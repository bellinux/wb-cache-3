40|$|SummaryIntroductionSecondary <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> a {{revision}} femoral stem {{is often a}} negative predictive sign for successful osseointegration and perfect long-term stability. Materials and methodsWe performed a retrospective study {{in a series of}} 183 revision total hip replacements between 1996 and 2000 to evaluate the importance and <b>risk</b> factors <b>of</b> secondary <b>subsidence</b> with a cementless press-fit design femoral stem as well as this subsidence's consequences to osseointegration. ResultsSecondary subsidence did not occur in 80 cases (53 %), was between 0 and 4 mm in 41 cases (27 %); between 5 and 10 mm in 17 cases (12 %) and was greater than 10 mm in 12 cases (8 %). Mean <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> all patients was 3 mm (0 – 30). There was a statistically significant negative correlation between subsidence and the quality of osseointegration (P= 0. 03). There was no significant relationship between component diameter and stem subsidence (P= 0. 9). The presence of preoperative bone deficiencies did not increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> secondary <b>subsidence</b> (P= 0. 2). ConclusionIn the case of revision with press-fit stems, the importance <b>of</b> secondary <b>subsidence</b> should not be overestimated, because it usually does not negatively affect satisfactory osseointegration.

5000|$|Canosa sits on {{the right}} bank of the Ofanto river (the ancient [...] ) and is nearly 20 km from the Adriatic Sea. The town sits upon the Murgia plateau, between 105 and 140 m above sea level. The city is built on a mostly sandy or clay surface that covers a {{limestone}} layer ("calcareniti of Gravina") which in turn constitutes the typical white-yellowish tuff and is easily collapsible.This morphological feature allowed the underground construction of artificial grottoes (used in the 19th century as cellars), {{and the creation of}} a Hypogean. The tuff derived from the excavations has gone towards the construction of buildings on the surface. There are <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> due to the presence of caves and underground channels typical of karst environments.

40|$|High {{temperature}} processes may alter soil properties, creating potential <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence,</b> {{erosion and}} other hazards. Soils may {{be exposed to}} high temperatures during some aggressive contaminant remediation processes as well as natural events such as fires. Characterising the effects of high temperatures on soil properties is essential to understanding the potential hazards that may arise after exposure. Thermal treatment and smouldering remediation were carried out on silica sand used here as a simple soil. Changes observed in physical properties {{were associated with the}} treatment type and exposure temperature. Particle, minimum and maximum densities were independent of heat treatment type and temperature. In contrast, particle size distribution, mineralogy, capillary rise, and hydraulic conductivity were linked to treatment type and exposure temperature with the most substantial changes associated with smouldering remediation. Changes in colour and mass loss with increasing temperature suggest changes within the crystal structure of the silica sand beyond loss of moisture content within the pore space and dehydration of iron deposits from goethite to hematite. Based on these observations, exposure to high temperature processes and the complex geo-chemical reactions during smouldering remediation can have significant effects on soil properties. Monitoring after exposure is advisable to determine the severity of exposure and any mitigation measures that may be necessary...|$|R

50|$|In 1984, the Western Australian Government {{proposed}} at {{the suggestion}} of Perth businessman Dallas Dempster that a casino complex be constructed at Burswood Island on the Swan River, 3 km east of the Perth city centre. This was the site of a large landfill facility, which posed difficulties in the proposal, design and construction phases due to the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> resulting from decomposition and also the risk of release of effluent into the adjacent river as a result of pile driving for the construction. The winning bidder to build the complex was Tileska Pty Ltd, a joint venture between Dallas Dempster and Genting Berhad, a Malaysian casino operator. At the time, there were allegations by rival bidders of misconduct against Dempster and Western Australian Premier Brian Burke, but, after a thorough investigation of these accusations, the WA Inc Royal Commission found no impropriety in that regard. This consortium planned a two-stage construction. The first stage was initially expected to cost A$200m, and involved futuristic-looking buildings comprising a 135-table casino, 400-room hotel, 18-hole golf course, convention and exhibition centre, tennis courts, amphitheatre and other amenities, together with a beautification of the Burswood Island area. The second stage of the plan involved the A$100m construction of another hotel on the site, but no time schedule was ever set for this and the second hotel was not constructed until two decades later. The Tileska joint venture took up 60% of the capital in the Burswood Property Trust, which was to own the complex.

Acton swing bridge is a symmetrical bowstring girder swing bridge, which was built in situ between 1931 and 1933, on an island in the centre of the river. It was first swung across the channel on 10 August 1933. J. A. Saner was again the designer. Dutton locks are of a similar design and age to those at Saltersford, and the Pelton turbines were made by Northern Foundry Co.

Subsidence was defined as ≥ 2 mm decrease in the average of ASH and PSH at the final follow up compared to that measured in the immediate postoperative period. A decrease of more than 3 mm was defined as severe subsidence for further statistical analysis. Results: <b>Subsidence</b> <b>of</b> more than 2 mm was observed in 14 segments (38. 9 %) and severe subsidence (≥ 3 mm) was observed in seven segments (19. 4 %). The direction <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> was examined by comparison of means of decreased ASH and PSH and anterior subsidence outweighed posterior subsidence (p< 0. 001). Examination of CCD showed that inferior subsidence was more frequent than superior subsidence (p< 0. 001, p= 0. 047). Among the suspicious risk factors for subsidence, intraoperative disc space distraction (anterior distraction: p= 0. 031, posterior distraction: p= 0. 007) and height of inserted cage (p= 0. 032) showed statistical significance. Conclusion: Considerable incidence <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> was observed after use of the cage.

40|$|Subsidence due to fluid {{withdrawal}} from the subsurface is being experienced in many regions. Water extraction for agricultural and civil needs {{is the most common}} cause of this phenomenon, However, hydrocarbon production from deep formations sometimes has been blamed for substantial rates of subsidence (e,g,, Wilmington, California; Ekofisk, the North Sea). Hydrocarbon reservoirs in sensitive areas (lowlands), such as the Netherlands and the eastern Po River Plain in Italy, which includes the city of Venice, must be maintained under control to avoid actual or alleged subsidence, Because compaction in deep sediments is a relatively new research held, applicable data are sparse, and much work remains to be done. In particular, a strong discrepancy exists between rock compressibility values measured in the laboratory and in the field, these latter ones being probably more representative. Laboratory compressibility values are at least one order of magnitude larger than in situ values. Given this discrepancy, and in order to accommodate also for the variability of natural materials, a stochastic risk analysis is the most reliable tool for predicting subsidence due to hydrocarbon extraction. This approach is here applied to a planned gas production project from offshore fields in the northern Adriatic Sea, in order to assess the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> on the coast and the nearby city of Venice, No stochastic theory of subsidence is available to date; consequently, a Monte Carlo technique is applied with respect to soil compressibility, which affects both the reservoir and subsidence simulations. A semi-analytical three-dimensional model based on the theory of Geertsma is used as a subsidence model. The results show that no actual <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> exists on the coast. Against intuition, the worst case scenarios coincide with the lowest compressibilities, since these values contribute to higher pressure declines in the reservoirs and the adjacent aquifers, and to a faster propagation of pressure change towards the shoreline. The results for the worst-case scenarios are confirmed by more sophisticated non linear, three-dimensional, finite element simulations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> hazard assessment using geographic information systems (GIS) in an abandoned coal mine area in South Korea. A spatial database was constructed using mine drift maps, topographic maps, geologic maps, borehole data, and subsidence inventory maps representing the locations <b>of</b> past <b>subsidence</b> occurrences. Eight factor layers (drift depth, drift density, distance from nearest drift, distance from nearest railroad, rock mass rating, groundwater depth, slope, and surface runoff accumulation) were extracted from the spatial database to examine {{the relationships between the}} factors and past subsidence occurrences (training data set). A frequency ratio (FR) model was used to establish rating classes for each factor, and an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model was used to establish weightings for the factors. The two models were integrated to combine multiple factor layers into a subsidence hazard map. When the area under the curve technique was used to verify the subsidence hazard map, by comparing the determined hazard rankings with past subsidence occurrences (validation data set), the FR model and FR-AHP integrated model showed 97 percent and 94 percent accuracies, respectively, in predicting subsidence occurrences. Finally, the subsidence hazard map based on the FR model was overlain with exposure intensity and vulnerability maps to generate a priority setting map, representing the relative <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> mine <b>subsidence</b> to buildings. The priority setting map can be used by planners and developers to identify and prioritize areas requiring more detailed investigations <b>of</b> mine <b>subsidence</b> hazards and risks...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of high demand for grammar school {{provision}} for the Arnold and Carlton areas {{in the mid to}} late 1940s, it was agreed upon by the Nottinghamshire Education Committee that the remaining sections of nearby parks would be constructed upon [...] "in the preparation of the Development Plan". Unusually, this concept would accommodate both the coeducational grammar school, but also a technical secondary institute (which were rare at the time due to the considerable running costs) however, they would be separated into two distinct buildings. This concept came into effect in 1954 and 1963, when the grammar school and technical institute were founded respectively. Due to the close geographical proximity to the colliery <b>of</b> Gedling, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> mining <b>subsidence</b> also had to be considered {{in the design of the}} school, something that would later come as a necessity during a 1957 earthquake, despite the school seeing little damage.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the geology of the wider Hunter Valley and Central Coast regions of New South Wales and a discussion of some of the consequences that present challenges to the geotechnical engineering profession. The contrasting structural styles of the folded and faulted Southern New England Fold Belt and the relatively flat-lying, undeformed Sydney Basin are described and compared. Consideration is given to the potential for instability arising from the combination of competent, blocky conglomerates, low strength claystones and coal seams, particularly within the Newcastle Coal Measures. Of the wide variety of challenges that arise from such a regionally diverse range of geological conditions, three areas of practice are given special discussion due to their local importance. These are the treatment of Quaternary sediments that underlie many of the more intensely developed areas; the distribution, properties and treatment of reactive clay soils that are well developed in all geological environments and the treatment of problems due to the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> mining-induced <b>subsidence</b> on development...|$|R
