5|$|The kulintang {{is played}} by {{striking}} the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing {{the arrangement of the}} gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very <b>rapid</b> <b>fire</b> strokes all in an effort to show off a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|E
5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with <b>rapid</b> <b>fire</b> from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E
5|$|In May 2006, an auto-update {{was made}} {{available}} on Xbox Live, responsible for fixing some bugs and adding additional multiplayer options to the game. The bug fixes included code {{to prevent an}} ongoing problem where players could walk through the air, an issue where some weapons could make use of <b>rapid</b> <b>fire,</b> and a map-exiting glitch, among others. The new multiplayer options provide seven additional new bot types {{and the ability to}} use bots in DarkOps matches, since bots had only one AI variant and were only available in DeathMatch scenarios when the game was released. Additionally, a playable demo of the game was made freely available on the Xbox Live Marketplace shortly afterwards. The demo includes one campaign mission that can be played in solo mode or co-operatively, and a new multiplayer map.|$|E

5|$|In the {{northern}} {{section of the}} fort, similar actions were taking place, as the airborne troops raced to destroy or otherwise disable the fortifications housing artillery pieces. Objective No. 13 was a casemate housing multiple machine-guns whose arcs of fire covered {{the western side of}} the Fort; to destroy the casemate, the airborne troops used a flamethrower to force the Belgian soldiers manning the weapons to retreat, and then detonated shaped charges against the fortification to disable it. Another observation cupola fitted with machine-guns, Objective No. 19, was destroyed, but two further objectives, Nos. 15 and 16 were found to be dummy installations. Unexpected complications came from Objective No. 23, a retractable cupola housing two 75mm artillery pieces. It had been assumed that the weapons in this fortification could not stop the airborne assault, but this assumption was found to be false when the weapons opened fire, forcing the airborne troops in the area to go to cover. The <b>rapid</b> <b>fire</b> of the weapons led to air support being summoned, and a Stuka squadron bombed the cupola. Although the bombs did not destroy the cupola, the explosions did force the Belgians to retract it {{throughout the rest of the}} fighting. Any exterior entrances and exits located by the airborne troops were destroyed with explosives to seal the garrison inside the Fort, giving the garrison few opportunities to attempt a counter-attack. The airborne troops had achieved their initial objective of destroying or disabling the artillery pieces that the fort could have used to bombard the captured bridges, but they still faced a number of small cupolas and emplacements that had to be disabled. A number of these included anti-aircraft weapons and machine-guns.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. To {{understand}} {{the mechanisms of}} postdefibrillation arrhythmias and failed defibrillation, we studied the cellular effects of high voltage shocks on different cardiomyocytes in the dog. Background. The causes of postdefibrillation arrhythmias and unsuccessful defibrillation are not clear. Methods. High voltage shocks with voltage differentials of 9. 3 to 97. 6 V/cm were delivered to isolated canine papillary muscles with attached Purkinje fibers. Transmembrane potentials were recorded simultaneously from the Purkinje fiber and the ventricular muscle using standard microelectrode techniques. Results. After delivery of high voltage shocks, significant depolarization and <b>rapid</b> <b>firing</b> were observed in Purkinje fibers. The maximal rate of the <b>rapid</b> <b>firing</b> in the Purkinje fibers correlated with shock intensity (r = 0. 69, p < 0. 05). In contrast, in ventricular muscle, only slight depolarization and a transient refractory state were observed after the shock. The incidence of the refractory state was correlated with both the shock intensity {{and the rate of}} the <b>rapid</b> <b>firing</b> in the Purkinje fiber (r = 0. 89 and 0. 74, p < 0. 01 and 0. 05, respectively). Propranolol at a concentration sufficient for complete beta-blockade (1 mg/liter) did not change the tissue response to shocks but suppressed or abolished the shock-induced <b>rapid</b> <b>firing</b> of Purkinje fibers at a higher concentration (3 mg/liter). Blockade of the slow calcium channel with verapamil (400 μg/dl) did not alter the responsiveness of the preparation to shocks. Conclusion. These results indicate that high voltage shocks induce different responses in Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle. The shock-induced <b>rapid</b> <b>firing</b> in the Purkinje fiber may contribute to postshock arrhythmias and possibly refibrillation in some cases. The shock-induced transient refractory state in the ventricular muscle may prevent the ventricle from responding to the <b>rapid</b> <b>firing</b> and thus may decrease the incidence of postshock arrhythmias...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{different}} {{properties of the}} inorganic constituents of the Ag paste used for the front metal grid is investigated for high sheet-resistance emitters. Our results show that both glass frit chemistry and Ag particle size are important for achieving good quality ohmic contacts to high sheet-resistance emitters. The melting characteristics of the glass frit determine the firing scheme suitable for low contact resistance and high fill factors (FFs). In addition, small to regular Ag particles were found to help achieve a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) and maintaining a low contact resistance. P self-doping from the paste was not necessary for good contacts to high sheet-resistance emitters for the <b>rapid</b> <b>firing</b> schemes in this paper. High FFs (> 0. 78) were achieved on untextured FZ Si cells using <b>rapid</b> <b>firing</b> in a lamp-heated belt-furnace with efficiencies of up to 17. 4 % on a 100 Ω/sq emitter. This corresponds to an efficiency improvement of ~ 0. 3 % absolute over the 45 Ω/sq emitter cells...|$|R

25|$|The gas-operated gun is a dual feed {{multipurpose}} small caliber weapon, {{that has}} a dual rate of fire with a minimum rate of 200-300 or 550 rounds per minute (rds/min), where the <b>rapid</b> <b>fire</b> mode assures 800 rds/min. The sustained rate of fire is 200 rds/min, though. The gun is intended for engaging materiel, low flying aircraft, light vehicles, and dismounted infantry. With a muzzle velocity of 960m/s, the gun is capable of defeating a light Armored Personnel Carrier at a range of 1,500 meters, a soft-skinned vehicle at 4,000 meters, and slow-flying aircraft at altitudes up to 2,000 meters and slant ranges of up to 2,500 meters.|$|E
