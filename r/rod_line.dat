50|$|Rods {{are matched}} {{to the line}} {{according}} to weight. The rod's manufacturer will mark on the <b>rod</b> the fly <b>line</b> weights for which a rod has been designed. One-weight (1wt) <b>rods</b> and <b>lines</b> are the lightest; the weight designations increase in whole number increments as the rod becomes heavier. The heaviest <b>rods</b> and <b>lines</b> readily available currently are 16-weight (16wt). In general, 1wt through 2wt rods {{would be used for}} the cast small flies for small trout and panfish; 3wt and 4wt rods are popular for small-stream fishing; 5wt is often considered the all-around rod for trout and general freshwater fishing; 6wt and 7wt rods are used on large rivers and for fishing with streamers, for larger warmwater species, and occasionally in calm inshore conditions for smaller saltwater species; 8wt to 9wt <b>rods</b> and <b>lines</b> might be used for steelhead or salmon in medium rivers, as well as for bass fishing with large flies, fishing for large carp, and general inshore saltwater use; and 10-11wt <b>rods</b> and <b>lines</b> would be used for pursuing large saltwater gamefish (tarpon, snook) under conditions of high wind or surf. The heaviest rods (12-16wt) are mostly used for bluewater species (billfish, tuna) while fishing from a boat. The characteristics of these rods reflect the fact that only short casts are needed during this type of fly fishing, while lifting ability is at a premium.|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the nuclear-coupled thermal-hydraulic {{stability}} of boiling water reactors (BWRs) using a model that includes: space-time modal neutron kinetics based on spatial w-modes; single- and two-phase flow in parallel boiling channels; fuel rod heat conduction dynamics; and a simple model of the recirculation loop. The BR model is represented {{by a set of}} time-dependent nonlinear ordinary differential equations, and is studied as a dynamical system using the modern bifurcation theory and nonlinear dynamical systems analysis. We first determine the stability boundary (SB) - or Hopf bifurcation set- in the most relevant parameter plane, the inlet-subcooling-number/external-pressure-drop plane, for a fixed control rod induced external reactivity equal to the 100 % <b>rod</b> <b>line</b> value; then we transform the SB to the practical power-flow map used by BWR operating engineers and regulatory agencies. Using this SB, we show that the normal operating point at 100 % power is very stable, that stability of points on the 100 % <b>rod</b> <b>line</b> decreases as the flow rate is reduced, and that operating points in the low-flow/high-power region are least stable. We also determine the SB that results when the modal kinetics is replaced by simple point reactor kinetics, and we thereby show that the first harmonic mode does not {{have a significant effect on}} the SB. However, we later show that it nevertheless has a significant effect on stability because it affects the basin of attraction of stable operating points. Using numerical simulations we show that, in the important low-flow/high-power region, the Hopf bifurcation that occurs as the SB is crossed is subcritical; hence, growing oscillations can result following small finite perturbations of stable steady-states on the 100 % <b>rod</b> <b>line</b> at points in the low-flow/high-power region. Numerical simulations are also performed to calculate the decay ratios (DRs) and frequencies of oscillations for various points on the 100 % <b>rod</b> <b>line.</b> It is determined that the U. S. NRC requirement of DR is not rigorously satisfied in the low-flow/high-power region; hence, this region should be avoided during normal startup and shutdown operations. The frequency of oscillation is shown to decrease as the flow rate is reduced. Moreover, the simulation frequency of 0. 5 Hz determined in the low-flow/high-power region is consistent with those observed during actual instability incidents. Additional numerical simulations show that in the low-flow/high-power region, for the same initial conditions, the use of point kinetics leads to damped oscillations, whereas the model that includes the modal neutron kinetics equations results in growing nonlinear oscillations...|$|E

In an earlier paper, we showed that this problem is NP-hard when the focus is in the relative interior of the rod. Our proof did not cover the case where the focus lies at one of the rod endpoints. Indeed, considerable evidence suggested that this special case might admit a polynomial time solution. In this paper we settle this open problem by proving, by means of a non-trivial adaptation of our earlier construction, that this remaining case is also NP-hard. ...|$|E
