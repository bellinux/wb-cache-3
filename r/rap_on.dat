25|$|A crowd mills {{about before}} the Cathedral of the Intercession (the Temple of Vasiliy the Blessed) in Red Square. Many are beggars, and policemen {{occasionally}} appear. A {{group of men}} enters, discussing the anathema the deacon had declared on Grishka (Grigoriy) Otrepyev in the mass. They identify Grishka as the Tsarevich. With growing excitement they sing of the advance of his forces to Kromï, of his intent to retake his father's throne, and of the defeat he will deal to the Godunovs. A yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song ("The moon is flying, the kitten is crying"). The urchins greet him and <b>rap</b> <b>on</b> his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Boris and his retinue exit the Cathedral. The boyars distribute alms. In a powerful chorus ("Benefactor father... Give us bread!"), the hungry people beg for bread. As the chorus subsides, the yuródivïy's cries are heard. Boris asks why he cries. The yuródivïy reports the theft of his kopek and asks Boris to order the boys' slaughter, {{just as he did}} {{in the case of the}} Tsarevich. Shuysky wants the yuródivïy seized, but Boris instead asks for the holy man's prayers. As Boris exits, the yuródivïy declares that the Mother of God will not allow him to pray for Tsar Herod (see Massacre of the Innocents). The yuródivïy then sings his lament ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") about the fate of Russia.|$|E
25|$|Tempestuous music {{accompanies the}} entry of a crowd of vagabonds who have {{captured}} the boyar Khrushchov. The crowd taunts him, then bows in mock homage ("Not a falcon flying in the heavens"). The yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song ("The moon is flying, the kitten is crying"). The urchins greet him and <b>rap</b> <b>on</b> his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Varlaam and Misail are heard in the distance singing of the crimes of Boris and his henchmen ("The sun and moon have gone dark"). They enter. The crowd gets worked up to a frenzy ("Our bold daring has broken free, gone on a rampage") denouncing Boris. Two Jesuits are heard in the distance chanting in Latin ("Domine, Domine, salvum fac"), praying that God will save Dmitriy. They enter. At the instigation of Varlaam and Misail, the vagabonds prepare to hang the Jesuits, who appeal to the Holy Virgin for aid. Processional music heralds the arrival of Dmitriy and his forces. Varlaam and Misail glorify him ("Glory to thee, Tsarevich!") along with the crowd. The Pretender calls those persecuted by Godunov to his side. He frees Khrushchov, and calls on all to march on Moscow. All exeunt except the yuródivïy, who sings a plaintive song ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") of {{the arrival of the}} enemy and of woe to Russia.|$|E

500|$|... "Hello Good Morning" [...] {{is a song}} by American rapper and {{producer}} Diddy and his band Dirty Money, from their debut album, Last Train to Paris. It was released from March 30, 2010 as the album's third single. The electronic dance song incorporates an acid squelch section in the middle 8, ad was written by Marcella Araica, Richard Butler, Clifford [...] "T.I." [...] Harris and Nathaniel [...] "Danja" [...] Hills who also produced the song. T.I. has a featured <b>rap</b> <b>on</b> the song. The song's musical composition was inspired by Diddy's experiences in Ibiza night clubs; its lyrics focus around sex and money. Three official remixes were released alongside the main single: the Official Remix with Rick Ross & Nicki Minaj, the [...] "Grime Remix" [...] with Skepta, and a [...] "Team UK remix" [...] with Tinchy Stryder and Tinie Tempah. Critics noted the track {{as one of the}} better songs from Last Train to Paris, particularly for Danja's production, but criticized the lyrics for being superficial and for lacking substance.|$|E
500|$|Their {{subsequent}} recording for {{the album}} was influenced by their experiences in Trinidad and Caribbean musical styles, including the rhythms and festive atmosphere of the local music scene. They enlisted Trinidadian dancehall artist General Grant, a regular at Caribbean Sound Basin, to perform a ragga <b>rap</b> <b>on</b> [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Dance Hall", songs they developed in Trinidad. Raphael Wiggins recalled this in an interview for the Toronto Star: [...] " [...] was just hanging around the studio. We {{asked him to come}} freestyle on [...] After that, he just kept hanging around. Then we had the song 'Dance Hall' playing one night and he started again, so we just turned on the mic." [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend" [...] was also recorded there. According to D'wayne, they recorded [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] in the studio at 3a.m., and Raphael was [...] "quite snookered" [...] on an alcoholic beverage when delivering his vocals. Collectively, the group had written and recorded approximately 40songs {{at the end of the}} sessions. In an interview for Billboard, D'wayne Wiggins said that they focused on the love songs when having to decide what songs would make the album.|$|E
500|$|There were, however, some {{mixed reviews}} of [...] "Best Mistake". Idolator's Kathy Iandoli {{described}} it as [...] "the average looking cousin of their previous duet [...] "Right There"". Reviewing for Slant Magazine, Andrew Chan said it [...] "makes the mistake of hemming her into her frail middle register, where she has a habit of delivering every word {{as if it were}} a pout." [...] Big Sean's appearance on [...] "Best Mistake" [...] also got varied reception. Pitchfork Media's Meaghan Garvey said his <b>rap</b> <b>on</b> the track made [...] "a mockery of the song's serious tone with hysterically awful lines like [...] "How can we keep the feelings fresh/ How do we Ziploc it?"" [...] Lipshutz found his verse [...] "unnecessary, yet [...] has morphed into an interesting confessional now that the dating rumors are on." [...] Sawdey called it a [...] "pretty outstanding verse," [...] with [...] "his own voice never overpowering the sparse atmosphere, his rhymes measured and metered in a way that fits the song perfectly", while James Shotwell of Under the Gun Review said [...] "Grande is a treat, but I think it's Big Sean who steals the show." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} piece, Jon Pareles from The New York Times said that The Chronic and Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle [...] "made the gangsta life {{sound like a}} party occasionally interrupted by gunplay". AllMusic's Steve Huey compared Dr. Dre to his inspiration, George Clinton, stating [...] "Dre's just as effortlessly funky, {{and he has a}} better feel for a hook, a knack that improbably landed gangsta <b>rap</b> <b>on</b> the pop charts". Rhapsody writer Brolin Winning named the album as [...] "an untouchable masterpiece of California Gangsta Rap" [...] and that it had [...] "track after track of G-Funk gems". In Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it was noted that [...] "Dre funked up the rhymes with a smooth bass-heavy production style and the laid-back delivery of then-unknown rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg." [...] Time magazine's Josh Tyrangiel states that Dr. Dre created [...] "a sound that defined early 90's urban L.A. {{in the same way that}} Motown defined 60's Detroit". Laura Sinagra, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), said that The Chronic [...] "features system-busting Funkadelic beats designed to rumble your woofer while the matter-of-fact violence of the lyrics blows your smoke-filled mind".|$|E
500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not <b>rap</b> <b>on</b> any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed." ...|$|E
500|$|Ed Easton Jr. {{of radio}} station WNOW-FM called the song a [...] "cocky and hip hop based song" [...] and commented that Brown's ability to <b>rap</b> <b>on</b> [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was {{not close to}} LilWayne and Busta Rhymes' level. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine could not imagine why Brown would want to share the song with Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes, stating [...] "One alone would've been enough to point up just how little {{personality}} he exudes on his own tracks, but putting both on 'Look at Me Now' ironically renders him invisible."
