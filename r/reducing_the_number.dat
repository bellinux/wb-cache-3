These benefits are achieved by <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein {{announced}} plans to relax the university's famed core curriculum, <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of required courses from 21 to 15.

The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene {{were linked}} to {{autosomal}} dominant (i.e. requiring only one abnormal copy) FH in a 2003 report. The gene {{is located on the}} first chromosome (1p34.1-p32) and encodes a 666 amino acid protein that is expressed in the liver. It has been suggested that PCSK9 causes FH mainly by <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of LDL receptors on liver cells.|$|E

40|$|Several newly {{introduced}} insecticides {{that have}} potential {{for use in}} vegetable crops for aphid control were evaluated and demonstrated very good efficacy against green peach aphid (Myzus persicae).

5|$|After {{the first}} two adaptations, both done by Clark, the tales were adapted {{by a number of}} playwrights and screenwriters. In most {{instances}} the adaptations alter the original source material. For example, A Warning to the Curious frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction and <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, is changed from a young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure to a middle-aged character driven by poverty to seek the treasure and acting in full awareness of what he is doing.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E

5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E

In preparation for the enrollment period, Burwell hired additional staff to coordinate operations. The first open-enrollment period, which had occurred during Secretary Sebelius' tenure, was marred by technical difficulties with the Healthcare.gov website. In preparation for the second enrollment period, the HealthCare.gov website underwent various testing actions.
