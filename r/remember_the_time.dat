25|$|The college gown has the {{standard}} pattern of an undergraduate gown at the University of Cambridge, with the sleeves sewn {{up for a}} length of eight inches from the shoulder. The proper dress of the gown and cap was observed at the first honorary degree to a woman, given to the Queen, an LL.D. on 21 October 1948. As academic dress, gowns were adopted with little changes (the sleeves had to be closed so {{that even in the}} summer, when women wear short-sleeved dresses their bare shoulders do not show), and square caps were chosen as head-dress. However, to <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when women were not allowed to obtain degrees of the University of Cambridge, no gowns are worn during the college feast, when students in their final year are celebrated.|$|E
25|$|She {{referred}} to her early girlhood as the most eventful part of her life. There was the long journey to Vermont the summer she was 18 months old, and her young mother’s death only four days after reaching the state which it had been hoped would give her health. There was the sojourn in New York, where William had established himself in business, and where he wanted his little daughter’s company. Clear and vivid was her memory of that trip down the Hudson River taken with her father when she was three years old, and of their arrival at the small boarding school on then fashionable Bleeker Street. At six, {{she was back in}} Middlebury, browsing in her father’s large and well chosen library —she could not <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when she {{did not know how to}} read— a library established in a newly-built house four miles up the Otter from Middlebury village in a quarter of the town called Farmingdale, a house presided over by a new step-mother. Here, also she recited daily lessons to her father and did her daily “stent” of sewing or knitting. Dorr grew to womanhood in a home of culture and refinement, and it is here where she began writing as a little child. It is here also that the father engaged in business again, and devoted himself chiefly to the development of the Rutland marble quarries. The home also included her half-brothers, Edward H. Ripley and Major General William Y. W. Ripley, both of whom became prominent officers in the American Civil War.|$|E

500|$|Moondram Pirai {{attained}} cult {{status in}} Tamil cinema and was praised for bringing out human emotions, unconditional love and sacrifice. The film {{had a significant}} impact among the audience for its style of filmmaking, performances of the lead cast and for Ilaiyaraaja's music. The climax scene where Haasan's character, Cheenu, runs after Sridevi's character, Bhagyalakshmi, who has recovered her memory but forgets the incidents that occur between her accident and recovery completely, and Cheenu trying desperately to make Bhagyalakshmi <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he spend with him, to no effect, became popular and was parodied many times. The dialogue told by Smitha's character to Cheenu, [...] "You haave a verrry strrong physique, you know", also attained popularity. A. P. Thiruvadi, in his obituary of Balu Mahendra, called him [...] "The Moondram Pirai of Indian cinema". Moondram Pirai is also the name of a drama written by Tamil poet Puviarasu. When S. Shiva Kumar of The Hindu suggested to Balu Mahendra that the film's ending lacked logic, Mahendra said, [...] "Believe me there’s no logic in life." ...|$|E

500|$|Extraordinary {{events had}} {{recently}} transpired in England, with King Charles I executed, {{power in the}} hands of a commoner, and freedom of the pulpit given to Puritans. The commoner in power was a personal friend of Wheelwright, the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, with whom Wheelwright had gone to college. Henry Vane, who had been very close to Wheelwright during the events of the Antinomian Controversy, had also reached high positions in government. These two prominent men had been working side by side for political and religious liberty, but became estranged and hostile towards each other in the early 1650s. Vane had retired from public life while Cromwell moved into the highest position of authority in England. Wheelwright was well received by Cromwell, who once described his classmate this way: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when I was more afraid of meeting Wheelwright at football than I have been since of meeting an army in the field, for I was infallibly sure of being tripped up by him". Wheelwright wrote a letter to his church in Hampton, dated 20 April 1658, in which he described his meeting with Cromwell, writing, [...] "I had discourse in private about the space of an hour. All his speeches seemed to me very orthodox and gracious".|$|E

2500|$|Sven Anders Hedin, {{a medical}} doctor at the royal court, and married {{to one of the}} Queen's chambermaids, Charlotta Hellman, contributed two {{statements}} which have been quoted in connection with the scandal. In the summer of 1780, during the King's absence abroad, he passed through the private apartments of the Queen, which were expected to be empty at that hour. There, he claimed to have seen the Queen and Baron Munck embracing each other through the not-quite closed door to her bedroom. [...] To warn them that they were not alone, he hummed a tune and pretended to speak to himself, saying that he would be in trouble if the Queen discovered him there, and then left the room. He claimed to have found three expensive court costumes in his room a few days after this event. In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor {{on his way to the}} Queen's bed chamber. Gustav III asked Hedin what time it was, and Hedin claims to have added to his reply: [...] "In nine months, I will be able to answer exactly!" [...] in which Hedin insinuated that the King had expected him to <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> should the fatherhood of the next child be questioned.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an earlier}} time, one person had {{described}} the transparency of the water: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> gentlemen, {{when you could}} go in twelve feet of water {{and you could see}} the pebbles on the bottom of this river." [...] As the water got more polluted, it darkened, underwater vegetation (such as photosynthesizing seagrass) began dying, and as the seagrass beds declined, the many associated species of their ecosystems declined as well, contributing to the decline of the river. Also harmful was the general destruction of the once plentiful oyster beds in the waters around the city, and the over-fishing of menhaden, or mossbunker, a small silvery fish which had been used since the time of the Native Americans for fertilizing crops - however it took 8,000 of these schooling fish to fertilize a single acre, so mechanized fishing using the purse seine was developed, and eventually the menhaden population collapsed. [...] Menhaden feed on phytoplankton, helping to keep them in check, and are also a vital step in the food chain, as bluefish, striped bass and other fish species which do not eat phytoplankton feed on the menhaden. [...] The oyster is another filter feeder: oysters purify 10 to 100 gallons a day, while each menhaden filters four gallons in a minute, and their schools were immense: one report had a farmer collecting 20 oxcarts worth of menhaden using simple fishing nets deployed from the shore. [...] The combination of more sewage, due to the availability of more potable water [...] New York's water consumption per capita was twice that of Europe [...] indoor plumbing, the destruction of filter feeders, and the collapse of the food chain, damaged the ecosystem of the waters around New York, including the East River, almost beyond repair.|$|E
