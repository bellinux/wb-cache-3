500|$|Inspired by [...] "In Flanders Fields", American {{professor}} Moina Michael resolved at the war's {{conclusion in}} 1918 {{to wear a}} red poppy year-round to honour the soldiers {{who had died in}} the war. She also wrote a poem in <b>response</b> <b>called</b> [...] "We Shall Keep the Faith". She distributed silk poppies to her peers and campaigned to have them adopted as an official symbol of remembrance by the American Legion. Madame E. Guérin attended the 1920 convention where the Legion supported Michael's proposal and was inspired to sell poppies in her native France {{to raise money for the}} war's orphans. In 1921, Guérin sent poppy sellers to London ahead of Armistice Day, attracting the attention of Field Marshal Douglas Haig. A co-founder of The Royal British Legion, Haig supported and encouraged the sale. The practice quickly spread throughout the British Empire. The wearing of poppies in the days leading up to Remembrance Day remains popular in many areas of the Commonwealth of Nations, particularly Great Britain, Canada and South Africa and in the days leading up to ANZAC Day in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|Many {{studies in}} {{neurolinguistics}} {{take advantage of}} anomalies or violations of syntactic or semantic rules in experimental stimuli, and analyzing the brain responses elicited when a subject encounters these violations. For example, sentences beginning with phrases such as *the garden was on the worked, which violates an English phrase structure rule, often elicit a brain <b>response</b> <b>called</b> the early left anterior negativity (ELAN). Violation techniques have been in use since at least 1980, when Kutas and Hillyard first reported ERP evidence that semantic violations elicited an N400 effect. [...] Using similar methods, in 1992, Lee Osterhout first reported the P600 response to syntactic anomalies. Violation designs have also been used for hemodynamic studies (fMRI and PET): Embick and colleagues, for example, used grammatical and spelling violations to investigate the location of syntactic processing in the brain using fMRI. Another common use of violation designs is to combine two kinds of violations {{in the same sentence}} and thus make predictions about how different language processes interact with one another; this type of crossing-violation study has been used extensively to investigate how syntactic and semantic processes interact while people read or hear sentences.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: EMS Belgrade uses INDEX {{protocols}} in its everyday operations, {{according to}} which all calls are divided into 2 types of emergency calls: code red <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> (immediate <b>response</b> <b>call)</b> and code yellow <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> (prompt <b>response</b> <b>call).</b> Refused calls are marked as green in the system. If an operator receives a call where a person is unconscious, that call is by default marked as a red <b>response</b> <b>call.</b> Objective: To evaluate the degree of successful functioning of INDEX protocols in {{the operations of the}} EMS of the City of Belgrade (EMS Belgrade). To evaluate, based on the calls received where patients have been declared unconscious, to what degree has the operator been adhering to the INDEX protocols and marked these calls as 'code red response calls'. Also, to evaluate to what degree of urgency have the operators managed to adhere to INDEX protocols when giving code red <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> to teams for execution as opposed to code yellow <b>response</b> <b>calls.</b> Finally, to establish if there is a significant time difference when distributing code red and code yellow <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> for execution. Method: The study has been conducted by examining retrospectively all accepted calls at the EMS Belgrade in the period from 01. 06. 2010 to 01. 09. 2010. Out of 24777 calls the following calls have been excluded: patients in which level of consciousness was unknown, patients suffering from malignant neoplasm as losing consciousness could be part of their primary illness, patients who have regained consciousness prior or during the call and calls that have waited on execution for over 30 minutes at the dispatch centre. Remained 520 calls referring to unconscious patients that were then graded as code red or code yellow <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> by the operators. Basic statistical data was obtained in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences and statistical testing was done according to Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Out of 520 analyzed calls 54 % of them were not graded as code red response. Before the operator submits a call to a team for execution the average time for red <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> is 2. 13 min. whereas for yellow <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> it is 5. 47 min. In the first 5 minutes after receiving the call 90 % of red <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> and 62 % of yellow calls are submitted for execution. Statistically, {{there is a big difference}} in pre-execution times when the calls are still kept with operators, Mann- Whitney U, Z=- 8. 200 p< 0. 01. Discussion: It is extremely difficult to evaluate a state of emergency of a patient only based on information obtained in a telephone call. Operators at the EMS call centre do not always fully adhere to the protocols for responding to calls. Conclusion: In over 50 % of the calls with unconscious patients these have not been graded as code red <b>response</b> <b>calls.</b> Operators usually adhere to emergency codes and red <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> are given to teams for execution sooner. Statistically, there is a significant difference in pre-execution times of red response and yellow <b>response</b> <b>calls,</b> i. e. red <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> were given to teams for execution significantly sooner...|$|R

40|$|Leptodactylus pustulatus {{is one of}} {{the most}} dis-tinctive species in the genus because of its ven-tral pattern of large bright red to yellow spots on a dark background. Although the species was {{described}} in 1870 and there has been no confu-sion regarding its taxonomic identity, there has been very little published about the species, par-ticularly with respect to its biology. The lack of biological information for L. pustulatus is likely due to the fact that the species occurs in very inaccessible areas (flooded plains) in poorly sampled regions of Brazil at transition zones of Cerrado, Caatinga, and Amazon do-mains. Herein, we describe the advertisement and <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> of L. pustulatus, which turn out to be very different and more complex than for any other species of Leptodactylus for which the advertisement calls are known. We use terms to describe the calls that are meant to be functionally neutral, as we have no evidence for the biological function of the calls. We use the terms advertisement and <b>response</b> <b>calls</b> for the two types of calls we report on. Other authors have ascribed various functions to <b>response</b> <b>calls,</b> terming them as encounter calls or aggressive calls. We also use the term “unit” to describe what we find to be rather discrete portions within the advertisement call.
