25|$|The {{first major}} {{improvement}} was the split-anode magnetron, {{also known as}} a negative-resistance magnetron. As the name implies, this design used an anode that was split in two — one {{at each end of the}} tube — creating two half-cylinders. When both were charged to the same voltage the system worked like the original model. But by slightly altering the voltage of the two plates, the electron's trajectory could be modified so that they would naturally travel towards the lower voltage side. The plates were connected to an oscillator that reversed the <b>relative</b> <b>voltage</b> of the two plates at a given frequency.|$|E

50|$|Other {{arguments}} {{for a higher}} voltage included the reduction of weight in the wiring system, improved stability, and reduced voltage drop. With three times the voltage, thick conductors {{can be reduced to}} a third of the cross-section, {{and at the same time}} the <b>relative</b> <b>voltage</b> drop can also be reduced to a third. For the same cross-section, the <b>relative</b> <b>voltage</b> drop is now no more than one ninth. The voltage level resulting from these arguments was so close to three times the present voltage that 42 V became the automatic choice for the second voltage level.|$|E

50|$|The mode can be {{determined}} by the sign of the threshold <b>voltage</b> (gate <b>voltage</b> <b>relative</b> to source <b>voltage</b> at the point where an inversion layer just forms in the channel): for an N-type FET, enhancement-mode devices have positive thresholds, and depletion-mode devices have negative thresholds; for a P-type FET, enhancement-mode negative, depletion-mode positive.|$|R
25|$|MOSFET analog {{switches}} use the MOSFET to pass {{analog signals}} when on, {{and as a}} high impedance when off. Signals flow in both directions across a MOSFET switch. In this application, the drain and source of a MOSFET exchange places depending on the <b>relative</b> <b>voltages</b> of the source/drain electrodes. The source is the more negative side for an N-MOS or the more positive side for a P-MOS. All of these switches are limited on what signals they can pass or stop by their gate–source, gate–drain and source–drain voltages; exceeding the voltage, current, or power limits will potentially damage the switch.|$|R

50|$|The p-n {{junction}} possesses some interesting properties that have useful applications in modern electronics. A p-doped semiconductor is relatively conductive. The {{same is true}} of an n-doped semiconductor, but the junction between them can become depleted of charge carriers, and hence non-conductive, depending on the <b>relative</b> <b>voltages</b> of the two semiconductor regions. By manipulating this non-conductive layer, {{p-n junction}}s are commonly used as diodes: circuit elements that allow a flow of electricity in one direction but not in the other (opposite) direction. Bias is the application of a voltage across a p-n junction; forward bias is in the direction of easy current flow, and reverse bias is in the direction of little or no current flow.|$|R
50|$|Each {{focusing}} element {{consisted of}} a pair of wires, and a conductive aluminum coating {{on the back of the}} phosphors. The screen was normally charged with a potential of 3000 to 4500 V between the wires and the aluminum, resulting in a curved electric field between the grid and the screen. When the electron beam from the gun entered the region between the grid and the screen it was accelerated and focused down to a tiny spot, normally impinging on the green phosphor. By varying the <b>relative</b> <b>voltage</b> between the two wires in each pair, the beam would be bent one direction of the other, allowing control over the color. Unlike a shadow mask, all of the signal eventually reached the screen, further reducing power requirements.|$|E
50|$|The beam-index tube bears some {{resemblance}} to two {{other types of}} television tubes which also used vertical stripes of colored phosphor instead of dots or grids. The Chromatron used two sets of fine wires suspended behind the display area to electrically focus its single beam, one set of wires pulling the beam towards the red side and the other towards the blue. The grids were aligned so the beam would normally focus onto the green stripe in the middle, but by varying the <b>relative</b> <b>voltage</b> between the two the beam could accurately hit the colored stripes. In practice the wires were difficult to keep aligned with the phosphors, and gave off electrical noise that interfered with the radio receivers in a television application. It saw some use in military settings, including some commercial television use in the Yaou, Sony 19C 70 and the Sony KV 7010U.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique for the measurement systems of solar orientation based on solar cells. A methodology for {{the calculation of}} the solar orientation is developed which uses solar cells as solar sensors. The time and latitude angles of the sun are proposed to {{be a function of}} the output voltages of sloped solar cells. The solar cells are located at different angles of elevation and azimuth for the comparative output voltages between the back-to-back solar cells. A variation in the time and latitude angles of the sun causes a change of the output voltages of the eastern-western (E-W) and southern-northern (S-N) solar cells, which changes the <b>relative</b> measured <b>voltages</b> between the solar cells, respectively. The current experimental data show that the optimized assembly of solar cells and the detailed calibration of time and latitude angles of the sun yield a high degree of sensitivity. The relationship between the measured <b>relative</b> <b>voltages</b> of solar cells is fully explored and documented. The proposed study indicates not only simplified solar orientation measurement systems but also convenient and accurate correlations of the comparative output solar cell voltages and the sun angles. As such, the proposed measurement systems make a valuable contribution to the development of tracking systems in solar energy technologies...|$|R

50|$|Sense {{amplifiers}} {{are required}} to read the state contained in the DRAM cells. When the access transistor is activated, the electrical charge in the capacitor is shared with the bitline. The bitline's capacitance {{is much greater than}} that of the capacitor (approximately ten times). Thus, the change in bitline voltage is minute. Sense amplifiers {{are required to}} resolve the voltage differential into the levels specified by the logic signaling system. Modern DRAMs use differential sense amplifiers, and are accompanied by requirements as to how the DRAM arrays are constructed. Differential sense amplifiers work by driving their outputs to opposing extremes based on the <b>relative</b> <b>voltages</b> on pairs of bitlines. The sense amplifiers function effectively and efficient only if the capacitance and voltages of these bitline pairs are closely matched. Besides ensuring that the lengths of the bitlines and the number of attached DRAM cells attached to them are equal, two basic architectures to array design have emerged to provide for the requirements of the sense amplifiers: open and folded bitline arrays.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} phased {{installation}} of compensating units in electrical distribution networks using <b>relative</b> <b>voltage</b> drops as integral indicators was proposed. Introduction of compensating units {{is one of}} the most effective ways to reduce electricity losses in distribution networks. In accordance with the existing methods this task is carried out in two ways: maximum reduction of losses and providing acceptable levels of voltage in load nodes. Complicated mathematical methods, nonlinear programming methods in particular, are necessary to solve this problem. Results of the calculations, obtained by these methods, are difficult to be checked on compliance with both criteria, since they characterize different technical parameters. On the other hand, these criteria are of common physical nature which makes it possible to form the integral indicators evaluating both active power losses and voltage drops. The aim of the article is to research and use integral indicators which evaluate both active power losses and voltage drops. A mathematical model of positioning compensating units in electrical network was presented. A calculation example of the phased establishing of compensating units in electrical distribution network by two methods: the one being in use now and the proposed one were presented. Calculation results are given in tabular and graphical forms. These results show the coincidence of the results obtained by these two methods. Proposed method provides minimum active power losses, specified <b>relative</b> <b>voltage</b> drop value and makes it possible to simplify the introduction of compensating units through linearizatio...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{low-power}} operation, MOS-only subthreshold voltage references are gradually adopted [7 – 10]. As transistors in a weak inversion region have inherent advantages in low-power applications with quite small current, the power consumption of <b>relative</b> <b>voltage</b> references can be effectively reduced. Besides, since the characteristics of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) are consistent with process improvement, voltage reference based on MOSFET is more adaptable to advanced technologies. In addition, the usage of resistors should also be avoided in low-power applications. Since the current in the voltage reference is usually inversely proportional to resistance value, low-power dissipation means high-ohmic resistors [10], which can induce large noise occupying a large chip area.|$|E
30|$|Recall that, in a EEG, a preictal {{stage is}} {{characterized}} by an asynchronous pattern with <b>relative</b> low <b>voltage</b> amplitude. As a consequence, the complexity is higher in this case than during an ictal phase where the neurons are synchronized exhibiting high voltage amplitude peaks. Hence, the complexity comes down. During the postictal period, the voltage amplitude starts to decrease slowly increasing complexity gradually. These characteristics were well reflected by BMSE (see “Results and discussion”).|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} has shown that spectral decomposition of the reduced power flow Jacobian (RPFJ) can yield participation factors that describe the extent to which particular buses contribute to particular spectral components of a power system. Research has also shown that both variance and autocorrelation of time series voltage data tend to increase as a power system with stochastically fluctuating loads approaches certain critical transitions. This paper presents evidence suggesting that a system's participation factors predict the <b>relative</b> bus <b>voltage</b> variance values for all nodes in a system. As a result, these participation factors can be used to filter, weight, and combine real time PMU data from various locations dispersed throughout a power network in order to develop coherent measures of global voltage stability. This paper first describes the method of computing the participation factors. Next, two potential uses of the participation factors are given: (1) predicting the <b>relative</b> bus <b>voltage</b> variance magnitudes, and (2) locating generators at which the autocorrelation of voltage measurements clearly indicate proximity to critical transitions. The methods are tested using both analytical and numerical results from a dynamic model of a 2383 -bus test case...|$|R
