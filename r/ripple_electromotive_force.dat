40|$|This {{study focused}} on the design {{optimization}} of permanent magnet synchronous linear motors (PMSLM) that are applied in microsecond laser cutting machines. A new design optimization method was introduced to enhance PMSLM performances in terms of motor thrust, thrust <b>ripple,</b> and inductive <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (EMF). Based on accurate 3 D finite element analysis (3 D-FEA), a multiple support vector machine (multi-SVM) was proposed to build a non-parametric quick calculation model by mapping the relation between multivariate structure parameters and multivariate operation performances. The gravity center neighborhood algorithm (GCNA) was also applied to search the global optimal combination of the structure parameters by locating the gravity center of the multi-SVM model. The superiority and validity of this method are verified by experiments...|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{approach is}} innovative, since stochastic modeling of uncertainties are {{combined with a}} topology optimization for minimal electromagnetic torque fluctuations (of the CT) {{and at the same}} time allowing for a robust optimization on the basis of a suitable optimization criterion. The current paper is an extended version of [35] with many more details and new results for an analysis of a PM electric machine in on-load state (with excitation currents involved). More precisely, we paid a lot of attention to investigate the impact of the optimization methodology on other machine parameters such as the electromagnetic torque, the torque <b>ripple,</b> the back <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> and an analysis of its frequency spectrum as the important source of noise and vibrations. However, it should be noticed that in this paper we focus mainly on a robust low cogging torque design under uncertainty which resulted in no-load steady state analysis of stochastic curl-curl equation (a density of excitation currents J(x) = 0). Consequently, the machine analysis in on-load state can be considered here as a post-processing procedure, since the electromagnetic (average) torque itself was not involved in the optimization task. Moreover, we restricted ourselves to the minimization of noise and vibrations caused predominantly by the cogging torque, the torque ripple and the back EMF, however, without coupling a vibro-acoustic modeling as in, e.g., [43] with the curl-curl equation. Instead the air-gap flux density (as equivalence of the back EMF) is considered in the optimization procedure as a second objective. It yields a considerably improvement of the wave form of the back electromotive which, in turn, directly leads to the reduction of noise and vibrations. Furthermore, to deal with a stochastic multi-objective problem, the trade-off method, incorporated in the level set method (LSM) as well as the AWM, involved in a robust functional, have been applied.|$|R

40|$|In mean-field {{magnetohydrodynamics}} {{the mean}} <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> due to velocity and magnetic field fluctuations plays a crucial role. In general {{it consists of}} two parts, one independent of and another one proportional to the mean magnetic field. The first part may be nonzero only {{in the presence of}} mhd turbulence, maintained, e. g., by small-scale dynamo action. It corresponds to a battery, which lets a mean magnetic field grow from zero to a finite value. The second part, which covers, e. g., the alpha effect, is important for large-scale dynamos. Only a few examples of the aforementioned first part of mean <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> have been discussed so far. It is shown that a mean <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> proportional to the mean fluid velocity, but independent of the mean magnetic field, may occur in an originally homogeneous isotropic mhd turbulence if there are nonzero correlations of velocity and electric current fluctuations or, what is equivalent, of vorticity and magnetic field fluctuations.
