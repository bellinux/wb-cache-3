Shortly {{after his}} election, Jones created the Quality and Efficiency Commission to study ways to {{streamline}} state government.

Funding problems and political disputes led to the scaling back of the original plans.

In December 2010, amid a tax <b>revenue</b> <b>shortfall</b> during the ongoing economic recession, the Sound Transit Board elected to suspend all design work on the light rail project south of South 200th Street. The Sound Transit Board officially approved an accelerated schedule for the South 200th Street station in July 2011, seeking a federal Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant of up to $34 million; a $10 million grant was awarded in December, allowing the opening date for the station to move from 2020 to September 2016.|$|E

However, by the late 1980s, the state-ownership model {{was on the verge}} of collapse. This delicate situation was the result of heavily subsidized tariffs and a <b>revenue</b> <b>shortfall</b> in the sector of about US$35 billion, which led to the delay in the construction of about 15 large hydro plants due to lack of funds for investment. Efforts to address the deterioration of the sector were not successful, a situation that further intensified the need for deep reforms. A major commitment was made by President Cardoso to carry out a substantial reform of the Brazilian electricity sector. The first reforms introduced in the power sector were aimed to allow the participation of private capital and also to improve its economic situation.|$|E

In addition, in early 2008, records were uncovered that show the campus of Michael Reese Hospital to have been designed, in large part, {{by one of the}} twentieth century's most well-respected modernist architects, Walter Gropius. Thus, the plan for the Olympic Village battled the growing belief that preserving the old hospital campus would be better from an urban planning and historic preservation standpoint, and also rose questions about financing the village.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} rainy day funds on state savings behavior. We find that states with rainy day funds have higher total balances than states without such funds and also have higher balances after adoption than before adoption. Furthermore, rainy day fund deposits increase total balances dollar-for-dollar. While we cannot rule out that states planning future savings may adopt rainy day funds, our findings are robust to the inclusion of measures of savings preferences. In sum, these funds appear {{to belong to the}} growing set of fiscal institutions with real fiscal and economic consequences. 1 Introduction During the last two decades, virtually all of the U. S. states have adopted budget stabilization funds, often called "rainy day funds, " that allow them to save for unexpected <b>revenue</b> <b>shortfalls.</b> Prior to 1981, few states had such funds (Gold, 1981). By 1984, 18 states had enacted rainy day funds, and by 1994, 45 states had them (ACIR, 1995). These accounts are designed to help state governments stabilize public spending over time by saving during booms and using the balances to cover <b>revenue</b> <b>shortfalls</b> during recessions. In 1996, rainy day fun...|$|R
