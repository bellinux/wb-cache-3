5|$|For the 1999 season, {{a winner}} was {{selected}} using an objective points system. Hits, home runs, and <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (RBI) were given certain point {{values and the}} winner was the player who had the highest tabulated points total.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, in a 10–5 {{win over}} the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, Posey hit two three-run home runs {{en route to a}} career-high six <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in.</b> It is the second most RBIs in a single game by a Giants catcher in the San Francisco Era.|$|E
5|$|Hideki Matsui, the 2009 winner, {{batted in}} six {{runs in the}} sixth game of the 2009 World Series, tying Richardson's record of most <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> for a single World Series game. Matsui became the first Japanese-born player to win the award, {{as well as the}} first player to win it as a {{full-time}} designated hitter. He is also the only player named both a World Series and a Japan Series MVP.|$|E

5|$|Kelly is {{a two-time}} World Series {{champion}} (1921 and 1922). He led the National League in home runs once (1921) and <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> twice (1920 and 1924), and {{was elected to}} the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973. However, his selection is regarded as controversial, as many believe he is undeserving of the recognition and was only elected by the Veterans Committee because it consisted of his former teammates.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Johnny Bench, Hartnett was {{considered}} the greatest catcher {{in the history of}} the National League. A six-time All-Star, he appeared in four World Series during his playing career. At the time of his retirement, Hartnett held the career records for catchers in home runs, <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in,</b> hits, doubles and in most games played as a catcher. Hartnett was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Richard hit {{well for}} a pitcher, going 20-for-87 in the season with two triples, two home runs and seven <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in.</b> After the season was completed, Richard {{underwent}} an emergency appendicectomy on October 26, 1977 at a Houston hospital. He {{spent most of the}} off-season working out at the Houston Astrodome and, for relaxation, fishing. In early 1978, he was a participant in ABC's Superstars all-around sports competition.|$|E
5000|$|Giambi led {{the team}} in 1998 with 27 home <b>runs,</b> 110 <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>ins</b> and a [...]295 batting average.|$|R
5000|$|In the Major Leagues, Narron {{appeared}} {{in parts of}} three seasons (1935, 1942 and 1943) with the St. Louis Cardinals, playing in 24 games and hitting [...]286 with one <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> in just 28 at bats.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, {{a batter}} does not receive {{credit for a}} <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (RBI) when <b>runs</b> score on an error, unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake. For example, if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a {{sacrifice}} fly and the outfielder drops the ball for an error, the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R
5|$|These {{games have}} {{resulted}} in other MLB single-game records due to the extreme offensive performance. Mark Whiten, for example, tied Jim Bottomley for the most <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> in a single game with 12 in his four-homer game. Shawn Green hit a double and a single along with his four home runs for 19 total bases, an MLB record. It surpassed Joe Adcock's mark of 18, which also came from a four-homer game.|$|E
5|$|With the LSU Tigers, Furniss was {{a two-time}} College World Series {{champion}} and a two-time All-American. He won the Dick Howser Trophy as college baseball's {{best player in}} 1998, and set Southeastern Conference (SEC) records in numerous offensive categories, including home runs and <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (RBIs). He was among the National Collegiate Athletic Association's all-time leaders in home runs and RBIs {{at the time he}} graduated from college.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Sounds players {{have led the}} league in {{multiple}} statistical categories during a single season. Balboni led the 1980 season in five categories: runs (101), <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (122), total bases (288), home runs (30), and fielding percentage among first basemen (.990). In 1990, Hammond {{led the league in}} wins (15), winning percentage (.938 (15–1)), earned run average (2.17), and strikeouts (149). Durham, Ruffcorn, and Wever have also led a single season in three areas.|$|E
50|$|Following {{those who}} would {{generally}} omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in,</b> simply add an s {{to the end of}} RBI.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Valenzuela {{played for}} Team Mexico in the World Baseball Classic, {{finishing}} the tournament batting [...]250 {{with a home}} run and one <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R

5|$|Mottola {{attended}} St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, {{graduating in}} 1989. After leading all Broward County {{high school players}} in batting average (.573), home runs (14) and <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (RBIs) (48) as a senior, Mottola was named to Florida's Class 3A All-State first team. Out of high school, the Baltimore Orioles selected Mottola in the tenth round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft, with the 243rd overall selection. Mottola did not sign with the Orioles, opting to pursue a college baseball career.|$|E
5|$|Scott broke George Pinkney's MLB {{consecutive}} games played streak of 577 on April 26, 1920. He again led AL shortstops in fielding percentage. The Red Sox named Scott team captain for the 1921 season, after the previous captain, Harry Hooper, {{was traded to}} the Chicago White Sox. During spring training in 1921, Scott dealt with leg cramp that threatened his playing streak, but he was able to continue playing. Scott had 62 <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> on the season, and stated that it was his goal to play in 1,000 {{consecutive games}}.|$|E
5|$|Several {{records were}} tied, extended, or broken during this World Series, {{including}} team championships (Yankees with 27), career postseason wins (Andy Pettitte with 18), career World Series saves (Mariano Rivera with 11), career World Series home runs (Chase Utley with seven), {{home runs in}} a postseason series (Chase Utley with five), strikeouts by a hitter in a World Series (Ryan Howard with 13), and <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> in a single World Series game (Hideki Matsui with six).|$|E
50|$|Among Holtzman's {{contributions}} to the game during his career {{was the creation of}} the save statistic in 1959. It was adopted as an official statistic for the 1969 season, the first official new statistic since the <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (RBI) in 1920.|$|R
50|$|Having {{spent most}} of his career in the American League, Thomas only logged 34 career at-bats. His only career <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> came off Randy Jones on July 19, 1978.|$|R
5000|$|His MLB service {{consisted}} of two 16-game stints with the White Sox. For his career, he collected eight hits, including one double, and compiled a [...]186 <b>batting</b> average <b>in</b> 43 at-bats, with one <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bowker {{was born}} to Brite and Chris Bowker on July 8, 1983, in Sacramento, California. Growing up, he {{attended}} Mariemont Elementary School, Arden Middle School, and Rio Americano High School. He began his baseball career playing for an Arden Park Little League team coached by his father, and he played baseball at Rio Americano, along with football and basketball. He decided to concentrate on baseball as a sophomore. He lettered three seasons in baseball, two seasons in football and one season in basketball {{in addition to being}} named all-league in each of these sports. He set Rio Americano's single-season records for batting average (.463) hits (41), home runs (8) and <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (RBI) (41).|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Davis led all MLB batters in {{home runs}} (53), <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (138), extra-base hits (96), and total bases (370). His 53 home runs, 96 extra-base hits and 199 strikeouts all set new Orioles single-season records. In {{addition}} to these statistics, which were all career highs, he also set new career highs in games played (160), hits (167), doubles (42), runs scored (103), walks (72), stolen bases (4), batting average (.286), on-base percentage (.370), slugging percentage (.634), and OPS (1.004). In AL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting, Davis finished third behind Cabrera and Mike Trout, as the Orioles failed {{to return to the}} playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Musial {{finished}} the 1948 season leading {{the major leagues}} in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702). Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became {{the first player to}} win three NL MVP awards. If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{championship}} game, Lee Yong-kyu of South Korea recorded a <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (RBI) {{double in the}} first inning off of Zack Segovia. Kim Hyun-soo had an RBI double in the third inning, and scored two more runs on a double in the fourth inning. Park Byung-ho hit a home run off of Brooks Pounders to left field in the fourth inning. Kim finished the game three hits, including two doubles that scored runs. Kim Hyun-soo and Jeong Keun-woo also had three hits apiece, and Jeong recorded a <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> with a bases loaded walk in the ninth inning.|$|R
50|$|As {{addressed}} within Rule 10.08(d) of the Official Baseball Rules, {{a sacrifice}} fly is not counted as a turn at bat for the batter, though the batter is credited with a <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Altogether, in 22 Major League games, 75 plate {{appearances}} and 72 at-bats, Moss garnered only seven hits, none for extra bases, with 17 strikeouts, three bases on balls, and one <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in,</b> <b>batting</b> [...]097.|$|R
5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} before the 2008 season about where Bonds might play. However, no one signed {{him during the}} 2008 or 2009 seasons. If he had returned to Major League Baseball, Bonds would have been within close range of several significant hitting milestones: needing just 65 hits to reach 3,000, 4 <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> to reach 2,000, and 38 home runs to reach 800. He would have needed 69 more runs scored to move past Rickey Henderson as the all-time runs champion, and 37 extra base hits to move past Hank Aaron as the all-time extra base hits champion.|$|E
5|$|Few {{teams were}} {{interested}} in Pujols because of uncertainty about his age, which position he would play, and his build. Tampa Bay Rays scout Fernando Arango recommended that his team sign Pujols, and quit his job when Tampa Bay failed to do so. Pujols was not drafted until the 13th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, when the St. Louis Cardinals selected him with the 402nd overall pick. Pujols initially turned down a $10,000 bonus and spent the summer playing for the Hays Larks of the Jayhawk Collegiate League (a summer league in the National Baseball Congress); his total of 48 <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (RBIs) with the team was tied for ninth with Tyler Wasserman in Larks' history. When the Cardinals increased their bonus offer to $60,000, he signed.|$|E
5|$|Garvey, Leonard, and Albert Pujols hit four {{home runs}} in their winning series—Garvey in his first win. Adam Kennedy won the 2002 ALCS MVP for hitting 3 {{home runs in}} 5 games; he had hit 7 {{during the regular season}} and hit 80 in his 14-year career. David Ortiz had 11 <b>runs</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (RBI) during the 2004 ALCS and Iván Rodríguez had 10 during the 2003 NLCS—the only two players to reach double-digit RBI in the series {{in the history of the}} award. From the pitcher's mound, Steve Avery threw 16 innings without giving up a run in the 1991 NLCS, and John Smoltz amassed 19 strikeouts the {{following}} year. Liván Hernández won the 1997 NLCS MVP after winning his only start and earning a win out of the bullpen in relief; he struck out 16 in 10 innings. Daniel Murphy won the 2015 NLCS MVP after hitting home runs in six consecutive games, setting a major league record.|$|E
50|$|Runs {{produced}} is {{a baseball}} statistic {{that can help}} estimate the number of runs a hitter contributes to his team. The formula adds together the player's <b>runs</b> and <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in,</b> and then subtracts the player's home runs.|$|R
5000|$|In a 13-season career, Wambsganss {{posted a}} [...]259 batting average with seven {{home runs and}} 519 <b>run</b> <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> in 1492 games played. Due to his long surname, Wambsganss was often called [...] "Wamby" [...] by {{headline}} writers.|$|R
50|$|Martin made {{a single}} {{first-class}} appearance for Hampshire in 1904 against Somerset.
