R0 functions as a measure of contagiousness, so low R0 values are associated with lower HITs needed, whereas higher R0s demand higher HITs. For example, a disease with an R0 of 2 theoretically needs only a 50% HIT to be eliminated, whereas a disease with an R0 of 10 needs a 90% HIT. These calculations assume that the entire population is susceptible, meaning no individuals are immune to the disease. In reality, varying proportions of the population are immune to any given disease at any given time. To account for this, the effective <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> Re, also written as Rt, or the average number of infections caused at time t, can found by multiplying R0 by the fraction of the population that is still susceptible. When Re is reduced to and sustained below 1, the number of cases occurring in the population gradually decreases until the disease has been eliminated. If a population is immune to a disease in excess of that disease's HIT, the number of cases reduces at a faster rate, outbreaks are even less likely to happen, and outbreaks that occur are smaller than they would be otherwise [...] If Re increases to above 1, then the disease is neither in a steady state nor decreasing in incidence but is actively spreading through the population and infecting a larger number of people than usual.|$|E

Beginning in August 2008, a major cholera epidemic occurred in Zimbabwe, with 98, 585 reported cases and 4, 287 deaths. The dynamics of such outbreaks, particularly in nonestuarine regions, {{are not well}} understood. We explored the utility of mathematical models in understanding transmission dynamics of cholera and in assessing the magnitude of interventions necessary to control epidemic disease. Weekly data on reported cholera cases {{were obtained from the}} Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MoHCW) for the period from November 13, 2008 to July 31, 2009. A mathematical model was formulated and fitted to cumulative cholera cases to estimate the basic <b>reproductive</b> <b>numbers</b> R 0 and the partial <b>reproductive</b> <b>numbers</b> from all 10 provinces for the 2008 – 2009 Zimbabwe cholera epidemic. Estimated basic <b>reproductive</b> <b>numbers</b> were highly heterogeneous, ranging from a low value of just above unity to 2. 72. Partial <b>reproductive</b> <b>numbers</b> were also highly heterogeneous, suggesting that the transmission routes varied by province; human-to-human transmission accounted for 41 – 95 % of all transmission. Our models suggest that the underlying patterns of cholera transmission varied widely from province to province, with a corresponding variation in the amenability of outbreaks in different provinces to control measures such as immunization. These data underscore the heterogeneity of cholera transmission dynamics, potentially linked to differences in environment, socio-economic conditions, and cultural practices. The lack of traditional estuarine reservoirs combined with these estimates of R 0 suggest that mass vaccination against cholera deployed strategically in Zimbabwe and surrounding regions could prevent future cholera epidemics and eventually eliminate cholera from the region...|$|R

Epidemic curves to the situation in Chile under different initial conditions were adjusted and simulations for different <b>reproductive</b> <b>numbers</b> and notifi cation scenarios were performed.

The transmission coeffi cient ranged from 2 to 132 new cases per day x 106 susceptible individuals. The adjustments showed that the onset of the epidemic probably had more cases than reported.

40|$|When {{antibodies}} {{raised in}} response to a particular pathogen bind with immunologically similar pathogens it may facilitate infection through a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This process occurs between the four serotypes of dengue virus and, furthermore, secondary infection is a major risk factor in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Theory has suggested that ADE may be responsible for the large immunological distance between dengue serotypes. We investigate this hypothesis using an epidemic model for dengue in which immunological distance and the strength of immune cross-reaction are expressed separately. Cross-enhancement is considered in three alternative forms acting on susceptibility, transmission and mortality. Previous models have shown that transmission and mortality enhancement can lead to periodicity or chaos. We confirm this result for reasonable levels of susceptibility and transmission enhancement but not for mortality enhancement. We also show that when the two strains have identical basic <b>reproductive</b> <b>numbers</b> no form of enhancement leads to competitive exclusion. When the two strains have different basic <b>reproductive</b> <b>numbers</b> susceptibility or transmission enhancement allow strains with greater immunological similarity to stably coexist but mortality enhancement forces strains to be more distinct. All three forms of enhancement can be associated with DHF and we conclude that mortality enhancement must be dominant if ADE really is responsible for the immunological distance between dengue serotypes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{formulate}} differential susceptibility and differential infectivity {{models for}} disease transmission in this paper. The susceptibles {{are divided into}} n groups based on their susceptibilities, and the infectives are divided into m groups according to their infectivities. Both the standard incidence and the bilinear incidence are considered for different diseases. We obtain explicit formulas for the <b>reproductive</b> <b>number.</b> We define the <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> for each subgroup. Then the <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> for the entire population is a weighted average of those reproductive numbers for the subgroups. The formulas for the <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> are derived from the local stability of the infection-free equilibrium. We show that the infection-free equilibrium is globally stable as the <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> is less than one for the models with the bilinear incidence or with the standard incidence but no disease-induced death. We then show that if the <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> is greater than one, there exists a unique endemic equilibrium for these models. For the general cases of the models with the standard incidence and death, conditions are derived to ensure {{the uniqueness of the}} endemic equilibrium. We also provide numerical examples to demonstrate that the unique endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable if it exists. In honor of Professor Zhien Ma’s 70 th birthday 1. Introduction.

40|$|Background. With the {{increased}} occurrence of outbreaks of H 5 N 1 worldwide {{there is concern}} that the virus could enter commercial poultry farms with severe economic consequences. Methodology/Principal Findings. We analyse data from four recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry to estimate the farm-to-farm <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> for HPAI. The <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> is a key measure of the transmissibility of HPAI at the farm level {{because it can be}} used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. In these outbreaks the mean farm-to-farm <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> prior to controls ranged from 1. 1 to 2. 4, with the maximum farm-based <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> in the range 2. 2 to 3. 2. Enhanced bio-security, movement restrictions and prompt isolation of the infected farms in all four outbreaks substantially reduced the <b>reproductive</b> <b>number,</b> but it remained close to the threshold value 1 necessary to ensure the disease will be eradicated. Conclusions/Significance. Our results show that depending on the particular situation in which an outbreak of avian influenza occurs, current controls might not be enough to eradicate the disease, and therefore a close monitoring of the outbreak is required. The method we used for estimating the <b>reproductive</b> <b>number</b> is straightforward to implement and can be used in real-time.
