30|$|Natural {{regeneration}} {{with the}} consequent avoidance {{of the need}} for financial investments in artificial tree regeneration works well where competitive understory vegetation is sparse. Although dense stand conditions prior to <b>regeneration</b> <b>cutting</b> can reduce the amount of understory vegetation, numerous forest types in the world have understory vegetation that is highly shade tolerant and understory species that can respond very aggressively and competitively to canopy opening, even after partial harvests (e.g. Noguchi and Yoshida 2004; Donoso and Nyland 2005; Nilsson and Wardle 2005; Bose et al. 2014; Dodson et al. 2014). In these forests, regeneration of desirable tree species (especially, but not limited to shade-intolerant species) may be poor or delayed for years or even decades (Hibbs and Bower 2001; Axelsson et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the study, the {{selected}} wood and fiber properties were investigated in terms of their occurrence and variation in wood, as well as their relevance from the perspective of thermomechanical pulping process and related end-products. It was concluded that the most important factors were the fiber dimensions, juvenile wood content, and in some cases, the content of heartwood being associated with extremely dry wood with low permeability in spruce. With respect to the above properties, the following three pulpwood assortments of which pulping potential was assumed to vary were formed: wood from <b>regeneration</b> <b>cuttings,</b> first-thinnings wood, and sawmill chips. In the experimental part of the study the average wood and fiber characteristics and their variation were determined for each raw material group prior to pulping. Subsequently, each assortment - equaling about 1500 m 3 roundwood - was pulped separately for a 24 h period, at constant process conditions. The properties of obtained newsgrade thermomechanical pulps were then determined. Thermomechanical pulping (TMP) from sawmill chips had the highest proportion of long fibers, smallest proportion of fines, and had generally the coarsest and longest fibers. TMP from first-thinnings wood was just the opposite, whereas that from <b>regeneration</b> <b>cuttings</b> fell in between the above two extremes. High proportion of dry heartwood in wood originating from <b>regeneration</b> <b>cuttings</b> produced a slightly elevated shives content. However, no differences were found in pulp specific energy consumption. The obtained pulp tear index was clearly best in TMP made from sawmill chips and poorest in pulp from first-thinnings wood, which had generally inferior strength properties. No dramatical differences in any of the strength properties were found between pulp from sawmill residual wood and <b>regeneration</b> <b>cuttings.</b> Pulp optical properties were superior in TMP from first-thinnings. Unexpectedly, no noticeable differences, which could be explained with fiber morphology, were found in sheet density, bulk, air permeance or roughness between the three pulps. The most important wood quality factors in this study were the fiber length, fiber cross-sectional dimensions and percentage juvenile wood. Differences found in the quality of TMP manufactured from the above spruce assortments suggest that they could be segregated and pulped separately to obtain specific product characteristics, i. e., for instance tailor-made end-products, and to minimize unnecessary variation in the raw material quality, and hence, pulp quality...|$|R

40|$|European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a {{keystone}} species for biodiversity in boreal forests. However, large aspen {{have largely been}} removed from managed forests, whereas regeneration and the long-term persistence of mature trees in protected areas are matters of concern. We recorded the numbers of mature (≥ 20 cm diameter) aspen in old-growth and managed forests in eastern Finland, based on a large-scale inventory (11400 ha, 36000 living and dead trees). In addition, saplings and small aspen trees were surveyed on thirty-six 1 ha sample plots. The average volumes of mature living and dead aspen were 4. 0 and 1. 3 m 3 /ha in continuous old-growth forests and 0. 2 and 0. 6 m 3 /ha in managed forests, respectively. These results indicate that large aspen trees in managed forests are {{a legacy of the}} past, when forest landscapes were less intensively managed. We conclude that the long-term persistence of aspen in protected areas can only be secured by means of restoration measures that create gaps large enough for regeneration to occur. More emphasis should be given to sparing aspen during thinning and to retaining mature aspen during <b>regeneration</b> <b>cutting</b> in managed forests...|$|E
30|$|We {{explored}} 300 {{combinations of}} tree complexity (ranging from 5 to 9) and learning rate (ranging from 0.0001 to 0.01), which produced models with between 700 and 1500 trees. The optimal model had a tree complexity of 7, a learning rate of 0.0001, {{and a total}} of 1020 trees. Model predictive deviance was 0.809 [*]±[*] 0.001 with 80.6 % of the total response variance explained. The AUC score was 0.773 [*]±[*] 0.022 (“good” ability to discriminate between species presence and absence). Recursive feature elimination tests showed that twelve variables, including slope, adjacency to water bodies, artificial <b>regeneration,</b> <b>cutting,</b> forestland ownership, distance to the nearest road, fire disturbance, animal disturbance, disease disturbance, insect disturbance, human-caused disturbance, and weather disturbance, could be removed from the model before the resulting predictive deviance exceeded the initial predictive deviance of the model with all variables. Examination of the relative contribution of the predictor variables indicated that the top four accounted for approximately 90 % of the contribution in the overall model. Of the four most influential variables, three were forest features (tree species diversity (Hs), basal area, and stand age) and one was a landscape condition (elevation). Species diversity was the most influential variable, contributing 30.7 %. Basal area, elevation, and stand age were the second, third, and fourth most important variables, contributing 22.9 %, 20.5 %, and 16.7 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective is to}} construct a model for crown radius (CR) based on DBH and significant quantifiers for wild pear (Pyrus pyraster), using regression analyses, to develop guidelines for silvicultural practices for wild pear. To establish the model empirical data of a wild pear population in Western Germany was collected. Site measurements include prevailing vegetation, soil characteristics, location and neighbouring trees. Tree measurements include DBH, height, crown radius and quality characteristics: living branches, forking, bending and spiral grain. 52 trees have been measured of which 41 {{have been used for}} modelling purposes. Selection criteria for the model are residual plots and coefficient of determination (R²). In order to find a linear relationship, (semi-) logarithmic transformations of the dependent and independent variables have taken place. A backward variable elimination from a full model was used to find significant predictors. The logarithmic model is selected best as residual plots show a homoscedastic distribution and follow a normal distribution around the zero-line. The R² of 0. 6101 gives an indication of a significant relationship. The final relation can be formulated as:CR=e^(0. 61388 ∗ln(DBH) − 0. 75029), where CR in m and DBH in cm. No other independent variables than DBH have been significant. From the derived model, tree spacing and number of stems per ha can be calculated at any DBH.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{probability of}} Taxus baccata (L.) decline given climate change brings forth many uncertainties for conservation management decisions. In this article, the authors present {{the effects of}} applying <b>regeneration</b> <b>cuttings</b> since the year 2000 on {{the viability of the}} understory yew population. By collecting data from a stand located at the centre of the largest population of European yew in Slovakia, containing approximately 160, 000 individuals, and analysing tree-ring records from 38 sampled trees, the improved performance of yews, including stem growth, seed production, and number of regenerated individuals, was revealed. Thinning the canopy by removing 15 % of the growing stock volume per decade, combined with the subsequent irregular shelterwood cuttings, was assessed as a useful strategy. Moreover, lower radial growth of females compared to males, but simultaneously their similar response to climate, suggests a possible trade-off between reproduction and growth. Release cuttings of up to 30 % of the standing volume {{in the vicinity of the}} female trees, executed in the rainy summers following warmer winters, and consistent elimination of deer browsing, can further enhance the positive effects of applied cuts on yew viability. Overall, the suggested active measures could be considered as an effective option to preserve the unique biodiversity of calcareous beech-dominated forests in Central Europe...|$|R

40|$|The paper analyse the {{substitution}} of hornbeam coppice stands and conversion into high forest stands, formed by species that better valorise the site conditions. An improved alternative for the method of substitution in corridors is presented. The main goal of this new substitution-conversion alternative is to gradually conduct the actual structure of the coppice stands towards the target structure imposed by the forest management objectives, without a total elimination of the species that will be substituted. Two plot areas were selected {{in order to put}} into practice the proposed method. Bands were created for reducing the effective costs of {{the substitution}} process. 450 respectively 468, small seedlings (of beech, pedunculate oak and sessile oak) per hectare were planted in the created bands. The planting scheme took into account the shadow tolerance of the species from the target composition. Based on the field data and using the yield tables, the evolution of the stands in the two selected plots was simulated. In this respect, the forest treatments were parameterized according to the Romanian forest rules regarding the application of thinning and <b>regeneration</b> <b>cuttings.</b> The substitution-conversion process started from an almost pure hornbeam coppice and, simulating the application of the proposed method for 120 years, it was predicted that the method allows directing the actual stand structure to the target structure. The dynamics of species and structural diversity were assessed and the results of 120 years simulation indicate an important increase of both the species (the Shannon species index increases from 0. 203 to 1. 073) and structural diversity (the Gini structural index increases from 0. 032 to 0. 200).  </span...|$|R

Elevations range from 54 to 2025  m, where the highest and lowest points are Clingmans Dome and Mississippi River, respectively. We extracted data on {{the presence or absence of}} Japanese stiltgrass collected by the U.S. Forest Service during two field survey cycles (2000 – 2005 and 2006 – 2011) using the Southern Nonnative Invasive Plant data Extraction Tool (SNIPET) of the USDA Forest Service (Rudis et al. 2006; USDA 2011). We also collected data on a suite of associated landscape conditions (including elevation, slope, and adjacency to water bodies) and forest features (including stand age, site productivity, tree species diversity, basal area, and natural regeneration), as well as forest management activities (including site preparation, artificial <b>regeneration,</b> <b>cutting,</b> and forestland ownership) and past disturbances (including distance to the nearest road, fire disturbance, animal disturbance, disease disturbance, insect disturbance, human-caused disturbance, and weather disturbance), from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program (Bechtold and Patterson 2005). The FIA Program is a forest inventory program in which each state inventory is completed and reported every 5  years in most southeastern states (Bechtold and Patterson 2005). The basic sampling design consists of a lattice of 4047 -m 2 hexagons, with one sample plot located randomly within each hexagon (Bechtold and Patterson 2005; USDA 2011). Each sample plot consists of four subplots of radius 7.32  m which form a cluster consisting of a central subplot and three peripheral subplots equidistant from each other arrayed in a circle of radius 36.58  m centered on the central plot. On each subplot, inventory crews estimate percent cover by target invasive species, and also record a suite of landscape conditions and forest features, as well as past disturbances and forest management activities (Rudis et al. 2006). Thus, the percent cover of invasion in a fixed plot could either increase or decrease.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Powdery mildew (Microsphaera alphitoides Griff. et Maubl.) was studied {{from the}} aspect of its {{influence}} on regeneration of the pedunculate oak stands in the Ravni Srem area. Possibility to control the funguswith chemical protection measures was also investigated. During the three-year research period (2006 – 2008), efficiency of eight fungicides (Microthiol special, Stroby DF, ZATO 50 -WG, Cabrio Top, Quadris, Alert S, Duett Ultra, Sabithane) and their influence on the plant growth increase were tested. Material and Methods: The research was conducted on seedlings and juvenile oak plants in a newly regenerated pedunculate oak stand in the southwestern Srem area, in the Vini~na forest section (dept. 15 a). Level of plants infection and evaluation of fungicide efficiency were determined by visual evaluation {{of the presence of}} powdery mildew on leaves of 25 randomly picked plants within each experimental field. Plant growth elements were determined {{on the basis of the}} length of multistage formed shoots and root neck diameter. Results and Conclusion: Suppression of powdery mildew on pedunculate oak seedlings and juvenile oak plants is an important protective measure which is essential for regeneration areas in the period of <b>regeneration</b> <b>cutting.</b> The observed fungicides showed high efficiency in control of the fungus. A biological feature of pedunculate oak to form multistaged shoots by activating terminal buds during the growing season came to the fore. Majority of plants formed 3 or 4 stage growths during the first year. Chemical protection of seedlings from powdery mildew should be conducted in the period of plant growth in height. In such proceedings, the application of fungicides is reduced to minimum and thereby provides a rational seedling protection. In the second and third year of oak development, applied fungicides had little effect.

One of these methods, which can be applied in forestry, is mathematical programming (in particular, linear programming). Linear programming has a long tradition of being used in the U. S. and European forestry, whereas in the forestry of Serbia it still represents a theoretically and practically unknown tool. Therefore, in this paper we analyze the possibility of applying the methods of linear programming in developing a plan of <b>regeneration</b> <b>cutting</b> in the poplar plantations of FMU "Topolik" managed by PE "Vojvodinašume. " Using the aimed function (linear programming) and the corresponding software package the maximum yield that can be achieved by cutting the plantation was obtained. The planned management period was from 2012 to 2021 and its volume was 155 852 m 3. The preset condition that the yield in half-periods remains equal was fulfilled (half-period I 77, 925 m 3, half-period II 77, 927 m 3). The maximum yield obtained with this methodology was by 4, 040 m 3 lower than the theoretically possible yield that would be obtained if all stands were cut {{down at the end of}} the second half-period, i. e. higher by 8, 430 m 3 than the yield that would be obtained if cutting of the stands were performed at the start of the management period. The results obtained and foreign experience in this area clearly indicate that linear programming can successfully be used to solve this problem and even more complex problems (than the one presented in this paper) in our local forest practice (multidimensional planning with a series of constraints).

40|$|Modern {{industry}} {{expectations in}} terms of milling operations often demand the milling of the flexible details by using slender ball-end tools. This is a difficult task because of possible vibration occurrence. Due to existence of certain conditions (small depths of <b>cutting,</b> <b>regeneration</b> phenomena), <b>cutting</b> process may become unstable and self-excited chatter vibration may appear. Frequency of the chatter vibration is close to dominant natural frequency of the workpiece or the tool. One of the methods of chatter vibration avoidance is matching the spindle speed to the optimum phase shift between subsequent cutting edges passes (i. e. the Liao-Young condition). However, the set of optimum spindle speeds {{from the point of}} view of vibration reduction may be not optimum one from other points of view. For example milling efficiency or machine tool capabilities cannot be assured. This article presents the idea of a workpiece holder with adjustable stiffness and discusses a new variant of its realization. In the holder, milling process is performed at constant spindle speed and feed speed. In order to avoid vibration the holder stiffness is modified. Stiffness changes modify natural frequencies of the workpiece and thus it is possible to modify dynamic properties of the workpiece in such a way that arbitrary chosen, constant spindle speed will be optimum, due to the Liao-Young condition performance. Calculation of the optimum stiffness is performed before milling, based on the workpieces modal identification results and the finite element model simulations...|$|R

The aim of this work was to study the impact of deer on sprout <b>regeneration</b> after <b>cutting</b> in mixed coppices felled in the period 2007 - 2010 and characterized by the dominance of chestnut, hornbeam, Turkey oak, and beech. Some 36 plots were established in four municipal districts of the Prato province (Cantagallo, Vernio, Montemurlo, Vaiano). Damage and browsing intensity on each stump were evaluated using an index that allowed the comparison among different areas and fores stand types.

A significant difference in the sprout height was detected between browsed and non-browsed areas. Despite a high incidence of damage in all the studied areas, chestnut showed a greater resilience against browsing.

To calibrate the model, we measured and mapped trees in 27 plots with structures ranging from secondary-successional oak forests to late-successional beech forests. We measured understory light and crown openness and verified that our forest radiative transfer model well captured the variability of understory light among the studied stands (R 2 = 87 %). We then compared cutting strategies varying in type and intensity and provided indications to promote the regeneration of mixtures of species of different shade tolerances.

The study objective was to investigate P. curatellifolia’s seed germination to improve its conservation and sustainable utilisation in Uganda. The current research study focused on two major areas of P. curatellifolia regeneration: (1) regeneration in nature, (2) regeneration under laboratory conditions of (a) seed (sexual) <b>regeneration</b> and (b) <b>cuttings</b> (vegetative) <b>regeneration</b> and (c) direct sowing. Previously published results also confirmed difficulties in germinating P. curatellifolia seeds. Hence the need to undertake this research study aimed at understanding best ways to regenerate the species both in nature and laboratory-based conditions. However germination results were not obtained during the study time. Therefore efforts towards species’ regeneration in Uganda, require every exertion and support to succeed. To complement nature conservation research, plant genetic resources and biodiversity management. That supports other indicative mechanisms such as the Global Plan of Action to ensure food security, availability and sustainable utilisation of our natural resources...|$|R

These industries {{rely on the}} fast and guaranteed supply of clones to be cost-effective. Two vegetative propagation methods for H. sabdariffa L. are proposed as a technique of ensuring maximum genetic stability. Softwood and semi hardwood cuttings from two-month-old plants were rooted on a medium containing soil, compost and rocksand after dipping in IBA (indole- 3 -yl-butyric acid) or NAA (a-naphthalene acetic acid) at (0 - 1. 0 g/l). Rooting was significantly (P< 0. 05) affected {{by the type of}} cutting and the concentration of auxin used. Softwood cuttings responded more positively to auxin treatment and lower levels (0. 5 g/l) of auxin stimulated leaf and root formation. Rooting seemed to be more effective in cuttings treated with auxins than untreated <b>cuttings.</b> <b>Regeneration</b> by tissue culture proved to be more successful by using nodal explants. Multiple shoots were initiated on Murashige and Skoog 1962 (MS 1962) medium supplemented with various levels (0 - 2. 0 mg/l) of 6 -benzyl amino purine (BAP) and kinetin (KIN). Individual shoots with a minimum of two nodes were excised and rooted on MS (1962) medium containing 1. 5 - 2. 5 mg/l. Regenerants were acclimatized on a mixture (1 : 1) of sterile peat and soil. They showed vigorous shoot growth (within 3 weeks) and after 5 - 6 months were suitable for field planting.

40|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV), worldwide {{considered as}} one of the worst disease affecting Citrus plants, produced great changes in citriculture, mainly because it made mandatory the turnover of the sensitive sour orange rootstock with virus resistant ones. Among them, Troyer citrange {{has become one of the}} most employed rootstocks, due to its CTV tolerance and to the positive characteristics induced to the scion fruit production. Unfortunately, in Italy, there is a scarcity of seed mother plants. Micropropagation can be a solution for this problem. Among the in vitro techniques allowing the production of good quality true-to-type plants, the regeneration from seedling epicotyl cuttings generally guarantees a high proliferation rate and it is particularly suitable for citranges, because of their high level of polyembryony. A key factor to induce the <b>regeneration</b> from epicotyl <b>cuttings</b> is the addition, in the culture medium, of exogenous cytokinins, such as 6 -benzyladenine (BA). To overcome some of the BA flaws, a new family of endogenous aromatic cytokinins, named meta-Topolin (6 -[3 -hydroxylbenzylamino] purine, mT), has recently started to be used. In this research, the influence of mT and BA on organogenesis from Troyer citrange epicotyl cuttings was evaluated. For more than three months, a good proliferation rate was observed in these explants. However, no significant differences were detected in the explant response to the different media tested. Obtained results demonstrated that mT can be a valid alternative to BA in order to induce organogenesis from epicotyl cuttings. Further studies are necessary to increase the proliferation rate, evaluating new cytokinin combinations and concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Regeneration {{processes}} in riparian forests in islands Vardim and Malak Vardim were studied. Stands in natural oak {{forests in the}} investigated region are insignificantly impacted by anthropogenic activities in the last 40 - 50 years. They are dominated by Quercus robur L. Among the native tree species Populus alba L., Ulmus laevis Pall. and Pyrus communis L. are mostly spread. The introduced Amorpha fruticosa L. and Fraxinus americana L. spread in large scales. The regeneration potential of U. laevis is good and to less extent- of Q. robur. Main reason for the unsatisfactory regeneration of Q. robur is grazing of wild animals. Carrying out of regen-erating cuttings in Vardim oak forests is difficult due to the introduced limiting status of pro-tected area. For the successful natural regeneration of Quercus robur, it is recommended to make fences around solitaire and groups of fruiting trees, as well as strict protection and soil scarifi-cation. To stop the further invasion of introduced species and to increase the participation of other native tree species, it is recommended the following: (i) reafforestations with hybrid Euroamerican poplars and other exotic tree species are no longer performed; (ii) clear cuttings in forests composed by native tree and shrub species are stopped; (iii) regeneration groups of Quercus robur, Ulmus laevis, Populus alba, Populus nigra L. and Salix alba L. are established. This could be done through supporting the natural <b>regeneration</b> (soil scarification, <b>cutting</b> of the understorey and sowing of seeds) or through afforestation with Vardim reproductive materials.

40|$|The {{state of}} Florida {{has one of}} the most severe exotic species {{invasion}} problems in the United States, but little is known about their influence on soil biogeochemistry. My dissertation research includes a cross-continental field study in Australia, Florida, and greenhouse and growth chamber experiments, focused on the soil-plant interactions of one of the most problematic weeds introduced in south Florida, Lygodium microphyllum (Old World climbing fern). Analysis of field samples from the ferns introduced and their native range indicate that L microphyllum is highly dependent on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for phosphorus uptake and biomass accumulation. Relationship with AMF is stronger in relatively dry conditions, which are commonly found in some Florida sites, compared to more common wet sites where the fern is found in its native Australia. In the field, L. microphyllum is found to thrive in a wide range of soil pH, texture, and nutrient conditions, with strongly acidic soils in Australia and slightly acidic soils in Florida. Soils with pH 5. 5 - 6. 5 provide the most optimal growth conditions for L. microphyllum, and the growth declines significantly at soil pH 8. 0, indicating that further reduction could happen in more alkaline soils. Comparison of invaded and uninvaded soil characteristics demonstrates that L. microphyllum can change the belowground soil environment, with more conspicuous impact on nutrient-poor sandy soils, to its own benefit by enhancing the soil nutrient status. Additionally, the nitrogen concentration in the leaves, which has a significant influence in the relative growth rate and photosynthesis, was significantly higher in Florida plants compared to Australian plants. Given that L. microphyllum allocates up to 40 % of the total biomass to rhizomes, which aid in rapid <b>regeneration</b> after burning, <b>cutting</b> or chemical spray, hence management techniques targeting the rhizomes look promising. Over all, my results reveal for the first time that soil pH, texture, and AMF are major factors facilitating the invasive success of L. mcirophyllum. Finally, herbicide treatments targeting rhizomes will most likely become the widely used technique to control invasiveness of L. microphyllum in the future. However, a complete understanding of the soil ecosystem is necessary before adding any chemicals to the soil to achieve a successful long-term invasive species management strategy...|$|R
