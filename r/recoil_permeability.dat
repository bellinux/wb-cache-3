40|$|A general {{analytical}} technique {{predicts the}} magnetic field distribution in brushless permanent magnet machines equipped with surface-mounted magnets. It accounts {{for the effects of}} both the magnets and the stator windings. The technique is based on two-dimensional models in polar coordinates and solves the governing Laplacian/quasi-Poissonian field equations in the airgap/magnet regions without any assumption regarding the relative <b>recoil</b> <b>permeability</b> of the magnets. The analysis works for both internal and external rotor motor topologies, and either radial or parallel magnetized magnets, as well as for overlapping and nonoverlapping stator windings. The paper validates results of the analytical models by finite-element analyses, for both slotless and slotted motor...|$|E
40|$|We develop {{analytical}} {{models for}} predicting {{the magnetic field}} distribution in Halbach magnetized machines. They are formulated in polar coordinates and account for the relative <b>recoil</b> <b>permeability</b> of the magnets. They are applicable to {{both internal and external}} rotor permanent-magnet machines with either an iron-cored or air-cored stator and/or rotor. We compare predicted results with those obtained by finite-element analyses and measurements. We show that the air-gap flux density varies significantly with the pole number and that an optimal combination of the magnet thickness and the pole number exists for maximum air-gap flux density, while the back iron can enhance the air-gap field and electromagnetic torque when the radial thickness of the magnet is small...|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} work, we succeeded in fabricating ferrite/Sm 2 Fe 17 N 3 composite magnets from explosive-consolidating Sm 2 Fe 17 N 3 powders (2 Î¼m size) which were {{coated with a}} continuous iron ferrite layer (50 nm thick) in an aqueous solution. The magnetization curves had no inflection, {{which suggests that the}} soft magnetic ferrite layer is exchange-coupled with the hard ferromagnetic Sm 2 Fe 17 N 3 particles. In this paper, we provide evidence of exchange coupling in ferrite/Sm 2 Fe 17 N 3 composites by the following means: 1) measurements of <b>recoil</b> <b>permeability,</b> 2) detailed microstructural observation and 3) calculations of the reduction in remanence due to the introduction of a ferrite layer in the Sm 2 Fe 17 N 3 magnets. Our ferrite/Sm 2 Fe 17 N 3 composite magnets are a novel type of spring magnet in which an insulating soft magnetic phase is exchange-coupled with hard magnetic phase...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{model for the}} computation of the electromagnetic performance in interior permanent magnet (IPM) machines that accounts for the stator and the complex rotor structure. Using the subdomain method, we propose a simplified analytical model that considers the magnetic properties of the IPM machine. The analytical solutions are derived by solving the field-governing equations in each simple and regular subdomain, i. e., magnet, barrier, air gap, slot opening, and slot, and then applying the boundary conditions to the interfaces between these subdomains. The analytical model accurately accounts for {{the influence of the}} interaction between the slots, the relative <b>recoil</b> <b>permeability</b> of the magnets, and the boundary conditions. The magnetic field and electromagnetic performance obtained using the analytical method are compared with those obtained using finite element analysis. Finally, the analytical predictions are compared with the measured data in order to confirm the validity of the methods proposed in this paper...|$|E
