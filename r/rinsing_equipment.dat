Of these isolates, 8 species were identified in the <b>rinses</b> of <b>equipment,</b> 2 from {{the air of the}} production facilities, and 9 from the final product, i. e., quarg and quarg products. Four species of the yeasts isolated from quarg, namely Debaryomyces hansenii, Trichosporon cutaneum, Kluyveromyces marxianus var. marxianus and Candida zeylanoides were also present in the <b>rinses</b> of <b>equipment.</b> Debaryomyces hansenii and Trichosporon cutaneum were the predominant species both in the <b>rinses</b> of <b>equipment</b> and in the final product...|$|R
40|$|Mixing and loading may be {{the most}} {{hazardous}} activities associated with normal pesticide use. Because of the concentrations and quantities of pesticides involved, accidental releases of pesticides at a mixing and loading site pose a high risk of ground and surface water contamination. Also, when you mix and load, you handle a pesticide in its most concentrated form and experience the greatest potential for exposure. To prevent pollution and safeguard human health, the mixing and loading of pesticide and the washing and <b>rinsing</b> of <b>equipment</b> should be conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible fashion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWash water streams {{coming from}} <b>rinsing</b> of <b>equipment</b> in a {{detergent}} production site {{is in many}} cases considered as waste. On site treatment in waste water plants is possible but typically requires advanced oxidation process (AOP) technology which uses chemicals and creates a waste sludge. A new treatment approach, based on nanofiltration, has been demonstrated at industrial scale in a detergent production site in China. Wash water could be split into a concentrate stream and water fraction. The concentrate stream contains most of the valuable surfactants and has a value to recycle. The water fraction can easily be polished by MBR to feed cooling towers. As such, this production site does not discharge any process wash water and recovers all resources out of the rinsing water: both chemicals (as surfactants) as the water...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of glutaraldehyde on the synovial tissue of rabbits. Four different concentrations of glutaraldehyde solution were injected into one knee and the contralateral gleno-humeral joint of rabbits in group A to group D. The concentration levels used in group A and group B were 1000 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively. For group C and group D, samples of rinsing solutions obtained by <b>rinsing</b> arthroscopic <b>equipment</b> with 1 l or 2 l of isotonic saline, respectively, after immersion in 2 % glutaraldehyde were used. The contralateral knee and ipsilateral glenohumeral joint of the same rabbits were injected with saline and used as control sites. Rabbits were sacrificed after 1 day, 7 days or 15 days and the histopathological changes in the synovial tissues were compared. The most dramatic inflammatory changes were observed in group A and group B. The histopathological changes were greater after 7 days than after 1 day or 15 days. Group C and group D showed no significant differences when compared with normal synovium. A correlation between the concentration of the glutaraldehyde solution {{and the number of}} inflamed joints was observed. Very few or no inflamed joints were seen when samples from rinsing solutions of 1 l or 2 l of saline, respectively, were used...|$|R

40|$|The COGEMA UP 1 {{reprocessing}} plant commissioned at Marcoule, France in 1958 handled roughly 20, 000 {{metric tons of}} fuel from gas-cooled and research reactors. The commercial reprocessing activities of the UP 1 plant ended in December 1997. CODEM, a joint venture created by the former users of the UP 1 plant, including the utility Electricité de France (EDF), the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and COGEMA, was established to fund and supervise decommissioning of the plant.

COGEMA, with its CODEM partners, had made the decision to proceed to a "Final Shutdown " of the plant within a few {{years after the end of}} commercial operation. Final shutdown is intended to remove remaining fissile matter and highly radioactive materials, as well as some equipment, from the plant to ease the plant monitoring requirements compared with those applied when the plant was in operation.

40|$|Enterococci {{are common}} milk contaminants, and {{microbial}} contamination of milk by {{this group of}} microorganisms can occur {{from a variety of}} sources. Significance of enterococci can be assessed by many separated points of view, otherwise a lot of research has focused on the potential role of food enterococci as reservoirs and/or vehicles of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the occurence of enterococci in <b>rinses</b> of milking <b>equipment</b> (n = 38) on two farms using automatic sanitation system. Our results showed, that alkaline disinfectant (on chlorine basis) was effective towards enterococci because apart from 2 samples, their presence in rinses has not been determined. Average number of enterococci survived the aplication of acid disinfectant reached the value 5. 00. 101 CFU. ml- 1. Together, 60 strains were randomly isolated and identified from the grown colonies of genus Enterococcus, and E. faecalis was the predominat species (69. 6 %). In rinses, also E. faecium, E. mundtii and undefined enterococci were found. Among antibiotic resistant isolates, 83. 9 % of isolates were sensitive to erytromycin (15 mcg/disk) and resistant to vancomycin (30 mcg/disk) were 20 % of isolates...|$|R
40|$|Among 82 {{patients}} who underwent liposuction {{performed by a}} single practitioner in a 6 -month period, 34 (41 %) developed cutaneous abscesses. An organism identified as Mycobacterium chelonae by polymerase chain reaction restriction-enzyme analysis was recovered from cultures of samples from 12 of those patients. DNA large restriction-fragment pattern analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated that a strain of M. chelonae recovered from biofilm in the piped-water system {{in one of the}} physician’s offices differed by only 2 restriction fragments from the 12 patient isolates, which differed from each other by 0 or 1 restriction fragment. A detailed retrospective cohort study that included interviews with former employees and statistical analysis of risk factors indicated that inadequate sterilization and <b>rinsing</b> of surgical <b>equipment</b> with tap water were likely sources of mycobacterial contamination. This is the first reported outbreak of nosocomial infection due to M. chelonae in which a source has been identified and the first to occur in association with liposuction in patients in the United States. Infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) are relatively uncommon [1 – 13]. Cutaneous infection is the most common presentation [2 – 4] and, in most cases, follows penetrating trauma [3, 4]. Out-breaks of nosocomial surgical-site RGM infection [4 – 8], most often due to Mycobacterium fortuitum or Mycobacterium abscessus, have been associated with car-diothoracic surgery, augmentation mammaplasty, and facial plastic surgery [6 – 9]. Liposuction is a common cosmetic procedure. Ap-proximately 150, 000 liposuction procedures were per-formed in the United States in 1997 by board-certified plastic surgeons who were members of the America...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to isolate potential Bacillus cereus sensu lato (B. cereus s. l.) from a range of farm environments. Samples of tap water, milking <b>equipment</b> <b>rinse</b> water, milk sediment filter, grass, soil and bulk tank milk were collected from 63 farms. In addition, milk liners were swabbed at the start and the end of milking, and swabs were taken from cows’ teats prior to milking. The samples were plated on mannitol egg yolk polymyxin agar (MYP) and presumptive B. cereus s. l. colonies were isolated and stored in nutrient broth with 20 % glycerol and frozen at - 80 °C. These isolates were then plated on chromogenic medium (BACARA) and colonies identified as presumptive B. cereus s. l. on this medium were subjected to 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing. Of the 507 isolates presumed to be B. cereus s. l. on the basis of growth on MYP, only 177 showed growth typical of B. cereus s. l. on BACARA agar. The use of 16 S rRNA sequencing to identify isolates that grew on BACARA confirmed that the majority of isolates belonged to B. cereus s. l. A total of 81 of the 98 isolates sequenced were tentatively identified as presumptive B. cereus s. l. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was carried out on milk and soil isolates from seven farms that were identified as having presumptive B. cereus s. l. No pulsotype was shared by isolates from soil and milk on the same farm. Presumptive B. cereus s. l. was widely distributed within the dairy farm environment. peer-reviewedTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|R
