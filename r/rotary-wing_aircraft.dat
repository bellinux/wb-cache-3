5|$|Based on the {{guidance}} from the Secretary of the Army, CDC established Qualitative Material Development Objectives (QMDO) for a <b>rotary-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> with 195-knot (224mph, 361km/h) cruise speed, 220-knot (253mph, 407km/h) dash speed, and {{the capability to}} hover out-of-ground-effect (OGE) at 6,000feet (1,830m) on a 95°F (35°C) day.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedOver {{the last two}} decades, cockpits have migrated from the traditional analog gauges of moving dials to computer displays representing an assortment of flight data. To keep in stride with this modernization trend, the U. S. Navy determined that the newest <b>rotary-wing</b> fleet <b>aircraft,</b> the MH- 60 S and MH- 60 R, would incorporate these advanced cockpit designs. This program was named Common Cockpit. Using structured interviews with current Navy MH- 60 S pilots, and analysis of system design models; {{it was determined that}} the MH- 60 glass cockpit has fundamental flaws in cockpit design and usability. One major issue identified is the omission of a fully integrated moving map. The lack of a moving map is a serious issue because many of the MH- 60 missions require precise navigation. The Navy pilots interviewed indicated that lack of a moving map makes mission task performance difficult and could threaten safety. It is argued here that a user-centered design methodology would have given ample consideration to including the moving map and would have produced a more effective and usable cockpit design. Recommendations are made to improve design methodology by using Crew-Centered Design methods. Recommendations are made regarding modification of existing Common Cockpit acquisitions procedures needed to produce a better product for the fleet. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
40|$|In this study, hover {{performance}} and acoustic measurements are taken {{on two different}} isolated rotors representative of small-scale <b>rotary-wing</b> unmanned <b>aircraft</b> systems (UAS) {{for a range of}} rotation rates. Each rotor system consists of two fixed-pitch blades powered by a brushless motor. For nearly the same thrust condition, significant differences in overall sound pressure level (OASPL), up to 8 dB, and directivity were observed between the two rotor systems. Differences are shown to be in part attributed to different rotor tip speeds, along with increased broadband and motor noise levels. In addition to acoustic measurements, aeroacoustic predictions were implemented in order to better understand the noise content of the rotor systems. Numerical aerodynamic predictions were computed using the unsteady Reynoldsaveraged Navier Stokes code OVERFLOW 2 on one of the isolated rotors, while analytical predictions were computed using the Propeller Analysis System of the Aircraft NOise Prediction Program (ANOPP-PAS) on the two rotor configurations. Preliminary semi-empirical frequency domain broadband noise predictions were also carried out based on airfoil self-noise theory in a rotational reference frame. The prediction techniques further supported trends identified in the experimental data analysis. The brushless motors were observed to be important noise contributors and warrant further investigation. It is believed that UAS acoustic prediction capabilities must consider both rotor and motor components as part of a combined noise-generating system...|$|R

50|$|The {{predecessor}} to the RSAF, the SADC, {{was formed}} in September 1968. The SADC's immediate task was {{to set up the}} Flying Training School to train pilots. Qualified flying instructors were obtained through Airwork Services Limited, a UK-based company specialising in defence services. Basic training for pilots was carried out using two Cessna light aircraft hired from the Singapore Flying Club. The SADC also enlisted the help of the Royal Air Force which introduced the first flying training syllabus and provided two ex-RAF pilots as instructors, as well as facilities and services at Seletar Airport. Finally, the first batch of six pilot trainees were sent to the United Kingdom in August 1968 to undergo training in various technical disciplines. The training was based on the Hawker Hunter, the SADC's first air defence fighter. The following month, another pioneer group of technicians, this time from the rotary wing, were sent to France to begin their technical training on the Aérospatiale Alouette III helicopter. In 1969, a number of local RAF technicians were released to join the fledging SADC. These local technicians (local other ranks) had experience working on fixed-wing RAF aircraft such as the Hawker Hunter, Gloster Javelin, English Electric Canberra, English Electric Lightning and Avro Shackleton; as well as <b>rotary-wing</b> RAF <b>aircraft</b> such as the Bristol Belvedere, Westland Wessex and Westland Whirlwind.|$|R
25|$|The RLAF {{began its}} {{operations}} as a liaison, logistics and transport unit. Its initial stock were a melange of French and American supplied <b>rotary-wing</b> and fixed-wing <b>aircraft</b> inherited from its predecessor, Aviation Laotienne. On 9 January 1961, the new RLAF was supplied with six AT-6 Texans {{as its first}} strike aircraft. Although these were quickly lost, they were replaced by five T-28 Trojans. Despite ongoing losses, the T-28 inventory would eventually burgeon under American auspices to 75 Trojans on board in 1973. It would also acquire ten AC-47 gunships for a time. Pilot procurement for the swelling fleet would always be problematic, with the inadequate roster of Lao and Hmong pilots being filled out with Thai mercenary pilots, and a few Americans from Air America. By the time American aid was withdrawn in 1973, dooming the force, the RLAF would total 180 aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{approach to the}} study of flight dynamics of aircraft operating in a high-angle-of-attack flight regime and of helicopters operating in extreme thrust conditions is presented. Steady coordinated high-g turns are used to establish the initial equilibrium flight conditions near stall angles of attack. The kinematic properties of the aircraft in steady coordinated turns are examined: in high-g turns, pitch rate (independent of the angle of attack) is of a much larger magnitude than roll and yaw rate; a substantial roll rate is found to develop in steep turns for all angles of attack; the angle of attack also has a significant effect on the pitch attitude, with decreasing influence as the normal load factor increases. The exact small disturbance equations of motion of the aircraft in general steady turns are also developed for application to both <b>rotary-wing</b> and fixed-wing <b>aircraft</b> in extreme conditions. These equations are in a first-order, vector-matrix format, and are thus compatible with many efficient software packages developed in modern system theory...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{potential}} of combining measurements from fixed- and <b>rotary-wing</b> remotely piloted <b>aircraft</b> systems (RPAS) to complement data sets from radio soundings as well as ship and sea-ice-based instrumentation for atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) profiling. This study represents a proof-of-concept of RPAS observations in the Antarctic sea-ice zone. We present first results from the RV Polarstern Antarctic winter expedition in the Weddell Sea in June�August 2013, during which three RPAS were operated to measure temperature, humidity and wind; a fixed-wing small unmanned meteorological observer (SUMO), a fixed-wing meteorological mini-aerial vehicle, and an advanced mission and operation research quadcopter. A total of 86 RPAS flights showed a strongly varying ABL structure ranging from slightly unstable temperature stratification near the surface to conditions with strong surface-based temperature inversions. The RPAS observations supplement the regular upper air soundings and standard meteorological measurements made during the campaign. The SUMO and quadcopter temperature profiles agree very well and, excluding cases with strong temperature inversions, 70 % of the variance in the difference between the SUMO and quadcopter temperature profiles can be explained by natural, temporal, temperature fluctuations. Strong temperature inversions cause the largest differences, which are induced by SUMO’s high climb rates and slow sensor response. Under such conditions, the quadcopter, with its slower climb rate and faster sensor, is very useful in obtaining accurate temperature profiles in the lowest 100 m above the sea ice...|$|R
