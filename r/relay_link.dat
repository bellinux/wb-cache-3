Three dedicated Airborne Launch Control Centers (ALCC) were {{on ground}} alert around-the-clock providing ALCS coverage for {{five of the}} six Minuteman ICBM Wings. These dedicated ALCCs were mostly EC-135A aircraft but could also have been EC-135C or EC-135G aircraft depending on availability. ALCC No. 1 was on ground alert at Ellsworth AFB, SD and during a wartime scenario would have taken off and orbited between the Minuteman Wings at Ellsworth AFB, SD and F.E. Warren AFB, WY providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCCs No. 2 and No. 3 were routinely on forward deployed ground alert at Minot AFB, ND. During a wartime scenario, ALCC No. 3 would have orbited between the Minuteman ICBM Wings at Minot AFB and Grand Forks AFB, both in North Dakota, providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCC No. 2 was dedicated to orbiting near the Minuteman ICBM Wing at Malmstrom AFB, MT providing ALCS assistance if needed. The 4th ACCS also maintained an EC-135C or EC-135G on ground alert at Ellsworth AFB, SD as the West Auxiliary Airborne Command Post (WESTAUXCP) as a backup to SAC’s [...] "Looking Glass" [...] Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) as well as a radio <b>relay</b> <b>link</b> between the Looking Glass and ALCCs when airborne. Although equipped with ALCS, the WESTAUXCP did not have a dedicated Minuteman ICBM wing to provide ALCS assistance to.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nash equilibria and {{dominant}} {{strategies are}} two of the major approaches to deal with selfishness in an automated system (AS), where each agent is a selfish entity. In this paper, we consider the scenario when the receiver(s) and the <b>relay</b> <b>links</b> are both selfish, which generalizes the previous scenario in which either the <b>relay</b> <b>links</b> are selfish or the receivers are selfish. This also advances all previous studying in routing by taking into account the budget balance ratio. We prove that no mechanism can achieve budget balance ratio greater than 1 when truthful revealing is a dominant n strategy for each of the <b>relay</b> <b>links</b> and receivers. Here, n is the number of vertices in the network. In the meanwhile, we also present a mechanism that achieves the budget balance ratio 1 and is truthful for both n the receivers and <b>relay</b> <b>links,</b> which closes the bounds. When we relax the truthful revealing requirement to Nash Equilibrium for <b>relay</b> <b>links,</b> we present a mechanism that achieves an asymptotically optimal budget balance ratio. ...|$|R

In the considered system, one user is selected among multiple ones for secure transmission to the destination node {{with the help of an}} untrusted relay node. To reduce the information leakage to the untrusted relay, the paper considers two selection criteria to select the user based on the direct and the <b>relaying</b> <b>links,</b> respectively. The impact of direct and the <b>relaying</b> <b>link</b> on the system secrecy performance is studied by deriving the close-form ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) as well as the asymptotic expression.

30|$|Our design {{problem is}} to {{determine}} transmit precoders at the transmitters and relays to maximize the end-to-end sum-rates. The single-hop sum-rate maximization problem is non-convex and NP-hard, i.e., its globally optimal solution cannot be found efficiently in terms of computational complexity[14]. More complicated, the joint transmit precoder problem for end-to-end sum-rate maximization is also non-convex {{and is expected to}} be NP-hard. This motivates us to develop an algorithm for transmit precoder design that obtains high end-to-end sum-rates, i.e., to find efficiently suboptimal solutions to the end-to-end sum-rate maximization problem. Note that prior work often focuses on single-hop sum-rate maximization. Then existing algorithms could be applied to maximize independently the sum-rates in each hop of the two-hop interference channel. This naive approach, however, leads to rate mismatch in the two hops, which reduces the end-to-end sum-rates. Rate mismatch occurs when some <b>relay</b> <b>links</b> have a dominant first hop while others have a dominant second hop. From a resource allocation perspective, this means it wastes resources to the second-hop dominant <b>relay</b> <b>links</b> while depriving resources from the first-hop dominant <b>relay</b> <b>links.</b>|$|R
