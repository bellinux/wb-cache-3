5|$|Stars {{are created}} within galaxies from a <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> cold gas that forms into giant {{molecular}} clouds. Some galaxies {{have been observed}} to form stars at an exceptional rate, which {{is known as a}} starburst. If they continue to do so, then they would consume their <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> gas in a time span less than the lifespan of the galaxy. Hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million years, a relatively brief period in the history of a galaxy. Starburst galaxies were more common during the early history of the Universe, and, at present, still contribute an estimated 15% to the total star production rate.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the rifle}} corps were re-established in late 1942 and the {{previous}} organization of artillery at the corps level was reintroduced.

5|$|The {{third stage}} of the {{operation}} centred on the capture of Drvar, the secondary objective of the overall offensive.

A renewed push by OGs West and South, combined with a rapid advance by the ARBiH 5th Corps against Bosanski Petrovac threatened to isolate Drvar, and the VRS withdrew from the town.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{discharge}} from the NZEF, Hart resumed legal work in his Carterton practice. However, within a few months, he moved his family to Masterton and established a new law firm.

He maintained an association with the military; after an initial spell in the <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> officers, he resumed his involvement with the Territorial Force and served as commander of the 2nd (Wellington) Infantry Brigade for several years. He was eventually returned to the <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> officers in 1925. To acknowledge his long military career, he was awarded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration (VD) and appointed honorary colonel of his old Territorial Force unit, the Hawkes' Bay Regiment (formerly 17th (Ruahine) Regiment). He retired from the military in 1930.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fossil fuels}} include coal, {{petroleum}} and natural gas. Bulgaria possesses significant <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> coal estimated at 4,8 billion tons. More than 92% of them, or 4,5 billion tons, is lignite, {{which is the}} lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content but is widely used for electricity generation. With <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> 2,856 billion tons Maritsa Iztok, situated in the Upper Thracian Plain, {{is by far the}} largest coal basin in the country which powers Maritsa Iztok Complex, the largest energy complex in South-Eastern Europe. Other lignite basins include Sofia valley (<b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> 870 million tons), Elhovo (656 million tons), Lom (277 million tons), Maritsa Zapad (170 million tons). The <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> sub-bituminous coal are 300 million tons, situated mainly near Bobov Dol, Pernik and Burgas. The recoverable <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> bituminous coal and anthracite are insignificant— only 10 and 2,5 million tons respectively. However, there is a huge basin of bituminous coal in Southern Dobruja with estimated <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> over 1 billion tons but its large depth (1370–1950m) is an obstacle for its commercial exploitation.|$|R
5|$|David French {{wrote that}} the {{follow-up}} formations landing in Normandy were on average two days behind schedule and that had the 33rd Armoured Brigade, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 7th Armoured Division's infantry brigade landed on time, XXX Corps {{might have been able}} to secure Villers-Bocage, before the arrival of substantial German forces. Other historians wrote that substantial British forces remained uncommitted during the battle. Mungo Melvin wrote that although the 7th Armoured Division changed its organisation to a flexible combined arms structure, which was not done by the other British armoured divisions until after Operation Goodwood, neither the 131st Infantry Brigade nor the balanced divisional <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion were employed well.|$|E
5|$|Eleven Ottoman {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} forced to retire, suffering 28,443 casualties; some 12,000 prisoners were captured, 100 guns, and scores of machine guns were also captured. Now the Ottoman Army needed to deploy troops from other theatres to make up for these significant losses. On 15 December the Ottoman 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division arrived in Palestine and became the <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> the XXII Corps before taking part in the counterattacks of 27 December. The 1st Infantry Division arrived from the Caucasus and moved to Nablus in reserve. A significant consequence of the Ottoman Empire's firm focus on the Levant was that the British recapture of Baghdad and the British offensive in Mesopotamia became more viable and secure.|$|E
