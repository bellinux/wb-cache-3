5000|$|... "Double parking" [...] means {{standing}} or parking {{a vehicle}} on the <b>roadway</b> <b>side</b> {{of a vehicle}} already stopped, standing or parked at the curb. This often prevents some of the vehicles {{in the first row}} from departing and always obstructs a traffic lane or bike lane (to the extent of often making the street impassable in one-way single-lane situations). In some areas, people double parking their cars leave the hand brake off, allowing the drivers of the cars next to the curb to push the double parked car a little forward or backward, in order to allow departing from the parking spot. Double parking in this fashion, where illegal, is often punished by ticketing or towing the offending vehicle.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to realize the high {{function}} of an electric wheelchair with the consideration of the driving environment. The orientation sensor is used to comprehend the driving environment. The estimated method can be obtained unknown parameters of the driving environment by the orientation sensor. The developed electric-wheelchair operates by the force-feedback joystick. When the marketed wheelchairs drive on the slope or the side-slope, the wheelchairs flow to the slope lower direction. In this case, the wheelchairs might go to <b>roadway</b> <b>side</b> in JAPAN, and such situations are very dangerous. The force-feedback joystick is developed to avoid dangerous situation. The force-feedback joystick is combined with the orientation sensor to the force feedback of joystick. The effectiveness of the force-feedback joystick is confirmed by comparison experiments with the control performance of the wheelchair without the force feedback. Therefore, this study is expected to be useful to social welfare in the future...|$|E

A heap of bricks and mortar lay in the <b>roadway</b> on each <b>side</b> of a breach in the newly built wall, over which Lady Brandon, from her eminence on horseback, could see, coming towards her across the pleasure ground, a column of about thirty persons. They marched three abreast in good order and in silence; the expression of all except a few mirthful faces being that of devotees fulfilling a rite. The gravity of the procession was deepened by the appearance of a clergyman in its ranks, which were composed of men of the middle class, and a few workmen carrying a banner inscribed THE SOIL or ENGLAND THE BIRTHRIGHT OF ALL HER PEOPLE. There were also four women, upon whom Lady Brandon looked with intense indignation and contempt. None of the men of the neighborhood had dared to join; they stood in the road whispering, and occasionally venturing to laugh at the jests of a couple of tramps who had stopped to see the fun, and who cared nothing for Sir Charles.|$|R

He had conceived the brilliant idea of abandoning Portsmouth, or at least giving up the straight way to his fellow-wayfarers, and of striking out boldly to the left, eastward. He did not dare to stop at any of the inviting public-houses in the main street of Haslemere, but turned up a side way and found a little beer-shop, the Good Hope, wherein to refresh himself. And there he ate and gossipped condescendingly with an aged labourer, assuming the while for his own private enjoyment the attributes of a Lost Heir, and afterwards mounted and rode on towards Northchapel, a place which a number of finger-posts conspired to boom, but which some insidious turning prevented him from attaining.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{bridge is}} of the Burr Truss design, which was {{patented}} by Theodore Burr, brother of U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr, in 1817. [...] The bridge spans a length of 204 ft across the river, making the bridge the longest still-standing covered bridge in Virginia. [...] Two stone abutments, which extend ten feet below the riverbed, support the bridge {{on the sides of}} the river. The rock used in the abutments was gathered from local quarries. The bridge consists of two arches on each side spanning the length of the bridge and joining the abutments 8 ft below the top of the abutments' stone construction. The arches are constructed of three sections each of 7 in by 15 in timbers bolted together. The vertical truss supports and horizontal roof supports are composed of 8 in by 10 in lumber. The diagonal truss supports are 7 in by 9 in timbers. Originally, the floor supports consisted of two 7 in by 12 in beams along the length of the bridge and 4 in by 14 in beams supporting the <b>roadway</b> running from <b>side</b> to side. The bridge was strengthened in 1937 with the addition of steel I-beams running along the length of the bridge and parallel to the roadway supports. A new road surface was also added at this time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge is}} one of Scotland's most notorious suicide spots: {{estimates}} suggest that more than fifteen people commit suicide there each year.

There are also normal SOS phones as seen on motorways nationwide. The bridge was brought into the media spotlight again after the death of two teenage girls who absconded from a nearby secure unit. In September 2011, work started to install suicide barriers {{along the length of the}} bridge to prevent future suicide attempts. Installation of the new barriers was completed by Amey Highways at a cost of £3.5 million. The vehicle barriers are also being upgraded. The new barriers being installed are H4a High Containment Vehicle Barriers. These works will also see the towers and the suspension cables being re-painted. Stage one of this upgrade started on 15 July 2013 and is scheduled to last for 12 months. Highway Barrier Solutions are undertaking the upgrade which will cost £6 million and whilst ongoing the traffic is being monitored by Bluetooth technology. There are detectors on the bridge entry points which feed live traffic reports to the Traffic Scotland website.|$|R
30|$|The {{techniques}} of stress relief mining in low-permeability coal seams and pillarless gob <b>side</b> retained <b>roadway</b> entry using Y-type ventilation and gas drainage systems {{were developed to}} control gas outbursts and applied successfully. However, as the mining depth increasing, parts of the gas drainage system are not suitable for mines with high gas emissions. Because larger mining depths cause higher ground stresses, it becomes extremely difficult to maintain long gob <b>side</b> <b>roadways.</b> The greater deformation suffered by the roadway is not favorable for borehole drilling for continuous gas drainage. To solve these problems, Y-type ventilation and gas drainage systems installed from a roof roadway were designed for drainage optimization. This system was designed based on a gas-enrichment zone analysis developed from mining the 11 - 2 coal seam in the Zhuji Mine at Huainan, Anhui Province, China. The method of Y-type gas extraction from different mine areas {{was applied to the}} panel 1112 (1) in the Zhuji Mine. The absolute gas emission rate was up to 116.3  m 3 /min with an average flow of 69.1  m 3 /min at an average drainage concentration of nearly 85  %. After the Y-type method was adopted, the concentration of gas in the return air was 0.15  %– 0.64  %, averaging 0.39  % with a ventilation rate of 2100 – 2750  m 3 /min. The gas management system proved to be efficient, and the effective gas control allowed safe production to continue.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{bridge is}} a {{stiffened}} suspension structure of an uncommon type, inasmuch {{as the main}} cables, after leaving the towers, are carried upwards to an anchorage in the sandstone cliffs above the bridge, instead of downwards, as is usually the case. The main span is of 226 ft feet centres, carried by suspension rods from the cables, {{of which there are}} fourteen {{on either side of the}} bridge. The cables have socketed end connections secured to steel girders in anchorages cut out of the solid rock and accessible for inspection. The stiffening trusses are of steel, hinged at the towers and also at the centre, to allow for the rise and fall of the cables due to temperature changes. The roadway is of timber planking, 15 ft feet wide between kerbs, carried on timber stringers and cross girders. In addition to the main span there are seven timber approach spans, built on a curve to meet the <b>roadway</b> on either <b>side</b> of the river. The approaches include a considerable retaining wall on the Maldon side. The materials required have been supplied under various contracts. The cables were imported, the steel and ironwork in stiffening trusses etc. manufactured by Clyde Engineering Company, and the timber supplied by various firms.

From just northwest of this intersection southeast to the new intersection with SR 157. A little later in the year, SR 2 was completed slightly to the southeast of the SR 157 intersection. By the end of 1946, US 76 was designated along the Clayton-South Carolina segment. By April 1949, SR 2 was shifted to an entirely different alignment west of Blue Ridge. The entire segment from Trenton to Villanow was redesignated as SR 143. The entire Villanow-Dalton segment was redesignated as SR 201. SR 2's new western terminus was at US 27/SR 1 in Chickamauga Park. It traveled through Ringgold and intersected SR 71 in Varnell. It went northeast to US 411/SR 61 in Cisco. It took a winding path through the Chattahoochee National Forest and intersected SR 5 northwest of Blue Ridge. The two highways traveled concurrently into Blue Ridge, where it resumed its former alignment. The entire Chickamauga Park-Ringgold segment, and the SR 5 concurrency, was hard surfaced. From Ringgold to the Whitfield-Murray county line, and from east of Cisco to northwest of Blue Ridge, the highway had a sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth surface. From the Whitfield-Murray county line to east of Cisco, the highway was machine graded and maintained.|$|R
