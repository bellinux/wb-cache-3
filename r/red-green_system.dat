Measurements {{of unique}} hues and L to M cone ratios {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} variations in the color-opponent sites with eccentricity and among individuals due to differences in: 1) spectral sensitivities of the cone photopigments; 2) the relative numbers of L, M, and S cones; and 3) neural mechanisms. MstfaoflSi Foveal unique yellow and L to M cone ratio were measured for 10 color normal individuals. For two observers, L to M cone ratio and unique yellow, blue, and green were measured at the fovea and at eccentric locations (nasal 2, 7, 28 deg and temporal 2, 7, 17, 28 deg). S cone numerosity at each location was estimated {{on the basis of}} anatomical results (Curcio et al., 1991). Results, Measurements are consistent with a constant L to M cone ratio with eccentricity. For the <b>red-green</b> <b>system,</b> each individual's unique yellow and unique blue are constant with eccentricity. For the yellow-blue system, each individual's unique green, dependent on quantum catches in L, M, and S cones, is constant with eccentricity, except in the central (± 2 deg) region where S cone density rapidly changes. Conclusions. Individual variability in unique yellow (20 nm) is too large to be due to differences in cone spectral sensitivity alone. In our sample of 10 observers, individual differences in cone ratios are sufficient to account for individual differences in unique yellow if, in addition, differences of no more than 3 - 4 run in X max of the L or M cone pigments are assumed. Cone ratios and unique hues are invariant with eccentricity for the <b>red-green</b> <b>system</b> but not for the yellow-blue...|$|E
40|$|The human {{visual system}} shows a {{relatively}} greater response to low spatial frequencies of chromatic spatial modulation than to luminance spatial modulation [1]. However, previous work [2, 3] {{has shown that}} this differential sensitivity to low spatial frequencies is not reflected in any differential luminance and chromatic content of general natural scenes. This {{is contrary to the}} prevailing assumption that the spatial properties of human vision ought to reflect the structure of natural scenes [4 – 6]. Now, colorimetric measures of scenes suggest that red-green (and perhaps blue-yellow) color discrimination in primates is particularly suited to the encoding of specific scenes: reddish or yellowish objects on a background of leaves [7 – 10]. We therefore ask whether the spatial, as well as chromatic, properties of such scenes are matched to the different spatial-encoding properties of color and luminance modulation in human vision. We show that the spatiochromatic properties of a wide class of scenes, which contain reddish objects (e. g., fruit) on a background of leaves, correspond well to the properties of the red-green (but not blue-yellow) systems in human vision, at viewing distances commensurate with typical grasping distance. This implies that the <b>red-green</b> <b>system</b> is particularly suited to encoding both the spatial and the chromatic structure of such scenes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{evaluates the}} effect of {{illuminant}} changes along the two post-receptoral mechanisms: red–green (L− 2 M) and yellow–blue (L+M−S). By means of a CRT colour monitor, Mondrian-type scenes were simulated {{and a series of}} asymmetric colour matches were made with five test illuminants. The standard objects comprising the scenes were simulations of surfaces under equal-energy illuminant and were selected according to lines of equal excitation of the red–green and the yellow–blue mechanisms. Results show that observers’ matches are well predicted by assuming affine transformations between test and standard illuminant conditions. The best linear fits derived from the data corroborates the previous heuristic-based algorithms [Zaidi Q. (1998) Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 7, 1767 – 1776] although some discrepancies were found. Results along red–green mechanism confirm that the significant effect of the illuminant is an additive change along this axis, while data for yellow–blue mechanism suggest that illuminant induces not only multiplicative changes along this axis but additive too. In addition, we found that memory factors involved in the experiment could influence the observers’ matches and would be taken into account as responsible of the differences found between the yellow–blue and the <b>red–green</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite the evolvement of an {{extensive}} {{literature on the}} economics of smuggling, the evasion of customs duties under the common <b>red-green</b> channel <b>system</b> has failed to attract any theoretical attention. The present paper develops a simple three-passenger-type model to examine the passenger's decision of whether {{to pass through the}} green or red channel, as well as to derive the optimal inspection policy for a revenue-maximizing customs authority. The analysis reveals that if net revenue collection when inducing truthful declaration is positive, it is never optimal for the customs authority to provide incentives for passing through the green channel, although it may be optimal to provide incentives for cheating at the red channel. However, if the penalty for evasion is large enough to wipe out passengers' income, providing incentives for passing through the green channel may be the optimal policy.

40|$|Lennie, Haake, and Williams {{found that}} in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), parvocellular unit {{responses}} {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that their input connectivity is blind to the difference between middle-wavelength-sensitive (MWS) and long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) cones. Most of their cells have a total MWS input weight opposite in sign and similar in magnitude to their total LWS input weight. If these weights are exactly balanced, the construction of a <b>red-green</b> opponent <b>system</b> from such units is simple: such units need only be aligned so the signs of their outputs agree. Ahumada and Mulligan described an associative learning process which can accomplish this alignment. If the units are not balanced (carry some luminance information), the strong overlap between the MWS and LWS spectral responses can cause units to agree more on the basis of luminance, and the associative process fails to produce red-green opponency. The learning theory requires that the LGN units be nearly balanced (more strongly encode chromaticity than luminance) and quantitatively expresses the requirement: the principal component of the LGN outputs must be in the red-green rather than the luminance direction. We show that the cone weights of the monkey LGN cells measured by Derrington, Krauskopf, and Lennie can satisfy this learnability criterion even if the MWS spectral response is close to the LWS spectral response, simulating anomalous trichromacy. The learnability theory provides a source of visual system variation for explaining why different anomalous trichromats may make the same average anomaloscope match (same pigments), but have either narrow (good opponent learning) or wide (poor learning) ranges of acceptable matches...|$|R
40|$|The {{color vision}} of Old World {{primates}} and humans uses two cone-opponent systems; one differences the outputs of L and M cones forming a red–green (RG) system, {{and the other}} differences S cones {{with a combination of}} L and M cones forming a blue–yellow (BY) system. In this paper, we show that in human vision these two systems have a differential distribution across the visual field. Cone contrast sensitivities for sine-wave grating stimuli (smoothly enveloped in space and time) were measured for the two color systems (RG & BY) and the achromatic (Ach) system at a range of eccentricities in the nasal field (0 – 25 deg). We spatially scaled our stimuli independently for each system (RG, BY, & Ach) in order to activate that system optimally at each eccentricity. This controlled for any differential variations in spatial scale with eccentricity and provided a comparison between the three systems under equivalent conditions. We find that while red–green cone opponency has a steep decline away from the fovea, the loss in blue–yellow cone opponency is more gradual, showing a similar loss to that found for achromatic vision. Thus only red–green opponency, and not blue–yellow opponency, can be considered a foveal specialization of primate vision with an overrepresentation at the fovea. In addition, statistical calculations of the level of chance cone opponency in the two systems indicate that selective S cone connections to postreceptoral neurons are essential to maintain peripheral blue–yellow sensitivity in human vision. In the <b>red–green</b> <b>system,</b> an assumption of cone selectivity is not required to account for losses in peripheral sensitivity. Overall, these results provide behavioral evidence for functionally distinct neuro-architectural origins of the two color systems in human vision, supporting recent physiological results in primates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} {{the performances of}} the blue–yellow, <b>red–green</b> and luminance <b>systems</b> on a shape discrimination task. Stimuli were radial frequency patterns (radially modulated fourth derivative of a Gaussian) with a peak spatial frequency of 0. 75 cpd. Stimuli isolated the chromatic (red–green and blue–yellow) and achromatic post-receptoral mechanisms. We showed that in all cases performance, measured as a radial modulation threshold for discrimination between a circular and non-circular stimulus, improves with contrast. Performance was compared across radial frequencies with contrast matched in multiples of stimulus detection threshold. We find that blue–yellow color system performs the worse on this shape discrimination task, followed by the red–green, with the achromatic system performing best. The average difference is a factor of 2 between achromatic and blue–yellow performance, and a factor of 1. 7 between red–green and achromatic. Despite these performance losses, chromatic shape discrimination can still reach hyperacuity performance levels. In a secondary experiment we contrast modulate the radial contour to eliminate either the “corners” or “sides” of an RF 4 (square) pattern. We find that for the achromatic system, the sides are {{more important for the}} task than the corners. However, for the chromatic system, removal of sides or corners produces similar performance deficits. We conclude that color vision has a selective although relatively mild deficit for two-dimensional form perception...|$|R
