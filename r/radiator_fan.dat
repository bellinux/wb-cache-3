25|$|The diesel {{alternator}} {{sets for}} the carriages provided 3-phase 415-volt alternating current power. Only 1 phase {{was required for}} operation, so the other two phases were available for backup or for load-sharing across other carriages - useful because the ACN and BN cars required 28kW to operate and the BRN, with its additional functions, 40kW. To accommodate the extra load, the ACN and BN were upgraded midway through construction to a 35kVA supply, and the programming reworked so that the BRN would not power adjacent cars. If all alternators were off, then the cars {{was able to take}} power from an external 240vAC power supply. Around the same time as these modifications were made, the alternator set supports were modified to reduce vibration, and the <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> motors' thermal overload switches were moved to reduce unnecessary tripping. At the end of the modifications, the system was organised so that in event of a power failure, the batteries mounted under the carriages would automatically reroute all power to the lights at the ends of the train to protect from oncoming traffic. Those lights could function for over ten hours, at the expense of air-conditioning and other functions. The first six cars had plastic fuel pipes near the alternator units, but that was changed from car 7 onwards.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February, the [...] (DAK), {{was formed}} as the [...] (barrier detachment) to defend Tripolitania. After the Battle of France [...] 1940), the [...] (German army) began to {{increase}} the amount of armour on tanks, by bolting extra armour plates to tanks and most of those in Panzer Regiment 5 and Panzer Regiment 8 were of the modified type. The tanks were also adapted for desert conditions, with better engine cooling achieved by increasing the speed of the <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> and by cutting holes in the hatch covers of the engine compartment. Panzer Regiment 5 of the 5th Light Afrika Division arrived in North Africa aboard two convoys from [...] 1941.|$|E
2500|$|The top of {{the line}} models were named American GFS (Concord DL two-door), American ECD (Concord DL four-door), and Camioneta American Automática (Concord DL wagon). All three {{featured}} automatic transmissions, power brakes, power steering, [...] six-cylinder (258 on ECD) with new-for-the-year Motorcraft two-barrel carburetor and 8.0:1 compression ratio, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio, light group (courtesy, ashtray, glovebox, hood and trunk; the last one unavailable on the wagon), custom steering wheel, woodgrain panels on dashboard, parcel shelf, clock, retractable seat belts, luxury upholstery, tinted windshield, bright molding package (wheel arches, drip rails, rocker panels, front hood edge, hood ornament), engine displacement [...] "4.6" [...] emblems ("4.2" [...] on ECD), wheel covers, and bumper guards. The GFS model included a floor-shift transmission and reclining individual high-back seats, while the ECD and automatic wagon had column-shift coupled with a bench front seat. Both sedan models incorporated vinyl roof either in full form (ECD) or Landau type (GFS). The most unusual looking of these models in contrast with AMC's versions was the GFS model as it incorporated the flip-open rear side opera windows and the targa band used in the 1977 AMC Hornet AMX models (the same treatment used in the Hornet-based 1977 VAM American GFS). The optional equipment list on these models included air conditioning system with heavy duty cooling (seven-blade flexible fan, three-line <b>radiator,</b> <b>fan</b> shroud, coolant recovery tank and 55 amp alternator), reading dome light, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, and rear defroster.|$|E

50|$|They {{also had}} four <b>radiator</b> <b>fans</b> {{at the center}} of the unit next to each other in line on the roof instead of two at each end. This {{external}} feature was the result of a major change in internal arrangement, the replacement of all mechanical and belt-drives for <b>radiator</b> <b>fans</b> and traction motor blowers with electric motors. Power for these accessories was produced by a new D14 three phase alternator built into the main DC generator, called a “companion alternator”. This device has been used in all later EMD road locomotives to the present.|$|R

40|$|In the past, {{comprehensive}} {{investigations have}} been made by the automobile industry and government institutions to develop new <b>radiator</b> <b>fans</b> of different geometry which generate lower noise and lower aerodynamic loss. These efforts have been conducted promarily in an empirical manner. More controlled and effective approaches are possible using modern computational methods to be described during this presentation. As a first step in the evolution of such modern analysis, an Aeroacoustic Singularity Method combined with an Optimization Code was developed at the Institute of Design Aerodynamics. This permitted conducting a research study supported by the AEG company, Germany, to improve conventional car <b>radiator</b> <b>fans.</b> In the case of periodic signals, the singularity method employs a lifting surface approach for both aerodynamics and acoustics.

50|$|The {{prototype}} was refined {{during the}} second half of 1917, but the Renault FT remained plagued by <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> belt problems throughout the war. Only 84 were produced in 1917, but 2,697 were delivered to the French army before the Armistice.|$|E
50|$|Devin {{designed}} a new body {{specifically for the}} car. The front-mounted radiator was angled forward, and the car did not come with a <b>radiator</b> <b>fan,</b> which combined to permit an extremely low nose. While early bodies had a rounded rear, later versions had a raised and flattened rear with room for a license plate. Later cars also had enlarged headlamp buckets.|$|E

50|$|Panther {{crews were}} aware of the weak side armour and made augmentations by hanging track links or spare {{roadwheels}} onto the turret and/or the hull sides. The rear hull top armour was only 16 mm thick, and had two <b>radiator</b> <b>fans</b> and four air intake louvres over the engine compartment that were vulnerable to strafing by aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The roof {{is a more}} {{reliable}} indication; FTs had four exhaust stacks along the centerline (flanked by boxy structures if dynamic brakes were included). The <b>radiator</b> <b>fans</b> were recessed within the carbody, and arranged in two pairs, one near {{each end of the}} locomotive. Later units have the fans grouped together, and their shrouding extended atop the roof.|$|R
50|$|Other factors {{influence}} {{the temperature of}} the engine, including radiator size and the type of <b>radiator</b> <b>fan.</b> The size of the radiator (and thus its cooling capacity) is chosen such that it can keep the engine at the design temperature under the most extreme conditions a vehicle is likely to encounter (such as climbing a mountain whilst fully loaded on a hot day).|$|E
50|$|The engine (with {{electric}} starter) {{is connected}} to the hydraulic transmission by a torsionally flexible clutch and a short articulated drive shaft. The reversing gear is directly connected to the hydraulic transmission and drives the jack shaft. The torque is transmitted by side rods to the wheels. A belt drive from the engine drives the <b>radiator</b> <b>fan,</b> the air compressor and the alternator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} way of engine rating {{is what is}} known as the brake power, {{measured}} at the flywheel, and given in kilowatts (metric) or horsepower (Imperial/USA). This is the actual mechanical power output of the engine in a usable and complete form. The term [...] "brake" [...] comes from the use of a brake in a dynamometer test to load the engine. For accuracy, it is important to understand what is meant by usable and complete. For example, for a car engine, apart from friction and thermodynamic losses inside the engine, power is absorbed by the water pump, alternator, and <b>radiator</b> <b>fan,</b> thus reducing the power available at the flywheel to move the car along. Power is also absorbed by the power steering pump and air conditioner (if fitted), but these are not installed for a power output test or calculation. Power output varies slightly according to the energy value of the fuel, the ambient air temperature and humidity, and the altitude. Therefore, there are agreed standards in the USA and Europe on the fuel to use when testing, and engines are rated at 25 ⁰C (Europe), and 64 ⁰F (USA) at sea level, 50% humidity. Marine engines, as supplied, usually have no <b>radiator</b> <b>fan,</b> and often no alternator. In such cases the quoted power rating does not allow for losses in the <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> and alternator. The SAE in USA, and the ISO in Europe publish standards on exact procedures, and how to apply corrections for deviating conditions like high altitude.|$|E
50|$|Engine-driven {{fans are}} often {{regulated}} by a viscous-drive clutch from the drivebelt, which slips {{and reduces the}} fan speed at low temperatures. This improves fuel efficiency by not wasting power on driving the fan unnecessarily. On modern vehicles, further regulation of cooling rate is provided by either variable speed or cycling <b>radiator</b> <b>fans.</b> Electric fans are controlled by a thermostatic switch or the engine control unit. Electric fans also {{have the advantage of}} giving good airflow and cooling at low engine revs or when stationary, such as in slow-moving traffic.|$|R
25|$|The main {{alternator}} is a Brush BA1006A type, providing {{power for}} the traction motors via rectification circuits to DC, the auxiliary alternator is Brush BAA 702A Auxiliary Alternator, providing {{power for the}} <b>radiator</b> <b>fans,</b> lubrication and fuel oil pumps, traction motor cooling fans and air compressors amongst others. The main and auxiliary alternators are both driven by the main engine.|$|R
2500|$|These {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} improved engine blocks, larger turbochargers, and two-speed <b>radiator</b> <b>fans</b> which {{were expected to}} improve cooling and reliability. [...] The four UP units, but not the five BN locomotives, were fitted with an extended long hood, about [...] longer, to take enlarged radiators. [...] Instead of the standard seven access doors under the radiators, the units had eight.|$|R
5000|$|When Fiat began {{marketing}} the Fiat 128 in 1969 [...] - [...] with its engine and gearbox situated in an in-line, transverse front-drive layout, combined unequal drive shafts, MacPherson strut suspension and an electrically controlled <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> [...] - [...] {{it became the}} layout adopted by virtually every other manufacturer {{in the world for}} front-wheel drive. The approach of unequal drive shafts was crafted by Dante Giacosa.|$|E
50|$|A test {{standard}} by Italian CUNA (Commissione Tecnica per l'Unificazione nell'Automobile, Technical Commission for Automobile Unification), a federated entity of standards organisation UNI, was formerly used in Italy.CUNA prescribed that the engine be tested with all accessories necessary to its running fitted (such {{as the water}} pump), while all others—such as alternator/dynamo, <b>radiator</b> <b>fan,</b> and exhaust manifold—could be omitted. All calibration and accessories had to be as on production engines.|$|E
50|$|In 1983 the GL500 was {{upgraded}} to the GL650. Apart {{from the larger}} engine, the GL650 had a slightly different fairing mounts and front engine hanger mount than the GL500, and portions of the GL650 engine are painted black. The fuel economy of the GL650 was improved over that of the GL500 due to significantly taller gearing and {{the replacement of the}} CX/GL500's mechanical <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> with an electric fan.|$|E

50|$|They {{were called}} VentiPorts because the 1949 sales {{brochure}} noted that VentiPorts helped ventilate the engine compartment {{to minimize the}} engine overheating. The suggestion was made that they allowed air flow out of the engine bay. Air entered from the grille into the engine bay and was pressurized by the <b>radiator</b> <b>fan,</b> and exited through the VentiPorts. The benefit might have been true in early 1949, but sometime during the model year they became plugged.|$|E
