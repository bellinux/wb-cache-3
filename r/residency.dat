5|$|Emanuel's {{eligibility}} for office was challenged {{on the basis}} of his lack of <b>residency</b> in Chicago for one year prior to the election. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that <b>residency</b> for purposes of a candidate is different from <b>residency</b> for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.|$|E

As a consequence, it was limited to firing its attitude control thrusters and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments. After each crew <b>residency</b> ended, it was necessary for Progress and TKS spacecraft to boost the station into a high orbit so it wouldn't decay until the next <b>residency</b> began.|$|E

Shortly after, however, Lennon convinced fellow art school student Stuart Sutcliffe to purchase a bass guitar and join the group. The group had no bookings, but began rehearsing vigorously to allow the musical novice Sutcliffe practice on his new instrument.|$|E

5|$|Best was {{studying}} at the Collegiate Grammar School {{when he decided}} he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks, who later played in The Casbah. Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen. The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen <b>residency</b> at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel {{with the rest of the}} group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their <b>residency</b> and stormed out.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} the Greens were separated, Debora met Michael Farrar, {{a student in}} his twenties {{completing}} his last year of medical school.

In contrast, Green felt that Farrar was a stable, dependable presence. The couple were married on May 26, 1979. When Farrar was accepted for an internal medicine <b>residency</b> at the University of Cincinnati, the couple moved to Ohio.

5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the vast {{majority}} of medical residents in the United States were physicians who had recently graduated from a medical school in the United States.

All states require that an individual pass Step 3 of the USMLE or COMLEX exams and complete at least one year of <b>residency</b> training to obtain an unrestricted medical license; in practice, most practicing physicians complete their multiyear <b>residency.</b> While training, residents practice medicine with considerable autonomy under the supervision of attending physicians.|$|E

5|$|Kruger's second volksraad sat for {{the first}} time in 1891. Any {{resolution}} it passed had to be ratified by the first volksraad; its role was in effect largely advisory. Uitlanders could vote in elections for the second volksraad after two years' <b>residency</b> on the condition they were naturalised as burghers—a process requiring the renunciation of any foreign allegiance. The <b>residency</b> qualification for naturalised burghers to join the first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years, with the added criterion that they had to be at least 40 years old. During the close-run campaign for the 1893 election, in which Kruger was again challenged by Joubert with the Chief Justice John Gilbert Kotzé as a third candidate, the President indicated that he was prepared to lower the 14-year <b>residency</b> requirement so long as it would not risk the subversion of the state's independence. The electoral result was announced as 7,854 votes for Kruger, 7,009 for Joubert, and 81 for Kotzé. Joubert's supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount; the ballots were counted twice more and although the results varied slightly each time, every count gave Kruger a majority. Joubert conceded and Kruger was inaugurated for the third time on 12 May 1893.|$|E
