50|$|Politicians and {{religious}} leaders argued that gin drinking encouraged laziness and criminal behaviour. In 1729, Parliament passed a Gin Act which increased the <b>retail</b> <b>tax</b> to 5 shillings per gallon. With the Gin Act 1736 the government imposed a high licence fee for gin retailers and a 20 shillings <b>retail</b> <b>tax</b> per gallon. These actions were unpopular with the working-classes and resulted in riots in London in 1743. The license fee and tax were lowered significantly within a few years.|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the many {{problems}} perceived with the United States income tax system, four major tax reform proposals are being debated in Congress: the Value-Added Tax, the Flat Tax, the Unlimited Savings Allowance Tax, and the National <b>Retail</b> Sales <b>Tax.</b> Of these, the National <b>Retail</b> Sales <b>Tax</b> is the most different from the existing system. This article summarizes the first three proposals to provide background, and then analyzes the National <b>Retail</b> Sales <b>Tax</b> in detail. To illustrate the impact of the National <b>Retail</b> Sales <b>Tax</b> on individual taxpayers, three model scenarios were developed corresponding to major classes of the people who pay the U.

40|$|In this paper, I {{construct}} a new {{general equilibrium model}} of the United States economy that is better able to analyze energy and gross receipts taxes than previous models. Existing models in the energy literature fall into two groups: general equilibrium models of the entire economy with exogenous energy resource supply and partial equilibrium models of the energy sector with endogenous resource supply. I combine the main advantages of these two strains of the literature by incorporating endogenous resource supply in a computable general equilibrium model with highly disaggregated and flexible industry cost and consumer expenditure functions. My new model is able to analyze all the major inefficiencies caused by energy taxation, i. e. those related to production, consumption, resource rents, and externalities. In addition to its application in energy, my model is also ideal for looking at gross receipts and <b>retails</b> sales <b>taxes.</b> Gross receipts and <b>retail</b> sales <b>taxes</b> are important revenues sources for most US states and share {{many of the same}} issues as energy <b>taxes.</b> <b>Retail</b> sales <b>taxes</b> are commonly viewed as more efficient than gross receipts taxes because the latter apply to intermediate goods and thus result in production and consumption inefficiencies. However, in reality the <b>retail</b> sales <b>taxes</b> used by the US states are not pure consumption taxes, but tax many intermediate inputs while exempting many consumption goods. My model determines whether <b>retail</b> sales <b>taxes</b> are still more efficient than gross receipts taxes when these realistic factors are included. As an application, I use the model to analyze two tax reforms for energy or gross receipts taxes. First, President Obama's 2014 budget proposes to reform energy taxation by eliminating fossil fuel tax preferences. I find that the budget's tax increases for fossil fuels increase household welfare if the social cost of carbon emissions is over $ 15 per ton but otherwise reduce welfare. Second, I also use the model to examine a tax reform that replaces a typical <b>retail</b> sales <b>tax</b> with a generic gross receipts tax. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, I find that the gross receipts tax is more efficient than the <b>retail</b> sales <b>tax,</b> with an efficiency cost that is 6. 8 percent of revenues less than that of the <b>retail</b> sales <b>tax.</b> These results demonstrate that the predicted impacts of the tax reforms are significantly altered by the features included in my model: general equilibrium effects, flexible substitution, resource rents, and externalities...|$|R

At the time, the <b>retail</b> <b>tax</b> base in Long Beach was so poor the city was unable to support a shopping mall. In October 1990, Disney released a privately-commissioned study which projected that tax revenues within Long Beach would rise by $47 million and that Long Beach alone would see 23,900 new jobs, consisting of 12,400 directly employed by Disney and the rest indirectly from businesses supporting the new Port Disney. City officials were skeptical as the numbers were provided by Disney and {{did not address the}} cost of modifications to infrastructure, which were later revealed to include a request for $880 million in road improvements, made during an early round of negotiations with Disney. A year later, employment issues remained, with opponents wondering whether park employees would be drawn from and reflect the diversity of Long Beach residents.|$|E
