We derive an expression for the probability of false alarm and expressions for probability of missed detection in non-faded (AWGN) and <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>faded</b> sensing environments in terms of cumulative distribution function (CDF). Each CR transmits its decision about PU via noisy and faded reporting (R) channel to fusion center (FC). In this paper we assume that S-channels are noisy and <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>faded</b> while several cases of fading are considered for R-channels such as: (i) Hoyt (or Nakagami-q), (ii) Rayleigh, (iii) Rician (or Nakagami-n), and (iv) Weibull. A Binary Symmetric channel (BSC) with a fixed error probability (r) in the R-channel is also considered. The impact of fading in R-channel, S-channel and several network parameters such as IED parameter, normalized detection threshold, number of CRs, and number of antennas on missed detection and total error probability is assessed. The effects of Hoyt, Rician, and Weibull fading parameters on overall performance of IED-CSS are also highlighted...|$|R
