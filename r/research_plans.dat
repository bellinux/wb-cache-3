40|$|ABSTRACT The {{trend towards}} demand-driven {{agricultural}} {{research has focused}} attention on the inclusion of farmers in <b>research</b> <b>planning.</b> Theoretically, this should enhance ownership and increase the applicability of research. However, in practice, several tensions emerge {{with regard to the}} operationalization of such `user-driven <b>research</b> <b>planning</b> systems¿, and this paper aims to address these. The paper analyzes a public and private <b>research</b> <b>planning</b> system by means of a comparative qualitative case study approach focusing on institutional aspects of <b>research</b> <b>planning</b> systems. While the systems have different approaches, the tensions are quite similar, dealing with the different and often limited perspectives on innovation of the actors involved, different progress monitoring and output evaluation criteria, and information asymmetries between the actor groups which influence there capacity to successfully act in the <b>research</b> <b>planning</b> system. The analysis prompts the importance of synchronizing perspectives on innovation and capacity building among all actors to enable them to successfully operate demand-driven <b>research</b> <b>planning</b> platforms.

40|$|Abstract – When {{researchers}} {{develop new}} technology, {{the process of}} <b>research</b> <b>planning</b> does a critical role because <b>research</b> <b>planning</b> sets goal and the direction. Although it is essential, {{it is hard to}} accomplish because it contains complicated process such as scoping, searching, and evaluating. As the technologies are converged and rapidly changed environment, the role of <b>research</b> <b>planning</b> is more important. This paper proposes the systematic tool for the <b>research</b> <b>planning</b> process by integrating KM and CBR because future is uncertain and need more efficiency for <b>research</b> <b>planning.</b> KM supports the relationship between technologies and even market demands so that it uses the technology prediction, and CBR derives information from similar working environments efficiently. Through this approach, researchers can expect more accurate prediction and enhance efficiency. As a case study, this paper applies the integration model into TFT-LCD R&D(research and development) area, one of highly growing industries, in GRI(Government-sponsored Research Institute) ...|$|R
