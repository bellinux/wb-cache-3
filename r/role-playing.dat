5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} <b>role-playing</b> game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a <b>role-playing</b> system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a drag and drop inventory.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of development, Soma Bringer {{was to be a}} standard <b>role-playing</b> game. During early testing, it was seen that typical <b>role-playing</b> games were not well suited to the DS' limited hardware and controls, so they adjusted the gameplay to its current form as an action <b>role-playing</b> game. After positive feedback from this, the team went ahead. The move to being an action <b>role-playing</b> game enabled the incorporation of cooperative multiplayer: the team wanted to focus as much as possible on the combat and related gimmicks over environmental puzzles. Rather than a separate mode, multiplayer was incorporated into the main story. The development cycle differed greatly from previous Monolith Soft titles. In Takahashi's earlier games, the scenario was written first then the gameplay was tailored to fit. For Soma Bringer, the gameplay was finalized first, and the scenario was built around the locations, dungeons, and mechanics the team had created. Also in contrast to earlier Monolith Soft titles was the lack of lengthy cutscenes, which could not be incorporated into the game with the DS' limited hardware. Instead, the team used the real-time graphics and gameplay models for equivalent scenes.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{development}} in 1987, it was conceived by designer and writer Shouzou Kaga: {{he wanted to}} combine the strategic elements of Famicom Wars with the characters and story of a <b>role-playing</b> video game. Keisuke Terasaki acted as director and Gunpei Yokoi produced, while the music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko. The scale of the game meant that the team needed to find ways around memory storage problems, and make compromises with the graphics and storyline. While initial sales and critical reception were lackluster, it later became popular, launching the Fire Emblem series. The game would later be credited with popularizing the tactical <b>role-playing</b> genre in general.|$|E
5|$|Bunnies & Burrows (B) is a <b>role-playing</b> game (RPG) {{inspired}} by the novel Watership Down. Published by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1976, the game centered on intelligent rabbits. It introduced several innovations to <b>role-playing</b> game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-humanoid roles, {{and the first to}} have detailed martial arts and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by Steve Jackson Games as an official GURPS supplement in 1992.|$|E

5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei {{began as}} a trilogy of science fantasy books written by Japanese author Aya Nishitani. Published by Tokuma Shoten, the novels were a major success in Japan. The novels were first adapted into an {{original}} video animation (OVA), which retold {{the events of the}} first novel. Following the completion of the OVA in 1987, Tokuma Shoten decided to expand the series into video games. The license to develop a game based on Nishitani's work was simultaneously acquired by two companies; Atlus and Telenet Japan. The two companies were willing to work on the same project, but wanted to differentiate their products. As the Famicom was noted for action-based titles and PCs for traditional <b>role-playing</b> games, the two companies decided to respectively play against platform expectations. Two different game projects were created with Tokuma Shoten's supervision under the Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei title; Atlus created a traditional <b>role-playing</b> game which was published by Namco, while Atlus and Telenet collaborated on an action <b>role-playing</b> game which would be published by Telenet. The two versions were developed concurrently, although the version by Telenet was the first to be completed.|$|E

The games also won awards from several gaming publications. In March 2014, Bandai Namco reported that the series had sold more than 1.7 million copies worldwide.|$|E
