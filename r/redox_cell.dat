Here, the putative roles of Tre in regulation of ionic balance, cellular <b>redox</b> state, <b>cell</b> death were studied in Arabidopsis under high salt condition. Our results found that the salt-induced restrictions on both vegetative and reproductive growth in salt-stressed plants were largely alleviated by exogenous supply with Tre. The microprobe analysis of ionic dynamics in the leaf and stem of florescence highlighted the Tre ability to retain K and K/Na ratio in plant tissues to improve salt tolerance. The flow cytometric (FCM) assay of cellular levels of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and PCD (programmed cell death) displayed that Tre was able to antagonized salt-induced damages in <b>redox</b> state and <b>cell</b> death and sucrose did not play the same role with Tre. By comparing ionic distribution in leaf and IS (inflorescence stem), we found that Tre was able to restrict Na transportation to IS from leaves since that the ratio of Na accumulation in leaves relative to IS was largely improved due to Tre. The marked decrease of Na ion and improved sucrose level in IS might account for the promoted floral growth when Tre was included in the saline solution. At the same time, endogenous soluble sugars and antioxidant enzyme activities in the salt-stressed plants were also elevated by Tre to counteract high salt stress.

Here, we provide evidence that the response of mitochondria to the lysoPC-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + leads to activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase through a redox signaling mechanism in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. ERK activation was attenuated by inhibitors of the electron transport chain proton pumps (rotenone and antimycin A) and an uncoupler (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), suggesting that mitochondrial inner membrane potential {{plays a key role}} in the signaling pathway. ERK activation was also selectively attenuated by chain-breaking antioxidants and by vitamin E targeted to mitochondria, suggesting that transduction of the mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide signal is mediated by a lipid peroxidation product.
