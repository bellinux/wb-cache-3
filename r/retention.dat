40|$|In a {{frictionless}} milieu <b>retentions</b> {{should have}} no impact on investment behavior. However, empirical studies typically find that <b>retentions</b> are an important determinant of investment. Managerial discretion and financial constraints are two alternative explanations that have been suggested. This paper uses a panel of listed Scandinavian firms to examine the importance of <b>retentions</b> as a determinant of investment. Measures of Tobin’s Q, marginal q and sales accelerator are used to control for investment opportunities. Scandinavian firms are found to depend on <b>retentions</b> to a high degree, {{more so than in}} other developed economies. This high dependence on <b>retentions</b> suggests that the Scandinavian capital markets are suffering from allocational inefficiencies. Moreover, these market frictions appear too large to per se be caused by information asymmetries or managerial discretion phenomena. Possible institutional explanations are suggested. investment; liquidity; retained earnings; free cash flow; Tobin’s Q; marginal q...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} large versus small company performance, though frequent, have not {{produced}} a clear answer {{as to whether}} large companies outperform small companies or vice versa. This article highlights <b>retentions</b> - the fact that different companies have different dividend policies 2 ̆ 014 as a problem in that <b>retentions</b> obscure accurate measurement of a company 2 ̆ 019 s growth. <b>Retentions</b> obscure accurate measurement in that these funds are not costed, hence a high <b>retentions</b> company is getting cost free funds using conventional accounting and security analysis techniques, and, thus other things equal, will outperform a low <b>retentions</b> company. The <b>retentions</b> problem can be overcome by a technique that produces a company statistic called 2 ̆ 01 ccash equivalents per share 2 ̆ 01 d (CEPS). When CEPS is calculated for 771 companies, arrayed into 13 SIC industrial classifications, each containing a portfolio of large companies (over 1 billion in 1988 / 1989 sales) and a portfolio of small companies (under 200 million in 1988 / 1989 sales), then in every industry, the portfolio of large companies outperforms the portfolio of small companies. An additional feature of CEPS covered in the study {{is that in a}} competitive economy, the CEPS should show a benchmark growth of zero. The 13 portfolios of large companies all show a CEPS growth rate in excess of zero; only three of the 13 small company portfolios do this.

40|$|Pesticide {{residues}} in wine {{were analyzed}} by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. <b>Retentions</b> are modelled by structure–property relationships. Bioplastic evolution is an evolutionary perspective conjugating effect of acquired characters and evolutionary indeterminacy–morphological determination–natural selection principles; its application to design co-ordination index barely improves correlations. Fractal dimensions and partition coefficient differentiate pesticides. Classification algorithms are based on information entropy and its production. Pesticides allow a structural classification by nonplanarity, and number of O, S, N and Cl atoms and cycles; different behaviours depend on number of cycles. The novelty of the approach is that the structural parameters are related to <b>retentions.</b> Classification algorithms are based on information entropy. When applying procedures to moderate-sized sets, excessive results appear compatible with data suffering a combinatorial explosion. However, equipartition conjecture selects criterion resulting from classification between hierarchical trees. Information entropy permits classifying compounds agreeing with principal component analyses. Periodic classification shows that pesticides in the same group present similar properties; those also in equal period, maximum resemblance. The advantage of the classification is to predict the <b>retentions</b> for molecules {{not included in the}} categorization. Classification extends to phenyl/sulphonylureas and the application will be to predict their <b>retentions...</b>|$|R
