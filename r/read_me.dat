500|$|Crane was {{reunited with}} his partner, Cora, several days after the ordeal, and quickly wrote his initial report of the sinking while waiting in Jacksonville for another ship. Desperate for work, he soon left for New York to secure a job {{covering}} the impending Greco-Turkish War. Crane completed the story that would become [...] "The Open Boat" [...] a few weeks later, in mid-February. According to fellow correspondent Ralph D. Paine, Crane {{had the opportunity to}} show the first draft of the short story to Murphy when Crane again passed through Jacksonville. When Crane asked his opinion, Murphy allegedly replied, [...] "You've got it, Steve... That is just how it happened, and how we felt. <b>Read</b> <b>me</b> some more of it".|$|E
500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to <b>read</b> <b>me.</b> They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E
500|$|The {{band had}} been flooded with [...] "hyperbolic praise," [...] and deemed [...] "the next big thing" [...] by {{multiple}} media outlets. Before recording the follow-up to its debut, the band released the acoustic EP/DVD My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue. The EP was the band's first charting on the Billboard 200 at number 153. From Under the Cork Tree {{was recorded in}} Burbank, California, and served as {{the first time the}} band had stayed in California {{for an extended period of}} time. The group lived in corporate housing during the making of the album. In contrast to Take This to Your Graves rushed recording schedule, Fall Out Boy took a much more gradual pace while working on From Under the Cork Tree. It was the first Fall Out Boy record in which Stump created all the music and Wentz wrote all the lyrics, continuing the approach they took for some songs on Grave. Stump felt that this process was much more [...] "smooth" [...] as every member was able to focus on his individual strengths. He explained: [...] "We haven't had any of those moments when I play the music and he'll say, 'I don't like that,' and he'll <b>read</b> <b>me</b> lyrics and I'll say, 'I don't like those lyrics.' It's very natural and fun." [...] Despite this, the band had great difficulty creating its desired sound for the album, constantly scrapping new material. Two weeks before recording sessions began, the group abandoned ten songs and wrote eight more, including the album's first single, [...] "Sugar, We're Goin Down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not {{long before}} his death, Leskov {{reportedly}} said: [...] "Now they <b>read</b> <b>me</b> {{just for the}} intricacies of my stories, but in fifty years' time {{the beauty of it}} all will fade and only the ideas my books contain will retain value." [...] That, according to Mirsky, was an exceptionally ill-judged forecast. [...] "Now more than ever Leskov is being read and praised for his inimitable form, style and manner of speech," [...] the critic wrote in 1926. Many critics and colleagues of Leskov wrote about his innovative style and experiments in form. Anton Chekhov called him and Turgenev his two [...] "tutors in literature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lowell {{attended}} Harvard College for two years. While he was {{a freshman}} at Harvard, he visited Robert Frost in Cambridge and asked for feedback on a long poem he had written on the Crusades; Frost suggested that Lowell needed {{to work on his}} compression. In an interview, Lowell recalled, [...] "I had a huge blank verse epic on the First Crusade and took it to him all in my undecipherable pencil-writing, and he read a little of it, and said, 'It goes on rather a bit, doesn't it?' And then he <b>read</b> <b>me</b> the opening of Keats's 'Hyperion,' the first version, and I thought all of that was sublime." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 28 February 1923 Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik {{met again}} {{and went for}} several days to Petrograd together. In her 1956 book of memoirs Brik remembered:I came to the railway station and found him on the platform, waiting for me on the wagon steps. As the train started, Volodya, leaning on the door <b>read</b> <b>me</b> the poem About That. Having finished, he burst into tears, immensely relieved. Now, {{in the course of}} those two months I often had pangs of consciousness. Volodya was {{suffering}} there alone, while I lived an ordinary life, was seeing people, visiting places. Now I felt happy. For the poem that I've just heard wouldn't have been written should I have not chosen Volodya as my personal ideal and an impersonation of an ideal human being." ...|$|E

Geller said “This scares me.” and “I’m surprised because before this program your producer came and he <b>read</b> <b>me</b> at least 40 questions you were going to ask me.” Geller was unable to display any paranormal abilities, saying “I don’t feel strong” and he expressed his displeasure at feeling like he was being “pressed” to perform by Carson.

2500|$|The Tale of Genji is an {{important}} work of Japanese literature, and modern authors have cited it as inspiration, such as Jorge Luis Borges who said of it, [...] "The Tale of Genji, as translated by Arthur Waley, is written with an almost miraculous naturalness, and what interests us is not the exoticismthe horrible wordbut rather the human passions of the novel. Such interest is just: Murasaki's work is what one would quite precisely call a psychological novel ... I dare to recommend this book to those who <b>read</b> <b>me.</b> The English translation that has inspired this brief insufficient note is called The Tale of Genji." [...] It is noted for its internal consistency, psychological depiction, and characterization. The novelist Yasunari Kawabata said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech: [...] "The Tale of Genji in particular is the highest pinnacle of Japanese literature.

2500|$|Woolf trusted Sackville-West so {{much that}} she {{admitted}} during a trip to France that she had been molested by her half-brother during her youth, an experience that Woolf normally preferred to avoid mentioning. A somber Sackville-West wrote in her diary: [...] "After dinner, V. <b>read</b> <b>me</b> her memoir of Old Bloomsbury and talked a lot about her brother". It was largely due to Sackville-West's encouragement and her role as an amateur therapist that Woolf overcome, at least partially, the damage caused to her self-esteem by the sexual abuse inflicted on her by her half-brothers, allowing {{her for the first time}} in her life to have a satisfying erotic relationship as Woolf told Sackville-West that she was the first person who had caused her to orgasm. Woolf, who suffered from spectrophobia, had her mood so improved by Sackville-West that she purchased a mirror during a trip to France with her lover, saying she felt she could look in a mirror for the first time in her life.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, he {{attended}} the University of Madrid, first studying agronomy then industrial engineering and finally switching to philosophy. [...] He developed a very close relationship with painter Salvador Dalí and poet Federico García Lorca, among other important Spanish creative artists living in the Residencia de Estudiantes, with the three friends forming {{the nucleus of the}} Spanish Surrealist avant-garde, [...] and becoming known as members of [...] "La Generación del 27". Buñuel was especially taken with Lorca, later writing in his autobiography: [...] "We liked each other instantly. [...] Although we seemed to have little in common—I was a redneck from Aragon, and he an elegant Andalusian—we spent most of our time together... We used to sit on the grass in the evenings behind the Residencia (at that time, there were vast open spaces reaching to the horizon), and he would <b>read</b> <b>me</b> his poems. He read slowly and beautifully, and through him I began to discover a wholly new world." [...] Buñuel's relationship with Dalí was somewhat more troubled, being tinged with jealousy over the growing intimacy between Dalí and Lorca and resentment over Dalí's early success as an artist.|$|E
