Research also continues in the shorter wavelengths with this configuration of materials and the unit cell sizes are scaled down. However, at around 200 terahertz [...] issues arise which make using the split <b>ring</b> <b>resonator</b> problematic. [...] "Alternative materials become more suitable for the terahertz and optical regimes." [...] At these wavelengths selection of materials and size limitations become important. For example, in 2007 a 100 nanometer mesh wire design made of silver and woven in a repeating pattern transmitted beams at the 780 nanometer wavelength, {{the far end of}} the visible spectrum. The researchers believe this produced a negative refraction of 0.6. Nevertheless, this operates at only a single wavelength like its predecessor metamaterials in {{the microwave}} regime. Hence, the challenges are to fabricate metamaterials so that they [...] "refract light at ever-smaller wavelengths" [...] and to develop broad band capabilities.|$|E

50|$|Critical to {{understanding}} how an optical <b>ring</b> <b>resonator</b> works, {{is the concept}} of how the linear waveguides are coupled to the ring waveguide. When a beam of light passes through a wave guide as shown in the graph on the right, part of light will be coupled into the optical <b>ring</b> <b>resonator.</b> The reason for this phenomenon to happen is because the wave property of the light, or if we consider it in ray optics, it is because of the transmission effect. In other words, if the ring and the waveguide are close enough, the light in the waveguide will be transmitted into the ring. There are three aspects that affect the optical coupling: the distance, the coupling length and the refractive indices between the waveguide and the optical <b>ring</b> <b>resonator.</b> In order to optimize the coupling, it is usually the case to narrow the distance between the <b>ring</b> <b>resonator</b> and the waveguide. The closer the distance, the easier the optical coupling happens. In addition, the coupling length affects the coupling as well. The coupling length represents the effective curve length of the <b>ring</b> <b>resonator</b> for the coupling phenomenon to happen with the waveguide. It has been studied that as the optical coupling length increases, the difficulty for the coupling to happen decreases. Furthermore, the refractive index of the waveguide material, the <b>ring</b> <b>resonator</b> material and the medium material in between the waveguide and the <b>ring</b> <b>resonator</b> also affect the optical coupling. The medium material is usually the important one been studied since it has a great effect on the transmission of the light wave. The refractive index of the medium can be either large or small according to various applications and purposes.|$|E

40|$|Coherent {{optical signal}} {{processing}} systems typically require dynamic, low-loss phase changes of an optical signal. Waveform generation employing phase modulation {{is an important}} application area. In particular, laser radar systems {{have been shown to}} perform better with non-linear frequency chirps. This work shows how dynamically tunable integrated optical <b>ring</b> <b>resonators</b> are able to produce such phase changes to a signal in an effective manner and offer new possibilities for the detection of phase-modulated optical signals. When designing and fabricating dynamically tunable integrated optical <b>ring</b> <b>resonators</b> for any application, system level requirements must be taken into account. For frequency chirped laser radar systems, the primary system level requirements are good long range performance and fine range resolution. These mainly depend on the first sidelobe level and mainlobe width of the autocorrelation of the chirp. Through simulation, the sidelobe level and mainlobe width of the autocorrelation of the non-linear frequency modulated chirp generated by a series of integrated optical <b>ring</b> <b>resonators</b> is shown to be significantly lower than the well-known tangent-FM chirp. Proof-of-concept experimentation is also important to verify simulation assumptions. A proof-of-concept experiment employing thermally tunable Silicon-Nitride integrated optical <b>ring</b> <b>resonators</b> is shown to generate non-linear frequency modulated chirp waveforms with peak instantaneous frequencies of 28 kHz. Besides laser radar waveform generation, three other system level applications of dynamically tunable integrated optical <b>ring</b> <b>resonators</b> are explored in this work. A series of dynamically tunable integrated optical <b>ring</b> <b>resonators</b> is shown to produce constant dispersion which can then help extract complex spectral information.

40|$|A {{distributed}} modeling {{approach has}} been developed to describe the dynamic behavior of <b>ring</b> <b>resonators.</b> The model includes the effect of large amplitudes around primary resonance frequencies, material and electrostatic nonlinearities. Through a combination of geometric and material nonlinearities, closed-form expression for third-order nonlinearity in mechanical stiffness of bulk-mode <b>ring</b> <b>resonators</b> is obtained. Moreover, to avoid dynamic pull-in instability, the choices of the quality factor, ac-drive and DC-bias voltages of the <b>ring</b> <b>resonators,</b> with a given geometry are limited by a resonant pull-in condition.

As the light in an optical <b>ring</b> <b>resonator</b> completes multiple circuits around the ring component, it will interfere with the other light still in the loop. As such, assuming there are no losses in the system such as those due to absorption, evanescence, or imperfect coupling and the resonance condition is met, the intensity of the light emitted from a <b>ring</b> <b>resonator</b> will be equal to the intensity of the light fed into the system.|$|E
