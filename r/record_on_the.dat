2500|$|In an {{accounting}} sense, assets are <b>recorded</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left-hand side (debit) of asset accounts, {{because they are}} typically shown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left-hand side of the accounting equation (A=L+SE/OE). Likewise, an increases in liabilities and owner’s equity are <b>recorded</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right-hand side (credit) of those accounts {{in order to maintain}} the balance of the accounting equation. This means if [...] "assets are increased with left-hand entries, the accounting equation is balanced only if increases in liabilities and owner’s equity are <b>recorded</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite or right-hand side. Conversely, decreases in assets are <b>recorded</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right-hand side of asset accounts, and decreases in liabilities and equity are <b>recorded</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left-hand side". Similar is the case with revenues and expenses, what increases shareholder's equity is recorded as credit because they are in the right side of equation and vice-versa.|$|R

5|$|Paavo Nurmi Marathon, held {{annually}} since 1969, is {{the oldest}} marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest. In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957. Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi. A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987. The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively. The Nurmi bill {{was replaced by a}} new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993. In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the Paavo Nurmi Stadium. Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's <b>record</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 3000 m and Zátopek's <b>record</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 10,000 m. In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel Marathon Man as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi. The opera on Nurmi, Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream., written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000. In a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar.|$|E
5|$|Patras, on {{the northwestern}} {{coast of the}} Peloponnese, is claimed by the Chronicle of Monemvasia—a work of highly disputed {{accuracy}} and chronology, but an essential source for the period—to {{have been one of}} the cities abandoned c. 587/8 as a result of the Slavic depredations, its population fleeing to Rhegion in Calabria. This was followed by 218 years of independent Slavic rule in the Peloponnese, until around 804/5. The archaeological <b>record</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand shows Patras to have remained in Byzantine control throughout the period, although it is possible that part of the population indeed emigrated to Italy.|$|E
5|$|Ruffing had a 9–14 win-loss {{record with}} a 3.91 ERA in the 1933 season, as the Yankees {{finished}} in {{second place in the}} AL. He threw a one-hitter on June 20, 1934, against the Cleveland Indians. Two weeks later, Joe Cronin selected Ruffing for the 1934 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. At that point, he had a 9–3 win-loss <b>record</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> season. He finished the season with a 19–11 win-loss record, as the Yankees finished second in the AL. Ruffing pitched to a 16–11 record in the 1935 season, as the Yankees again finished second in the AL. His 3.12ERA was third in the league, behind only Grove and Ted Lyons.|$|E

5|$|The 1961 season saw {{the chase}} of Babe Ruth's 1927 single season home run record by Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. Both Maris and Mantle would {{continue}} to reach the home run record until Mantle got injured late in the season, leaving Maris to reach the <b>record.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{last day of the}} season, Maris broke the record with his 61st home run of the year off Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard at Yankee Stadium. Former Hall of Fame shortstop for the Yankees, Phil Rizzuto, called the shot in what was one of his first games as an announcer. The Yankees won the game 1–0 to win their 26th American League pennant and then to win their 19th World Series title.|$|E
5|$|The noise {{eventually}} {{stops and}} James {{returns to the}} house. After she explains what has happened, he finds his car ransacked and the blonde woman watching him from afar. His phone has also had its battery stolen and he realizes the house has been breached. The couple attempt to leave in James' car but a third masked stranger in a pin-up girl mask rear-ends them with a pickup truck, forcing them to flee. Back inside the house, Kristen and James find a shotgun {{and wait for the}} intruders in a bedroom. One of the strangers puts a country <b>record</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turntable, filling the house with music.|$|E

5|$|Although it was {{reported}} that 15,000 copies had been shipped, only 2,000 copies were sold in Tell All Your Friends first week of release. The album spent one week (at number 183) on the Billboard 200, and 68 weeks on the Heatseekers Albums chart, peaking at number 9. It spent 78 weeks on the Independent Albums chart, peaking at number 8, and peaked at number 23 on the Catalog Albums chart. Despite little airplay, Tell All Your Friends sold 110,000 copies by March 2003; {{near the end of the}} year, sales stood at 252,000. By April 2004 the album had sold nearly 400,000 copies, and by September 2005 it was certified gold by the RIAA. By May 2009, the album had sold 790,000 copies in the US. As of April 2010, the album has sold over one million copies worldwide. Tell All Your Friends is Taking Back Sunday and Victory Records' best-selling release. It would also become Victory's longest-running <b>record</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Billboard Heatseekers and Independent Albums charts.|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by {{his defeat}} to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became {{a series of}} {{experiments}} which he analyzed meticulously. Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance. He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics {{to a point where}} the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless. Nurmi set his first world <b>record</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921. In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m. A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile. His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since. Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record. After excelling in mathematics, Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola {{regained his}} German Grand Prix title at the Nürburgring at the 1928 German Grand Prix, driving the new 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SS. He shared the driving with Christian Werner, {{who took over}} Caracciola's car when the latter {{collapsed}} with heat exhaustion at a pit stop. The German Grand Prix, like many other races at the time, ignored the official Grand Prix racing rules set by the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (International Association of Recognized Auto Clubs, or AIACR), which limited weight and fuel consumption, and instead ran races under a Formula Libre, or free formula. As a result, Mercedes-Benz focused less on producing Grand Prix cars and more on sports cars, and Caracciola drove the latest incarnation of this line, the SSK, at the Semmering hillclimb, and further reduced his own <b>record</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> course by half a second.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Brooks dead-heated with Stockwell in the 100m {{freestyle}} at the Australian Championships, clocking {{a time of}} 51.12s. He then {{combined with}} Tom Stachewicz, Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong, as Western Australia won the 4100m freestyle relay for the first time. Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100m title, was selected for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he came second to Fasala in the 100m freestyle {{in a time of}} 51.01s. He claimed gold in the 4100m freestyle relay along with Fasala, Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw, anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games <b>record.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> return flight, he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television interview. In his memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time. In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} in {{the athletic}} competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle {{on his shoulder and}} a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national <b>record</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.|$|E

5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed <b>record</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E
5|$|Modern Vampires of the City was {{released}} by XL Recordings on May 14, 2013, and debuted {{number one on the}} Billboard 200, selling 134,000 copies in its first week of release in the United States.

The record entered the British album charts at number three with first-week sales of 27,805 copies, becoming the group's third consecutive top-twenty album in the United Kingdom. By December 2014, it had been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold 505,000 copies in the US. In 2014 it was awarded a diamond certification from the Independent Music Companies Association, which indicated sales of at least 200,000 copies throughout Europe.|$|E

On September 20, Kolb threw for 321yards and four touchdowns and went 20-for-29 passing in the 42–35 win over Mississippi State. He was named Conference USA Player of the Week for his performance. On October 25, Kolb accounted for over 400yards passing and 100yards rushing against TCU in a 62-55 loss to the Horned Frogs, only the fourth time this feat had been achieved in Division I-A. He tied the league record with 578totalyards, and earned Conference USA offensive co-player of the week honors for his performance.
