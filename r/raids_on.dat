5|$|Allied forces {{conducted}} many air <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> Japan during World War II, causing extensive destruction to the country's {{cities and}} killing between 241,000 and 900,000 people. During {{the first years}} of the Pacific War these attacks were limited to the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 and small-scale <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> military positions in the Kuril Islands from mid-1943. Strategic bombing raids began in June 1944 and continued until the end of the war in August 1945. Allied naval and land-based tactical air units also attacked Japan during 1945.|$|E
5|$|Australians {{participated in}} attacks on German defences in France {{in the weeks}} before D-Day. No.453 Squadron made four <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> radar {{stations}} in late May and early June, and RAAF pilots serving with British fighter and fighter-bomber squadrons took part in other such attacks. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons contributed aircraft to <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> radar stations and communications facilities in the week before the landing. These units also struck German coastal batteries along the channel coast on nine occasions between 8 and 29 May; Australians serving with British light bomber units took part in a further 14 <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> German batteries. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF light and heavy bomber units also participated in raids against German Army camps in France and Belgium during May. The Australian squadrons suffered heavy losses in several of these attacks, including seven aircraft lost during a raid on the 21stPanzer Division's facilities at Mailly-le-Camp on the night of 3/4 May. In addition to these attacks on German positions, Bomber Command struck the seven largest German munitions factories and ammunition dumps in France during late April and early May; the four Australian squadrons participated in five of these operations, and no Australian aircraft were lost.|$|E
5|$|From Sardinia, Italian Piaggio P.108 bombers {{attacked}} Gibraltar several times, {{mainly in}} 1942. The last <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> Gibraltar were {{done during the}} 1943 Allied landing in Algeria, when those bombers hit successfully even the Oran port.|$|E

5|$|In January 1942, {{together}} with Akagi and Kaga of the First Carrier Division, the sisters supported {{the invasion of}} Rabaul in the Bismarck Archipelago, as the Japanese moved to secure their southern defensive perimeter against attacks from Australia. Aircraft from all four carriers attacked the Australian base at Rabaul on 20 January; the First Carrier Division continued to attack the town while the Fifth Carrier Division moved westwards and attacked Lae and Salamaua in New Guinea. They covered the landings at Rabaul and Kavieng on 23 January before returning to Truk {{before the end of}} the month. After the Marshalls–Gilberts <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> 1 February, the Fifth Carrier Division was retained in home waters until mid-March to defend against any American carrier <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> the Home Islands.|$|E
5|$|In June 1953, the 2nd Battalion {{conducted}} {{a series of}} successful <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> Hill 412 and in November, the Regiment successfully counterattacked enemy units in the Numsong Valley and held their positions until the truce signing between all parts involved.|$|E
5|$|The Khazars {{resumed their}} <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> Muslim {{territory}} after the Abbasid succession, reaching deep into Transcaucasia.

5|$|The {{attack on}} Darwin in February 1942 marked {{the start of}} a {{prolonged}} aerial campaign over northern Australia and the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies. Following the first attack on Darwin the Allies rapidly deployed fighter squadrons and reinforced the Army's Northern Territory Force to protect the town from a feared invasion. These air units also attacked Japanese positions in the NEI and the Japanese responded by staging dozens of air <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> Darwin and nearby airfields during 1942 and 1943, few of which caused significant damage. These raids were opposed by US, Australian and British fighters and suffered increasingly heavy casualties as Darwin's defences were improved. The Japanese also conducted a number of small and ineffective <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> towns and airfields in northern Queensland and Western Australia during 1942 and 1943.|$|E
5|$|Today, most {{of these}} villages are {{inhabited}} by Kurds.

5|$|After the Marianas {{began to}} come under attack, the United States {{military}} stepped up its <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> the Japanese-held islands {{which could be used}} to launch <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> the B-29 bases. Particular attention was given to Iwo Jima, as it was correctly assumed that the Japanese aircraft which attacked the Marianas were flying from Japan and staging through the island en route to their targets. Following the first raid against Saipan in November, XXI Bomber Command B-29s were dispatched against Iwo Jima's airfields on November5 and 8. These attacks were primarily training missions and caused little damage. The first raid was unopposed by the Japanese, but the second was met by eight fighters which inflicted light damage on a B-29; this was the first combat damage suffered by any of XXI Bomber Command's aircraft. The Seventh Air Force also increased the number of B-24 Liberator attacks on Iwo Jima, and these attacked the island 30 times during November.|$|E
5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E
50|$|On 9 September 1940, {{a bombing}} <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> Tel Aviv caused 137 deaths. There was another <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> Tel Aviv on 12 June 1941 with 13 deaths, {{done by the}} Italians or by the French, based in Syria.|$|R

50|$|The last {{significant}} <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> Birmingham came on 27 July 1942, when around 60 to 70 bombers {{attacked the}} city. The very last <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> the city came on 23 April 1943 when just two bombs fell on Bordesley Green, causing slight injury, {{and the last}} air <b>raid</b> siren sounded <b>on</b> 15 May 1944.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the losses it had suffered, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had ceased to be an {{effective}} fighting force. Following a series of <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> the Japanese shipyard at Kure, Japan, the only major warships in fighting order were six aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and one battleship, none of which could be fueled adequately. Although 19destroyers and 38submarines were still operational, their use was limited by the lack of fuel.|$|E
5|$|As the Royalist {{situation}} deteriorated, the south-west {{became one}} of the few remaining Royalist strongholds. Lingen, with 200men and 90horses at Goodrich Castle, conducted <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> Parliamentary forces in the region, representing a continuing challenge. No action had been taken, however, to strengthen the castle's defences with more modern 17th-century earthworks, and the castle remained essentially in its medieval condition.|$|E
5|$|Australian airmen were {{involved}} in Allied efforts to delay German reinforcements from reaching Normandy throughout June. On the night of 6/7 June, 20 Mosquitos from No.464 Squadron were dispatched to attack German road convoys and trains in northern France. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons also participated in <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> French towns on this night. While No.463, No.466 and No.467 Squadrons mainly targeted railway facilities, No.460 Squadron formed part of an attack on Vire, which sought to destroy the town to prevent the Germans from using the roads through it. Following these initial raids, Bomber Command continued to target railway infrastructure in France {{in an attempt to}} disrupt the movement of German reinforcements to Normandy. The command operated intensively during the week after the invasion, and some Australian aircrew flew <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> consecutive nights during this period. Overall, Bomber Command made 16 raids against railway facilities in France between 13 and 30 June, of which six included {{at least one of the}} RAAF squadrons. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF units also took part in several attacks on German supply dumps and airfields during this period. Bomber Command made fewer <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> these targets than had been planned prior to the invasion, however, as its units were frequently assigned to strike facilities associated with the V-1 flying bombs the Germans were launching against the UK. No.464 Squadron also operated against German vehicles travelling at night and bombed railway yards, and flew 75 sorties between the nights of 7/8 and 12/13 June. Overall, the squadron conducted attacks on 19 nights during June, during which five of its aircraft were destroyed. The Australians in 2TAF's other light and medium bomber units also attacked the German lines of communication in France and occasionally provided direct support for the Allied ground forces throughout this period.|$|E

Æthelred and Emma's two sons, Edward and Alfred, went into exile in Normandy while their mother, Emma, became Cnut's second wife.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 16–17 April 1941, {{in one of the}} last major air <b>raids</b> <b>on</b> London, bombs {{repeatedly}} fell on the Waterloo area, and the LNC's good fortune in avoiding damage to their facilities finally ran out.
