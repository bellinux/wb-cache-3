Upon taking office, he was confronted with <b>redressing</b> the city's treasury, which had accumulated 8.2 billion Malagasy Ariary (approximately 4.6 million U.S. dollars) in debts under previous mayors, including Ravalomanana himself. Beginning 4 January 2008, Ravalomanana ordered water cutoffs at public pumps and brownouts of Antananarivo's street lights run by the state utilities company Jirama, due to 3.3 million ariary of unpaid debts to Jirama by the City of Antananarivo. Rajoelina responded by condemning the move as political and proceeded to undertake an audit that identified and addressed long-standing procedural irregularities and issues of corruption within the city's administration. Following a series of crimes against members of Rajoelina's inner circle in 2008 that comprised the burgling of his cabinet director's car, the kidnapping and ransoming {{of one of his}} special advisers, and the death of an assistant under mysterious circumstances, rumors spread that the Rajoelina administration was being deliberately intimidated by supporters of the president.|$|E

40|$|Collective <b>redress</b> congregates {{claims of}} a group of claimants with similar factual and legal issues {{together}} in one action. It is introduced in consumer litigation primarily to overcome the weakness of expensive and time-consuming court proceedings in small claims in order to increase consumers' access to justice. Compared to the common law countries with the class action tradition, collective <b>redress</b> in European countries is at an 'experimental' stage. The European Commission is currently examining existing collective <b>redress</b> mechanisms in the Member States, exploring effective and efficient means to address mass claims of consumers. During the process of the Commission's project in collective <b>redress,</b> a special question has gradually attracted stakeholders' attention, which is how the collective <b>redress</b> would work in a cross-border context. This article aims to examine cross-border collective <b>redress</b> from a private international law perspective. It introduces the European developments on collective <b>redress,</b> examines the theoretical and practical challenge brought by collective <b>redress</b> to the current private international law and evaluates the effect of the current European private international law in the future development of collective <b>redress</b> mechanisms, including classification, proximity, judicial proceedings in supporting the voluntary settlement, lis pendens, exequatur, effects on the third state and substantive rights. It is submitted that the current European conflicts regime does not fit the purpose of cross-border collective <b>redress.</b> The jurisdictional barrier to the future development of collective <b>redress</b> is not catastrophic though inconvenience, uncertainty and unfairness may exist in certain circumstances, but the choice of law barrier is much more fundamental.

25|$|Given the Singapore government's {{focus on}} efficiency, {{the country has}} been said to {{emphasize}} a largely green-light approach towards administrative law. Public administration is not seen as a necessary evil but a positive attribute, and the objective of administrative law is not primarily to stop bad administrative practices but to encourage good ones. In this approach, recourse to the judiciary is not the first line of defence against administrative abuses of powers. Instead, it is perceived that control can and should come internally from Parliament and the executive itself in upholding high standards of public administration and policy. In other words, instead of <b>redressing</b> bad government through the courts, good government should be sought through the political process and public avenues. Courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules and principles by which the Singapore government may abide and conform to the rule of law.|$|E

40|$|David Miller has {{provided}} {{one of the}} most fully-fledged and sophisticated theories of <b>redress</b> for historical injustice. In this paper we analyse his view and we demonstrate how his account of <b>redress</b> reveals some difficulties when it comes to offering <b>redress</b> for past injustices that are characterised by complex and interrelated structures, such as colonialism. This is because Miller would repair the colonial injustice through a ‘correspondence model of redress’, according to which <b>redress</b> should be obtained by identifying the type of reparations that corresponds {{to the nature of the}} past injustice at stake. By focusing on the case of colonial injustice, we show how a correspondence model of <b>redress,</b> like the one developed by Miller, is not fully equipped to theorise what <b>redress</b> for colonialism should amount to. The aim of the paper is not to prove Miller's theory true or false, but rather to point at some of the shortcomings that its application to real cases of historical injustice would run into. Despite its sophistication, Miller's theory does not acknowledge with sufficient depth the complexity of colonial injustice and its implications for thinking about <b>redress.</b> Such a complexity not only makes <b>redress</b> more difficult to be achieved through Miller's correspondence model but also it brings to the forefront concerns about the process whereby <b>redress</b> is reached...|$|R

In this book, Kathleen Daly explores major cases of historical institutional {{abuse of children}} in Canada and Australia. Drawing from first-hand accounts of survivors, the book documents their memories growing up in institutions and their experiences with <b>redress,</b> to examine whether justice interests - for participation, voice, validation, vindication, and offender accountability- are achieved. <b>Redress</b> for institutional abuse includes civil litigation, public inquiries, and <b>redress</b> schemes.

25|$|In 1993, then prime {{minister}} Brian Mulroney {{made an offer}} of individual medallions, a museum wing, and other collective measures involving several other redress-seeking communities. These were rejected outright by the Chinese Canadian national groups. After Jean Chrétien, in the same year, replaced Mulroney as {{prime minister}}, the Cabinet openly refused to provide an apology or redress. Still, the CCNC and its supporters continued to raise the issue whenever they could, including a submission to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and eventually undertaking court action against the Crown-in-Council, arguing that the federal Crown should not be profiting from racism {{and that it had}} a responsibility under both the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and international human rights law. In addition, the 1988 apology and compensation for the internment of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War was regarded as a precedent for <b>redressing</b> other racially motivated policies. The Ontario court declared in 2001 that the government of Canada had no obligation to redress the head tax levied on Chinese immigrants because the Charter had no retroactive application and the case of internment of Japanese Canadians was not a legal precedent.

500|$|In {{the early}} years of French rule, al-Kharrat was al-Shaghour's qabaday (pl. qabadayat), the {{traditional}} leader of a neighborhood's local toughs. The qabaday was informally charged with <b>redressing</b> grievances and defending a neighborhood's honor against local criminals or the encroachments of qabadayat from other neighborhoods. He was popularly characterized as an honorable man, noted for his personal strength, and protection of minorities and the poor. The qabaday was considered an [...] "upholder of Arab traditions and customs, the guardian of popular culture", according to historian Philip S. Khoury. Khoury asserts that al-Kharrat was [...] "probably the most respected and esteemed qabaday of his day". Qabadayat normally shunned formal education, and historian Michael Provence maintains that al-Kharrat was likely illiterate. Qabadayat were normally linked with particular city notables and could secure them political support in their neighborhoods. Al-Kharrat was allied with Nasib al-Bakri, a Damascene politician and landowner. The al-Bakri family was the most influential in al-Shaghour, and al-Kharrat served as the family's principal connection and enforcer in the quarter.|$|E
500|$|In California Motor Transport Co. v.

Certainly the right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition." [...] Today thus this right encompasses petitions to all three branches of the federal government—the Congress, the executive and the judiciary—and has been extended to the states through incorporation. According to the Supreme Court, [...] "redress of grievances" [...] is to be construed broadly: it includes not solely appeals by the public to the government for the <b>redressing</b> of a grievance in the traditional sense, but also, petitions on behalf of private interests seeking personal gain. The right not only protects demands for [...] "a redress of grievances" [...] but also demands for government action. The petition clause includes according to the Supreme Court the opportunity to institute non-frivolous lawsuits and mobilize popular support to change existing laws in a peaceful manner.|$|E
