5|$|Director Sean Penn's The Pledge (2001), though {{adapted from}} a very self-reflexive novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, plays noir {{comparatively}} straight, to devastating effect. Screenwriter David Ayer updated the classic noir bad-cop tale, typified by Shield for Murder (1954) and Rogue Cop (1954), with his scripts for Training Day (2001) and, adapting a story by James Ellroy, Dark Blue (2002); he later wrote and directed the even darker Harsh Times (2006). Michael Mann's Collateral (2004) features a performance by Tom Cruise as an assassin in the lineage of Le Samouraï. The torments of The Machinist (2004), directed by Brad Anderson, evoke both Fight Club and Memento. In 2005, Shane Black directed Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, basing his screenplay in part on a crime novel by Brett Halliday, who published his first stories back in the 1920s. The film plays with an awareness not only of classic noir but also of neo-noir <b>reflexivity</b> itself.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, a new postmodern {{movement}} arose {{led by the}} British archaeologists Michael Shanks, Christopher Tilley, Daniel Miller, and Ian Hodder, {{which has}} become known as post-processual archaeology. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical <b>reflexivity.</b> However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as historical processualism has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of <b>reflexivity</b> and history.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reflexivity</b> is best {{observed}} under {{special conditions}} where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena. Examples {{of factors that}} may give rise to this bias include (a) equity leveraging or (b) the trend-following habits of speculators.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} <b>reflexivity</b> {{provides}} {{an explanation of}} the theories of Complexity economics, as developed at the Santa Fe Institute, although Soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|His {{early studies}} of {{philosophy}} {{led him to}} develop and apply Karl Popper's General Theory of <b>Reflexivity</b> to capital markets, which he claims renders him {{a clear picture of}} asset bubbles and fundamental/market value of securities, as well as value discrepancies used for shorting and swapping stocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>reflexivity</b> {{attempts}} {{to explain why}} markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros' theories were originally dismissed by economists, but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the Journal of Economic Methodology.|$|E
25|$|Giddens, {{relying on}} his past {{familiar}} themes of <b>reflexivity</b> and system integration, which places people into new relations {{of trust and}} dependency {{with each other and}} their governments, argues that the political concepts of 'left' and 'right' are now breaking down, as a result of many factors, most centrally the absence of a clear alternative to capitalism and the eclipse of political opportunities based on the social class in favour of those based on lifestyle choices.|$|E
25|$|It is only by {{maintaining}} such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot {{themselves in the}} act of importing their own biases into their work. <b>Reflexivity</b> is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking down those guilty of 'vulgarity'. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. <b>Reflexivity</b> should enable the academic to be conscious of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.|$|E
25|$|Bartlett {{has contributed}} to the field of study the general theory of <b>reflexivity,</b> which investigates the {{properties}} of systems capable of self-reference. As Bartlett has described, there are many such systems, ranging from reflexive formal systems in mathematics and in mathematical logic, to self-referential systems in artificial intelligence and the theory of computation, to self-referential systems that are physiologically based — an advanced example being that of human self-awareness and the capacity to reflect on that awareness. Secondary applications arise in connection with breakdowns in reflexive functioning found in certain psychopathologies.|$|E
25|$|Steven James Bartlett (born 1945) is an American {{philosopher and}} {{psychologist}} notable for his studies in epistemology {{and the theory}} of <b>reflexivity,</b> and {{for his work on}} the psychology of human aggression and destructiveness, and the shortcomings of psychological normality. His findings challenge the assumption that psychological normality should serve as a standard for good mental health. He is the author or editor of more than 20 books and research monographs as well as many papers published in professional journals in the fields of epistemology, psychology, mathematical logic, and philosophy of science.|$|E
25|$|If {{a theory}} has a binary formula A(x,y) which {{satisfies}} <b>reflexivity</b> and Leibniz's law, {{the theory is}} said to have equality, or to be a theory with equality. The theory may not have all instances of the above schemas as axioms, but rather as derivable theorems. For example, in theories with no function symbols and a finite number of relations, it is possible to define equality in terms of the relations, by defining the two terms s and t to be equal if any relation is unchanged by changing s to t in any argument.|$|E
25|$|Any preordered set (P, ≤) forms a small category, {{where the}} objects are {{the members of}} P, the morphisms are arrows {{pointing}} from x to y when x ≤ y. Between any two objects there can be at most one morphism. The existence of identity morphisms and the composability of the morphisms are guaranteed by the <b>reflexivity</b> and the transitivity of the preorder. By the same argument, any partially ordered set and any equivalence relation {{can be seen as}} a small category. Any ordinal number {{can be seen as a}} category when viewed as an ordered set.|$|E
25|$|From 1963 to 1973, Soros's {{experience}} as {{a vice president at}} Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job; business was slack following the introduction of the interest equalization tax, which undermined the viability of Soros's European trading. He spent the years from 1963 to 1966 with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation. In 1966 he started a fund with $100,000 of the firm's money to experiment with his trading strategies. But he was principally motivated by a desire to assert himself as an investor to profit from his <b>reflexivity</b> insights.|$|E

These cosets may {{be described as}} the equivalence classes of the following equivalence relation: [...] if [...] is even. Here, the evenness of zero is directly manifested as the <b>reflexivity</b> of the binary relation ~. There are only two cosets of this subgroup—the even and odd numbers—so it has index 2.|$|E
