5|$|Silencing systemin did {{not affect}} the ability of black {{nightshade}} to resist herbivory and, when competing against normal plants, silenced plants produced more above-ground biomass and berries. Upon herbivory, systemin was down-regulated in black nightshade in contrast to the other peptides which are up-regulated after herbivory. By contrast HypSys were up-regulated and activated the synthesis of protease inhibitors. The down-regulation of systemin was associated with increased <b>root</b> <b>mass</b> but did not decrease shoot mass, demonstrating that systemin can cause developmental changes as a result of herbivory, allowing the plant to tolerate, rather than directly resist attack. Tomato roots were also affected by tomato systemin, with root growth increasing at high tomato systemin concentrations. By allocating more resources to the roots, plants under attack are thought to store carbon and then use it to re-grow when the attack ends. Overexpressing AtPEP1 also increased root and shoot biomass in A. thaliana.|$|E
25|$|Small trees {{grown in}} containers, like bonsai, require {{specialized}} care. Unlike most houseplants, flowering shrubs, and other subjects of container gardening, tree {{species in the}} wild generally grow individual roots up to several meters long and root structures encompassing {{hundreds or thousands of}} liters of soil. In contrast, a typical bonsai container allows a fraction of a meter for root extension, and holds 2 to 10 liters of soil and <b>root</b> <b>mass.</b> Branch and leaf (or needle) growth in trees is also large-scale in nature. Wild trees typically grow 5 meters or taller when mature, while the largest bonsai rarely exceed 1 meter and most specimens are significantly smaller. These size differences affect maturation, transpiration, nutrition, pest resistance, and many other aspects of tree biology. Maintaining the long-term health of a tree in a container requires a number of specialized care techniques.|$|E

Heads average between , with fast-growing, earlier-maturing varieties producing smaller heads.

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of biostimulant and substrate volume on scarlet sage transplants {{growth and development}} was examined in this investigation. There was one cultivar of scarlet sage used in trial which was transplanted in pots of two different volumes. Plants were treated with biostimulant (Radifarm) in concentration of 0. 25 % or left untreated (control). During the trial, root and above-ground fresh and dry mass were recorded. Treatment with biostimulant and bigger substrate volume showed good results by increasing investigated parameters. Investigation shows how biostimulant application to scarlet sage transplants production improves growth and development of <b>root</b> and above-ground <b>mass</b> which is important for faster plant adaptation to stress during transplanting. Key words: scarlet sage, biostimulant, substrate volume, <b>roots</b> <b>mass,</b> above-ground mass. ...|$|R
