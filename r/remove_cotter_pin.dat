50|$|In 1897, the company's founder Walter Hindley, {{automated}} {{the manufacture}} of <b>cotter</b> <b>pins</b> in a small shop near the Blackstone River north of Providence, RI. The company originally produced only <b>cotter</b> <b>pins</b> and then plumbing supplies. Currently, the company's main {{focus is on the}} various wire-hardware products mentioned previously.|$|R
25|$|A bowtie <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> is a formed wire {{fastener}} that resembles an R-clip, except it positively locks when installed. Rue S. Leitzke and Roman J. Baus first patented the bowtie <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> in 1999. U.S. patent #6,135,693 was filed on March 23, 1999 and issued to Leitzke and Baus on October 24, 2000.|$|R

50|$|A split <b>pin</b> (<b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> in American usage) {{can also}} be used as a shear pin.|$|R
50|$|Because all {{the load}} is on one very small {{area of the}} <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> and the crank land the <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> deforms plastically under normal use and so must be {{replaced}} regularly. If this is not done the crank and the spindle wear and must be replaced. There is warning because of a characteristic creak sound that aging pins cause the cranks to make.|$|R
40|$|Jaws on new {{insertion}} tool contain upset point and anvil. Point forces cotter-pin legs into loop as it engages anvil. <b>Cotter</b> <b>pin</b> before insertion consists of loop and straight shaft {{composed of two}} legs welded together as tips. After insertion, welded legs have been shaped into loop. Tool used to prevent bent loose ends of <b>cotter</b> <b>pins</b> from scratching workers' fingers or cutting and entangling wires...|$|R
50|$|A <b>cotter</b> is a <b>pin</b> or wedge {{passing through}} a hole to fix parts tightly together. In British usage <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> has the same meaning, but in the U.S. it refers to a {{different}} fastener.|$|R

50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and <b>cotter</b> <b>pin,</b> {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a split pin or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the <b>cotter</b> <b>pin.</b> Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|R

2500|$|On July 7, 2005, BC Ferries {{concluded}} that a missing <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> was to blame. The pin normally retained a nut on a linkage between an engine speed governor and the fuel control {{for one of the}} engines. Without the pin, the nut fell off and the linkage separated, causing the engine, [...] clutches, and propellers to increase in speed until overspeed safety devices tripped and shut down the entire propulsion system. The faulty speed governor had been serviced 17 days before the incident during a $35-million upgrade, and the <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> had not been properly replaced at that time.|$|R
50|$|A bowtie <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> is a formed wire {{fastener}} that resembles an R-clip, except it positively locks when installed. This keeps them from accidentally falling off or vibrating loose. It was patented by Pivot Point, Inc. on March 23, 1999.|$|R

2500|$|Spencer also {{invented a}} {{precursor}} to the modern paper clip, though it {{looked more like a}} modern <b>cotter</b> <b>pin.</b> This [...] "binding-pin" [...] was distributed by Ackermann & Company. Spencer shows drawings of the pin in Appendix I (following Appendix H) of his autobiography along with published descriptions of its uses.|$|R
50|$|A split pin, {{also known}} in the United States as a <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> or <b>cotter</b> key, is a metal {{fastener}} with two tines that are bent during installation, similar to a staple or rivet. Typically made of thick wire with a half-circular cross section, split pins come in multiple sizes and types.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} standards of crank interface, cottered cranks are now considered obsolete in Western countries, but are still in common use in China, India and other developing nations. The spindle is a cylinder, and has a flat region across it (a land). The crank has a hole through it to fit onto the spindle, with a transverse hole for the <b>cotter</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> is cylindrical with one side flattened {{at an angle to}} form a wedge to match the spindle land. When tightened, this produces a simple and effective interface. The problem is that normally the interface cannot be tightened enough without a cotter press, a highly specialized tool, though still produced and for sale. Cotters can also be installed with an improvised tool designed for another purpose, such as a ball joint splitter or hammer, with mixed results.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on safety wire at all, such as lock washers, locknuts, jam nuts, thread-locking fluid, castellated nuts and <b>cotter</b> <b>pins,</b> all of which accomplish the same objective as safety wire, which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|R
50|$|Steel-framework can {{be easily}} {{constructed}} of electrical conduit. One flattens {{the end of a}} strut and drills bolt holes at the needed length. A single bolt secures a vertex of struts. The nuts are usually set with removable locking compound, or if the dome is portable, have a castellated nut with a <b>cotter</b> <b>pin.</b> This is the standard way to construct domes for jungle gyms.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were many}} forms of {{fastening}} in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels and pins, wedging, mortises and tenons, dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, <b>cotter</b> <b>pins</b> or pin bolts, and [...] "clinch bolts" [...] (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.|$|R
40|$|Improved spring-tab {{lock washer}} offers {{alternative}} to such positive-locking devices as <b>cotter</b> <b>pins</b> and lock wires and to conventional split-ring lock washers. Does not dig into fastened parts with sharp edges; {{less likely to}} inflict scratches causing cracks. Contains three winglike spring tabs and three alignment pips, pressed into mating dimples in surface of part to be fastened. Spring tabs on lock washer allow only clockwise rotation (tightening) of bolt or nut...|$|R
50|$|A lanyard is a cord or strap worn {{around the}} neck, shoulder, or wrist to carry {{such items as}} keys or {{identification}} cards. In the military, lanyards were used to fire an artillery piece or arm the fuze mechanism on an air-dropped bomb by pulling out a <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> (thereby starting the arming delay) when it leaves the aircraft. Aboard a ship, it may refer {{to a piece of}} rigging used to secure or lower objects.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{drove on}} the second pair of coupled wheels. The locomotives were fitted with the single slide-bar type piston crossheads, popular in Europe but prone to rapid wear under South African conditions. The valve spindle crossheads were screwed {{to the ends of}} the valve spindles and secured with locknuts. Although this made adjustment easier, it was not satisfactory in service and was later replaced by the usual taper fit with <b>cotter</b> <b>pin.</b> With these two exceptions, the mechanical parts of the Class 19 gave very little trouble.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} claimed, though {{apparently}} without evidence, that Herbert Spencer, the originator {{of the term}} [...] "survival of the fittest", invented the paper clip. Spencer claimed in his autobiography to have invented a [...] "binding-pin" [...] that was distributed by Ackermann & Company, and he shows a drawing of the pin in his Appendix I (following Appendix H). This pin {{looked more like a}} modern <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> than a modern paper clip, but it was designed to hold sheets of paper together. It is approximately 15 cm unfolded.|$|R
50|$|For safety, it {{is common}} to mouse a {{threaded}} shackle to keep the pin from coming loose. This is done by looping mousing wire or a nylon zip tie {{through the hole in the}} pin and around the shackle body. For pins that have a cross-hole in the threaded end a <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> can be used. One disadvantage of wire is that mousing can introduce galvanic corrosion because of material differences; it is especially bad when used in places where the shackle is exposed to air and water. Nylon is not recommended for use where significant movement of the shackle is expected.|$|R
5000|$|Chicken {{eyeglasses}} {{were often}} made from celluloid or aluminum and typically consisted of [...] "two oval panels that fit over the upper beak of the chicken. A pin is put through the nostril to-hold the oval pieces in place." [...] Different designs were produced that {{attached to the}} chicken's head in different ways. Some were {{held in place by}} a strap, some by small hooks into the nares (nostrils) and some by piercing the bone septum between the nostrils with a <b>cotter</b> <b>pin.</b> Due to the piercing of tissue, this last type of design is illegal in some countries.|$|R
5000|$|The green {{detachable}} main circuit, {{mounted on}} the top of the robot is called the Board of Education [...] The microcontroller which plugs into a socket on the green circuit board is called the BASIC Stamp [...] The BASIC Stamp is programmed in PBASIC. The rear wheel is a drilled polyethylene ball held in place with a <b>cotter</b> <b>pin.</b> Wheels are machined to fit on the servo spline and held in place with a screw. The BASIC Stamp is easy to program. The Boe-Bot is small, approximately four inches wide, and runs on four AA batteries. It is well documented.|$|R
5000|$|... 7-122. GENERAL. The word {{safetying}} {{is a term}} universally used in {{the aircraft}} industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, oil caps, drain cocks, valves, and parts. Three basic methods are used in safetying; safety-wire, <b>cotter</b> <b>pins,</b> and self-locking nuts. Retainer washers and pal nuts are also sometimes used.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of clevis pins: {{threaded}} and unthreaded. Unthreaded clevis pins have a domed head {{at one end and}} a cross-hole at the other end. A <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> (USA usage) or split pin is used to keep the clevis pin in place. Threaded clevis pins have a partially threaded shank on one end and a formed head on the other. The formed head has a lip, which acts as a stop when threading the pin into the shackle, and a flattened tab with a cross-hole. The flattened tab allows for easy installation of the pin and the cross-hole allows the pin to be moused.|$|R

The major objective of the second part of this thesis is to design a crankset based on the research in the first half. One of the most important aspects of the design was to choose a suitable type of bottom bracket for non-competetive riding. Structural analysis using finite element method was done and the design was altered accordingly. In the end the process of manufacture was described...|$|R

40|$|A {{dexterous}} robot manipulator {{must be able}} to {{feel what}} it is doing. The mechanical hand of the future will be able to roll a screw between its fingers and sense, by touch, which end is which. This paper describes a step toward such a manipulator, an imaging tactile sensor with hundreds of pressure sensors in a space the size of a fingertip. The sensor was designed as part of a tendon-actuated mechan-ical finger, similar in size and range of motion to a human index finger (Hillis 1981). As a demonstration, the device was programmed to distinguish among several commonly used fastening devices&mdash;nuts, bolts, flat washers, lock washers, dowel <b>pins,</b> <b>cotter</b> <b>pins,</b> and set screws&mdash;by touching them with the finger and analyzing the tactile image...|$|R

It appeared to be of the usual harp-pattern with a <b>cottered</b> <b>pin,</b> and he called out sharply to the Siwash, who presently flung him an iron bar and a big spike. He struck one of the two or three sulphur matches he had carefully treasured, and when the sputtering blue flame went out set to work to back the pin out in the dark.
