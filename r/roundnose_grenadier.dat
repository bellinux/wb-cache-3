5000|$|The <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> {{sometimes}} forms dense shoals at {{depths of}} about 600 to 900 m. It makes a daily vertical migration, returning later to the seabed where it feeds on small invertebrates including shrimps, amphipods and cumaceans, {{and to a}} lesser extent, cephalopods and various fishes, including lanternfishes. The <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> is a batch spawner [...] and is believed to migrate to the vicinity of Iceland to spawn in late summer or autumn. The females reach maturity when they are nine to eleven years old and the males when they are rather younger. Up to 35,000 eggs can be produced at a time.|$|E
50|$|Coryphaenoides rupestris is {{a species}} of marine ray-finned fish in the family Macrouridae. Its common names include the rock grenadier, the <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> and the {{roundhead}} rat-tail. In France it is known as Grenadier de roche and in Spain as Granadero de roca. It is a large, deep water species and is fished commercially in the northern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial {{fishing for}} the <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> {{started in the}} 1960s. The former USSR, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic were the main {{countries}} involved, sending factory ships to undertake midwater trawls in the Atlantic Ocean. Catches peaked at over 80000 t in 1971. More recently, French and Spanish vessels have predominated and the total annual catch has been under 20000 t in most years since 1980. The flesh of the fish is white with a pleasant texture and is sold as seafood. In 2010 in the United Kingdom, the <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> was listed as a [...] "UK Priority Species" [...] for conservation purposes {{on the grounds that}} it is a long-lived fish taking many years to mature and that numbers were declining. It was suggested that if no actions to conserve the fish were taken, it would become extinct within the next 10 years.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> {{is found}} in the {{northern}} Atlantic Ocean at depths between 400 and 1200 m and occasionally at much greater depths. It tends to spend the summer in deep waters and the winter in shallower locations. Its range normally extends from Baffin Island, Greenland, Iceland and Norway south to the New England Seamounts and North Africa. [...] It is found on continental shelves and in the vicinity of seamounts and knolls.|$|E
50|$|Because {{little was}} known about the {{biodiversity}} of the New England Seamount Chain, an expedition was mounted in 2000. The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service deep water research vessel R/V Delaware II made 20 exploratory trawls {{in the vicinity of}} Bear Seamount and around 274 species were collected. These included 115 species of fish, some of which were rare or had not been recorded in the western North Atlantic before. The <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and the onion-eye grenadier (Macrourus berglax) were the only fish species of potential commercial importance - they were caught in mid-water at depths of between 1100 and 1800 m and were up to a metre in length. A common but much smaller fish was Aldrovandia phalacra.|$|E
50|$|The deep-water coral {{systems on}} the mounds are {{especially}} fragile. Unlike shallow-water coral reefs, {{they are not}} adapted to cope with minor disturbances such as wave action. The mounds also support significant populations of the xenophyophore Syringammina fragilissima. This is a giant single-celled organism (a protozoan) that is widespread in deep waters, but occurs in particularly high densities on the mounds and the tails. Individual xenophyophores can grow to be larger than 20 cm and are often very fragile. The corals themselves provide a habitat for a wide diversity of other marine life including sponges, worms, crustaceans and molluscs. Among these starfish, sea urchins and crabs. Various fish have been observed, including blue ling, <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier,</b> and the orange roughy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> is a {{deep water}} fish {{sometimes}} reaching over a metre (yard) in length. The rounded head is large with a broad snout, the abdomen small and the tail long and tapering to a pointed tip. At {{the front of the}} snout there is a blunt, tube-like scute or scale and there is a small barbel under the chin. There are three rows of small teeth {{at the front of the}} mouth but only one row at the back. The scales on the body are densely packed and covered with small spines. The dorsal fin has two spines and 8 to 11 soft rays and the pelvic fin has 7 to 8 soft rays, the outer one of which is greatly elongated. The general body colour is brownish-grey but the inside of the mouth, the orbits round the eyes, the gill cavities and the fins are dark brownish black.|$|E
40|$|<b>Roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Coryphaenoides rupestris Gunnerus) {{were found}} in {{reasonable}} concentrations in four areas in Trøndelag, Norway. Inside the Trondheimsfjord, within a 400 to 500 m deep basin, about 340 kg was taken per half-hour-tow using a bottom prawn trawl. Around 500 kg per half-hour was taken in a 400 - 530 m deep basin in the Flatanger-Folla area, while catches above 3060 kg per half-hour were taken in a 350 m deep basin in the inner part of Foldenfjorden. Only few specimens were taken by use of pelagic trawl. In the deeper basins outside the near coastal areas, the catch rates were found too small for commercial fishing. The age of maturity {{was found to be}} about 8 and 10 years for males and females, respectively. Natural mortality rate was estimated to 0. 1. The biomass in the four major areas was calculated to about 15 000 tonnes using echo-integrations combined with pelagic and bottom trawl sampling, and a sustainable yield of 2000 per year was suggested. The <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> was only found in waters with temperatures above 7. 0 °C. The <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> and the greater silver smelt (argentine), Argentina silus, were the two dominant fishes caught; the former accounted for 70 % to 95 % and the latter for 3 % to 25 % of the total catch...|$|E
40|$|Little is {{understood}} about connectivity of deep-sea fish populations. Analysis of the geochemical properties of fish otoliths {{is one way}} to draw inferences regarding their movements and habitat use in the marine environment. Trace element and stable isotope analyses of otoliths were undertaken to assess patterns of spatial and temporal population structure of a wide-ranging deepwater fish, the <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> Coryphaenoides rupestris. Fish were sampled from 4 locations across the distribution range of the species in the northeast Atlantic. Multivariate analyses of elemental ratios (Li/Ca, Mn/Ca, Ba/Ca, Zn/Ca, Cu/Ca) revealed strong geographic separation at each life stage, and an overall significant difference between life stages. Otolith oxygen (? 18 O) and carbon (? 13 C) stable isotope analysis indicated a depth migration (and reduction in metabolic activity) from relatively shallow in the juvenile phase to much deeper in the adult phase at all locations. The results suggest that <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> are comprised of geographically distinct population units that persist throughout their life-history, migrating deeper as they get older...|$|E
40|$|Tail {{breakage}} and regeneration in grenadiers has hindered accurate {{measurement of}} their total lengths. In 1980, the Scientific Council of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) adopted anal fin length (from {{the tip of the}} snout {{to the base of the}} first anal fin ray) as the standardized length measurement for both roundnose and roughhead grenadier. Linear relation-Ships between total length and anal fin length (more properly called pre-anal fin length) are available for <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier,</b> but similar relationships for roughhead grenadier in the Northwest Atlantic have not been derived previously. Analysis of data collected in NAFO Div. 2 J and 3 K in 1978 and 1979 indicate that total length (TL) and pre-anal fin length (AFL) are highly correlated for roughhead grenadier. Unlike in <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier,</b> no significant differences were found between the relationships for males and females. The combined relationship is TL = 5. 2320 + 2. 3455 * AFL...|$|E
40|$|Oceans {{function}} as a sink for organochlorine compounds (OCs) such as PCBs and DDTs. Deep-sea fish bioaccumulate OCs to levels 10 to 100 times higher than shallow-water species. OCs induce the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) system, the activity of which may increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in liver cells. However,, the susceptibility of fish to the oxidative stress likely caused by OCs remains unclear. We analysed whether PCB and DDT contamination of <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> Coryphaenoides rupestris was associated with higher ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity (CYP 1 A-related), and activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutases (SOD) and glutathione peroxidases (GPX). Biological parameters affecting EROD patterns (e. g. gender, ontogeny) were also investigated. Citrate synthase (CS) {{was used as a}} proxy for oxidative metabolism, responsible for basal ROS production and recruitment of antioxidant enzymes in liver cells. Hepatic OC levels were determined in individuals of different sizes (89 to 2016 g) from northern Atlantic slopes (depth range = 1000 to 1900 m). Median PCB and DDT values were 2. 39 and 1. 48 µg g - 1 lipid weight, respectively, while median EROD activity was 15 pmol min - 1 mg - 1 protein. Gender greatly influenced OC levels (females were less contaminated), whilst weight (linked to ontogeny) positively affected DDT levels. EROD increased with PCB levels, and to some extent SOD and CAT were more influenced by EROD than CS, indicating that PCBs strengly affect the redox balance of <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> liver cells through increased CYP 1 A activity. Therefore, 0 C-related CYP 1 A induction may be a major source of cellular ROS in liver of <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{deepwater}} trawl survey programme {{has been}} operated since 1993 by the Fisheries Research Centre (FRC) {{in the deep}} waters of the Rockall Trough and Porcupine Bank. The present survey took place {{over a period of}} 10 days in October and November 1997 on the eastern and southern slopes of the Rockall Trough from 54 °N to 59 °N. Fishing was carried out in five separate areas, in four depth strata: 500 - 700 m, 700 - 900 m, 900 - 1100 m and 1100 - 1300 m. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondrichthyan and teleost fish for the FRC deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis offish by the FRC chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagasc National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on a commercial trawler using commercial deepwater demersal otter trawl gear. In total 15 species of chondrichthyan, 41 species of teleost fish and 5 species of cephalopods were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier,</b> Portuguese dogfish, leafscale gulper shark, and Baird's smoothhead. Over the entire survey discarding was estimated as 50. 5 % of the total catch. Discard rates expressed as kg discarded per tonne <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> landed and {{as a percentage of the}} total catch when compared with those of previous years showed no appreciable change. The main species discarded were rabbitfish, birdbeak dogfish, Baird's smoothhead, <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> and Lepidion eques. Catch per unit effort rates expressed as kg caught per hour fished compared with rates for previous trawl surveys showed marked declines. Length frequency distributions for the main chondrichthyan species showed absence of smaller individuals from the samples and sexual dimorphism with respect to length. Attachment of fine-mesh cod-end liner suggested that the commercial gear selects all length frequencies present and that mesh size may not be an effective management measure in this fishery. This leaflet documents the survey and presents some preliminary results. The data from this survey are currently under analysis at the FRC and results will be published in the scientific literature...|$|E

40|$|The species {{composition}} of by-catch was {{studied in the}} Spanish Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) fishery, developed in the NAFO Regulatory Area in Div. 3 L, 3 M and 3 NO, for the period 1991 – 94. Of the 17 species occurring in the catches, two groups were identified as the more and less frequent species. The more frequent species with an annual yield of about 5 kg/hr were roughhead grenadier, <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier,</b> skate, American plaice, redfish, witch flounder and blue antimora. Analyzing the data {{on a monthly basis}} revealed some species such as grenadiers, skate and American plaice, particularly in Div. 3 N, did not change much while other species had increased yields in recent years. The characteristic species of the demersal fisheries (skate, American plaice) showed a wide bathymetric distribution. The transfer of effort southwards to Div. 3 NO in recent years, mainly in the case of small vessels, has meant variation in the composition and relative abundance of by-catch in this fleet. The proportion of each by-catch species was highly variable. Skate, American plaice, witch flounder and grenadiers were caught most frequently in both fleets. In the large vessels, however, blue antimora, redfish and <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> were more frequent than in the small vessels. The length distribution in the discarded proportion was analyzed for the two grenadiers, skate and blue antimora.

Comparisons by area and sex indicated some variability, possibly caused in part by differing habitat conditions.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results on}} the influence of geometric attributes of satellite-derived raster bathymetric data, namely the General Bathymetric Charts of the Oceans, on spatial statistical modelling of marine biomass. In the initial experiment, both the resolution and projection of the raster dataset are taken into account. It was found that, independently of the equal-area projection chosen for the analysis, the calculated areas are very similar, and the differences between them are insignificant. Likewise, any variation in the raster resolution did not change the computed area. Although the differences were shown to be insignificant, for the subsequent analysis we selected the cylindrical equal area projection, as it implies rectangular spatial extent, along with the automatically derived resolution. Then, in the second experiment, we focused on demersal fish biomass data acquired from trawl samples taken from the western parts of ICES Sub-area VII, near the sea floor. The aforementioned investigation into processing bathymetric data allowed us to build various statistical models that account for a relationship between biomass, sea floor topography and geographic location. We fitted a set of generalised additive models and generalised additive mixed models to combinations of trawl data of the <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and bathymetry. Using standard statistical techniques—such as analysis of variance, Akaike information criterion, root mean squared error, mean absolute error and cross-validation—we compared the performance of the models and found that depth and latitude may serve as statistically significant explanatory variables for biomass of <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> in the study area. However, the results should be interpreted with caution as sampling locations may {{have an impact on the}} biomass–depth relationship...|$|E

40|$|The Fisheries Research Centre has {{conducted}} a deep-water survey programme since 1993 {{and as part}} of this programme a deep-water trawl survey was carried out in September 1996. The survey fished areas along the continental slope west of Ireland from 52 ° N to 58 ° N at depths of 500 - 1, 200 m The primary objective was to secure samples of potentially commercial deep-water shark and teleost species in order to examine aspects of their age, growth, reproduction and diet. The survey was conducted on a chartered commercial fishing vessel using a deep-water otter trawl fitted with a small mesh cod-end liner. A total of 26 hauls were made during 87 hours of fishing and yielded a total catch of 29, 345 kg. The ground covered ranged from mud to gravel and bare rock and there was no significant gear damage during the survey. Thirteen species of chondrichtian and 33 species of teleost fish were recorded. Length, weight sex and maturity data were taken from some of these species. The most abundant species in the catch were Baird's smoothhead, <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier,</b> leafscale gulper shark, black scabbard and orange roughy. Trawl discards expressed as kg discarded per tonne of <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> landed were calculated for a broad range of the most abundant species in the catch. During the survey in the Rockall Trough an estimated 16 t of deep-water species were discarded and results are compared to estimates for 1995.

40|$|Introduction: Two fish species, {{the greater}} silver smelt Argentina silus and the <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> Coryphaenoides rupestris, are highly {{abundant}} in the deep-water areas of the Skagerrak. Since the 1970 s, a small aimed trawl fishery for the smelt has developed and now also some grenadier is landed. The biology and general distribution of both species have been described from the Skagerrak and elsewhere. Due to their benthopelagic distribution at depths from 200 to 700 m, previous attempts at estimating abundance and biomass of the Skagerrak concentrations yielded unsatisfactory results. In April 1992, during what appears as a major spawning season of the {{greater silver smelt}}, abundance estimation by the SIMRAD EK 500 echo sounder and integrator was attempted. Comparisons were made between observations made by the hull-mounted transducer and a transducer mounted in a newly developed towed body...|$|E
40|$|The term {{deepwater}} {{refers to}} fishing in waters greater than 400 m depth. The main species taken in these deepwater fisheries are <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier,</b> black scabbard, orange roughy, greenland halibut, tusk and deepwater sharks. The fisheries {{take place in}} depths between 800 m and 1200 m {{on the slopes of}} the Porcupine Bank and in the Rockall Trough to the West of Ireland. France was the first country to take an interest in deepwater stocks in the late 1980 s. Since then Spain, UK Norway, Faroes and Ireland have developed deepwater fisheries. On the slopes west of Donegal, Norwegian long-liners fish for ling and tusk on the shelf edge. On the slopes of the Porcupine Bank Spanish longliners and gillnetters fish for shark.

40|$|The revised catch history after 1987 is presented, total SA 2 + 3 roughhead {{grenadier}} catch in 2002 was 3 657 tons. The trends in biomass estimates from four survey series are examined: Canadian fall, Canadian spring, Canadian Deepwater and EU summer div. 3 M. Only the Canadian fall surveys {{are considered to}} cover adequately the species distribution range. The biomass index from this survey in 2002 was 35 282 tons, 43 % of it in Div. 3 L. Commercial catch include mainly ages between 5 and 12, with a peak at age 8, in Spanish and Russian catches; and ages between 3 to 9, with a peak in 5 - 6, in the Portuguese catches. The C/B index {{using data from the}} 2002 Canadian fall survey is 0. 1 (C/B 2001 = 0. 07). COMMERCIAL CATCHES It has been recognised that the recent catches of grenadiers by EU-Portugal and EU-Spain in Subarea 3, previously reported to NAFO as roundnose grenadiers, correspond to {{roughhead grenadier}} (Alpoim et al., 1994; Power and Parsons, 1998; Junquera, 1998). The reason for this misclassification could be mainly because <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> was the only name that appears in the statistical data reporting forms. The misreporting has not yet been resolved in the official statistics before 1996, but the species are reported correctly since 1997. Beginning in 1990, more roughhead grenadier has been caught than <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Atkinson, 1995). Roughhead grenadier is taken as by-catch in the Greenland halibut fishery in the Regulatory Area mainly in Div. 3 LMN. The revised catch history after 1987 is presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1. Catches increased sharply from 1989 (333 tons) gradually until the highest level of 7 231 tons observed in 1998; since then, it has continued decreasing steadily up to 2002 (3 657 tons).

In total, 166 specimens from the RV G. O. Sars cruise in July 2004 were examined. The diet mainly comprised cephalopods, pelagic shrimps and fish. Pelagic and benthopelagic copepods were the most numerous prey, but did not contribute much on a weight basis. Cephalopods were by far the most important prey of the small grenadiers, while shrimps and fish became increasingly significant with increasing size. Previous studies from other areas have also found pelagic prey to be important, but in contrast to this study, cephalopods were generally of less importance.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for evaluating fisheries management plans comprehensively, both rebuilding plans and others. The framework includes a first rapid appraisal of {{the likelihood that the}} plan will result in management meeting its objectives, and guides subsequent quantitative analyses of potential weaknesses in the proposed plan. The framework includes four steps: (i) evaluating if a set of management objectives, if achieved, would result in a sustainable fishery, (ii) using qualitative analysis of a bio-economic model to evaluate whether the set of stock management tactics might be capable of achieving the specified fisheries objectives, (iii) using empirical criteria derived from the literature to evaluate if other management measures in the plan related to the ecological, social or economic context of the fishery actually contribute to sustainability, and (iv) carrying out quantitative simulations to compare alternative implementation options. Generally, several management measures have to be combined to increase stock size without sacrificing the economic benefits to the fishers remaining in the fishery.

The species composition of the catches is presented. In terms of weight, the <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and the bairdii smoothhead (Alepocephalus bairdi i) are the most important species in the catches. Other less important species are the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) and the blue ling (Molva dypterygia). In addition to the total catch, the composition of the retained catch and the discard are studied. For the main retained species, the dressing types are described and the conversion coefficients are presented. The length distribution of the catches and the discards, length-weight relationships and other biological aspects of some of the main species are analysed...|$|E
40|$|We review {{information}} from scientific trawl surveys carried out between 1977 and 2002 in the Porcupine Seabight and Abyssal Plain {{area of the}} Northeast Atlantic (240 - 4865 m water depth). Since the late 1980 s, commercial bottom-trawl fisheries targeting mainly <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), and orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) have been operating at depths of 500 - 1500 m, intersecting the depth ranges of 77 demersal fish species that would therefore be vulnerable to fishery effects. Comparisons of trawls pre- 1989 and post- 1997 indicate {{a significant decrease in}} total abundance of demersal fish down to 2500 m. Detailed analyses of the 15 most-abundant species showed that nine species with depth ranges within the commercial fishing depth have decreased in abundance. Other species were either not affected (Bathypterois dubius) or only affected at the shallow end of their range (Coryphaenoides guentheri). Species with a minimum depth of occurrence > 1500 m (Coryphaenoides armatus and Coryphaenoides leptolepis) increased in abundance over part of their depth range. Decreases in abundance are probably caused by commercial fishing activities, an effect that is transmitted downslope by removal of fish at the shallow end of their depth range, resulting in declines at the deeper end of the depth range. The estimated fishery area is ca. 52 000 km(2), but the potential impact probably extends to ca. 142 000 km(2) and to many non-target species...|$|E
40|$|The Marine Institute {{with the}} {{collaboration}} of the National University of Galway conducted a multidisciplinary deepwater survey along the continental {{slope of the}} Northeast Atlantic. At three selected sites northwest of Ireland and on the northern slopes of the Porcupine Bank, fishing transects were carried out at four depth strata (500 m, 1000 m 1500 m and 1800 m) during the day, while oceanographic measurements and plankton and benthic invertebrate sampling was carried out during the night. Data from CTD and ADCP measurements showed following distribution of water masses: The top 700 m was occupied by that of Eastern North Atlantic Water (ENAW) origin which is a basic feature of the upper layer hydrography in the Rockall Trough; small salinity maxima indicated the region associated with {{the core of the}} shelf edge current (SEC). At Area 6, immediately north of Porcupine Bank, a salinity maximum at a depth of 900 - 1000 m indicated the presence of Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) with the presence Labrador Sea Water (LSW) at 1800 - 2000 m. The SEC was identified in both CTD and ADCP transects and was characterised by a number of relatively narrow filaments evident in the salinity data. In terms of benthic invertebrate data, a total of 104 taxa were identified with a maximum number of 33 invertebrate taxa identified per haul (these values were recorded at two 1500 m hauls in 2006 and 2007, in Areas 5 and 2, respectively). Overall, no clear relationship between the number of invertebrate species and depth was apparent, however there was some indication that the number of species appears to be more variable in deeper waters. Several species occurred in very large numbers; these were the echinoderms, Cidaris cidaris, Benthegone rosea and Stichopus tremulus and the bivalve, Pseudammusium septemradii. Fisheries data revealed distinct deepwater fish communities that changed with depth {{and to a lesser extent}} with area. The number of species increased with depth at all sites to reach a maximum at 1500 m before decreasing again at 1800 m. At 500 m depth the fish community was mainly composed of rabbit fish and rattails with some shelf species present such as hake, ling and silver pout. The 1000 m depth strata presented a transition of species composition. The most abundant species overall was <b>Roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> which had is highest abundance at 1500 m in all three areas but could also be found in the 1000 and 18000 m depth strata. Other species of high abundance which also had their highest number of individuals at 1500 m were Baird’s smoothhead and other species of grenadiers. Cluster analysis revealed that <b>Roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> was a distinct species grouping as was that of Baird’s smoothhead. Species occurrences were similar in all three areas with some regional differences; in area 2, Phycis blennoides, greater forkbeard,occurred among the ten most abundant species while in area 5, species, such as Black Scabbard, Aphanopus carbo, and cut throat eel, Synaphobranchus kaupi, were being caught here in larger numbers while present in the other areas in low numbers. Seven comparative tows were carried out with the Scottish research vessels RV Scotia and indicated that overall similar numbers of species and total number of fish were caught. Size distribution also compared well between the two different vessels, however for some species the numbers or size ranges of fish caught differed.

40|$|Abstract – In the Northeast Atlantic fishery for <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> Coryphaenoides rupestris, {{discards}} {{account for}} about 30 % of the catch in weight. Data on discards are scarce; however, length distributions and discard rates appear to be relatively stable from year to year. In contrast, landings data available since 1990 show that the average pre-anal fin length has decreased from 20. 7 cm in 1990 to 15. 2 cm in 2008, resulting in a 58 % reduction of the mean individual weight (850 g in 2008) and an increasing occurrence of overlapping class sizes between landings and discards in recent years. For stock assessment, the method of separable virtual population analysis (SVPA) was used. However, {{because of the lack}} of discard data for many of the years covered by the study, the catch data used as input to the assessment model had to be reconstructed from the available information (landings, discards, fishing effort and bathymetric distribution of the stock) using two methods. The first method relied on the assumption that the recent length distributions of discards were applicable to the earlier years (1990 - 1997). It resulted in unrealistic bimodal length distributions, suggesting a change in discarding practices through time, with larger individuals being discarded in the early days. The second method, based on the fishing effort and length distribution by depth strata, produced unimodal distributions for the whole period and confirmed that the average length of discarded fish was higher in the early days of the fishery. In both cases, the estimates of biomass follow parallel trends, suggesting a strong decline in the population. The available information and methods are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} an {{exploited}} population is ideally determined by monitoring changes in abundance and distributional range and pattern over time. Area of occupancy {{is a measure}} of the current distribution. Unfortunately, for many populations, scientific abundance and distribution information is not readily available. To evaluate the reliability of commercial fishing data for deriving occupancy indicators that could serve as proxies for stock abundance, we investigated four questions: 1) Occupancy changes with stock biomass, but is this change strong enough to make occupancy a sensitive indicator of population biomass? 2) Fishing boats follow fish, but when does such activity alter the positive macroecological relationship between occupancy and abundance? 3) When does the activity of pursuing fish adversely affect occupancy estimates derived from catch and effort data? 4) How does uncertainty in fishing effort data affect occupancy estimates? Spatial simulations mimicking the dynamics of four deep-water fish species showed that biomass-occupancy relationships can be weak. Fishers following fish can modify the spatial distribution of target species, even reversing the sign of the biomass-occupancy relationship in certain cases, and can affect the reliability of occupancy indicators, which can also be impaired by error in effort data. Using commercial catch and effort data and abundance indices for deep-sea fish populations to the west of the British Isles it was found that only for <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> might occupancy provide insights into biomass changes. In conclusion, care should be taken when using occupancy for evaluating range changes in cases where fishing might have modified spatial distributions, uncertain commercial data are used or when the abundance-occupancy relationship is too flat...|$|E
40|$|Potential for new {{developments}} in deep water fishing have been identified by two sampling surveys carried out in April and September 1993, in the deep waters off {{the west coast of}} Ireland and Scotland. The primary objective of the two surveys was to secure samples of a variety of potentially commercial deep water fish species in order to examine aspects of their age, growth, reproduction and diet. These data will be essential in formulating management plans for the expanding deep water fisheries in the area. The surveys were conducted on a chartered fishing vessel using a commercial otter trawl, fitted with a small mesh cod-end liner. Fishing activity concentrated on the depth range 400 m- 1200 m and a total of 81 trawling operations were carried out, of which 75 produced fish catches with limited gear damage. Fifteen species of cartilaginous and 50 species of teleost fish were recorded from the catches. These include the <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> Coryphaenoides rupestris, black scabbard Aphanopus carbo, greater forkbeard Phycis blennoides, blue-mouth rockfish Helicolenus dactylopterus and Baird's smooth-head Alepocephalus bairdii. Length, weight, sex, maturity and catch data together with samples of otoliths, gonads and stomachs were secured. In general terms, the fishing ground off the north west of Ireland and west of Scotland caused little problems with gear damage and yielded good catches of deep water species. The two surveys have shown the areas have potential for commercial deep water fishing but the development of this fishery in the area will be contingent on the establishment of suitable markets. This initial report documents the surveys and presents some preliminary results. The data gathered from these surveys are currently under analysis at the FRC and the results will be published in the scientific literature...|$|E
40|$|Two {{surveys were}} carried out in 1995 {{as part of the}} {{continuing}} deep water fish research programme at the Fisheries Research Centre. The trawl survey fished areas on the eastern slopes of the Rockall Trough and on two seamounts of the mid-Atlantic ridge approximately 300 miles north of the Azores. The deep water longline trip was the first such survey carried out by the Fisheries Research Centre and concentrated on previously fished grounds in the Rockall Trough and on new areas along the slope of the Porcupine Bank. Both surveys {{were carried out}} in conjunction with an Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) and the objective was to locate commercial quantities of deep water fish and to obtain samples for biological analyses. The trawl survey was conducted on a chartered fishing vessel using a commercial otter trawl, fitted with a small mesh cod-end liner. Twenty-six trawling operations were carried out in the depth range 750 m- 1, 400 m, of which 21 produced fish catches. Longlines were set between 542 m and 1, 521 m and only one line was lost. Thirteen chondricthian and 38 species of teleost fish were recorded from the catches. The most abundant species in the catches were Portuguese shark, <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier,</b> black scabbard, Baird's smoothhead, blue ling and orange roughy. Length, weight, sex, maturity and catch data together with samples of otoliths and gonads were collected. Discards were monitored from both fishing methods. In comparison with the trawl, longline catches produced larger specimens of fewer species which were more dominated by sharks. Overall catch rates for the longlines were similar to Norwegian data for the Rockall area. Trawl catch rates showed a decrease since the last Irish survey in this area in 1993...|$|E
40|$|In the ocean, {{energy is}} {{transferred}} from the productive primary producers at the surface, down to the demersal fish fauna at the sea floor. When {{moving away from the}} surface layer, there is a decline in food availability, and demersal fish species has evolved different feeding strategies due to this (Merrett and Haedrich, 1997). Even though many studies have researched feeding ecology of demersal fish species in the ocean, {{little is known about the}} feeding ecology of demersal fish species in fjords. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the feeding ecology of <b>roundnose</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Coryphaenoides rupestris), a demersal fish species, in two Norwegian fjords. Three hypotheses were predicted; (1) that the diet would consist of mesopelagic fish and invertebrates, and benthic crustacean. (2) That diet and food composition would differ between the fjords. (3) Due to the importance of pelagic prey, a difference in prey composition and food amount would be found as a diurnal pattern, and there will be evidence that grenadiers migrate upwards during day or night to feed on pelagic prey. Stomach content of 303 roundnose grenadiers were analyzed to investigate importance of prey groups and differences between and within fjords. Pre-anal fin-length, weight, gonadosomatic index and hepatosomatic index were measured and calculated. In total, the diet consisted mostly of pelagic and benthic crustaceans, 19 % consisted of non-crustacean taxa. No major differences were found in prey composition between the fjords, with the exception of chaetognaths, which were only found as prey in Masfjord. Size of the grenadier influenced the foraging upon polychaetas and euphasids. Fish from Lustrafjord had more stomach content relative to body weight, while the Masfjord population had a higher distribution of sexually matured fish and more stored resources in the liver. There were no clear diurnal differences in consumed prey taxa or in food amount, but in general, pelagically caught fish contained more pelagic prey. Overall, diet analyses showed that roundnose grenadiers from two Norwegian fjords utilize food resources in both pelagic and demersal zone, and that size has an effect when specializing on specific prey groups such as krill and polychaetas. The feeding ecology of C. rupestris is similar to other populations in the Northwest-Atlantic, and they feed mostly on Amphipoda, Copepoda, Euphausiacea, Polychaetae and Mollusca, and are classified as 2 nd or 3 rd carnivorous consumer. Low amounts of fish found in the stomach content revealed that they rarely feed on fish. Diet consisted both of pelagic and benthic prey, no clear diurnal differences were found. Although the importance of pelagic prey was found, a diel vertical migration pattern could not be confirmed...|$|E
