40|$|Remote-Sensing Images (ARRSI); an {{automatic}} registration system built to register satellite and aerial <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images.</b> The {{system is designed}} specifically {{to address the problems}} associated with the registration of <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> obtained at different times and/or from different sensors. The ARRSI system is capable of handling <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> geometrically distorted by various transformations such as translation, rotation, and shear. Global and local contrast issues associated with <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> are addressed in ARRSI using control-point detection and matching processes based on a phasecongruency model. Intensity-difference issues associated with multimodal registration of <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> are addressed in ARRSI through the use of features that are invariant to intensity mappings during the control-point matching process. An adaptive control-point matching scheme is employed in ARRSI to reduce the performance issues associated with the registration of large <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images.</b> Finally, a variation on the Random Sample and Consensus algorithm called Maximum Distance Sample Consensus is introduced in ARRSI to improve the accuracy of the transformation model between two <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> while minimizing computational overhead. The ARRSI system has been tested using various satellite and aerial <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> and evaluated based on its accuracy and computational performance. The results indicate that the registration accuracy of ARRSI is comparable to that produced by a human expert and improvement over the baseline and multimodal sum of squared differences registration techniques tested.

40|$|Texture {{features}} play a {{vital role}} in land cover classification of <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images.</b> Local binary pattern (LBP) is a texture model that has been widely used in many applications. Many variants of LBP have also been proposed. Most of these texture models use only two or three discrete output levels for pattern characterization. In the case of <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images,</b> texture models should be capable of capturing and discriminating even minute pattern differences. So a multivariate texture model is proposed with four discrete output levels for effective classification of land covers. <b>Remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> have fuzzy land covers and boundaries. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is highly suitable for classification of <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> due to its inherent fuzziness. It can be used for accurate classification of pixels falling on the fuzzy boundary of separation of classes. Hence in this article, land cover classification of remotely sensed image has been performed using the proposed multivariate texture model MDLTP (Multivariate Discrete Local Texture Pattern) and SVM classifier.

40|$|The {{classification}} of remote <b>sensing</b> <b>images</b> is a challenging task, as image contains bulk of information {{which is to}} be carefully extracted and used. Support vector machine (SVM) has proven its excellence in the field of remote <b>sensing</b> <b>image</b> classification.

In this paper, we present a framework in which multiple SVM kernels are tested on a <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>image</b> for analysis of behaviour of kernel methods over image dataset. Pre-step to image classification is feature extraction on the basis of which image is classified. In our system, the image is classified into two classes on the basis of colour feature of image. Accuracy of each kernel along with delay in image classification is calculated for the task of kernel optimization over <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>image.</b> Thus a set of best suited kernel methods can be identified over a specific dataset...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved edge detection algorithm for facial and <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> using vector order statistics. The developed algorithm processes colored images directly without {{been converted to}} gray scale. A number of the existing algorithms converts the colored images into gray scale before detection of edges. But this process leads to inaccurate precision of recognized edges, thus producing false and broken edges in the output edge map. Facial and <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> consist of curved edge lines which have to be detected continuously to prevent broken edges. In {{order to deal with}} this, a collection of pixel approach is introduced with a view to minimizing the false and broken edges that exists in the generated output edge map of facial and <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two examples}} of real-life applications of texture segmentation using M-band wavelets. In {{the first part of}} the paper, an efficient and computationally fast method for segmenting text and graphics part of a document image based on textural cues is presented. It is logical to assume that the graphics part has different textural properties than the non-graphics (text) part. So, this is basically a two-class texture segmentation problem. The second part of the paper describes a segmentation scheme for another real-life data such as <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>image.</b> Different quasi-homogeneous regions in the image can be treated to have different texture properties. Based on this assumption the multi-class texture segmentation scheme is applied for this purpose.

40|$|Spectral feature used in <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>image</b> {{classification}} {{are recorded}} in narrow, adjacent frequency bands in the visible to infrared spectrum.

40|$|Traditional {{spectral}} {{classification of}} <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis ignores the potentially useful spatial information between {{the values of}} proximate pixels. For some 30 years the spatial information inherent in <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> has been employed, albeit by {{a limited number of}} researchers, to enhance spectral classification. This has been achieved primarily by filtering the original imagery to (i) derive texture `wavebands ' for subsequent use in classification or (ii) smooth the imagery prior to (or after) classification. Recently, the variogram has been used to represent formally the spatial dependence in <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> and used in texture classification in place of simple variance filters. However, the variogram has also been employed in soil survey as a smoothing function for unsupervised classification. In this review paper, various methods of incorporating spatial information into the classification of <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>images</b> are considered. The focus of the paper is on the variogram in classification both as a measure of texture and as a guide to choice of smoothing function. In the latter case, the paper focuses on the technique developed for soil survey and considers the modification that would be necessary for the remote sensing case...|$|E
