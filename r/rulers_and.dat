5|$|However, none {{of these}} invaders could extend their rule to Ruhuna, the {{southern}} part of the country, and Sri Lankan <b>rulers</b> <b>and</b> their heirs always organized their armies from this area and managed to regain their throne.

50|$|Some of the {{geometric}} cryptographic methods {{are based on}} the impossibility of trisecting an angle using <b>ruler</b> <b>and</b> compass. Given an arbitrary angle, there is a straightforward <b>ruler</b> <b>and</b> compass construction for finding the triple of the given angle. But there is no <b>ruler</b> <b>and</b> compass construction for finding the angle which is exact one-third of a given angle. Hence the function which assigns the triple of an angle to a given angle {{can be thought of as}} a one-way function, the only constructions allowed being <b>ruler</b> <b>and</b> compass constructions.|$|R
50|$|A <b>ruler</b> <b>and</b> compass {{construction}} {{refers to}} constructions using an unmarked <b>ruler</b> <b>and</b> a compass. It {{is possible to}} bisect an angle into two equal parts with <b>ruler</b> <b>and</b> compass. It can be proved, though, {{that it is impossible}} to divide an angle into three equal parts using only a compass and straightedge — the problem of angle trisection. However, should two marks be allowed on the ruler, the problem becomes solvable.|$|R
50|$|Initially the {{governorship}} {{was given to}} the tlatoani (indigenous dynastic <b>ruler),</b> <b>and</b> the first four governors were thus referred to as cacique y gobernador ("Indian <b>ruler</b> <b>and</b> governor") or señor y gobernador ("lord and governor"). Subsequent, non-dynastic governors were referred to juez-gobernador ("judge-governor") or simply gobernador ("governor").|$|R
5|$|However, {{some members}} of the Indian freedom {{struggle}} such as Nehru felt that Sastri was too sympathetic to the British <b>rulers,</b> <b>and</b> too co-operative with them. This was especially apparent at the Round table conferences where Sastri and his party member agreed to the unfair proposals of the British.|$|E
5|$|Other residences include Clarence House and Kensington Palace. The palaces {{belong to}} the Crown; they are held in trust for future <b>rulers,</b> <b>and</b> cannot be sold by the monarch. Sandringham House in Norfolk and Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire are privately owned by the Queen.|$|E
5|$|The Jarls Eirik and Svein proved strong, {{competent}} <b>rulers,</b> <b>and</b> their reign was prosperous.

5|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his position}} in 1240, Haakon focused on displaying the supremacy of the kingship, influenced by the increasingly closer contact with European culture. He started constructing several monumental royal buildings, primarily in the royal estate in Bergen where he built a European-style stone palace. He used a grand fleet with stately royal ships when meeting with other Scandinavian <b>rulers,</b> <b>and</b> actively sent letters and gifts to other European rulers; his most far-reaching contact was achieved when he sent gyrfalcons with an embassy to the Sultan of Tunis.|$|E

5|$|Another {{genre of}} history writing {{produced}} during the Era of the Princes was the terse Ethiopian annal known as ya'alam tarik. These works attempted to list major world events {{from the time}} of the biblical Genesis until their present time in a universal history. For instance, the translated work of John of Nikiû explaining human history until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 642 became a canonical text in Ethiopian historiography. There are also chronological and genealogical lists of <b>rulers</b> <b>and</b> Orthodox Church patriarchs that include some elements of historical narrative.|$|E
5|$|From {{the fifth}} century {{northern}} Britain was divided {{into a series of}} petty kingdoms. Of these the four most important to emerge were the Picts, the Scots of Dál Riata, the Britons of Strathclyde and the Anglian kingdom of Bernicia. After the arrival of the Vikings in the late eighth century, Scandinavian <b>rulers</b> <b>and</b> colonies were established along parts of the coasts and in the islands.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-14th century, {{after the}} Black Death, Norman {{settlements}} in Ireland {{went into a}} period of decline. The Norman <b>rulers</b> <b>and</b> the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, {{diplomatic}} contact continued {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols, until the Ilkhanate dissolved in the 1330s, and {{the ravages of}} the Black Death in Europe caused contact with the East to be severed. A few marital alliances between Christian <b>rulers</b> <b>and</b> the Mongols of the Golden Horde continued, such as when the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a (d. 1312) and later to his successor Uzbek (1312–1341).|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Ivan Shishman {{was engaged}} in a war against the voivode of Wallachia, Dan I, between 1384 and 1386.

5|$|Most of the Germanic tribes {{who in the}} {{following}} centuries invaded the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity in its Arian form, which the Catholic Church declared heretical. The resulting religious discord between Germanic <b>rulers</b> <b>and</b> Catholic subjects was avoided when, in 497, Clovis I, the Frankish ruler, converted to orthodox Catholicism, allying himself with the papacy and the monasteries.
