25|$|This {{was easily}} {{accomplished}} because Mexico {{had long been}} {{a major source of}} heroin and cannabis, and drug traffickers from Mexico had already established an infrastructure that stood <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> the Colombia-based traffickers. By the mid-1980s, the organizations from Mexico were well-established and reliable transporters of Colombian cocaine. At first, the Mexican gangs were paid in cash for their transportation services, but in the late 1980s, the Mexican transport organizations and the Colombian drug traffickers settled on a payment-in-product arrangement.|$|E

During World War I, Thoms campaigned the American Red Cross to permit black nurses to enroll. Introduced to President Warren G. Harding and First Lady Florence Kling Harding, she presented them with a basket of roses, and told them that 2000 black nurses were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> their country. These efforts ultimately led to the creation of the United States Army Nurse Corps.|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} most Mexican drug cartels is traced to former Mexican Judicial Federal Police agent Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo ("The Godfather"), {{who founded the}} Guadalajara Cartel in 1980 and {{controlled}} most of the illegal drug trade in Mexico and the trafficking corridors across the Mexico–U.S. border along with Juan García Ábrego throughout the 1980s. He started off by smuggling marijuana and opium into the U.S., {{and was the first}} Mexican drug chief to link up with Colombia's cocaine cartels in the 1980s. Through his connections, Félix Gallardo became the person {{at the forefront of the}} Medellín Cartel, which was run by Pablo Escobar. This was easily accomplished because Félix Gallardo had already established an infrastructure that stood <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> the Colombia-based traffickers.|$|E

[...] He extended a modest official rice stipend to Ine, and she {{was expected to be}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> in the women's quarters at the castle; she was one of three doctors present when Munenari's wife Yoshiko gave birth in 1867. [...] Ine had a busy practice in Uwajima and made frequent travel between Nagasaki and Uwajima during the 1860s. [...] Munenari made effort on behalf of her father and Shūzō, who were arrested in 1861 in Edo by anti-foreign factions.

500|$|The Doctor and Amy {{take the}} TARDIS to the Cabinet War Rooms during The Blitz of the Second World War, {{one month after}} Winston Churchill {{requested}} the Doctor's help in the war effort. As the Doctor arrived late, Churchill turned to the scientific advances of Professor Edwin Bracewell, including robotic devices called [...] "Ironsides", which are recognised immediately by the Doctor as his archenemies the Daleks. The Doctor tries to understand their purpose in being on Earth at this time, but they continue to act as Bracewell's inventions, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> Britain's war efforts. Angrily, the Doctor attacks the devices, shouting, [...] "I am the Doctor {{and you are the}} Daleks!". Unbeknown to the Doctor and the humans, a Dalek ship is in orbit near the moon; upon hearing the Doctor's [...] "testimony", the Dalek aboard uses it to activate a [...] "Progenator Device" [...] and alerts its comrades on Earth. The Daleks reveal their intent and turn hostile, killing several guards and exposing Bracewell as an android before transmatting to their ship. The Doctor follows in the TARDIS, leaving Amy behind for her protection.|$|E
500|$|Critias and his compatriots, in {{the light}} of these events, decided that Theramenes had become an {{intolerable}} threat to their rule; accordingly, speaking before the assembly of the 3,000, Critias denounced Theramenes as a born traitor, always ready to shift his political allegiances with the expediencies of the moment. Famously, he branded him with the nickname [...] "cothurnus", the name of a boot worn on the stage that could fit either foot; Theramenes, he proclaimed, was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> either the democratic or oligarchic cause, seeking only to further his own personal interest. In an impassioned response, Theramenes denied that his politics had ever been inconsistent. He had always, he insisted, favored a moderate policy, neither extreme democracy nor extreme oligarchy, and held true to the ideal of a government composed of men of hoplite status or higher, who would be able to effectively serve the state. This speech had a substantial effect on the audience, and Critias saw that, if the case were brought to a vote, Theramenes would be acquitted. Accordingly, after conferring with the Thirty, Critias ordered men with daggers to line the stage in front of the audience and then struck Theramenes' name from the roster of the 3,000, denying him his right to a trial. Theramenes, springing to a nearby altar for sanctuary, admonished the assemblage not to permit his murder, but to no avail; the Eleven, keepers of the prison, entered, dragged him away, and forced him to drink a cup of hemlock. Theramenes, imitating a popular drinking game in which the drinker toasted a loved one as he finished his cup, downed the poison and then flung the dregs to the floor, exclaiming [...] "Here's to the health of my beloved Critias!" ...|$|E

2500|$|When the {{landlord}} feels the beer has settled, {{and they are}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> it, they will knock a soft spile into the shive {{on the side of}} the cask. The major difference in appearance between a keg and a cask is the shive. A keg does not have a shive on the side. The majority of casks these days are metal, and look similar to a keg, but with the rounded traditional barrel shape (kegs are often straight-sided). Even though there are still some wooden casks around, these are rare; in fact there are more plastic casks around than wooden ones. Plastic casks are increasing in popularity because they are cheaper to buy and lighter to carry. Though they don't last as long, they are also less likely to be stolen as they have no melt-down value. Beer casks come in a number of sizes, but by far the most common in the pub trade are those of 9 gallons (72 pints or roughly 41 litres) which is known as a Firkin and 18 gallons (144 pints or roughly 83 litres) known as a Kilderkin.
