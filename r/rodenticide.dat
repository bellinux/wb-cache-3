An early recipient of warfarin was US president Dwight Eisenhower, who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Tammars {{from these}} areas were {{introduced}} to Kawau Island in New Zealand by colonial administrator Sir George Grey in 1870. Since then, they have flourished {{to the point where}} their foraging has damaged indigenous plants. Pest control operators have used sodium fluoroacetate, a naturally occurring <b>rodenticide,</b> to control their populations, a practice which has been controversial because of its possible effect on organisms not targeted, including humans. Cyanide pellets have been used as an alternative. In 1985, tammars {{were introduced to}} the North Island of the Houtman Abrolhos and have made similar impacts on native vegetation. Their numbers grew to 450 individuals, but by 2008 culling efforts appeared to have reduced their numbers to 25 individuals. In 2003, the Monarto Zoo temporarily housed 85 tammars from New Zealand awaiting reintroduction to the Innes National Park on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Four releases have been made, and a stable wild population of 100–120 animals exists as of 2012. Tammars have also been successfully translocated to other areas, such as Nambung National Park and Avon Valley National Park in Western Australia.|$|E

40|$|Anticoagulant <b>rodenticides</b> {{are widely}} used in urban areas to control rodent pests and are {{responsible}} for secondary poisoning in many nontarget wildlife species. We tested the livers of five coyotes (Canis latrans) in the Denver Metropolitan Area, Colorado, US, for anticoagulant <b>rodenticides.</b> All five livers were positive for brodifacoum, with values ranging from 95 ppb to 320 ppb, and one liver was positive for bromadiolone, with a value of 885 ppb. Both of these <b>rodenticides</b> are second-generation anticoagulants, which are more potent {{and more likely to}} cause secondary poisoning than first-generation anticoagulants due to their accumulation and persistence in the liver.

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow {{is treated}} as a species of least concern, or not {{threatened}} with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , estimated population of 2.4million individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. In years without sufficient rains, many birds fail to breed {{and those that do}} produce fewer offspring. Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number. The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases: A. r. sanctorum of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct, and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s. Populations of the species in southern California are also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and agricultural development in the region.

25|$|Mouse and rat poison* {{ingestion}} {{is common}} in dogs. Most <b>rodenticides</b> in the United States are anticoagulant by depleting Vitamin K. This type is the most frequent cause of poisoning in pets. Third generation products contain brodifacoum or bromadiolone and are toxic after a single ingestion. Signs include spontaneous and excessive bleeding internally and externally. Treatment is with Vitamin K supplementation. Other <b>rodenticides</b> may contain cholecalciferol which causes hypercalcemia and leads to heart and kidney problems. Newer <b>rodenticides</b> may contain bromethalin which causes central nervous system signs such as seizures, muscle tremors, and depression.|$|R
40|$|Anticoagulant <b>rodenticides</b> are {{chemical}} baits used {{to reduce}} rodent problems. They are used both indoors and outdoors, and are often found in both urban and rural settings. They are usually formulated into pellets or dusts that are often bright blue-green in color. 1, 10, 11 • Anticoagulant <b>rodenticides</b> can be classified into two different categories: first and second generation <b>rodenticides.</b> First generation anticoagulants are usually less toxic {{and more than one}} dose needs to be eaten by the animals for the product to be effective. <b>Rodenticides</b> in this category are made from chemicals such as warfarin and diphacinone. Second generation products are much more potent and act faster than first generation products. They kill rodents with just one dose and include chemicals such as brodifacoum, difethialone, and bromadiolone. 1, 10, 11 How do anticoagulant <b>rodenticides</b> work? • Vitamin K is an important vitamin that both animals and humans need to make blood clot effectively. For the normal coagulation to occur, vitamin K is needed to work with protein enzymes to recycle factors involved in the coagulation cascade. Anticoagulant <b>rodenticides</b> work by blocking the body’s ability to conserve vitamin K which in turn stops the body from producing and activating new factors needed for coagulation. The result is widespread bleeding throughout the body and eventual death. 3, 1...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{the use of}} <b>rodenticides</b> {{either in}} housing or office is increasing. We can find many type of <b>rodenticides</b> with its own {{effectiveness}} {{in order to control}} rats. Rats cause economic, social and especially health problems for human.

25|$|Several {{desirable}} control methods are currently ineffective for various reasons. Zinc phosphide {{is the only}} <b>rodenticide</b> currently registered to control nutria, but it is expensive, remains toxic for months, detoxifies in high humidity and rain, and requires construction of (expensive) floating rafts for placement of the chemical.

Therefore, this chemical is rarely used, especially not in large-scale projects. Other potential chemical pesticides would be required by the US Environmental Protection Agency to undergo vigorous testing before they could be acceptable to use on nutria.
