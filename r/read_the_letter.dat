5|$|Lauren and Whitney decline their {{invitations to}} the housewarming party, and instead plan an impromptu outing {{at the club}} Les Deux. Meanwhile, during the housewarming party, Jenn Bunney makes a brief {{appearance}} at the apartment, although Heidi is disappointed after realizing that Lauren will not be attending. Unaware that they will run into Heidi and Spencer, Lauren and Audrina attend a birthday party for their friend Frankie Delgado the following day. As Lauren leaves for the bathroom after Heidi gives her a letter, Heidi tells Audrina that she is unsure {{of the reason for}} the tension between them. Audrina finds Lauren in the bathroom and they <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> together, which details Heidi's interest in rekindling their friendship. Angered that Heidi will not acknowledge the sex tape rumors, Lauren decides to exit the club.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} on 27 September 1822, he {{published}} {{some of his}} findings in his Lettre à M. Dacier, addressed to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Paris Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Champollion <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> before the assembled Académie. All his main rivals and supporters were present at the reading, including Young {{who happened to be}} visiting Paris. This was the first meeting between the two. The presentation did not go into details regarding the script and in fact was surprisingly cautious in its suggestions. Although he must have been already certain of this, Champollion merely suggested that the script was phonetic already from the earliest available texts, which would mean that the Egyptians had developed writing independently of the other civilizations around the Mediterranean. The paper also still contained confusions regarding the relative role of ideographic and phonetic signs, still arguing that also hieratic and demotic were primarily ideographic.|$|E
25|$|Evatt's {{loss of the}} {{election}} and his belief that Menzies had conspired with ASIO to contrive Petrov's defection led to criticism within the Labor Party of his decision {{to appear before the}} Royal Commission. He compounded this by writing to the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, asking if allegations of Soviet espionage in Australia were true. When Molotov replied, naturally denying the allegations, Evatt <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> out in Parliament, bringing the House into silence momentarily before both sides of Parliament began laughing.|$|E

25|$|At the Second Council of Ephesus in 449, Leo's representatives {{delivered}} his famous , {{a statement of}} {{the faith of the}} Roman Church {{in the form of a}} letter addressed to Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople, which repeats, in close adherence to Augustine of Hippo, the formulas of western Christology. The council did not <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> nor did it pay any attention to the protests of Leo's legates but deposed Flavian and Eusebius of Dorylaeum, who appealed to Rome. That is one reason that the council was never recognized as ecumenical and was later repudiated by the Council of Chalcedon.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 1913, the Marquis Matsugae holds {{a cherry}} blossom viewing party {{for his friend}} Prince (Haruhisa) Toin, {{inviting}} only Satoko and her parents, the two princes, and Baron Shinkawa and his wife. The guests are depicted as ludicrously half-Westernised. During a private moment, Satoko and Kiyoaki embrace, but suddenly Satoko turns away and spurns him, calling him childish. Infuriated, Kiyoaki tells Iinuma what has happened, and the tutor responds with a story which makes him realise that Satoko did indeed <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> {{she was supposed to}} burn. He concludes that she has been leading him on all along in order to humiliate him.|$|E
25|$|King Louis XVI {{used his}} veto power to prevent decrees against émigrés and the non-juring clergy. Madame Roland {{therefore}} {{wrote a letter}} addressing the royal refusal to sanction the decrees {{and the role of}} the king in the state, which her husband addressed and sent to the king. When it remained unanswered, Roland read it aloud in full council and in the king's presence. Judged inconsistent with a minister's position and disrespectful in tone, the incident led to Roland's dismissal. However, he then <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> to the Assembly, which ordered it printed and circulated. It became a manifesto of dissatisfaction, and the Assembly's subsequent demand that Roland and other dismissed ministers be reinstated eventually led to the king's dethronement.|$|E

Sephy has not heard from Callum for a week so she writes him a letter asking him to run away with her and telling him that she will be leaving for Chivers if he does not contact her. However, Callum has decided to join the LM, against the wishes of his mother, and he does not <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> until just before Sephy leaves. Callum sprints to Sephy's house and fails {{to catch up with the}} car as it pulls out of the driveway.

25|$|In February 1820, Francia's {{political}} police {{called the}} Pyraguës ("hairy feet") uncovered and quickly crushed a plot by the elites and many leading independence figures to assassinate him. Juan Bogarin, the only conspirator still free, confessed the plot to his priest, then Francia. Francia arrested almost 200 prominent Paraguayans, executing most of them. On June 9, 1821, a letter detailing an anti-Francia conspiracy {{was found by}} two slaves, as well as Francia's priest, who had knowledge of the plot from the confessions of a conspirator. Francia had all 300 Spaniards arrested, and made them stand in the plaza whilst he <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> out. They were only released 18 months later, when they had paid 150,000 pesos (by comparison, the 1820 budget was 164,723 pesos). The arch-conspirators, Fulgencio Yegros and Pedro Caballero, were arrested and imprisoned for life; Caballero committed suicide on July 13, 1821, and Yegros was executed four days later.|$|E
25|$|Naaman, the {{commander}} of the army of the king of Aram, was a great warrior, but he was a leper. The girl who waited on Naaman's wife was an Israelite whom the Arameans had taken captive, and she told Naaman's wife that if Naaman went to Elisha in Samaria, then Elisha would cure Naaman of his leprosy. Naaman told his lord the king of Aram what the girl said, and the king of Aram sent Naaman on his way with a letter to the king of Israel. Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothes. Naaman brought the king of Israel the letter, which asked the king of Israel to cure Naaman of his leprosy. When the king of Israel <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> he rent his clothes and complained that he was not God with power over life and death, but the king of Aram must have been seeking some pretext to attack Israel.|$|E

25|$|Eddie sends Kat and Alfie {{on holiday}} to Spain and runs the pub in their absence. He teaches Liam about {{antiques}} but considers returning to Upton Park as he hasn't seen anywhere {{to move his}} business to. When Carol discovers that Eddie has allowed Liam to skip school, they argue and Carol tells him {{to stay away from}} her and Liam. Eddie discovers that someone is squatting in a local lock-up and decides to take over the premises. Eddie asks Liam to watch his stock, which he leaves in the gardens. Eddie's son, Anthony (Matt Lapinskas), poses {{as a member of the}} council to force the squatter out. Eddie returns to find his stock on fire and cannot extinguish the flames. He confronts Michael, thinking he started the fire, but Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) told Liam that she was responsible in revenge for comments Anthony and Tyler made about her grandfather Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick). Eddie finds out it was Lola and confronts her. Eddie and Michael seemingly make amends but Eddie is unaware that Michael has a plan. He later gets a letter that intrigues Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and she becomes fascinated by Eddie. When she tells him she knows his secret, that he wears silk underwear, Eddie assumes she <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> and shouts at her. Eddie moves into a house on Albert Square and tells Michael that he likes Carol. They are set up by Eddie's sons to spend time alone and are caught under a blanket by Tyler and Anthony.|$|E
500|$|Disappointed by Shahrbaraz's failure, Khosrow II sent a {{messenger}} bearing {{a letter to}} Kardarigan, who was the second-in-command of the Sasanian army. The letter said that Kardarigan should kill Shahrbaraz and take his army back to Ctesiphon, but the bearers of the letter were intercepted in Galatia by Byzantine soldiers, who gave the letter to Constantine III who in turn gave it to Heraclius. After reading the letter, he offered to show the letter to Shahrbaraz in a meeting at Constantinople. Shahrbaraz accepted his proposal and met Heraclius at Constantinople, where he <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> and switched over to Heraclius' side. Shahrbaraz then changed {{the contents of the}} letter, making it state that Khosrow II wanted 400 officers killed, ensuring that Kardarigan {{and the rest of the}} army remained loyal to him.|$|E
500|$|Yates's {{victory was}} the first UCI World Tour victory of his career and the first ever victory by a British rider in the Clásica de San Sebastián. Van Avermaet and the BMC team, however, were unhappy with the crash that had {{eliminated}} him from the race and issued a statement from Jim Ochowicz, the team's manager, saying that [...] "Greg was robbed and the BMC Racing Team was robbed" [...] and that the team would [...] "explore every legal option". Simon Yates – Adam's brother and his teammate at [...] – described these comments as [...] "quite disrespectful"; Van Avermaet later clarified that he considered Yates's victory well-deserved. The race organisers later wrote to Van Avermaet apologising for the incident; Van Avermaet was unable to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> however, as {{it was written in}} Spanish.|$|E

500|$|Sometime later, Sora, Riku, and Kairi {{receive a}} letter from King Mickey. The letter, which was {{discovered}} by Mickey during the events of Kingdom Hearts Coded, describes the parts of their past that Naminé learned while restoring Sora's memory. As they <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> they learn about the fates of three Keyblade wielders {{at the hands of}} Xehanort during the events of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep (a decade before Kingdom Hearts): Terra is possessed by Xehanort; Ventus, whom Xehanort attempts to turn into the legendary χ-blade, sacrifices his heart to stop him and hides it within a four-year-old Sora's; and new Keyblade Master Aqua ends up trapped in the realm of darkness after sacrificing herself to save Terra. King Mickey also discovers that the destruction of [...] "Ansem" [...] and Xemnas has led to the reconstruction of Xehanort. To combat the new threat Xehanort poses, Sora and Riku take an exam to attain the Mark of Mastery {{that will allow them to}} become Keyblade Masters themselves.|$|E
500|$|Sometime around September 19, 1869, Corbin, at {{the urging}} of Gould, sent a letter to Grant desperately urging him not to release gold from the Treasury. Grant {{received}} the letter from a messenger while playing croquet with Porter at a deluxe Pennsylvania retreat. He finally realized {{what was going on and}} was determined to stop the gold manipulation scheme. When pressed for a reply to Corbin's letter, Grant responded curtly that everything was [...] "all right" [...] and that there was no reply. One Grant biographer described the comical nature of the events as an Edwardian farce. Grant, however, did have his wife Julia respond in a letter to Corbin's wife that Abel Corbin needed to get out of the gold speculation market. When Gould visited Corbin's house, he <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> from Mrs. Grant containing the warning from Grant, after which he began to sell gold, while also buying small amounts of gold in order to keep people from getting suspicious. [...] Gould never told Fisk, who kept buying gold in earnest, that Grant was catching onto their predatory scheme.|$|E
500|$|It is Day 9, September 30, 2004. On the beach, Sawyer catches Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) {{searching through}} his stash of items he {{salvaged}} from the crash, and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) attends to a wound {{on the head}} of Sayid. Sayid reports his failure in triangulating the distress signal, and the destruction of the transceiver by his attacker. Shannon brings a bloody Boone to the caves, where he explains to Jack that Sawyer beat him, and that his sister Shannon's asthma has become a problem. Many of the survivors become convinced that Sawyer is hoarding some inhalers from the wreck. Jack unsuccessfully demands the inhalers from Sawyer, and when Kate does the same, Sawyer says he will give up the inhaler if Kate kisses him. Kate calls his bluff and challenges him about the letter he often reads. Sawyer makes Kate <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> aloud. The letter is addressed to [...] "Mr. Sawyer" [...] and explains that Mr. Sawyer had sex with the letter writer's mother and stole all of the letter writer's father's money, resulting in the father killing his wife and himself.|$|E

500|$|Zwingli {{credited}} the Dutch humanist, Cornelius Henrici Hoen (Honius), {{for first}} suggesting the [...] "is" [...] {{in the institution}} words [...] "This is my body" [...] meant [...] "signifies". Hoen {{sent a letter to}} Zwingli in 1524 with this interpretation along with biblical examples to support it. It is impossible to say how the letter impacted Zwingli's theology although Zwingli claimed that he already held the symbolic view when he <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter.</b> He first mentioned the [...] "signifies" [...] interpretation in a letter to Matthäus Alber, an associate of Luther. Zwingli denies transubstantiation using John 6:63, [...] "It is the Spirit who gives life, the flesh is of no avail", as support. He commended Andreas Karlstadt's understanding of the significance of faith, but rejected Karlstadt's view that the word [...] "this" [...] refers to Christ's body rather than the bread. Using other biblical passages and patristic sources, he defended the [...] "signifies" [...] interpretation. In The Eucharist (1525), following the introduction of his communion liturgy, he laid out the details of his theology where he argues against the view that the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ and that they are eaten bodily.|$|E
500|$|... "A Letter to Judge Dredd" [...] (1990) was a six-page story {{written in}} the same style as [...] "Letter From a Democrat", which had begun the Democracy story arc four years earlier. Set in 2112, the story was written from the {{perspective}} of a schoolboy writing a letter to Dredd as part of a school project about the Judge System. Despite his youthful naivety, the boy identified a multitude of problems with the dysfunctional system that Dredd stands for. Dredd was no doubt already aware of these problems to some extent, but the letter succinctly and starkly listed them at a time when Dredd was already growing disillusioned with the system due to his feelings of guilt in respect of the dubious and underhand methods he had used to subdue the Democratic March in 2109. The boy also described a neighbour who had been struck on the head by a judge on the March, receiving permanent brain damage as a result, which caused him to have violent mood swings and hallucinations. On the way to post his letter, the boy was murdered by the neighbour during one of his violent episodes. Attending the crime scene, Dredd <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> and felt indirectly responsible for the boy's death.|$|E
500|$|After {{the fleet}} arrived in July 1776, Admiral Howe made several {{attempts}} to open communications with Continental Army General George Washington. [...] Two attempts to deliver letters to Washington were rebuffed because Howe refused to recognize Washington's title. [...] Washington did however agree {{to meet in}} person with one of Howe's adjutants, Colonel James Patterson. [...] In the meeting on July 20, Washington learned that the Howes' diplomatic powers were essentially limited to the granting of pardons, to which he responded that the Americans had not committed any faults and thus did not need pardons. [...] Lord Howe then {{sent a letter to}} Benjamin Franklin detailing a proposal for a truce and offers of pardons. [...] After Franklin <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> in Congress on July 30, he wrote back to the admiral that [...] "Directing pardons to be offered to the colonies, who are the very parties injured, [...] can have no other effect than that of increasing our resentments. [...] It is impossible we should think of submission to a government that has with the most wanton barbarity and cruelty burnt our defenseless town, [...] excited the savages to massacre our peaceful farmers, and our slaves to murder their masters, and is even now bringing foreign mercenaries to deluge our settlements with blood." [...] He also pointed out to the admiral that [...] "you once gave me expectations that reconciliation might take place." [...] Howe was apparently somewhat taken aback by Franklin's forceful response.|$|E
