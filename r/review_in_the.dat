5|$|A <b>review</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Economist {{calls this}} a {{powerful}} book which articulates the politics involved {{and the degree}} to which scientists have sometimes manufactured and exaggerated environmental uncertainties, but opines that the authors fail to fully explain how environmental action has still often proved possible despite countervailing factors.|$|E

5|$|A {{county council}} for the East Riding of Yorkshire {{was set up}} in 1889, {{covering}} an administrative county which did not cover the county borough of Hull, but otherwise had the same boundaries as the historic riding. Both the administrative county and the historic Lieutenancy were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974, with most of the riding going to form the northern part of Humberside. The creation of this cross-Humber authority was unpopular and this culminated in the local government <b>review</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, which saw Humberside abolished and the northern part form two unitary authorities. The East Riding district was formed on 1 April 1996. The ceremonial county, the area in which the Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire represents the Crown, was re-established the same day, covering Hull as well as the district.|$|E

5|$|Elgato {{introduced}} a Thunderbolt docking station in June 2014. A computer is {{plugged into the}} dock using a Thunderbolt port {{in order to gain}} access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A <b>review</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
5|$|Gone to Coney Island and Booming Business are two 1910 American silent short comedy {{productions}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both {{were released}} {{together on a}} single film reel on July 5, 1910. Gone to Coney Island is a comedy that features Coney Island, which the mere subject would make for a successful film. Booming Business {{may have been the}} very type of slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser specifically said the Thanhouser Company would not produce. The productions of both films have no credits for the cast or crew, but possible candidates for these roles exist. Reviews of the films favored Gone to Coney Island, but some reviewers specifically refused to explain the plot because Coney Island subjects were deemed self-explanatory. Booming Business received one detailed <b>review</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> New York Dramatic Mirror which was negative. The films are presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Paul Taylor’s <b>review</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Independent hails American Idiot as “the Hair of its generation”. Yet, {{as noted}} by Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even lighter than the main men are”. Although intended to empower the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the female voice from this discourse. This disempowering of the female {{is evident in the}} fact that the female leads are denied identity, let alone agency. Just one of the three is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E

5|$|Peter Milner, in a <b>review</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Journal of Psychology, {{noted the}} book was short on {{concrete}} details on implementing the TOTE strategy. He also critically viewed the book as {{not being able to}} tie its model to details from neurophysiology at a molecular level. Per him, the book covered only the brain at the gross level of lesion studies, showing that some of its regions could possibly implement some TOTE strategies, without giving a reader an indication as to how the region could implement the strategy.|$|E
5|$|Pola {{went on a}} short {{cruise to}} Italian Libya on 1012 March 1937, with Mussolini and Prince Luigi Amedeo aboard. On 7 June, she {{took part in a}} naval <b>review</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Naples held for the visiting German Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg. Another review took place on 5 May 1938 when the German {{dictator}} Adolf Hitler made a state visit to Italy. On 7 March 1939, Pola and her sisterships sortied from Taranto to intercept a squadron of Republican warshipsthree cruisers and eight destroyersattempting to reach the Black Sea. The Italian ships were ordered not to open fire but merely to try to impede the progress of the Spanish ships and force them to dock at Augusta, Sicily. The Spanish commander refused and instead steamed to Bizerte in French Tunisia, where his ships were interned. The next month, on 79 April, Pola provided gunfire support to Italian forces occupying Albania.|$|E
5|$|Pola, {{named for}} the eponymous city seized by Italy after World War I, was laid down at the Odero-Terni-Orlando {{shipyard}} in Livorno on 17 March 1931 and was launched on 5 December that year. Fitting-out work proceeded quickly, and the new cruiser entered service {{just over a year}} later on 21 December 1932. Pola participated in a naval <b>review</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Naples, where she hosted Italy's fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, on 67 July 1933. On 29 July 1934 she was formally given her battle flag in a ceremony in her namesake city. On 3 September 1936 she left Gaeta, bound for Spanish waters; she thereafter began a non-intervention patrol during the Spanish Civil War. From 10 September to 3 October, she was stationed in Palma de Mallorca to safeguard Italian interests there. Pola returned to Gaeta on 4 October.|$|E
