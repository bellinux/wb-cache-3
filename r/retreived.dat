The sediments were <b>retreived</b> from the area between the western lake shore and the Great island – both places of human occupaion since the Late Neolithic (5400 - 5300 cal BC).

A set of porous H 2 O:CH 4 ices are taken as a prototypical example.

Accurate band strengths are then calculated from experimental mid-infrared spectra of complex ices.

Different levels of porosity are observed depending on the abundance of methane used as a gas contaminant premixed with water prior to background deposition. The absorption profiles are also found to vary with deposition rate. To explain this, we use Monte Carlo simulations and we observe that the deposition rate strongly affects the pore size distribution as well as the ice morphology through reorganization processes. Extrapolated to genuine interstellar ices, the methodology presented in this paper can be used to evaluate the porosity and to quantify the relative abundances from observational data...|$|E

However, it is possible to recover a subset of the input symbols from the actually received coded symbols: this process is called partial decoding and the number of recovered input symbols is termed the intermediate performance of rateless codes. In this paper we study the problem of the optimality of the partial decoding process: we say that a partial decoding algorithm is optimal if, given a rateless code, it is able to maximize the intermediate performance of the code, i. e. it is able to <b>retreive</b> the maximum number of input symbols when a certain number n of coded symbols have been received, for every n. We propose OPD, an optimal partial decoding algorithm for any rateless code, proving its optimality. The proposed algorithm is finally used to analyze the intermediate performance of LT codes.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of an energy recovery system for <b>retreiving</b> otherways wasted energy {{is an effective}} method for reducing the overall energy consumption of a mobile machine. In a fork lift, there are two subsystems that can be effectively modified for recovering energy. These are the driveline and the lift/lower function of the mast. This study focuses on the latter by studying a recovery system whose main component is a hydraulic transformer consisting of a hydraulic motor, a variable displacement pump and an induction motor. Since the flow rate/pressure - ratio can be modified, the utilization of the hydraulic transformer enables downsizing of the accumulator volume. However, the decrease of the gas volume leads {{to an increase in}} the compression ratio of the accumulator, which in terms leads to higher gas temperatures after charging and consequently to higher thermal losses during holding phase. In order to reduce these losses, a thermally regenerative unit was implemented to the gas volume of an accumulator to reduce the temperature build up during charging. In this study, the effect of improving the thermal characteristics of the accumulator to the efficiency of the whole energy recovery system is investigated by means of measurements...|$|R

Stanev in their paper {{discussing}} {{the origin of the}} highest energy cosmic rays, is alone responsible for the focusing of positive particles towards the North galactic pole.

In particular one cannot identify point sources at least up to energies of about 200 EeV 1. Therefore the apparent clustering of the back-traced highest energy cosmic rays observed to date cannot be interpreted as an evidence for a point source nor for the identification of M 87, which happens to be close to the North pole, as being such a source.
