50|$|The flask is {{then put}} back together, and metal can be {{poured into the}} mold. The metal will flow down the sprue, into the mold cavity, and back up the riser (of which there may be several). Once the metal has cooled enough to solidify, the flask can then be {{separated}} again, and the sand removed to reveal the <b>rough</b> <b>casting.</b> The <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> is separated from the sprue and riser(s) either by sawing them off, or just breaking the thin metal of the gates and runners.|$|R

50|$|The {{ceramic discs}} are {{available}} in two types, <b>cast</b> <b>plate</b> and membrane <b>plate.</b> The <b>cast</b> <b>plate</b> is a one piece ceramic plate with a homogeneous surface and a granulated core. The filter medium of the <b>cast</b> <b>plate</b> is the thick walls, separated by ceramic granules. These features form a rigid mechanical structure. The membrane plate type contains a thin membrane over a coarser core and a multi-layer porous structure made of aluminium oxide. The coarse part of the equipment provides mechanical strength to its structure while the intermediate layer acts as a membrane carrier. The outer layer membrane acts as a filtering layer. The filtration layer of the ceramic filter has uniform pores, which means that only a certain size of particles can be filtered by using vacuum ceramic filters.|$|R
50|$|The Alameda is a {{historic}} apartment building located at Indianapolis, Indiana. It was built about 1925, and is a three-story, <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> buff brick building. It has commercial storefronts on the first floor. It features distinctive spandrels with basketweave pattern brickwork.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} {{temperature}} stress cannot be ignored in actual project. Single-frame {{shear wall structure}} of two-dimensional plane has been simplified in this paper. Fixed point of displacement {{under the influence of}} the temperature is determined in structure. Model for Calculating is given. Temperature stress of frame- shear wall <b>cast</b> <b>plate</b> is found by matrix method. Basic assumptions The impact of transverse deformation is ignored. Just the longitudinal stretching deformation of <b>cast</b> <b>plate</b> is considered. The three-dimensional is simplified plane model. Temperature stresses become weaken quickly away from the foundation. So multi-layer is simplified into single layer for calculating. Temperature difference is at 1 T and 2 T in indoor and outdoor. Temperature gradient of the <b>cast</b> <b>plate</b> is distributed to line. The average temperature is 1 2 2 T T+ in this structure. The fixed point of temperature in the structure.

40|$|The {{submitted}} historic preservation´s procedure {{offers an}} instruction {{for the production}} and application of earth <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> and topping coat for rammed-earth monolithic masonry. After getting necessary skills, the submitted description of the building procedure is very effective within the hand-made production. Both connected layers of plaster are identical as to their material; the only difference consists in the ratio of admixtures added to the basic raw material. While making replicas of the buildings construction using the rammed-earth technique, the below-described procedure seems to be effective. The <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> (commonly called as špric) is a connecting bridge between the masonry and the plaster. The rough earth plaster is to plane possible masonry unevenness that developed during the construction, {{and to make a}} ground for the fine final plaster...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The microstructure and hardness of simulated welds in HY- 130 <b>cast</b> <b>plate,</b> wrought plate and weld filler metal are investigated. The dependence of these quantities on the austenitizing temperature and the tempering provided by subsequent weld passes is also investigated. The {{use of a}} tempering parameter, as developed by Hollomon and Jaffe, allows comparison of different tempering times and temperatures. It was found that in the rapid heating cycle of simulated welding that the AC 1 and AC 3 temperatures are approximately as much as 150 to 170 °F higher than the corresponding temperatures of the equilibrium phase diagram for this 0. 1 % C- 5. 0 % Ni steel. Results indicate that <b>cast</b> <b>plate</b> tends to resist tempering more than either the rolled plate or weld metal. Additionally, structures formed at lower austenitizing temperatures temper more readily. Although all three conditions tempered, the <b>cast</b> <b>plate</b> retained a steep hardness and microstructural gradient through the HAZ and consequently is probably more susceptible to a metallurgical notch effect.

5000|$|When a piston is cast, {{the alloy}} is heated until liquid, then poured into a mold {{to create the}} basic shape. After the alloy cools and solidifies it {{is removed from the}} mould and the <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> is {{machined}} to its final shape. For applications which require stronger pistons, a forging process is used.|$|R
50|$|The building, when completed, was a two-storey {{structure}} of red bricks relieved with <b>rough</b> <b>cast.</b> On {{the ground floor}} there was provision for an inspector's, sergeant's and clerk's offices.

50|$|In {{his choice}} of materials, Fournier {{demonstrated}} concern for a smooth transition {{between the house and}} its setting. This concern for landscape was shared by both Prairie and Craftsman designers. The strong fieldstone foundation and <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> stucco are more in keeping with the Craftsman School. However Fournier included sidewalks of smooth, rose-colored concrete—a trait of the Prairie School.|$|R
50|$|The {{south-western}} {{elevation of}} the church, facing the driveway, has changed little from that designed by Gailey: 6 bays framed with shallow engaged piers connected top and bottom, the first 5 punctuated by tall, narrow windows with round-arches and sills, and that at the rear featuring both a narrow window, shorter than the others because of the sloping land, and a timber door with semicircular fanlight. The bays are <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> render while the frame is smooth render. The windows are filled with 4 coloured lead lights, 3 of which pivot along the horizontal centre line. The rear elevation is again Gailey's design, rendered in a similar pattern with a <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> face framed by smooth-rendered, engaged piers at each corner curving to the top plate connecting them under the gable end. A small, narrow window with round-headed arch and fixed louvres opens high into the centre of this wall.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{microstructure}} of as-cast Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy, {{an image}} processing to simplify model of β grain size, α lamella space {{was developed and}} a quantitative statistical method of β grain size, α lamella space in two-phase titanium alloys was established, with which β grain size and α lamella space of as-cast Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy with different plate thickness were analyzed. The relationship between β grain size, α lamellar space and <b>cast</b> <b>plate</b> thickness was discussed. The results show that β grain size and α lamellae thickness nearly linearly increase as plate thickness increasing. β grain size has normal distribution and with <b>cast</b> <b>plate</b> thickness increasing, the dispersion gets larger...|$|R

60|$|It {{would have}} been more {{serviceable}} to us if we could have known the date of the <b>rough</b> <b>cast,</b> than of its removal; the period of entire contempt for ancient art being a subject of much interest in the ecclesiastical history of Italy. But the tomb itself was an incrustation, having been raised with much rudeness and carelessness amidst the earlier art which recorded the first rise of the Cavalli family.|$|R
50|$|Bronze {{items are}} {{typically}} cast, not forged. Secondary operations involve removing {{material from the}} <b>rough</b> <b>casting,</b> polishing, {{and the application of}} decorative elements. Some Chinese swords used high-tin bronze for the edges, since it is harder, and keeps a sharp edge longer, but is more brittle than the softer, lower-tin alloy used for the blade's core. Bronze alloys with lower tin content are tougher, or more resistant to fracturing.|$|R
