50|$|It {{constructs}} an {{overlay tree}} from a redundantly meshed graph of nodes, source specific shortest path trees are then constructed from <b>reverse</b> <b>paths.</b> The group management is equally distributed on all nodes because each overlay node {{keeps track of}} all its group members through periodic heartbeats of all members. The discovery and tree building is similar to DVMRP.|$|R
50|$|Another {{special case}} are mailing lists, where the list server rewrites all <b>reverse</b> <b>paths</b> {{to its own}} error {{handling}} address for bounces (error messages) by recipients. The list server could automatically unsubscribe bouncing recipients. This type of address rewriting is known since RFC 821 and still used today (RFC 5321, as well as RFC 2821, updated the SMTP chapter in RFC 1123).|$|R

5000|$|Coherent {{backscattering}} has {{its origin}} in the interference between direct and <b>reverse</b> <b>paths</b> in the backscattering direction. When a multiply scattering medium is illuminated by a laser beam, the scattered intensity results from the interference between the amplitudes associated with the various scattering paths; for a disordered medium, the interference terms are washed out when averaged over many sample configurations, except in a narrow angular range around exact backscattering where the average intensity is enhanced. This phenomenon, {{is the result of}} many sinusoidal two-waves interference patterns which add up. The cone is the Fourier transform of the spatial distribution of the intensity of the scattered light on the sample surface, when the latter is illuminated by a point-like source. The enhanced backscattering relies on the constructive interference between <b>reverse</b> <b>paths.</b> One can make an analogy with a Young's interference experiment, where two diffracting slits would be positioned in place of the [...] "input" [...] and [...] "output" [...] scatterers.|$|R
50|$|The {{forward and}} <b>reverse</b> <b>paths</b> used for unicast and {{multicast}} traffic in an IEEE 802.1aq network are symmetric. This symmetry permits the normal Ethernet Continuity Fault Messages (CFM) IEEE 802.1ag to operate unchanged for SPBV and SPBM and has desirable properties {{with respect to}} time distribution protocols such as Precision Time Protocol (PTP Version 2). Also existing Ethernet loop prevention is augmented by loop mitigation to provide fast data plane convergence.|$|R
50|$|The IPv4 {{implementation}} in Linux defaults to the weak host model. Source validation by <b>reversed</b> <b>path,</b> as specified in RFC 1812 can be enabled (the rp_filter option), and some distributions {{do so by}} default. This is {{not quite the same}} as the strong host model, but defends against the same class of attacks for typical multihomed hosts. arp_ignore and arp_announce {{can also be used to}} tweak this behaviour.|$|R
50|$|The Return-Path {{is visible}} in {{delivered}} mail as header field Return-Path inserted by the SMTP mail delivery agent (MDA) (which is usually combined with a mail transfer agent, or MTA). The MDA simply copies the <b>reverse</b> <b>path</b> in the SMTP MAIL FROM command into the Return-Path. The MDA also removes bogus Return-Path header fields inserted by other MTAs; this header field is generally guaranteed to reflect the last <b>reverse</b> <b>path</b> seen in the MAIL FROM command.|$|E
50|$|Because some links may be asymmetric, {{the path}} from one node to another is not {{necessarily}} the same as the <b>reverse</b> <b>path</b> of these nodes.|$|E

50|$|Sixteen equal cost multi tree (ECMT) paths are {{initially}} defined, however {{there are}} many more possible. ECMT in an IEEE 802.1aq network is more predictable than with internet protocol (IP) or multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) because of symmetry between the forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>paths.</b> The choice as to which ECMT path will be used is therefore an operator assigned head end decision while it is a local / hashing decision with IP/MPLS.|$|R

The ability to identify fault locations on both the forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>paths</b> from a single point would be very powerful for both operators and users. Rather than describing a tool for path diagnosis per se, this paper describes how one could apply a simple measurement protocol to diagnose faults...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} reasons why private companies that have decided to go public use the alternative <b>reverse</b> merger <b>path</b> instead of the traditional initial public offering. We test the importance of information asymmetry for the decision of domestic and foreign private company owners to go public in the US utilizing the <b>reverse</b> merger <b>path.</b> To measure information asymmetry we use size, profitability, development stage, expenses and financing variables. We conclude that private companies choosing the <b>reverse</b> merger <b>path</b> are highly information asymmetric since reverse merger deals require no offering to be conducted at the consummation of the deal making these companies less reliant on a wide public investor base. This dissertation consists of five Chapters: Chapter One reviews going public and cross-listing literature. Chapter Two presents our empirical findings of domestic reverse mergers-penny stock initial public offerings comparison. Chapter Three analyzes similarities and differences of domestic and foreign reverse mergers. Chapter Four expands our analysis to the international level. Chapter Five states our conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Traceroute is {{the most}} widely used Internet path {{diagnosis}} tool today. A major limitation of traceroute when the destination is not controllable by the user is its inability to measure <b>reverse</b> <b>paths,</b> i. e., the path from a destination back to the source. In this demo session, we showcase DisNETPerf, a new tool to perform reverse traceroute measurements. DisNETPerf is able to collect measurements from the server to the user for path performance monitoring and troubleshooting purposes, even when the server is not {{under the control of the}} experimenter. DisNETPerf uses RIPE Atlas, a largely distributed active measurements platform to perform traceroute measurements from any arbitrarily selected server in the Internet...|$|R

First, we consider rate-based error models vs. temporal error models. We show {{that it is difficult}} to confidently assess the impact of improvements to existing protocols or the performance gains of new protocols under a rate-based model. Second, we consider error models that "synchronize" losses in the forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>paths</b> vs. models that do not do so, or which model losses in the forward path only. Our results show that TCP performance can be dramatically different under a synchronized error model compared to a non-synchronized one...|$|R

50|$|When a {{multicast}} packet {{enters a}} router's interface, {{it will look}} up the list of networks that are reachable via that interface i.e., it checks the <b>reverse</b> <b>path</b> of the packet. If the router finds a matching routing entry for the source IP address of the multicast packet, the RPF check passes and the packet is forwarded to all other interfaces that are participating in multicast for that multicast group. If the RPF check fails, the packet will be dropped. As a result, the forwarding of the packet is decided based upon the <b>reverse</b> <b>path</b> of the packet rather than the forward path. RPF routers only forward packets that come into the interface that also holds the routing entry {{for the source of}} the packet, thus breaking any loop.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{mechanism}} for the appearance of oriented processes is investigated with a flexible dynamical system overcoming barriers. Under non-equilibrium condition with external driving, reaction paths deviate from that at equilibrium with an accompanying violation of symmetry between the forward and the <b>reverse</b> <b>paths.</b> Although we never introduce any external switching of potentials to generate the oriented processes, multi-dimensional flexible dynamics promote the oriented processes through this symmetry violation. Along the reaction paths, bottleneck points are proposed as a rate-controlling factor, which determine the direction-dependent activation energies satisfying Arrhenius-like law for the rate constants. In comparison, in stiff systems, the oriented process is suggested to appear in different manner from this scenario. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
