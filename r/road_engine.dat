The highway also runs parallel to, {{and about a}} half mile (0.8km) north of Outer Drive, the original beltway highway proposed in 1918 to encircle Detroit. The road passes the Mound <b>Road</b> <b>Engine</b> facility, a former Chrysler plant next to the Mound Road intersection.

It was initially more correctly named [...] "Hope Mill, for Goudhurst and Lamberhurst". Goudhurst station had a passing loop and two platforms, and was signalled so that either platform could be used by down passenger trains. There were three sidings on the up side. The route then continued along the valley of a tributary of the Teise in a south-easterly direction. An intermediate siding at Pattenden served the local farming community and timber industry. Cranbrook (...) was the line's third station and reached following a climb up the valley through woodland. There was a single platform on the down side, with a passing loop opposite it. Four sidings were on the down side of the line, but on the Goudhurst side of the station.

2500|$|Motorcycle {{and other}} power-sport riders benefit by wearing foam earplugs when legal {{to do so}} to avoid {{excessive}} <b>road,</b> <b>engine,</b> and wind noise, but their ability to hear music and intercom speech is actually enhanced when doing so. The ear can normally detect 1-billionth of an atmosphere of sound pressure level,Pa (...) Standard atmospheric pressure is 101,325Pa. 2 x 10−5 / 100,000 = 0.2 x 10−9, a ratio of less than a billionth. hence it is incredibly sensitive. At very high sound pressure levels, muscles in the ear tighten the tympanic membrane and {{this leads to a}} small change in the geometry of the ossicles and stirrup that results in lower transfer of force to the oval window of the inner ear (the acoustic reflex).|$|E
