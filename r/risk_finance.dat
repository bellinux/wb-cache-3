40|$|ABSTRACT Small {{and medium}} {{enterprises}} (SMEs) {{are vital to}} economic growth and development of a nation. However, many of them fail {{in the first five}} years of incorporation due to their exposures to <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> and strategies employed to meet customers’ need during business shutdown. Hence, this study is designed to verify how SMEs’ <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> affect their continuity, and to model their survival patterns in context of <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> and <b>risk</b> management approach employed by the operators. Two hundred and nine copies of valid questionnaire distributed to the respondents were filled and returned. Cramer’s V and multiple regressions were the statistical tools used for data analysis. Empirical failure and survival models were adopted for the selected SMEs. The findings revealed that: strong relationship exists between <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> and business shutdown; there is a moderate but not significant relationship between <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> and business continuity; and as efficient <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> is employed, the SMEs’ chance of survival also increased while the strategy employed to meet customers’ need after business shutdown has inverse relationship with SMEs’ survival. In light of these findings, recommendations on how to reduce SMEs’ exposures to business shutdown and discontinuity were made...|$|R

40|$|The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{has called}} for a new balance between {{reducing}} the risks from climate extremes and transferring them (for example, through insurance) as means for effectively preparing for and managing disaster impacts in a changing climate. This paper elaborates on this balance with an overview of disaster <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> mechanisms and how they contribute to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation in developing countries. We suggest a risk management approach that targets risk reduction and <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> to different layers of risk, including a layer that represents a possible limit to adaptation. By reviewing traditional post-disaster financial arrangements, such as government compensation, and non-traditional pre-disaster instruments, such as index-based insurance, we show how <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> can complement and stimulate risk reduction. We discuss the benefits of financial instruments, including the provision of post-disaster finances for recovery and pre-disaster security necessary for climate adaptation and poverty reduction. These benefits come at a cost, and we discuss the risks, challenges, and future prospects of <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{provide a}} {{conceptual}} framework for designing a comprehensive <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> strategy for a firm, using an optimal combination of three instruments: self-retention, contingent debt, and insurance. Using an original conceptual model, the risk management decisions of the firm are first decomposed into two sets-choosing attachment points for each layer of financing used in the overall <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> structure, and, then determining optimal risk allocation arrangements within each layer of risk. This model allows the authors to show how these optimal <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> arrangements are driven by the costs of risk management instruments, the risk characteristics, and the firm's borrowing constraints. Finally, the authors provide an original perspective to think about optimal ex ante risk management strategies, based {{on a combination of}} insurance, savings, and credit at the microeconomic or macroeconomic levels.

40|$|The {{current study}} reviews the <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> {{techniques}} {{employed in the}} insurance markets {{and looks at the}} changing field of the risk management arena. The overarching view is that apart from the traditional channels of <b>financing</b> <b>risk,</b> alternative routes should be explored. The latter is strengthened with the surfacing of off-balance sheet instruments in modern financial markets. The paper extends the discussion to the layered <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> approach and reinforces its importance. That is, cash flow engineering instruments are employed to match different segments of the loss distributions. The role of insurance risk capital to assume extreme losses is further discussed, while reinsurance still remains a form of capital restructuring. Taken all together, the intention is that <b>risk</b> <b>financing</b> should be able to release assets committed to liabilities, and should reduce the cost of risk capital in sponsoring all-purpose equity. Finally, risk management platforms are redefined, while the securitisation of insurance risk is explored along with its effectiveness and possible caveats.

40|$|Swine {{epidemics}} {{can have}} very large devastating financial consequences. Governments generally bear the direct losses, {{such as the}} value of destroyed animals.

40|$|Increased {{attention}} {{has recently been}} given to the possible role of financial services in the management of natural disaster risk. Local communities have {{been at the forefront of}} developing innovative disaster <b>risk</b> <b>finance</b> strategies and implementing risk-oriented incentive programs. In view of increasing risks, including the impacts of climate change, such programs will become more important. This paper examines four models and some recent experiences in using financial services at the community level. The paper offers an overview of advantages and limitations of each model to manage disaster risk in communities. Examples include a federal government initiated scheme of social protection funds, a local government risk reduction scheme, an insurance product provided by a non-governmental organization, and a micro-insurance scheme. Finally, the paper offers some directions about specific ways that the public and private sectors, in collaboration with other partners can improve finance alternatives for disaster management at the community level. It appears that a range of follow-up studies and further dialogue is needed, in order to expand the knowledge on what types of <b>risk</b> <b>finance</b> models can help manage and reduce the financial impacts of natural disasters. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the uneven regional operations and effects of such policies are likely to produce an unintended regionalization of outcomes that may contradict the aims of closing regional disparities in <b>risk</b> <b>finance</b> and entrepreneurialism. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This paper derives {{a simple}} {{theoretical}} {{relationship between the}} degree of loss aversion, the concavity/convexity of the value function, and the equilibrium market price of risk. We show that while the degree of loss aversion is key in determining the market price of risk, the convexity/concavity of the value function is much less important in this respect. The theoretical relationship obtained is tested empirically by using international data from 16 different countries during over 100 years, as documented by Dimson et al. [Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment Returns, 2002 (Princeton University Press) ]. The empirical data yield an estimate of λ= 2. 3 for the loss aversion index.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the main tenets of {{industrial}} policy. Industrial policy, as a conscious effort on the part of government to encourage and promote activities specific, industry or sector with an array of policies, through the process of cooperation and coordination with the private sector, is an indispensable tool for steering economic development. It is needed both for developing and developed countries. Due to the information and coordination externalities, the productive forces cannot be developed through the market mechanism itself and the intervention on the part of government is needed. The programmes of an industrial policy need to be tailor made and country specific. However, some of the programmes have been historically shown as effective.
