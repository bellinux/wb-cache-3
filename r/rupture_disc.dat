50|$|A <b>rupture</b> <b>disc,</b> {{also known}} as a burst disc, {{bursting}} disc, or burst diaphragm, is a onetime use, non-reclosing pressure relief device that, in most uses, protects a pressure vessel, equipment or system from over pressurization or potentially damaging vacuum conditions. A <b>rupture</b> <b>disc</b> is a sacrificial part because it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal, but nearly any material can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture discs provide instant response (within milliseconds) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disc has ruptured it will not reseal. Due to the one time usage of this disc it requires someone to replace the plate once it has ruptured. One time usage devices are initially cost effective, but can become time consuming and labor-intensive to repeatedly change out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{attention}} {{concentrated on}} the pole of bulge profile, tensile instability which results in the fracture of forward acting <b>rupture</b> <b>discs</b> has been studied. A formula was developed to calculate the theoretical limit pressure of <b>rupture</b> <b>discs,</b> and the theoretical predictions were compared with the measured data. It is found that the strain-hardening exponent of sheet metals has no influence on the limit pressure, whereas the limit pressure is {{in direct proportion to}} the strength coefficient of sheet metals. It is important to realize that the strength coefficient of sheet metals can be acquired easily from the limit pressure. This has potential value for the tests of mechanical properties of sheet metals...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>rupture</b> <b>disc</b> {{is a type}} of {{sacrificial}} {{part because}} it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal, but nearly any material (or different materials in layers) can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture discs provide instant response (within milliseconds) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disc has ruptured it will not reseal. It is not possible to set an accurate pressure value at which the disc will burst. Major advantages of the application of rupture discs compared to using pressure relief valves include leak-tightness and cost.|$|E
50|$|The Learjet 25 {{cabin is}} {{pressurized}} to enable high altitude operations {{without the use}} of supplemental oxygen. The cabin pressure is provided by the conditioned air entering the cabin through the distribution ducts and controlled by modulating the amount of air exhausted from the cabin. During ground operations, a solenoid limits the pressure differential to 0.25 psi in order to ensure normal functioning of the door and emergency exit. The pressure differential at final cruising altitude will be maintained at 8.7 psi difference between pressure altitude and cabin altitude. A rate controller enables the crew to select the rate pressurization of the cabin within preset limits. The normal pressure relief valve will open at 8.9 psi differential pressure and the safety outflow valve will open at 9.2 psi differential pressure which is the maximum allowable differential pressure.Oxygen is contained in a pressurized bottle located in the dorsal fin of the aircraft. The use of oxygen is only required for emergency in case of depressurization of the cabin or contamination of the cabin air. Oxygen is always available for the crew and can be made available to the passengers manually or automatically. The oxygen storage cylinder has a capacity of 38 cubic feet and is stored at 1800 psi. An oxygen <b>rupture</b> <b>disc</b> will relieve oxygen pressure if the oxygen cylinder pressure reaches 2700 to 3000 psi. A green overboard indicator on the outside surface of the dorsal fin will be ruptured or missing to indicate that the <b>rupture</b> <b>disc</b> is not intact.|$|E
5000|$|Rupture discs are {{commonly}} used in petrochemical, aerospace, aviation, defense, medical, railroad, nuclear, chemical, pharmaceutical, food processing and oil field applications. They {{can be used as}} single protection devices or as a backup device for a conventional safety valve; if the pressure increases and the safety valve fails to operate (or can't relieve enough pressure fast enough), the <b>rupture</b> <b>disc</b> will burst. Rupture discs are very often used in combination with safety relief valves, isolating the valves from the process, thereby saving on valve maintenance and creating a leak-tight pressure relief solution. It is sometimes possible, and preferable for highest reliability though at higher initial cost, to avoid the use of emergency pressure relief devices by developing an intrinsically safe mechanical design that provides containment in all cases.|$|E

We describe the evolution of the clinical and surgical aspects about <b>ruptured</b> <b>discs</b> in the lumbar and cervical spine. An illustrative timeline of the major events regarding the surgical treatment for ruptured disks is outlined in a straight forward manner. Our understandings of the relation between symptoms and signs and of that between anatomy and pathophysiology have led to more successful surgical treatment for this disease. Nowadays lumbar and cervical discectomies are the most frequent operations carried out by neurosurgeons. Our current care of patients with this kind of spinal disorders is based on the work of our ancient medical heroes...|$|R

50|$|Part of the {{pressurizer}} {{system is}} an over-pressure relief system. In {{the event that}} pressurizer pressure exceeds a certain maximum, there is a relief valve called the pilot-operated relief valve (PORV) {{on top of the}} pressurizer which opens to allow steam from the steam bubble to leave the pressurizer {{in order to reduce the}} pressure in the pressurizer. This steam is routed to a large tank (or tanks) in the reactor containment building where it is cooled back into liquid (condensed) and stored for later disposition. There is a finite volume to these tanks and if events deteriorate to the point where the tanks fill up, a secondary pressure relief device on the tank(s), often a <b>rupture</b> <b>disc,</b> allows the condensed reactor coolant to spill out onto the floor of the reactor containment building where it pools in sumps for later disposition.|$|E

The explosion occurred in a 2500-gallon batch reactor during production of methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl. The reactor cooling system, which lacked backups, failed; this led to a thermal runaway. Pressures rapidly reached 400 PSI, bursting the <b>rupture</b> <b>disc,</b> but it was too late. Nearby witnesses described a jet engine like sound as high pressure gases vented from the reactor. At the same time pressure increased in the reactor, temperatures also increased in the reactor until the MMT reached its decomposition temperature.

40|$|When the {{pressure}} at a weak spot established {{at a certain}} part of a high pressure vessel or piping system exceeds a design pressure, this weak spot bursts, and the pressurized gas emitted through the weak spot generates a compression wave system at the downstream of the disc. In this connection, an experimental study was performed by using a shock tube facility with dimensional analysis to relate the valve opening time and shock wave formation distance with the diaphragm radius of curvature, {{the pressure}} ratio and depth of cross type groove. Four kinds of curvature radii were used with and without 90 ° groove. It {{was found that the}} smaller the radius of curvature of the <b>rupture</b> <b>disc</b> is, the thinner the thickness of the <b>rupture</b> <b>disc</b> is; and the smaller the ultimate strength of the <b>rupture</b> <b>disc</b> is, the shorter the valve opening time becomes. The radius of curvature and the ultimate strength of the <b>rupture</b> <b>disc</b> for the same conditions are smaller; the maximum pressure rise caused by the coalescences of the compression wave at the downstream of the valve is smaller. Finally, we found that the formation distance of the shock wave for the case of smaller curvature is longer than that for the case of a larger one because of the retardation of accumulation of the compression wave...|$|E
