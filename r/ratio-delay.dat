40|$|This {{experiment}} measured pigeons' choices between delayed reinforcers and fixed-ratio schedules {{in which}} a force of approximately 0. 48 N was needed to operate the response key. In <b>ratio-delay</b> conditions, subjects chose between a fixed-ratio schedule and an adjusting delay. The delay was increased or decreased several times a session in order to estimate an indifference point [...] a delay duration at which the two alternatives were chosen about equally often. Each <b>ratio-delay</b> condition {{was followed by a}} delay-delay condition in which subjects chose between the adjusting delay and a variable-time schedule, with the components of this schedule selected to match the ratio completion times of the preceding <b>ratio-delay</b> condition. The adjusting delays at the indifference point were longer when the alternative was a fixed-ratio schedule than when it was a matched variable-time schedule, which indicated a preference for the matched variable-time schedules over the fixed-ratio schedules. This preference increased in a nonlinear manner with increasing ratio size. This nonlinearity was inconsistent with a theory that states that indifference points for both time and ratio schedules can be predicted by multiplying the choice response-reinforcer intervals of the two types of schedules by different multiplicative constants. Two other theories, which predict nonlinear increases in preference for the matched variable-time schedules, are discussed...|$|E
