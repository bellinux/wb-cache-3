METHODS: From 1997 to 2000, acute pancreatitis <b>relapsed</b> in 77 of 245 acute pancreatitis patients. By reviewing the clinical treatment results and the follow-up data, we analyzed the recurrent factors of acute pancreatitis using univariate analysis and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of the 245 acute pancreatitis patients, 77 were patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis. Of them, 56 patients <b>relapsed</b> two times, 19 <b>relapsed</b> three times, each patient <b>relapsed</b> three and four times.

5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a <b>relapse</b> might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a <b>relapse</b> might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines, while {{useful in}} the {{management}} of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management. Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of <b>relapse</b> with one author reporting {{more than a quarter of}} people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly, as severe anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for <b>relapse</b> into alcohol abuse. Taper regimes of 6â€“12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{autoimmune}} encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T cell-mediated inflammatory and demyelinating {{disorder of}} the central nervous system. Depending on the experimental conditions, it takes an acute monophasic or a chronic relapsing-remitting course. We have previously reported that the incidence and severity of acute EAE in mice are reduced by administration of interferon (IFN) -gamma and augmented by treatment with neutralizing antibodies against IFN-gamma. Here, we investigated the role of IFN-gamma in chronic <b>relapsing</b> models of EAE (CREAE) in SJL/J and Biozzi ABH mice. Spontaneous <b>relapses</b> in Biozzi mice as well as induced <b>relapses</b> in SJL/J mice were facilitated by administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against IFN-gamma in the disease-free interval. The enhancing effect of anti-IFN-gamma mAb given {{before and during the}} primary attack did not carry over to the <b>relapses.</b> However, early administration of IFN-gamma in Biozzi mice, which developed spontaneous <b>relapses</b> in a high proportion, provided partial protection not only against the first attack, but also against subsequent <b>relapses.</b> Administration of exogenous IFN-gamma during the remission phase provided some protection against subsequent <b>relapses.</b> These results indicate that in both types of <b>relapses,</b> IFN-gamma is produced and does provide a certain degree of protection against disease progression. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Symptoms {{of malaria}} can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, {{recurrence}} {{can be classified}} as either recrudescence, <b>relapse,</b> or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood {{as a result of}} inadequate or ineffective treatment. <b>Relapse</b> is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells. <b>Relapse</b> commonly occurs between 8â€“24 weeks and is commonly seen with P.vivax and P.ovale infections. P.vivax malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite. Reinfection means the parasite that caused the past infection was eliminated from the body but a new parasite was introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial infection is typically attributed to treatment failure. People may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections.|$|E
