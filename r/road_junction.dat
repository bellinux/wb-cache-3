40|$|ABSTRACT: Lead {{pollution}} and lead tolerance levels of microbes in soil at major <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> in Benin City were investigated. Results revealed that {{distance from the}} <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> affected the concentrations of lead in soil, {{as well as the}} microbial population density and types of microbes present in the soil. The highest concentrations of lead were recorded with soil samples obtained at 0 and 10 m distance closer to <b>road</b> <b>junctions,</b> while the lowest concentrations were recorded with soil samples obtained at 30 m distance away from <b>road</b> <b>junctions.</b> The highest concentrations recorded for lead, copper and iron were 32 x 101 mg kg- 1, 8 x 10 - 1 mg kg- 1 6. 3 x 10 - 1 respectively. All these levels decreased rapidly as the distance from the road increased. Bacterial counts increased as the distance from the <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> increased. While fungal counts decreased as distance from <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> increased. Lead tolerance range of bacterial and fungal isolates was between 10 to 1000 mg 1 - 1. Non-significant, negative correlation was found between lead concentration and microbal counts. The bacteria and fungi most frequently isolated at 0 and 10 m distance were Pseudomonas sp., Micrococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Candida utilis, Penicillium sp and the yeast Saccharromyces cerevisiae...|$|R

5|$|The new tracks from King's Cross to Farringdon {{were first}} {{used by a}} GNR freight train on 27 January 1868. The Midland Railway {{junction}} opened on 13 July 1868 when services ran into Moorgate Street before its St Pancras terminus had opened. The line left the main line at St Paul's <b>Road</b> <b>Junction,</b> entering a double-track tunnel and joining the Widened Lines at Midland Junction.|$|E
5|$|With finance {{guaranteed}} by the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act of 1929, construction started in 1930. Four tracks were built from Studland <b>Road</b> <b>junction</b> to Northfields on the Hounslow branch. At the junction at Turnham Green for Richmond eastbound freight loops were built for coal trains to Kensington. Acton Town was rebuilt with five platforms, and a depot was built west of Northfields station.|$|E
5|$|Around midday the Germans {{opened up}} an {{artillery}} and mortar barrage that caused casualties among the ridge's defenders and lasted {{for the entire}} afternoon. At about the same time, Kampfgruppe Weidinger seized an important <b>road</b> <b>junction</b> northeast of Coudehard. Several units of the 10th SS, 12th SS, and 116th Panzer Divisions managed to clear a corridor past Point 262N, and by mid afternoon about 10,000 German troops had passed out of the pocket.|$|E

Some of these services will revert to terminating at Charing Cross following the completion of the works, while services from the Greenwich line and from New Cross and St Johns will permanently run to Cannon Street due to the removal of the Spa <b>Road</b> <b>Junction.</b>|$|E
5|$|PA 563 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with PA63 in Upper Salford Township, Montgomery County and heads in an easterly direction on two-lane, undivided Ridge Road. The route passes through wooded areas with some homes, turning southeast at the Township Line Road intersection and forming {{the border between}} Salford Township to the northeast and Upper Salford Township to the southwest. PA563 makes a northeast turn at the Barndt Road–Moyer <b>Road</b> <b>junction,</b> continuing northeast on Ridge Road into Salford Township.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} served in general by around {{half a dozen}} trains each way between North Walsham, Mundesley and Cromer Beach. However, with no direct service to Norwich - the nearest city - the halt was little-used, and closed in 1953 {{as part of a}} package of early {{rationalisation}} measures undertaken by British Railways after nationalisation, which also involved the closure of the line from Roughton <b>Road</b> <b>Junction</b> to Mundesley. The coastal line, although highly picturesque, carried little traffic and its closure made sound economic sense to British Railways.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{withdrawal}} could be carried out, however, the PVA 347th Regiment of the 116th Division had already entered {{the town of}} Unsan through {{the gap between the}} American battalions. Soon afterward, several roadblocks appeared behind the US 1st and 2nd Battalions. With the attacks gaining momentum, the PVA 348th Regiment of the 116th Division advanced southward from Unsan, ambushing the UN forces at the <b>road</b> <b>junction</b> by 02:30. With all the roads blocked, the US 8th Cavalry Regiment's 1st and 2nd Battalions had to escape by infiltrating the Chinese lines in small groups, abandoning most of their vehicles and heavy weapons along the way. The surviving US and ROK soldiers reached UN lines by 2 November.|$|E
5|$|Hillside Road, {{which runs}} {{parallel}} with South Road several hundred metres to the south, is an arterial route connecting South Dunedin (at its eastern end) with Dunedin's southwestern suburbs. At its western end is Forbury Corner, a <b>road</b> <b>junction</b> linking Hillside Road with suburban arterial routes {{to the suburbs}} of Saint Clair (Forbury Road) and Corstorphine (Easther Crescent), as well as David Street, the major road link between Hillside Road and South Road. Numerous other small residential streets run parallel with David Street between Hillside Road and South Road. The suburb's other main roads include Caversham Valley Road, Playfair Street, Surrey Street, and Glen Road. The latter of these lies at the Glen at {{the eastern end of}} Caversham, providing a link between South Road and the hill suburbs of Maryhill, Balaclava, and Mornington.|$|E
40|$|In this study, car {{navigation}} {{is considered}} {{as the basic}} activity and the multiple representation approach {{for the production of}} the navigation maps is taken into account to derive road network data for different representation levels. In this context, <b>road</b> <b>junctions,</b> which are the most complicated parts of road networks, are classified considering two different approaches, an approach based on cartographic aspects and an approach based on algorithmic aspects. In the first approach, <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> are classified according to their aspects at different representation levels. In this concept, three representation levels, which are derived from 1 : 5000 scaled base level, are used and representations of possible <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> are structured according to characteristics of these levels. Finally, they are classified by considering their geometrical shapes in each level. In the second approach, <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> are classified according to algorithmic concerns. Junctions are defined in matrices based on their specific characteristics and also these matrices are classified according to their similarity. Finally, common representations are determined for these classes...|$|R

5|$|In the Vistula-Oder Offensive in January, 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front was {{tasked with}} driving into East Prussia from the east. The 31st Army {{was not on}} an assault sector, {{and in the first}} stages it was ordered to hold its {{positions}} stubbornly. By January 23–24, the 331st had joined in pursuit of the retreating German forces, and along with its corps helped capture the important <b>road</b> <b>junction</b> of Blenkheim, and the strongpoint of Treuburg on the approaches to Lötzen. However, {{in the first week of}} February, the German command had regrouped their 129th and 558th Infantry Divisions as well as units of the 24th Panzer Division, which counterattacked in an attempt to encircle units of the 71st Rifle Corps; after several days fighting the attacks were beaten back and the advance resumed towards Kanditten.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 December, Ottoman {{artillery}} began firing on a <b>road</b> <b>junction,</b> which Mott's Detachment had to negotiate. Unable to advance or retaliate against the accurate shell fire from an Ottoman battery near Bethlehem, the detachment waited. At around noon, Chetwode, the corps' commander, ordered the detachment to get moving. Mott finally attacked his main objective at Beit Jala at 16:00, but the Ottoman Army had already retired. It {{was not until the}} evening that they continued their advanced to find the way completely clear of Ottoman defenders. At the crucial moment, Mott's Detachment was unable to cover the southern flank of the 60th (London) Division, forcing the Londoners to pause during daylight, as enfilading fire would have made any advance extremely costly.|$|E

5|$|The North Circular Road {{forms the}} {{northern}} part of a ring-road around Central London. It has seen substantially more investment than its counterpart, the South Circular Road, and consequently runs on more purpose-built road than urban streets, often coupled with demolition of existing houses and urban infrastructure. Although the route has alternative names at some points, it is generally referred to as the North Circular throughout for route planning purposes. The route is mostly grade-separated dual carriageway from the A40 at Hanger Lane to the A13 in Beckton except for the Drury Way/Brentfield <b>Road</b> <b>junction,</b> the Golders Green Road/Brent Street junction, Henlys Corner and the section from Bounds Green to Green Lanes. In areas where improvements made slowest progress and upgrades are unlikely, the original names such as Gunnersbury Avenue and Bowes Road are used.|$|E
5|$|The next day, the LSSAH struck southwards {{towards the}} Kharkov River from Peiper's bridgehead, {{clearing}} Soviet resistance block by block. In {{a bid to}} trap the city's defenders in the center, the 1st Battalion of the 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment re-entered the city using the Volchansk exit road. At the same time, Peiper's forces were able to breakout south, suffering from bitter fighting against a tenacious Soviet defense, and link up with the division's left wing at the Volchansk and Chuhuiv <b>road</b> <b>junction.</b> Although the majority of Das Reich had, by now, disengaged from the city, a single Panzergrenadier Regiment remained to clear the southwestern corner of the city, eliminating resistance {{by the end of}} the day. This effectively put two-thirds of the city under German control.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was launched on 16 December 1944 and enjoyed initial success, but it quickly {{suffered from a}} lack of air cover and the inexperience in some of its infantry component, and critically short fuel supply. Sixth SS Panzer Army met heavy allied resistance, and while Fifth Panzer Army managed to make a deep thrust into Allied line, Model was unable to exploit the breakthrough there. He had failed to capture a vital <b>road</b> <b>junction</b> at Bastogne, and this in combination with poor weather and difficult terrain, caused the German columns to back up into huge traffic jams on the roads behind the front. Starved of fuel and ammunition, the attack had broken down by 25 December, and was abandoned on 8 January.|$|E
