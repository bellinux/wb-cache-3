40|$|Aim To {{assess the}} {{outcomes}} of <b>rectal</b> <b>suspension</b> procedures (forms of rectopexy) in adults with chronic constipation. Method Standardised methods and reporting of benefits and harms were used for all CapaCiTY reviews that closely adhered to PRISMA 2016 guidance. Main conclusions were presented as summary evidence statements with a summative Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (2009) level. Results Eighteen articles were identified, providing data on outcomes in 1238 patients. All studies reported only on laparoscopic approaches. Length of procedures ranged between 1. 5 to 3. 5 h, and length of stay between 4 to 5 days. Data on harms were inconsistently reported and heterogeneous, making estimates of harm tentative and imprecise. Morbidity rates ranged between 5 – 15...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} a candidate formulation for further development of a home or near-home administrable paediatric rectal form of a broad-spectrum antibiotic – specially intended for (emergency) use in tropical rural settings, in particular for children who cannot take medications orally and far from health facilities where injectable treatments can be given. Azithromycin, a broad-spectrum macrolide used orally or intravenously for the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections, was selected because of its pharmacokinetic and therapeutic properties. Azithromycin in vitro solubility and stability in physiologically relevant conditions were studied. Various pharmaceutical forms, i. e. <b>rectal</b> <b>suspension,</b> two different rectal gels, polyethylene glycol (PEG) suppository and hard gelatin capsule (HGC) were assessed for in vitro dissolution and in vivo bioavailability in the rabbit. Azithromycin PEG suppository appears to be a promising candidate...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigations}} in this dissertation have been 'conducted {{to investigate the}} formulation and analysis of a paediatric amoxycillin suppository. The oral administration of antibiotics to young children can at times be roblematic. Compliance is sometimes poor because of a sore throat, nausea, vomiting, a high fever or a dislike for the taste or smell of the medicine:- In-such cases the rectal administration of an antibiotic could provide an alternative route of administration that avoids {{some of the problems}} that affect oral administration. Difficulties associated with rectal administration are bioavailability, local irritation, acceptability to patients and rejection of the dosage form. Few data, however, are available on the usefulness in children of suppositories in general, and antibiotic suppositories in particular. The areas of investigation have included the formulation of an amoxycillin suppository in various fatty bases, the quantitation of amoxycillin in both aqueous solution and human serum, assessment of stability of amoxycillin in stored aqueous and biological samples, in vitro drug release testing of suppositories, and bioavailability and pharmacokinetics following administration to human subjects of capsule, suppository, oral suspension and <b>rectal</b> <b>suspension</b> dosage forms. Suppositories containing 250 mg amoxycillin were prepared in theobroma oil and in the semisynthetic bases Witepso[W 35, Suppocire A 32, Novata BD and Novata 299. The in vitro release characteristics of amoxycillin from these lipophilic suppository formulations were investigated using the USP rotating basket method. The dissolution of a drug from a solid dosage unit is an important parameter affecting drug bioavialability. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used as the main analytical technique. An original HPLC method for analysis of amoxycillin in aqueous solution, using ultraviolet detection at 230 nm was develcfped. The validated method was a~plied to the determination of the stability of aqueous amoxycillin solutions, and was utilized to determine the amount of drug released during dissolution testing. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a technique commonly used in preformulation studies. Dissolution testing was used in conjunction with DSC to select a suppository base suitable for formulation with amoxycillin trihydrate. An HPLC method for analysis of amoxycillin in human serum using UV detection at 230 nm is presented. The method involves a solid phase extraction procedure followed by chromatography on a reversed phase column. The limit of sensitivity of 0. 3 ILg/mL in serum is sufficiently sensitive to monitor serum concentrations of amoxycillin in humans after the administration of a single 250 mg oral dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from data obtained following the administration of a capsule and oral suspension. These parameters were consistent with previously published results. Following administration of a lipophilic suppository and a <b>rectal</b> <b>suspension,</b> to human volunteers, it was concluded that amoxycillin trihydrate is not readily absorbed from the rectum. Further {{investigations in}}to the modification of the suppository dosage form with absorption enhancers to improve rectal absorption of amoxycillin, as well as elucidation of the mechanism of absorption of the drug, could assist in improving this formulation so that it is suitable for paediatric use...|$|E
40|$|Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) {{are rapidly}} {{spreading}} worldwide. Early detection of fecal CPE carriers {{is essential for}} effective infection control. Here, we evaluated {{the performance of a}} meropenem combined disk test (CDT) for rapidly differentiating CPE isolates directly from rectal swabs. The screening method was applied for 189 rectal swabs from hospitalized patients at high risk for CPE carriage. Swabs were suspended in 1 ml saline and cultured for confluent growth onto a MacConkey agar plate with a meropenem (MER) disk alone, a MER disk plus phenyl boronic acid (PBA), a MER disk plus EDTA, and a MER disk plus PBA and EDTA. An inhibition zone of = 5 -mm differences in the inhibition zone between MER disks without and with the inhibitors (PBA, EDTA, or both) were considered positive results for detecting Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL), or both carbapenemases, respectively. For comparison, <b>rectal</b> <b>suspensions</b> were tested using MacConkey plates with ertapenem (MacERT) disks and PCR (PCR-S) for carbapenemase genes. Of the 189 samples, 97 were genotypically confirmed as CPE positive by one of the three protocols tested. The CDT, MacERT disks, and PCR-S assays exhibited sensitivities of 94. 8 %, 96. 9 %, and 94. 8 % and specificities of 100 %, 98. 9 %, and 100 %, respectively, for detecting CPE-positive swabs. Moreover, the CDT correctly differentiated the production of KPC, MBL, or both carbapenemases in 78 of the 97 (80. 4 %) CPE-positive rectal swabs. Our results demonstrate that the CDT may provide a simple and inexpensive method for detecting and differentiating the carbapenemase type within a single day without requiring further testing and additional delay, supporting the timely implementation of infection control measures...|$|R
40|$|Sand enteropathy is {{a common}} form of equine colic in Finland. Detection of sand in the faeces of a horse is a widely known {{diagnostic}} method for intestinal sand accumulations. The plastic glove test is a faecal sand sedimentation test recognized by many equine practitioners. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test is unknown, which restricts {{the use of the}} test. The main objective of this licentiate thesis was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the plastic glove test. The most reliable diagnostic method for intestinal sand accumulations is abdominal radiography, and therefore it was used as a gold standard method against which the plastic glove test was compared. The hypothesis was that there is a positive correlation between the results of the plastic glove test and abdominal radiography. The study was conducted by collecting a faecal sample and an abdominal radiograph from each participating horse. A total of 63 faecal samples were collected from 61 different horses. All the horses were patients at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Helsinki University. The cranioventral abdomen of each horse was radiographed, and the length and height of the sand accumulations were recorded. The plastic glove test was performed by mixing faecal material (~ 200 grams) and water (1 litre) inside a <b>rectal</b> sleeve. The <b>suspension</b> was left to hang, and the amount of sand sediment in the fingertips was recorded after 30 minutes and 24 hours. Each fingertip of the glove was assessed separately on a 0 - 3 numerical scale and then added up to make a total score out of 15 for each horse. The results were compared in a 2 X 2 table and ROC analysis. According to this study, the sensitivity of the plastic glove test is 82, 61 % (95 % confidence interval 68, 58 % to 92, 18 %) and the specificity is 71, 43 % (95 % confidence interval 41, 90 % to 91, 61 %). The positive predictive value is 90, 48 %, while the negative predictive value is only 55, 56 %. In the ROC analysis the area under the curve (AUC) is 0, 771 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0, 644 to 0, 870. The plastic glove test is a moderately accurate diagnostic test. A positive test result is usually correct, but it does not inform the severity of the condition. It can be used as an indication for further examinations or treatment. A single negative test result should not be used to exclude the disease. The plastic glove test can be a helpful tool in the diagnosis of sand enteropathy in the horse, but should not be relied on as the sole method of diagnosis due to the poor specificity of the test. Since the reference population in this study was the patient material of the Equine Hospital, more reliable results could be obtained by using a more comprehensive and randomized representation of the entire Finnish horse population. It {{should also be noted that}} 29 % of the horses had been treated with psyllium and/or magnesium sulphate prior to the testing...|$|R
40|$|Aim This {{manuscript}} {{provides the}} introduction and detailed methodology used in subsequent reviews {{to assess the}} outcomes of surgical interventions with the primary intent of treating chronic constipation in adults and to develop recommendations for practice. Method PRISMA guidance was adhered to throughout. A literature search was performed in public databases between January 1960 and February 2016. Studies that fulfilled strictly-defined PICOS (patients, interventions, controls, outcome, and study design) criteria were included. The process involved two groups of participants: (i) : ‘a clinical guidance group’ of 18 UK experts (including junior support) who performed the systematic reviews and produced summary evidence statements (SES) based strictly on data synthesis in each review. The same group then produced prototype graded practice recommendations (GPRs) based on coalescence of SES and expert opinion; (ii) : a European Consensus group of 18 ESCP (European Society of Coloproctology) nominated experts from nine European countries evaluated the appropriateness of each prototype GPR based on published RAND/UCLA methodology. Results An overview of the search results is provided in this manuscript. A total of 156 studies from 307 full text articles (from 2551 initially screened records) were included, providing data on procedures characterized by: (i) colonic resection (n = 40); (ii) <b>rectal</b> <b>suspension</b> (n = 18); (iii) rectal wall excision (n = 44); (iv) rectovaginal septum reinforcement (n = 47); (v) sacral nerve stimulation (n = 7). The overall quality of evidence was poor with 113 / 156 (72. 4...|$|E
