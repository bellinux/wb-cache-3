40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track III: Energy InfrastructureRefrigerated {{display cases}} are utilized by supermarkets to store and display food products {{in a manner}} that extends food shelf life and ensures food safety. Supermarkets operate their refrigeration systems continuously to maintain proper food storage conditions. Continual operation of this refrigeration equipment on a nationwide scale accounts for approximately 0. 33 quads/yr of electrical energy. Infiltration accounts for over 70 % of the refrigeration load in open refrigerated display cases. Clearly, an increase in the energy efficiency of refrigerated display cases will result in significantly reduced energy consumption and cost. Thus, the objective of this project is to compare a typical open <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>case</b> to a typical glass-doored <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>case</b> with the aim of quantifying the following: •	The difference in overall energy consumption between the cases. •	The normalized difference in food product sales between the cases. Two supermarkets are being used as test sites, which are similarly situated to ensure that climate, weather, time-of-year and economic conditions of the shoppers are comparable. One supermarket will receive an open <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>case</b> and the other will receive a doored <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>case.</b> Each <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>case</b> will be a medium temperature, self-service prepackaged deli or beverage case between 8 and 25 nominal linear feet.

40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} decreasing indoor ambient relative humidity on the performance and energy use of four different types of refrigerated display cases commonly used in supermarkets. A correlation was established between decreasing indoor relative humidity and eleven key parameters. Results of the study indicate {{that there is a}} direct relation between the indoor relative humidity and the weight of moisture removed from the air during the process of refrigeration. Open vertical meat and dairy fixtures demonstrated more vulnerability to humidity variations, and removed more moisture from the air, than the coffin and reach-in units. Decreasing indoor relative humidity had an immediate impact on the latent load of all fixtures. The effect of latent load reduction, as a result of lowering indoor humidity, was reflected directly on the evaporator coil load and consequently the power consumption of the test compressor. The study also provides important quantification of the impact of reduced indoor relative humidity on the length of time required for reach-in freezer door fogging to be cleared. Lowering the relative humidity from 50 % to 35 % resulted in 69. 2 % reduction in fog recovery time. It is recommended that store designers and operators reexamine HVAC and <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>case</b> designs to obtain economic benefits from the effects of reducing humidity through HVAC systems and optimizing energy use and demand.

40|$|Refrigeration {{systems in}} {{supermarkets}} and convenience stores operate continuously to maintain proper product storage conditions, and these refrigeration systems {{can account for}} 40 % {{or more of the}} electrical energy consumption of a supermarket or convenience store. Â Peak refrigeration system electricity demand typically occurs during the afternoon and summer months, corresponding to when the general demand and price for electricity are the highest. Â In order to reduce peak demand and its associated costs, {{it may be possible to}} shift refrigeration system electrical energy use by utilizing the thermal mass of the stored product. Refrigeration system capacities vary from 30 - 60 KW in small store to over 400 KW for large stores with annual energy consumption varying from 1 - 1. 5 million kWh. During early morning hours, when electricity demand and price are lower and refrigeration system efficiency is greater, the temperature set point of the refrigeration system can be reduced in order to pre-cool the stored products to below their normal storage temperature. Â Subsequently, refrigeration system operation can be reduced during the mid to late afternoon when electricity demand and price are high, and product temperature may be allowed to drift upwards. Â This operating strategy is particularly feasible with products that are not adversely affected by variations in temperature, such as water and canned or bottled beverages. The key to utilizing the thermal storage is to understand the storage potential and associated time constants of the display cases. To determine the feasibility of reducing peak demand by shifting the refrigeration load to off-peak times, experimental and analytical analyses were performed. Â Simulated product, consisting of one-pint containers filled with a 50 % ethylene glycol and 50 % water solution, were stored in a medium-temperature vertical open <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>case.</b> Â Product temperature rise as a function of time was determined by turning off the refrigeration to the display case, while product temperature pull-down time was subsequently determined by turning on the refrigeration to the display case. Â It was found that the thermal mass of the product in the display case was such that during a 2. 5 hour period with no refrigeration, the average product temperature increased by 10 Â°F. Â In addition, it took approximately 3. 5 hours for the product to recover to its initial temperature after the refrigeration was turned on. Using transient heat conduction analyses for one-dimensional objects (such as infinite slabs, infinite cylinders, or spheres), cooling or heating times of various objects may be estimated. Â For example, analytical methods predict that heating a cylindrical product by 10 Â°F (from 30 Â°F to 40 Â°F) would take approximately 2. 2 hours, which is in good agreement with the experimental results obtained in this study. Â From the analysis, it appears that the thermal mass of the stored product in refrigerated display cases is sufficient to allow product temperatures to safely drift for a significant time under reduced refrigeration system operation. Â Thus, strategies for shifting refrigeration system electrical demand can be developed. Â The use of an advanced refrigeration system controller that can respond to utility signals can enable demand shifting with minimal impact...|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} multiplex direct expansion (DX) {{refrigeration system}} used in commercial applications {{is prone to}} significant refrigerant leakage, especially older existing systems. Â EPA (2012) estimates that the U. S. supermarket industry-wide average refrigerant emission rate is approximately 25 %. Â The use of high Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants in these systems, combined with high refrigerant leakage, can result in considerable direct carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 eq) emissions. Â In addition, commercial refrigeration systems consume {{a substantial amount of}} electrical energy, resulting in high indirect CO 2 eq emissions. Â Thus, there are ongoing efforts to reduce both the direct and indirect environmental impacts of commercial refrigeration systems through the use of leak reduction measures, refrigerant charge minimization, low GWP refrigerants and energy efficiency measures. Based on prior energy and life cycle climate performance (LCCP) analyses, it was determined that a transcritical CO 2 booster refrigeration system for supermarket applications has the potential to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy efficiency. Â To that end, a lab-scale transcritical CO 2 booster refrigeration system was fabricated and installed in the environmental test chambers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Â This system consists of a transcritical CO 2 compressor rack, an air-cooled gas cooler/condenser, medium-temperature (MT) and low-temperature (LT) <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>cases,</b> and MT and LT â€œfalseâ€ loads. Â The lab-scale refrigeration system has a low-temperature cooling capacity of approximately 9. 1 Â kW at âˆ’ 30 Â°C and a medium-temperature cooling capacity of approximately 34 Â kW at âˆ’ 6. 7 Â°C. Â One 4 -door vertical <b>display</b> <b>case,</b> 3. 0 Â m in length, as well as a â€œfalseâ€ load provided by a plate heat exchanger and a glycol loop, constitutes the low-temperature load. Â The medium-temperature load consists of one open vertical <b>display</b> <b>case,</b> 2. 4 Â m in length, as well as a â€œfalseâ€ load provided by a plate heat exchanger and glycol loop. The air-cooled gas cooler/condenser is installed in a temperature and humidity controlled â€œoutdoorâ€ environmental chamber while the compressor rack and <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> are installed in a separate temperature and humidity controlled â€œindoorâ€ environmental chamber. Â For both chambers, the temperature can be controlled between âˆ’ 18 to 65 Â°C and the humidity can be controlled between 30 to 90 %. The performance of the transcritical CO 2 booster refrigeration system was determined at four ambient temperature conditions (15. 6 Â°C, 21. 1 Â°C, 26. 7 Â°C and 32. 2 Â°C). Â After the refrigeration system achieved steady-state operation at each of the four ambient temperature conditions, system performance data was collected for a 24 -hour period. Â Over the temperature range of 15. 6 to 32. 2 Â°C, the total load on the system was found to remain relatively constant. Â In addition, the compressor power was found to increase by approximately 78 % over this same temperature range. Â Thus, the resulting coefficient of performance (COP) of the system was found to vary from 2. 2 (at 32. 2 Â°C) to 4. 1 (at 15. 6 Â°C).

In the first one, {{the aim is to}} model and simulate a solar-powered, single-effect, absorption refrigeration system using a flat-plate solar collector and LiBr-H 2 O mixture as the working fluid. The cooling capacity and the coefficient of performance of the system are analyzed by varying all independent parameters, namely: evaporator pressure, condenser pressure, mass flow rate, LiBr concentration, and inlet generator temperature. The cooling performance of the system is compared with conventional vapor-compression systems for different refrigerants (R- 134 a, R- 32, and R- 22). The cooling performance is also assessed for a typical year in Tampa, Florida. Higher COP values are obtained for a lower LiBr concentration in the solution. The effects of evaporator and condenser pressures on the cooling capacity and cooling performance are found to be negligible. The LiBr-H 2 O solution shows higher cooling performance compared to other mixtures under the same absorption cooling cycle conditions. For typical year in Tampa, Florida, the model shows a constant coefficient of performance of 0. 94. In the second problem, a numerical model is developed for a typical food retail store refrigeration/HVAC system to study the effects of indoor space conditions on supermarket energy consumption. <b>Refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> are normally rated at a store environment of 24 ºC (75 ºF) and a relative humidity of 55 %.

This results in a 24 hour variation in the store relative humidity. Using these calculated hourly values of relative humidity for a typical 24 hour day, the store relative humidity distribution is calculated for a full year.

Based on this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) program was developed that assisted the researchers in specifying those flow parameters and geometrical configurations that minimized the infiltration rate, and the cooling load thereafter. A <b>display</b> <b>case,</b> based on these design specifications, was fabricated and tested.

40|$|OpenStudio, {{developed}} at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), is a cross-platform collection of simulation tools for whole building energy modeling. EnergyPlus and Radiance are the primary simulation engines in OpenStudio and the latest addition {{is a collection of}} refrigeration objects {{developed at}} the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) which makes the refrigeration system components of EnergyPlus available for use through OpenStudio. This paper highlights the benefits of including refrigeration modeling functionality in OpenStudio, the object model, the exposed Application Programming Interface, and discusses some of the design challenges faced. The project was implemented in four phases with each phase focusing on one aspect of the software. An initial set of EnergyPlus refrigeration components were selected and implemented, following which, additional components in decreasing order of priority were implemented. An Agile software development philosophy was employed along with modern source control tools such as GitHub. During the initial design, six main refrigeration components were determined to be critically important. These were Refrigeration System, Compressor, <b>Display</b> <b>Case,</b> Walk-In, Air-Cooled Condenser and Secondary System. Scripts were used to automatically convert various objects from the EnergyPlus Input Data Dictionary (IDD) file into C++ code. These prototypical source code files for the refrigeration objects were then modified to allow full instantiation of the objects. The objects, complete with their unit tests, were then submitted for integration into the main development branch of the software. During the second phase, the following components were implemented: Mechanical Subcooler, Liquid-Suction Subcooler, Cascade Condenser, Evaporative-Cooled Condenser, and Water-Cooled Condenser. During the third phase, the remaining refrigeration components from EnergyPlus were added: Air Chillers, Transcritical Refrigeration System, Transcritical Compressors, Air-Cooled Gas Cooler and waste heat recovery using the Air Heating Desuperheater Coil or the Water Heating Desuperheater Coil. In addition, EnergyPlus comes with metadata information of hundreds of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> and refrigeration compressors. These were added to the U. S. Department of Energy’s Building Component Library (BCL), which is a comprehensive online digital library of various building blocks of an energy model. During the fourth and final phase, documentation of the developed Application Programming Interface was created. In all phases, close collaboration with multi-lab partners was maintained who provided extensive support and developmental feedback to the ORNL team. It is expected that the addition of these refrigeration components fills a gap and will enhance the successful adoption of OpenStudio as a modeling tool of choice in the buildings simulation community. Furthermore, it is hoped that these refrigeration capabilities will allow retailers to assess the energy impact of a variety of supermarket and distribution facility refrigeration system design options and aid in the selection and implementation of energy efficient systems...|$|R
40|$|Evaporator {{fan motors}} used in {{commercial}} refrigeration applications are fractional horsepower in size, {{are responsible for}} moving air across the evaporator coil, and typically run at one speed. Historically, shaded-pole motors {{have been the most}} commonly used evaporator fan motors in commercial refrigeration equipment and beverage vending machines. These motors, a type of single-phase AC induction motor, are the simplest and least expensive type of fractional-horsepower motor. They are also the least efficient, with the common 9 â€“ 12 W sizes exhibiting an efficiency of approximately 20 %. Electronically commutated (EC) motors, also known as brushless DC motors, became widely commercialized in the late 1980 s, and their use in commercial refrigeration applications has increased within the last 10 to 15 years because of economic incentives and regulatory requirements. Another motor type, the permanent split capacitor (PSC) motor, offers a mid-point between shaded-pole and EC motor price and efficiency levels. Typically for commercial refrigeration evaporator fan motor applications, EC motors are 66 % efficient and PSC motors are usually about 29 % efficient. Â A new motor technology, a type of permanent magnet synchronous AC motor that can directly use grid-supplied AC current without the need to rectify to DC, has recently been commercialized. This new motor has the potential to significantly reduce the energy consumption of evaporator fans in commercial refrigeration equipment. Previously, synchronous motors have been prohibitively expensive for evaporator fan applications because of the high cost of the electronic control circuit that is required to bring the synchronous motor up to synchronous speed. However, this new motor technology makes use of a novel patent-pending controller that is simpler and lower in cost than previous synchronous motor controllers or EC motor controllers, making the new motor a cost-effective alternative in the commercial refrigeration market. Â In this paper, the results of field demonstrations, consisting of side-by-side measurements of the power consumption of the new motor technology versus shaded-pole, PSC, or EC evaporator fan motors in identical <b>refrigerated</b> <b>display</b> <b>cases,</b> are presented. Measured quantities include fan motor power, current, and power factor, as well as <b>display</b> <b>case</b> discharge and return air temperatures and ambient store temperature. Currently, field demonstrations are being conducted at six supermarkets and commissaries located in Kansas City, MO, San Antonio, TX and San Diego, CA, with the duration of these tests ranging from approximately one month to over six months. Initial results from the field demonstrations indicate that the new synchronous AC motor technology is approximately 20 to 30 % more energy efficient than existing EC motors and nearly 80 % more energy efficient than shaded-pole motors. In addition, the new motor exhibits a power factor of approximately 0. 86, which is on average 40 % greater than that of existing evaporator fan motors. Analyses indicate that retrofitting the installed base of commercial refrigeration evaporator fan motors with the new motors would produce a 68 % evaporator fan site energy savings, or 4. 9 Ã— 109 Â kWh/year for the installed base of commercial refrigeration evaporator fan motors. This would result in an annual cost savings of $ 516 million and reduce the annual CO 2 equivalent emissions by 8. 1 Ã— 109 Â lb...|$|R
