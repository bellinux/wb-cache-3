5|$|In a {{preface to}} his 1926 drama Korbannja Kong-Ek (The Victim of Kong-Ek), Kwee Tek Hoay {{wrote that he}} had drawn {{inspiration}} from the realist Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in that work, having read and <b>reread</b> <b>the</b> author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in Allah jang Palsoe. He compares the stage directions in Allah jang Palsoe to those in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and finds them to be similar in their level of detail.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked to think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly <b>reread</b> <b>the</b> novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E

He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing. His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him {{a few years of}} private education, first at a dame school, and then at a school run by William Giles, a dissenter, in Chatham.|$|E
25|$|Contemporaries of Discovery usually {{received}} the work very positively. Louis, Prince of Prussia, expressed {{his admiration for}} {{the first volume of}} Discovery in a letter to Campe. He excuses his late reply to a previous letter by saying that he first had to <b>reread</b> <b>the</b> book several times and that he wished he possessed all those virtues of Columbus. An anonymous reviewer in the German Enlightenment journal Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek praises Campe’s choice of topic and its utility but wishes for a more structured approach instead of the narratives. Of the general criticism that the German new humanists and others presented against philanthropinist children’s literature, Campe was usually exempt. Towards {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, however, the dialogue form had lost its appeal and in 1890 a revised German edition was published that eliminated the dialogue and solely related the narrative.|$|E

500|$|As a youth, Lincoln {{disliked the}} hard labor {{associated}} with frontier life. Some {{of his neighbors}} and family members thought for a {{time that he was}} lazy for all his [...] "reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc.", and must have done it to avoid manual labor. His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy [...] "physical labor", but loved to read. Lincoln was largely self-educated. His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent, the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning. Family, neighbors, and schoolmates of Lincoln's youth recalled that he read and <b>reread</b> <b>the</b> King James Bible, Aesop's Fables, Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Weems's The Life of Washington, and Franklin's Autobiography, among others.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{the novel}} was adapted into an {{illustrated}} hardback children's book by Janet Schulman, illustrated by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher, {{and published by}} Simon & Schuster {{as part of its}} [...] "Atheneum Books for Young Readers" [...] imprint. In the adaptation, Schulman attempted to retain some of the lyrical feel of the original novel. She notes that rather than rewrite the novel, she [...] "replicated Salten's language almost completely. I <b>reread</b> <b>the</b> novel a number of times and then I went through and highlighted the dialogue and poignant sentences Salten had written." [...] Doing so retained much of the novel's original lyrical feel, though the book's brevity did result in a sacrifice of some of the [...] "majesty and mystery" [...] found in the novel. The illustrations were created to appear as realistic as possible, using painted images rather than sketches. In 2002, the Schulman adaptation was released in audiobook format by Audio Bookshelf, with Frank Dolan as the reader.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Sci Fi Wire, Sanderson stated {{it was a great}} honor to be given the chance to complete the series but conceded he was unable to fill Jordan's shoes. Some parts of the book were nearly finished by Jordan, while others have only a couple of paragraphs to describe a twenty-page scene, but he describes Jordan's notes as [...] "amazing." [...] He later elaborated that [...] "the amount of material [...] left behind is what makes this book possible." [...] Speaking to The Guardian, he stated that although some people wouldn't like the book, and any failures would be blamed on him, [...] "I say that I win because I get to be part of this." [...] Through February 2008 Sanderson <b>reread</b> <b>the</b> entire series, posting his impressions of each book on his blog. The reread lasted until March 2008, at which point he [...] "began to grasp the daunting nature of this book," [...] with so many plot lines that needed to be resolved.|$|E

500|$|The scheme {{proposed}} by the pope was for twelve large figures of the Apostles to occupy the pendentives. However, Michelangelo negotiated for a grander, much more complex scheme and was finally permitted, in his own words, [...] "to do as I liked". His scheme for the ceiling eventually comprised some three hundred figures and took four years to execute, being completed and shown to the public on All Saints Day in 1512 after a preliminary showing and papal Mass on August 14, 1511. It is unknown and {{is the subject of}} much speculation among art historians whether Michelangelo was really able to [...] "do as he liked". It has been suggested that the Augustinian friar and cardinal, Giles of Viterbo, was a consultant for the theological aspect of the work. Many writers consider that Michelangelo had the intellect, the Biblical knowledge, and the powers of invention to have devised the scheme himself. This is supported by Ascanio Condivi's statement that Michelangelo read and <b>reread</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament while he was painting the ceiling, drawing his inspiration from the words of the scripture, rather than from the established traditions of sacral art.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, {{three years}} after {{retiring}} from the Court, Powell {{told a group of}} New York University law students that he considered his opinion in Bowers an error. “I do think it was inconsistent in a general way with Roe. When I had the opportunity to <b>reread</b> <b>the</b> opinions a few months later I thought the dissent had the better of the arguments."

2500|$|The German Millionaires risk format {{features}} an extra lifeline called [...] "Ask One of the Audience", {{in which the}} host will <b>reread</b> <b>the</b> question and ask the audience who think {{they would be able}} to answer that question to stand up.

This lifeline is also implemented in the Costa Rican version, after the first milestone is reached. Starting in its thirteenth season, the U.S. syndicated version uses a variant of this lifeline, called [...] "Plus One", which allows the contestant to bring a companion with them for help, rather than having them select their companion from the audience.|$|E
2500|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{noted in}} his {{autobiography}} that his first encounter {{with the idea of}} nonviolent resistance was reading [...] "On Civil Disobedience" [...] in 1944 while attending Morehouse College. He wrote in his autobiography that it was, Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I <b>reread</b> <b>the</b> work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.|$|E
