Historically, councils had to send Business <b>Rate</b> <b>revenue</b> to the government, while the government provided a large grant to councils based on need. Under the Cameron Ministry, the Business rate system was changed, so that councils keep 50% of the revenue; the central government grant was correspondingly reduced, and hypothecated streams merged into the general grant. The central grant has continued to fall, and shortly councils will retain 100% of Business <b>Rate</b> <b>revenue.</b> The grant has also fallen due to school funding being transferred directly to new Academy schools, and Housing Benefit (paid via the council) being replaced by centrally paid Universal Credit.|$|R

40|$|The {{value-added}} tax (VAT) in China has the unusual feature that capital goods {{are included in}} the VAT base. In addition, most services are subject to the business tax, which is not creditable against VAT, but which accrues to local governments, and operates as a turnover tax. On grounds of economic efficiency, it would be desirable to eliminate these distortions so that domestic producers are not increasingly placed at a disadvantage as China dismantles tariff and nontariff barriers on competing goods. Reforming indirect taxation would however generate considerable revenue losses for local governments and, {{in the absence of any}} compensatory mechanisms, there would be significant impediments to the needed reforms.

This report recommends reforms to help achieve our aims of: promoting early access to legal and financial counselling help for ratepayers experiencing financial hardship; reducing unnecessary court proceedings by identifying more appropriate ways for councils to seek payment of rates arrears; avoiding court and legal costs being added to unpaid rates debts; and encouraging consistent, ethical debt collection practices by councils across Victoria.

The £ 1 billion funding for the Northern Line extension to the London underground was also considered to be an innovative method of funding; with the entire project being funded with the intention of no detriment to the British taxpayer. This involved the Greater London Authority borrowing the £ 1 billion, with a repayment guarantee provided by the UK Government to minimise borrowing costs [28]. The loan repayments are then to be made through contributions from local developers (to be collected by the local authorities) and through the growth in business <b>rates</b> <b>revenue</b> within the enterprise zone in which the extension is to be built. Over time these funding sources are expected to cover the complete repayment of the loan [28].

40|$|Trader, BrianNonprofit institutions, {{including}} cultural attractions such {{as public}} gardens, seek revenue from diverse sources, including individual {{contributions in the}} form of membership dues. Despite their widespread popularity at cultural institutions, the role and importance of membership programs is not well documented. Based on gaps in previously published research, this study explored similarities and differences in the administration and success of membership programs at public gardens in the United States. The objectives of this research were to distinguish different types of membership programs, signify the role of membership in fundraising initiatives at public gardens, and document the success of membership programs at public gardens. Quantitative research, including a background study and a survey, recorded information regarding the administration of nearly 300 institutions. Participating gardens were analyzed based on categories of cost (No admission or Yes admission), size based on operating budget (Small, Medium, or Large), and governance (Independent, University, or Municipal). Aspects such as operating budget, visitation, number of memberships, levels, benefits, staffing, member retention <b>rates,</b> <b>revenue</b> generated, and cost of program administration were collected to better analyze administration of membership programs. The results of this study revealed that while much of membership administration remains the same across garden categories, there were several significant differences based on cost, size, and governance. Three areas of significant difference were observed when comparing No admission gardens with Yes admission gardens: number of memberships, cost of lowest-level membership, and member retention rates. Similarly garden governance displayed only three areas of significant difference: garden visitation, types of memberships offered, and cost of the lowest level of membership. The size (operating budget) of the garden most frequently had a significant interaction with the administration of membership programs. Significant interactions based on size were observed in nine different areas: operating budget, total garden FTE (full-time equivalent) staffing, FTE dedicated to membership, garden visitation, cost of admission, number of garden memberships, cost to administer membership program, cost of lowest-level membership, and member retention rate. Most often, the significant differences were observed between Large gardens as compared with Medium or Small gardens; there were almost no significant differences between Medium and Small gardens. Most notably, while visitation, number of memberships, and number of staff increased proportionately along with operating budget, average annual member retention rate was lowest for Large gardens, as compared with Small or Medium gardens. Through this research, membership programs were found to be valuable in their ability to generate revenue, add prospective donors, and connect people with the mission of the organization. Additionally, this study revealed a great need for defining industry-wide metrics for use in measuring success of membership programs. While there is much room for additional research in terms of defining and tracking the success of membership, this research adds to the body of knowledge that begins to address similarities and differences in membership programs and their role in the fulfillment of mission at public gardens.

40|$|The {{availability}} of tax revenue data in digital format prompted {{a study of}} Iowa communities {{with respect to their}} general property tax mill rate and {{the presence or absence of}} a hotel and motel tax. Both of these revenue sources are dispersed entirely to the local community. The revenue does not remain in the State 2 ̆ 7 s general fund. Alternative tax revenue sources are an important component in the decision making process of local city planners, city managers and community development administrators.;The intent of this thesis was to determine if there is an association between the general property tax mill rates of Iowa communities and presence of a hotel and motel tax. Do communities with a hotel and motel tax tend to have a higher or lower property tax mill rate? Secondary data available from the U. S. Census Bureau, Iowa Department of Revenue and Iowa Department of Management was used to examine the relationship between the mean property tax mill rate in Iowa communities with the presence of a hotel and motel tax and communities that do not assess the tax. Each community 2 ̆ 7 s population growth rate between 1980 and 2000 was also calculated and used as a control variable. The study years were FY 1998 to FY 2007 and study data for all communities in Iowa was compiled into a master data base.;The findings of this research study were (1) cities with the presence of a hotel and motel tax tend to have, on average, a 2. 05 higher general property tax mill rate than cities without the hotel and motel tax. (2) When population growth rate was used a s a control variable, cities with a hotel and motel tax tended to have a property tax mill rate of. 90 higher than cities without this alternative tax. The intent of this research study was to determine if there was an association between the general property tax mill rate for cities with and without the hotel and motel tax. The study was limited by the number of years for which digital data was available from the State of Iowa.;Planners, community development directors, policy makers and citizen action groups have access to these digital data bases. Findings in the study were not reported for individual cities in Iowa either by population, location or current property tax mill rate. The public digital data files allow individuals to investigate current <b>rates,</b> <b>revenue</b> totals and trends for specific cities. The master data base for this study is included. This data base includes a list of the 954 Iowa communities, population totals for 1980 and 2000, population growth rate for each city, the presence or absence of a hotel and motel tax and the general property tax mill rate for Fiscal Years 1998 to 2007. A second data base lists each city with a hotel and motel tax (1979 - 2007), the intervention date, current tax rate and revenue collected for Fiscal Years 1981 - 2005. Conclusions offered by this study indicate the implementation of a hotel and motel tax by a community may not reduce the general property tax mill rate. The revenue generated by the hotel and motel tax is a viable source of additional revenue to use for both the general operating expenses of a community and the improvement and maintenance of recreation, convention and entertainment facilities and for the promotion of tourism. All of the revenue generated by the hotel and motel tax is available to the local community; none of the revenue collected remains in the Iowa General Fund...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{issues of}} debt and the twin deficits - two serious ‘economic ills’. The central {{issue in this}} thesis (Part II) is on macromodelling of the twin deficits {{in an attempt to}} identify their determinants. This involves an investigation of the underlying theory and empirical evidence to show the workings of the links between debt and the twin deficits and between the twin deficits themselves. The usual practice in both theory and in empirical work, is to take the accounting identity and one or two other variables that are hypothesised to have effects on the twin deficits and posit causal linkages. We try to avoid this by building on the stylized facts on each of the macroeconomic aggregates and linking them to debt issues in building a full structural model of debt and the twin deficits. We arrive at a system of simultaneous equations, which none of the previous theory or empirical work has derived. We rename the deficit system of simultaneous equations which incorporates a debt identity and an output equation the `new twin deficits' model – signifying a departure from the conventional wisdom discussed in the literature survey. With the macromodel, we address three issues simultaneously, which are: (1) the linkages between twin deficits and increased indebtedness. (2) the details of internal policies that have effects on the twin-deficits and increased indebtedness. (3) the linkages between debt, twin-deficits and output. The first issue involves the broader mechanism that explains the link between the government, the private and the external sector balances, and their links to changes in debt. Previous studies on the twin deficits covers {{the first part of this}} issue and gives evidence for the U. S. that the government sector caused the unprecedented level of external deficits in the mid 1980 s and early 1990 s. In our case, we argue that the change in debt equals the external deficits because according to our findings in Part I debt and deficits seem to co-move. Our macromodel also focus on the second issue, that is, the details of the internal policies that affect each of the three sector deficits and eventually increased indebtedness. The variables involved are numerous such as tax policies (<b>rates,</b> <b>revenue</b> elasticities, etc.), financial policies (interest rates, investment versus savings behaviour, etc.), trade policies (import liberalisation/control, exports strategies, exchange rates, prices, etc.), debt policies, etc. as shown in the system of simultaneous equations in Chapter 5. Although the variables are numerous, there are some common ones appearing together in either two or all three of the system of equations which are expected to cause co-movements in the system. Obviously, consideration has to be made on their significance, magnitude and signs. The third issue involves recognising the supply side in response to debt and deficits which are demand-side management. The model thus ensures not only equilibrium in the internal and external sectors but also equilibrium in aggregate supply and the aggregate demand. The former equilibrium always holds because the identity serves as a constraint. For the latter equilibrium to hold, either one or a combination of the price variables found in the system adjust to maintain equilibrium in the short-run, while output adjusts to maintain equilibrium in the long-run. Having outlined the core of the thesis, it is appropriate to comment on the other parts. Part I presents the roots of debt and deficits; how developing countries accumulated debt and how it became a crisis in the 1980 s. The debt and deficits situation in ASEAN in the 1980 s is a particular focus. The essence of debt problem seems to be the adverse economic situation of the 1980 s, against the background of mounting accumulation of debt. Exogenous shocks such as the second oil shock, terms of trade shocks, interest rates hikes, dollar exchange rate appreciation, are among the factors that are associated with debt problems. Debt and deficits co-move in the representative Latin American and ASEAN countries. Differences among regional experiences are highlighted. For example the African countries went into debt problem not because of debt accumulation. The main crux of their problem is non-performance export sector. Excessive lending by creditors are associated with the Latin American countries, apart from loans contracted on floating rates which are associated with valuation changes and capital flight. The ASEAN region moved towards yen credit in the mid 1980 s, presumably insulating their economy with further spill-overs from other NICs' recycling of surpluses. The differences in experiences necessitates different treatment, or case by case approach to debt problems. In Part III, we present some empirical work on aspects of debt management. Debt servicing capacity or creditworthiness is examined using the logit approach. We builtin the marginal and elasticity analysis into the logit model so as to identify which variables are the most significant determinants. The exercise combines variables taken from the balance of payments and financial variables from the balance sheet to detect which variables cause debt servicing breakdown. The breakdown of debt servicing capacity is proxied by reschedulings, taken in terms of probabilities because it is not known a priori that a debtor will become illiquid and unable to repay interest payments falling due. We postulate that it is the foreign exchange scarcity, measured by their net borrowing requirements which comprise of the current account deficits including interest repayments and the principal due, that drive a country to demand for rescheduling. We investigate the determinants of rescheduling for each region separately to capture the differences in their experiences with indebtedness. The most important determinants of rescheduling are; the ratio of the current account deficits to export, the reserves to import ratio and the total debt to exports. In the African sample, the current account deficits to exports, the total debt to exports and the use of IMF credits are the most important determinants for rescheduling. As in the case of the Latin American countries, The current account deficits to exports, the debt service ratio and the use of IMF credit are most important. In ASEAN, the debt service ratio appears to be the single most significant ratio. Thus, the differences in experiences among regions, a cross section for all developing countries will ignore the uniqueness of each region in running into debt servicing difficulties. In the last part of the thesis, the exchange rate management is discussed in Chapter 7, relating exchange rate to import and export demand function to eventually determine the contribution of foreign exchange, through the elasticity approach, towards foreign exchange earnings and reducing debt service. Debt service seems to have links with exchange rates movements. We suggest that devaluation does have positive effects in the ASEAN countries to increase its foreign exchange earnings. Finally, we conclude and suggest some policy implications, especially pertaining to our twin deficit model. It is hoped that ASEAN would turn the already huge debt accumulation to more profitable investments so that not only timely repayment of loans is possible, the growth of output is ensured and the sustained industrialisation is possible...|$|E
