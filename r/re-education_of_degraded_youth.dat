40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explain the theory and {{practice}} of Cognitive Therapeutic Exercise (CTE) for the <b>re-education</b> <b>of</b> orthopaedic ankle disorders. The most important characteristic of CTE is to consider the purpose of the exercises as an appropriate intervention in the cognitive process of motor learning. The methods, therefore, were specifically designed, based on the recent theories of motor learning and neurophysiology. The CTE for <b>re-education</b> <b>of</b> the ankle is divided into three phases : the non-weight-bearing phase, the partial weight-bearing phase, and the full weight-bearing phase. The purpose of the first phase is to re-educate the pressure sensation of the plantar part of the foot and the ankle joint position sense, which supply important informations for postural control. The second phase consists of weight transfer exercises on specially developed therapeutic tools. In the last phase, various postural control exercises are emphasized using a spring-based balance board. The CTE is, therefore, expected to be effective as an innovative approach for <b>re-education</b> <b>of</b> orthopaedic disorders of the ankle. 国立情報学研究所で電子...|$|R

40|$|This bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the topic <b>of</b> options <b>of</b> <b>re-education</b> {{eyesight}} <b>of</b> preschool children with binocular vision disorder. Theoretical part of this thesis {{is divided into three}} chapters. The first chapter is about persons with visual disability, describes visual impairment and the term limited vision, criteria for assessing visual defects, distribution of visual impairment and characterizes binocular vision disorder. The second chapter is about evolution of preschool child, about specifics of evolution of preschool child with visual impairment, about legislative framework of education of children with visual impairment in The Czech Republic, about education and socialization of a child. The third chapter of theoretical part contains the term <b>re-education,</b> possibilities <b>of</b> <b>re-education</b> <b>of</b> binocular vision disorder from a medical point of view and possibilities special education support for children with binocular vision disorder. The main goal of this bachelor´s thesis was to create worksheets for the purpose <b>of</b> <b>re-education</b> in the form of eye exercises in a playful way for preschool children with binocular vision disorder and then verified in practice. Based on interview with educators, from which come requirement to make quality, original and useful worksheets, were made required worksheets different from worksheets which are in classrooms to use next. Final verification of those worksheets was in the same kindergarten where the interview with educators was made. The examined group counted five children boys for and five years aged with different types of binocular vision disorder which are attending nursery garden for visually impaired in České Budějovice. Qualitative approach was chosen as form of research. As the first data collection technique was used observation of children during verifying the worksheets. As the second technique was used holding a semi-structured interview with pedagogues and orthoptical nurse which agreed on need and meaningfulness of making of worksheets. As the third technique was used analysis available documents, folders with worksheets, registration lists, medical reports in classroom of nursery garden for visually impaired. Thanks to interview with orthoptic nurse was given comprehensive description orthoptical and pleoptical instruments and influencing factors of children´s motivation during pleoptical and orthoptical exercises in general. The interview with pedagogue and orthoptic nurse shows that all of them cooperate during <b>re-education</b> <b>of</b> sight of children with binocular vision disorder. Both sides consult on worksheets as a meaningful and creative form <b>of</b> <b>re-education</b> <b>of</b> sight, which availability is not so sufficient and which must meet certain criteria to reach <b>re-education</b> <b>of</b> binocular sight the correct way. By research investigation was found that clarity of task and its interpretation is essential during the work with group of preschool children. If child is filling the worksheet with supposed process, it occurs in the strengthening of the visual-motor coordination coordination device of coloring or leading lines by concrete direction. Child must also turn in area of visual perception on the differentiation of figure and background to reach desired results in context to task and content of worksheet. In tasks for visual distinction child must connect properties of object in confrontation with reality and differ by sight different and same objects. By filling one of those lists child trains vision analysis and synthesis of an object in background, which is divided by lines in front of the object. Visual memory, vocabulary and connection to real experiences child trains in worksheets where it confronts pictures with real frames, animals and objects. A child has also possibility to train motion of eyes on line of tasks in tables or rows...|$|R

40|$|Background: Tendon {{transfer}} {{surgery is}} usually {{done to improve}} function, following damage to either major nerve trunks or peripheral nerves. <b>Re-education</b> <b>of</b> the muscle is of utmost importance to gain functional activity. To achieve this, along with re-education exercises, faradic stimulation is usually used. Unipolar Acu-Stim (UAS), is an innovative technique where an acupuncture needle is used to stimulate the transferred tendon with Surged Faradic Currents (SFC). The objective {{of the study is}} to identify if the application of SFC using UAS method, is effective to re-educate a transferred muscle. Case Description: The subject was a 24 year old male who had a loss of finger and thumb extension following Posterior Interosseous Nerve (PIN) palsy, for which Flexor Carpi Radialis (FCR) was transferred to Extensor Digitorum Communis (EDC) and Palmaris Longus (PL) was transferred to Extensor Pollicis Longus (EPL). Following removal of the POP, UAS with surged faradic current was applied for 4 weeks along with <b>re-education</b> exercises. Prognosis <b>of</b> finger extension was assessed by goniometry and video recordings. Outcome: At the end of 8 th week, as observed on goniometry and video recordings, complete finger extension was achieved. Discussion: UAS with SFC, is useful in <b>re-education</b> <b>of</b> a transferred muscle, as desired movement can be achieved with low intensity. ...|$|R

40|$|Psychology remains {{addicted}} to null hypothesis significance testing despite decades of effort by reformers. Extensive changes in statistical understanding and practices are needed. The authors propose a model <b>of</b> reform—the statistical <b>re-education</b> <b>of</b> psychology—by making an analogy with the conceptual change model of learning. Four diverse components of reform are identified, {{and illustrated by}} brief examples of research. Reform is especially challenging because many statistics teachers in psychology first need to achieve conceptual change themselves. In relation to a highly desirable increase in use of confidence intervals (CIs), it seems that many psychologists do not understand CIs well, and guidelines for CI use are lacking.

Subsequently, to verify whether the intervention program had an effect on the motor difficulties of the children. Method: The research was designed as a prospective intervention study where there were two combined orientations ofeducational research: quantative and qualitative. To solve the problem a research design was used, called Crossover Design (Wilmore et al., 2008, Thomas et al., 2005), which was conceived as an experiment with an intervention re-education program aimed at improving the motor difficulties of children. The quantative part of the research was focused on the assessment of motor skills and to detect motor problems in children of primary school age.
