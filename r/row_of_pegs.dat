60|$|In the moor-house {{there were}} <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> with red {{garments}} hung thereon to dry, {{and there were}} numerous broad-shouldered men dressing and undressing--in every stage of the process; while in a corner two or three were washing their bodies in a tank of water.

60|$|Arrived at this place, poor Barnaby was {{marched into}} a stone-floored room, {{where there was}} a very {{powerful}} smell of tobacco, a strong thorough draught of air, and a great wooden bedstead, large enough for a score of men. Several soldiers in undress were lounging about, or eating from tin cans; military accoutrements dangled on <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> along the whitewashed wall; and some half-dozen men lay fast asleep upon their backs, snoring in concert. After remaining here just long enough to note these things, he was marched out again, and conveyed across the parade-ground to another portion of the building.|$|R
60|$|At {{the top of}} {{the first}} form--the post of honour in the school--was the vacant place of the little sick scholar, and {{at the head of the}} <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> on which those who came in hats or caps were wont to hang them up, one was left empty.

60|$|Little Nell {{was at the}} window, {{arranging}} a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> Rodney {{had made}} {{for her in the}} form of a company of soldiers. The largest peg went for the captain, and this she called Washington, while another, which would not stand, but insisted upon falling over, she called General Braddock, for she had heard the older folks talk over Braddock's fearful defeat at Fort Duquesne and of what Washington had done to save what was left of the English troops from annihilation.|$|E
60|$|A, B, are two pegs {{driven into}} the ground and {{standing}} about a foot out of it. A stake, A B, is lashed across them; a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs,</b> E, are {{driven into the}} ground, parallel to A, B, and about 6 inches apart. Two sets of strings are then tied to A B; one set are fastened by their loose ends into clefts, in the pegs E, and the other set are fastened to the stick, C D. If there be ten strings in all, then 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, are tied to C D, and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, to A B. By alternately raising and depressing C D, and by pushing in a handful of rushes between the two sets of strings after each of its movements, and, finally, by patting them home with a flat stick, this rough sort of weaving is carried on very successfully. Mats are also plaited in breadths, and the breadths are stitched together, side by side. Or a thicker kind of mat may be made by taking a wisp of straw and working it in the same way in which straw beehives are constructed. Straw is worked more easily after being damped and beaten with a mallet.|$|E

60|$|It {{was a low}} wainscoted room, with a {{very wide}} window divided into three by mullions, and fitted with {{latticed}} panes. They were open, and a delicious scent of flowers {{came in from the}} garden. The furniture was all new and very strong, of dark stained wood, which harmonized well with the paneling. There were no window curtains, but a valance of white dimity hung above the window. There was a piece of carpet between the beds; the rest of the floor was bare, but the boards were of old oak, and looked as well without it. Several <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> had been put upon the walls, and there was a small chest of drawers by each bed.|$|R

60|$|Most {{people know}} what sort of places {{commercial}} rooms usually are. That of the Peacock differed in no material respect from the generality of such apartments; that is to say, it was a large, bare-looking room, the furniture of which had no doubt been better when it was newer, with a spacious table in the centre, {{and a variety of}} smaller dittos in the corners; an extensive assortment of variously shaped chairs, and an old Turkey carpet, bearing about the same relative proportion {{to the size of the}} room, as a lady's pocket-handkerchief might to the floor of a watch-box. The walls were garnished with one or two large maps; and several weather-beaten rough greatcoats, with complicated capes, dangled from a long <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> in one corner. The mantel-shelf was ornamented with a wooden inkstand, containing one stump of a pen and half a wafer; a road-book and directory; a county history minus the cover; and the mortal remains of a trout in a glass coffin. The atmosphere was redolent of tobacco-smoke, the fumes of which had communicated a rather dingy hue to the whole room, and more especially to the dusty red curtains which shaded the windows. On the sideboard a variety of miscellaneous articles were huddled together, the most conspicuous of which were some very cloudy fish-sauce cruets, a couple of driving-boxes, two or three whips, and as many travelling shawls, a tray of knives and forks, and the mustard.|$|E
60|$|In a {{niche in}} the outer room, just beside the doorway leading to the balcony, were neatly piled a number of rounded pegs from {{eighteen}} to twenty inches in length. Selecting five of these she made them into a little bundle about which she twined the lower extremity of her sinuous tail and thus carrying them {{made her way to}} the outer edge of the balcony. Assuring herself that there was none about to see, or hinder her, she took quickly to the pegs already set in the face of the cliff and with the celerity of a monkey clambered swiftly aloft to the highest <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> which she followed in the direction of the lower end of the gorge for a matter of some hundred yards. Here, above her head, were a series of small round holes placed one above another in three parallel rows. Clinging only with her toes she removed two of the pegs from the bundle carried in her tail and taking one in either hand she inserted them in two opposite holes of the outer rows as far above her as she could reach. Hanging by these new holds she now took one of the three remaining pegs in each of her feet, leaving the fifth grasped securely in her tail. Reaching above her with this member she inserted the fifth peg in one of the holes of the center row and then, alternately hanging by her tail, her feet, or her hands, she moved the pegs upward to new holes, thus carrying her stairway with her as she ascended.|$|E
60|$|His {{own family}} name is simply Loyal; but, {{as he is}} married, and as {{in that part of}} France a husband always adds to his own name the family name of his wife, he writes himself Loyal Devasseur. He owns a compact little estate of some twenty or thirty acres on a lofty hill-side, and on it he has built two country houses, which he lets furnished. They are by many degrees the best houses that are so let near our French watering-place; we have had the honour of living in both, and can testify. The entrance-hall of the first we {{inhabited}} was ornamented with a plan of the estate, representing it as about twice the size of Ireland; insomuch that when we were yet new to the property (M. Loyal always speaks of it as 'La propriete') we went three miles straight on end in search of the bridge of Austerlitz - which we afterwards found to be immediately outside the window. The Chateau of the Old Guard, {{in another part of the}} grounds, and, according to the plan, about two leagues from the little dining-room, we sought in vain for a week, until, happening one evening to sit upon a bench in the forest (forest in the plan), a few yards from the house-door, we observed at our feet, in the ignominious circumstances of being upside down and greenly rotten, the Old Guard himself: that is to say, the painted effigy of a member of that distinguished corps, seven feet high, and in the act of carrying arms, who had had the misfortune to be blown down in the previous winter. It will be perceived that M. Loyal is a staunch admirer of the great Napoleon. He is an old soldier himself - captain of the National Guard, with a handsome gold vase on his chimney-piece presented to him by his company - and his respect for the memory of the illustrious general is enthusiastic. Medallions of him, portraits of him, busts of him, pictures of him, are thickly sprinkled all over the property. During the first month of our occupation, it was our affliction to be constantly knocking down Napoleon: if we touched a shelf in a dark corner, he toppled over with a crash; and every door we opened, shook him to the soul. Yet M. Loyal is not a man of mere castles in the air, or, as he would say, in Spain. He has a specially practical, contriving, clever, skilful eye and hand. His houses are delightful. He unites French elegance and English comfort, in a happy manner quite his own. He has an extraordinary genius for making tasteful little bedrooms in angles of his roofs, which an Englishman would as soon think of turning to any account as he would think of cultivating the Desert. We have ourself reposed deliciously in an elegant chamber of M. Loyal's construction, with our head as nearly in the kitchen chimney-pot as we can conceive it likely for the head of any gentleman, not by profession a Sweep, to be. And, into whatsoever strange nook M. Loyal's genius penetrates, it, in that nook, infallibly constructs a cupboard and a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs.</b> In either of our houses, we could have put away the knapsacks and hung up the hats of the whole regiment of Guides.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the Mastermind Satisfiability Problem (MSP) is NPcomplete. Mastermind is a popular game which {{can be turned into}} a logical puzzle called the Mastermind Satisfiability Problem in a similar spirit to the Minesweeper puzzle [5]. By proving that MSP is NP-complete, we reveal its {{intrinsic}} computational property that makes it challenging and interesting. This serves as an addition to our knowledge about a host of other puzzles, such as Minesweeper [5], Mah-Jongg [1], and the 15 -puzzle [6]. 1 The Mastermind Game The goal of Mastermind is for the player to determine the colors <b>of</b> each <b>peg</b> in a sequence of concealed locations (the solution). We first formalize the rules of Mastermind and then describe a variant called the Mastermind Satisfiability Problem which will be shown to be NP-complete. Mastermind is normally played as a board game between two players. More recently, one-player computer versions of the game have been widely available on the web. One player chooses a sequence <b>of</b> colored <b>pegs</b> and conceals them behind a screen. The other player makes a series of guesses and receives responses to each guess as a rating of how close the guesses were to the solution. A player typically takes advantage of the feedback for previous guesses in order to inform the next guess, or determine the solution. A rating, or response, consists of the number <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> in the guess having the same color and position as the corresponding peg in the solution and the number <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> in the guess having the same color but a different position from a peg in the solution. In most versions of Mastermind, the former score is presented to the player as a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> black <b>pegs</b> (equal in number to the correct pegs in the guess) and the latter score as a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> white <b>pegs...</b>|$|R
50|$|The codebreaker {{tries to}} guess the pattern, in both order and color, within twelve (or ten, or eight) turns. Each guess is made by placing a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> code <b>pegs</b> on the {{decoding}} board. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes <b>of</b> the <b>row</b> with the guess. A colored or black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates {{the existence of a}} correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.|$|R

A stockwhip is part of the regulation equipment in stockman challenges and some Australian Stock Horse events. Competitions known as a [...] "stockman’s chop" [...] are held in which a rider must canter down a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> with paper pieces attached and [...] "chop" [...] these pieces off with the whip. Whipcracking events are a popular form of competition for juniors through to the older family members.|$|E
50|$|The {{finished}} {{church building}} measured 25 x 40 feet in size. Inside the building were a pump organ {{in the front}} left corner, an altar in the center, a high pulpit {{to the right of}} the altar, a box stove with a pipe, and two rows of benches without backs. Whitewashed logs could be seen and the floor was made of split logs with the faces smoothed. A <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> on the rear wall served as hangers for hats and coats. The men sat on the right side of the church, and the women sat on the left. This building was also used as the first location of Hanover's day school, begun shortly after the construction of the church building. Classes were held during the day in the church building, and taught originally by Christian August Lehmann, the first pastor of the congregation.|$|E
50|$|A {{courtyard}} {{less than}} 8 amot (approx. 18 inches x 8 = 144 inches) {{can only be}} divided if both partners agree to the division.

If both partners agree to the stone wall, it is built in the middle. The lesson taught here is that if one partner owns more property, he {{does not need to}} contribute more space for the stones of the wall.|$|R
60|$|A summer {{afternoon}} in the year 2170 A.D. The official parlor of the President of the British Islands. A board table, long enough for three chairs at each side besides the presidential chair at the head and an ordinary chair at the foot, occupies {{the breadth of the}} room. On the table, opposite every chair, a small switchboard with a dial. There is no fireplace. The end wall is a silvery screen nearly as large as a pair of folding doors.

60|$|The short {{jacket and}} the low, round hat he assumed {{in a sort}} of curtained alcove {{containing}} a washstand, a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> wooden <b>pegs</b> and a shelf, brought out wonderfully the length of his grave, brown face. He stepped back into the full light of the room, looking like the vision of a cool, reflective Don Quixote, with the sunken eyes of a dark enthusiast and a very deliberate manner. He left the scene of his daily labours quickly like an unobtrusive shadow. His descent into the street was like the descent into a slimy aquarium from which the water had been run off. A murky, gloomy dampness enveloped him. The walls of the houses were wet, the mud of the roadway glistened with an effect of phosphorescence, and when he emerged into the Strand out of a narrow street by the side of Charing Cross Station the genius of the locality assimilated him. He might have been but one more of the queer foreign fish that can be seen of an evening about there flitting round the dark corners.|$|R
50|$|Hymenophyllum nephrophyllum is a fern {{distinctive}} for its undivided, kidney-shaped fronds, {{which give}} the plant its English common name, the kidney fern. The fronds, or laminae, are 3-10 cm by 4-13 cm {{and are a}} shiny, translucent green. The translucent nature of the kidney fern’s fronds is due to them being very thin, only one cell thick as a sporeling, which increases to 3-4 cells when the plant reaches maturity. The fronds are supported on brittle stipes 5-25 cm in length. Mature plants have a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> sori (a collection of sporangia) crowning the upper margin of their frond, where they resemble a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> small brown <b>pegs.</b> A feature Hymenophyllum nephrophyllum shares with some other filmy ferns {{is the ability to}} curl up tightly during dry conditions in order to reduce moisture loss; this gives kidney fern one of its Māori common names, kopakopa (to wrap or clasp). After rain or when conditions improve, it unfurls and recovers.|$|R
40|$|This report {{concerns}} {{a test of}} the hypothesis that gain in the stretch reflex pathway of cat medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle during locomotion increases after denervation of its synergists, lateral gastrocnemius (LG), soleus (SOL) and plantaris (PL) muscles. In four cats, MG, tibialis anterior (TA) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles were implanted with electromyogram (EMG) electrodes. The cats walked on a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> elevated <b>pegs,</b> some <b>of</b> which were spring-loaded and could be triggered to pop up at the moment of foot touchdown, rapidly dorsiflexing the foot. Pre-stretch EMG activity in MG as well as short-, medium- and long-latency responses to the dorsiflexions were compared before and after unilateral denervation of synergists. Short- and medium-latency responses of MG to perturbations increased in proportion to the increase in pre-stretch EMG {{in the days and weeks}} after partial denervation. This argues against an adaptive increase in stretch reflex gain independent of centrally generated extensor drive. Local anaesthesia of the skin of the paw did not significantly change the sizes of the stretch responses of MG before or after partial denervation. We conclude that pre-stretch EMG activity as well as stretch reflexes in MG muscle increased substantially after denervation of synergistic muscles. The data were consistent with an adaptive increase in central locomotor drive, causing more motoneuronal activity, which in turn resulted in an increase in the size of stretch reflexes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPaternally {{expressed}} 1 (Peg 1) /mesoderm specific transcript (Mest) is an imprinted gene, {{which is}} only transcribed from the paternal (father’s) allele. In some human cancer tissues, an alternatively spliced variant <b>of</b> <b>PEG</b> 1 /MEST mRNA using a different promoter of a distinct first exon is expressed from both paternal and maternal alleles. We previously reported that Peg 1 /Mest expression was markedly up-regulated in obese adipose tissue in mice. Moreover, transgenic overexpression <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 1 /Mest in the adipose tissue resulted in the enlargement of adipocytes in size. Given the potential pathophysiologic relevance in obesity, we examined the nature of increased expression <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 1 /Mest in obese adipose tissue. In obese adipose tissue, expression <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 1 /Mest was increased, but not that of other imprinted genes tested. The transcription rate <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 1 /Mest was increased in obese adipose tissue. We found at least four isoforms <b>of</b> mouse <b>Peg</b> 1 /Mest generated by use of the alternative first exons.
