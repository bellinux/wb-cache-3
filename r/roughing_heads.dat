60|$|Renewed anxiety showed {{itself in}} Lady Lydiard. She looked round sharply at Isabel. The girl's head was bent so {{low over the}} <b>rough</b> <b>head</b> of the dog that her face was almost entirely {{concealed}} from view.

5000|$|In {{the extreme}} cases {{springing}} may cause severe fatigue cracking of critical structural details, especially in moderate to <b>rough</b> <b>head</b> seas with low peak periods. Vibration is normally more easily excited by waves {{in ballast condition}} than in cargo condition. The converse may also be true since some ships experience more head wind and waves in ballast conditions, while other ships may experience more head wind and waves in cargo condition, thereby vibrating less overall.|$|R

The forecastle deck was deeply buckled in three places between the breakwater and the forward turret. The side plating was visibly buckled between the forecastle and upper decks.

5|$|Glorious keel {{was laid}} down on 1 May 1915 by Harland and Wolff at their Belfast shipyard. She was {{launched}} on 20 April 1916 and completed on 14 October {{at a cost}} of £1,967,223. During her sea trials the following month, her sister Courageous sustained structural damage while running at full speed in a <b>rough</b> <b>head</b> sea and had the damaged areas stiffened shortly afterwards to prevent a recurrence. Glorious did not suffer similar damage and did not receive her stiffening until 1918. Upon commissioning, Courageous served with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. After most of the 1st Cruiser Squadron was sunk at the Battle of Jutland, the squadron was re-formed with Courageous and Glorious. Glorious received six twin-tube torpedo mounts in mid-1917: one mount {{on each side of the}} mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of 'Y' turret on the quarterdeck.|$|R
50|$|Mugger {{crocodiles}} have 19 upper {{teeth on}} each side; a snout that is 1⅓ to 1½ {{as long as}} broad at the base; a <b>rough</b> <b>head</b> but without any ridges; mandibular symphysis extending {{to the level of}} the fourth or fifth tooth; pre-maxillo-maxillary suture, on the palate, transverse, nearly straight, or curved forwards; and nasal bones separating the pnemaxillaries above. Four large nuchals forming a square, with a smaller one on each side; two pairs of smaller nuchals on a transverse series behind the occiput. Dorsal shield well separated from the nuchal, the scutes usually in 4, rarely in 6, longitudinal series, those of the two median usually considerably broader than long; 16 or 17 transverse series. Scales on limbs keeled. Fingers webbed at the base; outer toes extensively webbed. A serrated fringe on the outer edge of the leg. Adult blackish olive above: young pale olive, dotted and spotted with black.|$|R
500|$|During her {{sea trials}} in November 1916 off the River Tyne, Courageous {{sustained}} structural damage while running {{at full speed}} in a <b>rough</b> <b>head</b> sea. The forecastle deck was deeply buckled in three places between the breakwater and the forward turret. In addition, the side plating was visibly buckled between the forecastle and upper decks. Water had entered the submerged torpedo room and rivets had sheared in the vertical flange of the angle iron securing the deck armour in place. The exact cause remains uncertain, but Courageous received [...] of stiffening in response; Glorious did not receive her stiffening until 1918. Courageous also was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917, but never actually laid any mines. In mid-1917 both ships received a dozen torpedo tubes in pairs: one mount {{on each side of}} the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts {{on each side of the}} rear turret on the quarterdeck. Courageous and Glorious served together throughout the war. Both ships were initially assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron and later reconstituted the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS).|$|R
6000|$|A {{man that}} has been in many wars; in whose <b>rough</b> <b>head,</b> are schemes hatching. Any {{religion}} he has is of Protestant nature; but he has not much,--on the doctrinal side, very little. Luther's Hymn, Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott, he calls [...] "God Almighty's grenadier-march." [...] On joining battle, he audibly utters, with bared head, some growl of rugged prayer, far from orthodox at times, but much in earnest: that lifting of his hat for prayer, is his last signal on such occasions. He is very cunning as required, withal; not disdaining the serpentine method when no other will do. With Friedrich Wilhelm, who is his second-cousin (Mother's grand-nephew, if the reader can count that), he is from of old on the best footing, and contrives to be his Mentor in many things besides War. Till his quarrel with Grumkow, of which we shall hear, he took the lead in political advising, too; and had schemes, or was thought to have, of which Queen Sophie was in much terror.|$|R
60|$|The women, too, keep house, make calls, {{and play}} mother; and some don't {{do it well}} either. The forlorn baby's mamma never seems to cuddle and comfort him; and some day, when the little fist lies cold and quiet, I'm afraid she'll wish she had. Then the naughty boy's mother. I'm very sure, if {{she put her arms}} round him sometimes, and {{smoothed}} that <b>rough</b> <b>head</b> of his, and spoke to him as only mothers can speak, that it would tame him far better than the scoldings and thrashings: for I know there is a true boy's heart, warm and tender, somewhere under the jacket that gets dusted so often. As for the fine lady who lets her children do as they can, while she trims her bonnet, or makes panniers, I wouldn't be introduced to her on any account. But as some might think it was unjustifiable curiosity on my part to see these things, and an actionable offence to speak of them, I won't mention them.|$|R
60|$|This is {{a strange}} rugged specimen, this inarticulate Leopold; already getting mythic, as we can perceive, to the {{polished}} vocal ages; which mix all manner of fables with the considerable history he has. Readers will see him turn up again in notable forms. A man hitherto unknown except in his own country; and yet of very considerable significance to all European countries whatsoever; the fruit of his activities, without his name attached, being now manifest in all of them. He invented the iron ramrod; he invented the equal step; in fact, he is the inventor of modern military tactics. Even so, if we knew it: the Soldiery of every civilized country still receives from this man, on parade-fields and battle-fields, its word of command; out of his <b>rough</b> <b>head</b> proceeded the essential of all that the innumerable Drill-sergeants, in various languages, daily repeat and enforce. Such a man is worth some transient glance from his fellow-creatures,--especially with a little Fritz trotting at his foot, and drawing inferences from him.|$|R
5000|$|The machine {{operates}} by a {{high speed}} air spindle rotating a grinding bit. The air spindles are removable and interchangeable to achieve varying surface speeds. Some spindles are fixed speed (60000 rpm), others are adjustable (30000-50000 rpm), and still others are very high speed (175000 rpm). The machines have a standard X-Y table with the notable exception of knee travel. All axes are indexed to [...]0001" [...] via a vernier scale on the handwheels, with higher accuracy available {{with the use of}} measuring bars. The machine head has two vertical travels, one <b>rough</b> <b>head</b> adjustment and the other a precise spindle adjustment. The spindle to which the detachable air spindle mounts also rotates at a variable speed and can typically outfeed [...]100" [...] while running, again with an accuracy of [...]0001" [...] on the handwheel or greater, for very precise hole, peg and surface grinding. A well-kept jig grinder will reliably position work to a higher degree of accuracy than is possible with handwheels alone. These features are all critical in positioning a hole and peg system a precise distance from a reference surface or edge.|$|R

The Man of Theory twangs his full-bent bow: Nature's Fact ought to fall stricken, but does not: his logic-arrow glances from it as from a scaly dragon, and the obstinate Fact keeps walking its way. How singular! At bottom, you will have to grapple closer with the dragon; take it home to you, by real faculty, not by seeming faculty; try whether you are stronger, or it is stronger. Close with it, wrestle it: sheer obstinate toughness of muscle; but much more, what we call toughness of heart, which will mean persistence hopeful and even desperate, unsubduable patience, composed candid openness, clearness of mind: all this shall be 'strength' in wrestling your dragon; the whole man's real strength is in this work, we shall get the measure of him here.|$|R
