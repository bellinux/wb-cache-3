In this study, the removal of five antiviral drugs (abacavir, acyclovir, emtricitabine, lamivudine and zidovudine) via both bio- and phototransformation processes, was investigated in laboratory microcosm experiments simulating an open-water unit process wetland receiving municipal wastewater effluent. Phototransformation was the main removal mechanism for abacavir, zidovudine, and emtricitabine, with half-lives (t 1 / 2,photo) in wetland water of 1. 6, 7. 6, and 25 h, respectively. In contrast, removal of acyclovir and lamivudine was mainly attributable to slower microbial processes (t 1 / 2,bio = 74 and 120 h, respectively). Identification of transformation products revealed that bio- and phototransformation reactions took place at different moieties. For abacavir and zidovudine, rapid transformation was attributable to high reactivity of the cyclopropylamine and azido moieties, respectively. Despite substantial differences in kinetics of different antiviral drugs, biotransformation reactions mainly involved oxidation of hydroxyl groups to the corresponding carboxylic acids.

The FT polymers consist of a non-fluorinated backbone linked to FT compounds through ester, ether or urethane bonds. These linkages are subject to microbially mediated cleavage releasing volatile fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), which subsequently degrade to suite of acid metabolites of concern including the globally detected perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). ^ In my research, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> aerobic <b>biotransformation</b> <b>of</b> 8 : 2 fluorotelomer stearate (FTS), 8 : 2 fluorotelomer citrate (TBC), toluene- 2, 4 -di(8 : 2 fluorotelomer urethane) (FTU) and hexamethylene- 1, 6 -di(8 : 2 fluorotelomer urethane) (HMU) were quantified in different soils, and analog-induced biotransformation was probed for FTU using a non-fluorinated urethane with the same backbone.

Biodegradation of urethane linkages also appeared slower compared to the ester linkages and a half-life was not reached within the 6 -month studies. PFOA was the dominant persistent acid metabolite produced in all studies and overall metabolite production was higher in the forest soil. <b>Biotransformation</b> <b>of</b> FTU in forest soil, where a non-fluorinated toluene- 2, 4 -dicarbamic acid diethyl ester, TDAEE was added, enhanced degradation of FTU was not observed; however, PFOA production was greatly enhanced with each addition. ^ Results of this research clearly show that FT monomers used as surfactants and in producing polymers can serve as an indirect source of persistent perfluorinated acids in the environment.

In addition, although these studies were not conducted long enough to see PFOA concentrations plateau, PFOA production was much less than observed in FTOH biotransformation studies.

Hence, overall PFOA production is likely to be much less from monomers, and therefore, even less from polymers.

However, because the enzymes are usually lost or destroyed in the solution-based methods that are presently used, we created fusions of the Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus PanK, PPAT, and DPCK enzymes with a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) {{which can be used}} to immobilize each of these proteins on cellulose. We show that all the CBD-fusion proteins can be expressed in soluble form, and that instead of impacting negatively on the activity of their enzyme partners, the presence of the CBD improves their kinetic profiles in some cases. We subsequently determined which combinations of the available enzymes are most effective in producing CoA and a typical CoA analogue, and used these to demonstrate that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>biotransformation</b> is not severely affected even when the CBD-fusion enzymes are immobilized on cellulose. Finally, we constructed batch and column reactors from cellulose loaded with the CBD enzymes and tested these in the biocatalytic production of a fluorescent CoA analogue often used for protein labeling. Our results show that such reactors can successfully be used, and that the enzymes retain their activities upon storage in this format. This study is the first to showcase the use of a multi-enzyme reactor system based on CBD-fusion proteins in biocatalysis. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{regulatory}} pressures (e. g., REACh, CEPA) requiring bioaccumulation {{assessments and}} the need for reduced animal use have increased the necessity for the development of in vitro-based methods to estimate bioaccumulation. Our study explored the potential use of subcellular and cellular hepatic systems to determine the <b>biotransformation</b> potential <b>of</b> two surfactants: octaethylene glycol monohexadecyl ether (C 16 EO 8) and diethylene glycol monotetradecyl ether sulfate (C 14 EO 2 S). The subcellular systems tested were liver homogenates and microsomes from the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Cellular systems consisted of primary hepatocytes from the common carp (C. carpio) and PLHC- 1 cells, hepatocarcinoma cells from the desert topminnow (Poeciliopsis lucida) cell line. Each in vitro system was exposed to radiolabeled test compounds and assayed for biotransformation using liquid scintillation and thin layer chromatographic methods. First-order kinetics were used to estimate <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>biotransformation.</b> Bioconcentration <b>of</b> test materials in fish were predicted using an in vitro to in vivo metabolic rate extrapolation model linked to a mass-balance model commonly used to predict bioaccumulation in fish. Both subcellular and cellular tests using microsomes, liver homogenates and hepatocytes respectively showed <b>biotransformation</b> <b>of</b> the parent surfactants. Biotransformation rates were fastest for hepatocytes, followed by microsomes and homogenates. Rates were too low from homogenate tests to extrapolate to in vivo-based biotransformation rates using the extrapolation model. Trout microsomes metabolized C 16 EO 8 faster than carp microsomes, yet rates were approximately the same for C 14 EO 2 S. Predicted BCF values incorporating in vitro biotransformation rates from hepatocytes were similar to measured in vivo or USEPA's bioconcentration model (BCFWIN) predicted values. Predicted BCF values using microsomal-based rates from trout and carp studies were only slightly less than default BCF values which assumes a linear logKow to BCF relationship with no biotransformation. However, hepatocyte-based results showed substantially decreased BCFs compared to the default BCF values. These results indicate that BCF estimates based on in vitro metabolic rates can provide reasonable estimates of in vivo BCF values, therefore, supporting the use of in vitro approaches within a tiered approach to assess bioconcentration...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{isolates}} {{from water}} and sediment samples from freshwater, estuarine and marine regions were tested for their growth {{in the presence of}} different concentrations of arsenic. Despite the generation times being longer in case of all bacterial isolates tested in nutrient broth with 200 ppm Arsenite (As 3 +), many of them were able to attain log phase and substantial growth variously between 36 and 96 hours. The isolates tolerating ≥ 200 ppm arsenic (As) were found to belong to Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Corynebaterium, Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Flavimonas and Micrococcus. Some of these environmental strains tolerant to 1000 ppm arsenic were tested to realize their potential to detoxify arsenic. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> As <b>biotransformation</b> was faster by many of these strains. The percent of arsenite biotransformed/removed from the growth medium was the highest by a strain of Enterobacteriaceae (as much as 92 % of the As in the growth medium by 120 hrs) followed by that of Corynebaterium and Acinetobacter strains. From these observations it is clear that many environmental strains are capable <b>of</b> quite rapid <b>biotransformation</b> <b>of</b> As. Contamination of drinking water by toxic metalloid arsenic affects thousands of people worldwide. Many environmental isolates of bacteria which detoxify this metalloid would serve beneficial in the depuration processes. We suggest that only such strains capable of high tolerance to toxic arsenite, would biotransform As in polluted estuarine environments and would prove useful in As bioremediation applications...|$|R
40|$|Sclerotinia homoeocarpa (F. T. Bennett) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important pathogens on high amenity cool-season turfgrasses where it causes dollar spot. Due to decades of over-reliance and repeated chemical treatments, S. homoeocarpa has developed resistance and insensitivity to multiple classes of fungicides. To understand the genetic mechanisms of fungicide resistance, the whole genomes of two strains with varying resistance levels to fungicides, were sequenced. In unpublished data (Sang et al.), a RNA-sequencing analysis revealed three CYP 450 s that were validated to play a functional role in S. homoeocarpa’s resistance against different fungicide classes. We also identified CYP 450 metabolic action on the multi-site mode of action fungicide chlorothalonil. Chlorothalonil is an extensively used contact fungicide and has been known to be persistent in soils. Yet, S. homoeocarpa resistance to chlorothalonil has not been reported in the field. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) indicated faster <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> chlorothalonil <b>biotransformation</b> by CYP 450 overexpression strains when compared to the wild-type.

40|$|The {{biotransformation}} of hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (RDX) {{has been}} researched in three situations: batch liquid phase, micro soil slurry reactors, and in-situ studies. A prospective consortium of bacteria found in horse manure {{was used as the}} primary source of microorganisms. From this consortium, five major strains were isolated. Serratia marcescens, one of the isolates, was found to be the most effective microorganism at biotransforming RDX in liquid phase. The growth and the biotransformation mechanism of RDX were characterized for both the consortium and Serratia marcescens. The biotransformation of RDX from soil matrices was tested in well-mixed micro soil slurry reactors and in undisturbed in-situ reactors. In the micro soil slurry reactors, carbon sources were varied (nutrient broth and corn steep liquor) and different bacteria were inoculated into the systems which already contained bacteria indigenous to the contaminated soil. There were two distinguishable pathways for the biotransformation of RDX in the soil slurry reactors. Different carbon sources promoted the biotransformation through the pathways differently. The addition of inocula to the systems did not provide any benefit as to the biotransformation rates. In the in-situ studies, a lag period of about 50 days was observed before biotransformation of RDX began. This lag period was believed to be due to mass transfer limitation and adaptation time for the bacteria. Again, adding other inocula to the indigenous bacteria did not provide any benefit towards the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>biotransformation</b> of RDX. In this study, bacteria indigenous to non-contaminated soil was tested as well and found not to biotransform RDX...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2010. Major: Chemistry. Advisor: Edgar A. Arriaga. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 97 pages, appendices A-B. In this thesis, {{a combination of}} high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and mass spectrometry (MS) is {{used to assess the}} metabolic profile of doxorubicin in vitro using the post-mitochondrial fraction (PMF) from the liver of Fischer 344 rats. Monitoring the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs is important in the development, screening and assessment of new chemical compounds for use in therapies. This often requires the use of two or more techniques in order to collect the relevant data. This is the case for the analysis of metabolic products of the anticancer drug doxorubicin. An HPLC instrument with tandem LIF and MS detection was developed and then used to quantify and identify the metabolic products of doxorubicin in vitro. Using this instrumentation, the consumption of doxorubicin and the appearance of 7 -deoxydoxorubicinone and 7 -deoxydoxorubicinolone were monitored in rat liver post-mitochondrial fractions. This application demonstrates the potential of the tandem LIF-MS detection scheme in quantification and characterization of biotransformations of fluorescent xenobiotics of biomedical and environmental relevance. The HPLC-LIF-MS instrumentation and in vitro methods were then applied to investigate the changes in metabolism between young adult (10 months-old, 100 % survival rate) and old (26 months-old, ~ 25 % survival rate) Fischer 344 rats. Results suggest that with aging there is decrease in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>biotransformation</b> of doxorubicin and that the timeframes needed to reach steady metabolite and doxorubicin levels are longer. On the other hand, the levels of metabolites and doxorubicin concentrations are not statistically different between the two age groups. In the future, the new methodologies presented here could be applied to investigate age-related changes in metabolism of drugs already in use, new compounds and xenobiotics with health relevance (e. g. pesticides or environmental pollutants) ...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{pharmaceuticals}} {{are among}} the most prescribed drugs. As a result of the high consumption, these pharmaceuticals have been frequently detected in waste and surface waters. Verapamil, diltiazem and atenolol are very important representatives of cardiovascular pharmaceuticals; therefore, the present research focused on their acute and sub-chronic effects, bioconcentration, half-life time and metabolism in fish. Moreover, unified protocol for the quantitative assessment of histopathological alterations on the heart ventricle and coronary blood vessels employing heart index calculation was developed with the aim to better assess histopathological changes in fish heart {{which is one of the}} targets of cardiovascular pharmaceuticals and other chemicals. The effects caused by high concentrations of the studied substances, verapamil, diltiazem and atenolol, in fish can be considered similar to the therapeutic effects and side effects that are found in humans. The acute exposure to verapamil at the human therapeutic plasma level reduced the heart rate in common carp embryos and larvae. In addition, the acute and chronic exposure to this substance caused peripheral edema and gastrointestinal haemorrhage in carp. Similarly, the histological changes in heart and the blood vessels of the liver in diltiazem exposed rainbow trout suggested vasodilatation similar to the pharmacological effect of diltiazem in the human body. In rainbow trout sub-chronically exposed to atenolol at a human therapeutic blood plasma concentration, histopathological changes in the cardiovascular system were found. The bioconcentration of verapamil, diltiazem and atenolol in fish can be classified as low. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) of verapamil in whole body homogenates of common carp ranged between 6. 6 and 16. 6. The BCF of diltiazem was also relatively low (0. 5 - 194) in analysed tissues of trout, following the order kidney liver muscle blood plasma. BCF of atenolol in rainbow trout tissues was the lowest among the tested substances (BCF = 0. 002 - 0. 27), following the order of liver > kidney > muscle. In the blood plasma, the concentration of atenolol was below the limit of quantification. Verapamil showed a longer half-life time (10. 6 days) in fish compared to the human body, indicating the slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>biotransformation</b> and/or elimination of verapamil in fish. Estimated half-life times of diltiazem in liver (1. 5 h) and kidney (6. 2 h) were in the same order of magnitudes as those determined for the human blood plasma. The half-life time of atenolol in trout was not studied, because of its very low bioconcentration. In diltiazem exposed rainbow trout, 8 groups of metabolites of diltiazem with 17 different isoforms were identified using liquid chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry method. Diltiazem was found to undergo a biotransformation involving desmethylation, desacethylation and hydroxylation in fish. These results showed that diltiazem was metabolised in fish in a similar way like in the human body by desmethylation and desacethylation. On the other hand, hydroxylation, which was involved to a minor extent, seemed to be species specific. Verapamil had no effect on early life stages of common carp at the environmentally relevant concentration after one month lasting exposure. On the other hand, atenolol and diltiazem in environmentally realistic concentrations caused after 42 -day exposure some physiological changes in rainbow trout. Namely, atenolol affected haematological and biochemical parameters of the blood in exposed rainbow trout and diltiazem caused changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in trout liver and gills. These data indicated that atenolol and diltiazem, when present in the aquatic environment, could be a source of sub-lethal detrimental effects in fish...|$|E
40|$|National audienceRecent {{observations}} {{have raised}} the hypothesis that biochemical pathways could be involved in cloud chemistry and physics. Indeed, cloud water carries about ~ 104 microorganisms mL- 1, and a metabolic activity has been detected in cloud water samples. Since 2003, more than 34 cloud events have been sampled from the puy de Dôme summit (1465 m a. s. l., France) using droplet samplers. These have been characterized for their chemical and microbiological contents, and viable bacterial strains have been isolated by culture. In laboratory, we are currently focusing on the capacity of isolates in (i) initiating the formation of ice crystals and act as ice nuclei (IN), (ii) producing biosurfactants and initiate the formation of cloud droplets (cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)) and (iii) transforming the organic compounds present in the atmosphere (formate, acetate, lactate, succinate, oxalate, formaldehyde and methanol). Experimental setups (microcosms) consist of bacterial suspensions incubated in liquid solutions of which the chemical composition reflects that of our cloud water samples: these have been designed for mimicking the conditions encountered under either oceanic or anthropic influence. The capacity of selected isolates to catalyze the formation of ice was tested by immersion freezing and in cloud chamber (AIDA, Karlsruhe). Ice nucleation active bacteria at - 5 °C were found in cloud samples; in cloud water, such cells could {{be responsible for the}} freezing of droplets into crystals, which often initiates precipitations. Preliminary analysis of the data showed that the IN efficiency of the isolates was dependent on the chemical composition of cloud water. Isolates have also been screened for biosurfactant production, by emulsification, oil spreading and surface tension meniscus tests. A majority of strains were positive to at least one test, suggesting that such cells would be efficient CCN in the atmosphere and could participate to the formation of liquid clouds. In order to investigate the implication of microbes in the chemistry of cloud water, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>biotransformation</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric organic compounds by isolated strains under microcosm conditions have been determined. They were in the range of ~ 10 - 2 pmol- 1 cell- 1 d- 1 at 5 °C and were in general decreased in the “anthropic” versus “oceanic” medium. The presence of free radicals such as OH● was also detrimental. A basic numeric model of atmospheric chemistry taking into account realistic concentrations of organic compounds, of bacteria, and of OH● and NO 3 ● radicals in a liquid cloud at 5 °C for daytime and nighttime and their respective reaction rates towards the tested organic acids was applied on the results. This confirmed that the presence of OH● radicals was largely responsible for the oxidation of organic species during the day, but it is noteworthy that during the night, bacterial activity would dominate the reactivity of formic, acetic and succinic acids by contributing to more than 90 % of their degradation. Overall, our results suggest that cloudborne microorganisms are actors of the physico-chemical processes occurring in the atmosphere. The composition of cloud water modulates these roles, and this raises the question of the negative impact that human emissions could have on the capacity of microbes to interact with atmospheric processes and disseminate by the atmosphere...|$|R

While a pronounced reduction in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> oxidative <b>biotransformations</b> occurred after either single or repeated exposure, both cytochrome P 450 and total haem content were lowered following acute challenge to zineb.

In the 0. 6 % treated animals, a decrease in class mu glutathione S-transferase and glyoxalase I, and an increase in thiol-transferase activities were also recorded. It is concluded that (1) zineb is able to selectively impair oxidative drug metabolism with possible different mechanism(s) according to the duration of the exposure, (2) only the subchronic treatment affects glutathione-dependent enzymes, (3) the decrease in glutathione S-transferase activity would seem to be ascribed to a direct interaction with the fungicide...|$|R
