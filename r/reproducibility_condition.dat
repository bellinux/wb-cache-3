40|$|A {{modified}} Beltrametti-Cassinelli-Lahti {{model of}} measurement apparatus that satisfies both the probability <b>reproducibility</b> <b>condition</b> and the objectification requirement is constructed. Only measurements on microsystems are considered. The cluster separability forms {{a basis for}} the first working hypothesis: the current version of quantum mechanics leaves open what happens to systems when they change their separation status. New rules that close this gap can therefore be added without disturbing the logic of quantum mechanics. The second working hypothesis is that registration apparatuses for microsystems must contain detectors and that their readings are signals from detectors. This implies that separation status of a microsystem changes during both preparation and registration. A new rule that specifies what happens at these changes and that guarantees the objectification is formulated and discussed. A part of our result has certain similarity with 'collapse of the wave function'. Comment: 31 pages, no figure. Published versio...|$|E
40|$|To begin with, it {{is pointed}} out that the form of the quantum probabil- ity formula {{originates}} in the very initial state of the object system as seen when the state is expanded with the eigen-projectors of the measured ob- servable. Making use of the probability <b>reproducibility</b> <b>condition,</b> which is a key concept in unitary measurement theory, one obtains the relevant coher- ent distribution of the complete-measurement results in the final unitary- measurement state in agreement with the mentioned probability formula. Treating the transition from the final unitary, or premeasurement, state, where all possible results are present, to one complete-measurement result sketchily in the usual way, the well-known probability formula is derived.

40|$|<b>Reproducibility</b> <b>conditions</b> of the {{replication}} of a measurement include several circumstances. In chemical measurement ‘reproducibility’ is mostly taken {{to refer to}} an interlaboratory study, either a collaborative trial (that is, with a strictly defined analytical procedure) or a proficiency test (with no prescribed procedure). At first sight, we might expect the reproducibility standard deviation of the proficiency test to be the greater for the same determination: the various procedures used by the participants will each introduce an extra uncertainty related to their specific biases. No comprehensive study of this potential disparity has been undertaken hitherto. The issue is important because reproducibility standard deviation {{is closely related to}} standard uncertainty. Here a comparison is made between the trend of collaborative trial outcomes (standard deviation as a function of concentration) and individual values from the FAPAS proficiency testing scheme in the food analysis sector. Contrary to expectations, the general tendency is for proficiency tests to provide slightly smaller standard deviations than do collaborative trials at mass fractions of the analyte greater than 10 − 7, and slightly higher at lower concentrations.

40|$|A multiresidue {{method for}} the {{determination}} of seven nitroimidazoles and their hydroxy metabolites in milk was developed. Milk samples were extracted with acetonitrile and cleaned up on strong cation-exchange solid phase extraction cartridges. Evaporated to dryness first, the extracts obtained were then reconstituted in 0. 1 % formic acid and injected onto a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). The separation of analytes was achieved on gradient mode using a C 18 column and a mobile phase consisting of 0. 1 % formic acid in acetonitrile and 0. 1 % formic acid in water. Multiple reaction monitoring mode was set for the MS/MS with positive electrospray ionisation. For quantification, the isotope dilution method was used with isotopically labeled analogues of the target analytes. The method was evaluated entirely in accordance with EU Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and all validation criteria were in the required ranges. The method can easily detect and confirm metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, ipronidazole, and their hydroxy metabolites below the recommended concentration level of 3 μg/kg.

The aim was to assess the repeatability sd and reproducibility sd of meat percentage evaluation, and to identify influence of the copy of the equipment and of the operator. For Slovenian method, repeatability sd was 0. 4 %, indicating we can expect 1 % difference for the same carcass made by the same operator with the same copy of the equipment; reproducibility sd was 0. 7 %, indicating 1. 8 % difference can be expected for the same carcass due to factors related to the abattoir. The variation due to the copy of the equipment was minor (sd= 0. 1 %) compared to the operator’s effect (sd= 0. 5 %).

However, {{the use of these}} agents in feedingstuffs was prohibited because of concerns about their toxicity. Regulatory laboratories are required to have suitably validated analytical methods to ensure compliance with the ban. A quantitative and confirmatory method for determining the presence of CBX and OLA in poultry and swine feed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was developed, optimized, and validated. The analytes extraction was performed with a mixture of water and acetonitrile (1 : 1 v/v) and cleanup with hexane and C 18 (dispersive phase). The method was evaluated by the following parameters: specificity, linearity, matrix effect, decision limits (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), accuracy, precision, limits of detection (LoD), limits of quantification (LoQ) and measurement uncertainty. The validated method presented a broad linear study range and no significant matrix effect. The limit of detection (LoD) was defined at 9 μgkg− 1 for CBX and 80 μgkg− 1 for OLA, and the limit of quantification (LoQ) was defined at 12 μgkg− 1 and 110 μgkg− 1 for CBX and OLA, respectively.

The test is intended for screening of cereals for the presence/absence of these mycotoxins at maximum permitted levels established by European legislation. The response of the measurement is determined with a reader device and when applying the test under routine conditions a sample is classified as positive or negative by comparing the measured response with a cut off value which has been established {{based on the results}} from this method validation. The collaborative study involved 12 laboratories and included a training phase enabling the participants to familiarise with the protocol. The interlaboratory validation design consisted of three steps, namely (1) estimating the precision under <b>reproducibility</b> <b>conditions,</b> (2) establishing robust and laboratory independent cut off values for the dipstick response at target mycotoxin levels, assuming an acceptable rate of false negative results of 5 % and (3) assessment of the rate of false positive results of compliant samples.

The test turned out to be able to differentiate blank samples from samples contaminated at target mycotoxin levels with a false positive rate lower than 10 % for zearalenone, deoxynivalenol and fumonisins, whereas unsatisfactory results were obtained for the sum of T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins.

A close correlation with intrasplenic pressure recording and a high <b>reproducibility</b> in chronic <b>conditions</b> with this technique were confirmed in our laboratory. Using this technique, we recently demonstrated that an intravenous bolus injection of somatostatin 250 micrograms or 500 micrograms given together with a slow infusion of 250 micrograms/h yielded a rapid and transient decrease in VP. Our experience with the non-invasive pressure sensitive gauge shows that the procedure is easy to perform, well standardized and that it has a high <b>reproducibility</b> in acute <b>conditions.</b> CONCLUSION: We inferred from our study of the acute effect of somatostatin that, in the event somatostatin is used in the treatment of variceal haemorrhage, repeated bolus injection should be included to arrest the bleeding.

40|$|In Europe, dynamic olfactometry, as {{described}} by the European standard EN 13725, has become the preferred method for evaluating odor emissions emanating from industrial and agricultural sources. Key elements of this standard are the quality criteria for trueness and precision (repeatability). Both are linked to standard values of n-butanol in nitrogen. It is assumed in this standard that whenever a laboratory complies with the overall sensory quality criteria for n-butanol, the quality level is transferable to other, environmental, odors. Although olfactometry is well established, little {{has been done to}} investigate inter laboratory variance (reproducibility). Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the reproducibility of odor laboratories complying with EN 13725 as well as to investigate the transferability of n-butanol quality criteria to other odorants. Based upon the statistical analysis of 412 odor measurements on 33 sources, distributed in 10 proficiency tests, it was established that laboratory, panel and panel session are components of variance that significantly differ between n-butanol and other odorants (a = 0. 05). This finding does not support the transferability of the quality criteria, as determined on n-butanol, to other odorants and as such is a cause for reconsideration of the present single reference odorant as laid down in EN 13725. In case of non-butanol odorants, repeatability standard deviation (sr) and reproducibility standard deviation (sR) were calculated to be 0. 108 and 0. 282 respectively (log base- 10). The latter implies that the difference between two consecutive single measurements, performed on the same testing material by two or more laboratories under <b>reproducibility</b> <b>conditions,</b> will not be larger than a factor 6. 3 in 95 % of cases. As far as n-butanol odorants are concerned, it was found that the present repeatability standard deviation (sr = 0. 108) compares favorably to that of EN 13725 (sr = 0. 172). It is therefore suggested that the repeatability limit (r), as laid down in EN 13725, can be reduced from r = 0. 477 to r = 0. 31...|$|R

Biofilms in nature are often difficult to investigate and reside under poorly defined conditions 1.

40|$|Motion {{of protein}} drops on {{crystallization}} media during routine handling {{is a major}} factor affecting the <b>reproducibility</b> of crystallization <b>conditions.</b> Drop stability can be enhanced by chemical patterning to more effectively pin the drop's contact line. As an example, a hydrophilic area is patterned on an initially flat hydrophobic glass slide. The drop remains confined to the hydrophilic area, and the maximum drop size that remains stable when the slide is rotated to the vertical position increases. This simple method is readily scalable and has the potential to significantly improve outcomes in hanging and sitting drop crystallization. Comment: text 4 pages, 6 jpg figure...|$|R
40|$|Triglycerides {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} lipids. They are biologically very {{important}} substances for the human body. Chemically they are glycerols which are bound by ester bonds to fatty acids. Triglycerides are feeding, and that our organism has spend triglycerides must be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids, and then they are absorbed and transported to tissues. Determination of triglycerides in serum, respectively plasma, is particularly important for the prevention of atherosclerosis which {{is the leading cause of}} cardiovascular diseases, but also to diagnose and prevent such diseases as obesity or diabetes mellitus. To introduce method for the determination of the second-generation triglycerides via the biochemical analyzers Advia 1800 to be used in the ward of clinical biochemistry of Central Laboratories of Hospital Strakonice, a. s. there was need to carry out a verification of the method. This verification is subject ot the requiremets of ČSN EN ISO 15189 Medical laboratories Special requirements for quality and eligibility, according to which the Central Laboratory of Strakonice Hospital, a s. is accredited. It is further governed by the procedures for the validation/verfication methods, SOPO-C- 06, drawn up by our laboratory. The results of the verification/validation are used for the evaluation of measurement uncertainties and to establish continuity and comparability of measurement results. On the basis of document mentioned above, the measurement of triglycerides in serum was conducted in two biochemical analyzers Advia 1800. These measurement led to the evaluation of the precision under repeatability conditions, precisions under conditions of reproductibility and accuracy. Precision under repetability condition was measured at twenty patients' samples in two concentration ranges. For evaluation of precisions under <b>reproducibility</b> <b>conditions</b> we used control materials validated in the EHK processes, exactly Liquid Assayed Multiqual 1 Lot 45651, the second check was with the help of Liquid Assayed Multiqual 2 Lot 45662 from the manufacturer BIO-RAD. These reference materials were measured every day in a singlet for twenty days. From the measured values the basic statistical parameters and analytical coefficient of variation were calculated. To evaluate the truthfulness they were also measured with the help of control materials from the manufacturer SEKK, s. r. o. Based on these measurements the basic characteristics were again calculated together with bias and total laboratory analytical error. Comparison of this error with a maximum mistake reccommended by the company SEKK, s. r. o. led to the evaluation of the method for the present purposes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the set of issues {{commonly}} known as the 'measurement problem' in quantum mechanics. The main thesis is that the problems are best understood as typically theoretical problems, {{in the sense that they}} are not problems directly concerned with the ability of the quantum theory to account for, or represent, actual measurements. This is contrary to the standard view that the quantum measurement problem is in fact about how to fit theory to experiment. I explain how I characterise a theoretical problem and argue against claims that quantum measurement theory is unrealistic or ineffective because it bears so little relation to actual measurement practice: I argue that the quantum theory's analysis of measurement need not be committed to doing for the experimenter what Henry Margenau and other critics think it should do. Its principal aim is to answer two questions. First, it tells us what properties are to be associated to quantum states; secondly, it tells us what, in the theory, a measurement must be if these properties are to emerge. I then discuss some of the specific aspects of the problem of measurement, in particular the results known as insolubility proofs of the quantum measurement problem and the characterisation of the quantum measurement interactions satisfying standard probabilistic constraints. I prove several results here, amongst them characterisations of all interactions jointly satisfying the conditions of unitarity and, first, objectification, then secondly, probability <b>reproducibility</b> <b>conditions.</b> These are the standard conditions which capture our intuitions about quantum measurement. I show how the results lead to negative consequences with respect to the interpretive questions in quantum mechanics. The discussion of these specific aspects of quantum measurements does, on the other hand, suggest a particular strategy for solving the problems. This is found in Arthur Fine's solution to the measurement problem, which is based on the idea of a selective interaction. The discussion of Fine's solution emphasises in general how simply implementing technical strategies is not sufficient to solve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics: further arguments must be given for why the strategy is appropriate, rather than just mathematically satisfactory. I claim that the arguments given by Fine are far from sufficient. The thesis concludes that, although the quantum theory of measurement is immune from Margenau's critique, and retains a theoretical autonomy, it is still plagued by numerous problems: the thesis identifies clearly what some of these problems are and considers some solutions, most of which, however, raise serious philosophical questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics...|$|R
