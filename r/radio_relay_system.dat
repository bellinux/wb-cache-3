50|$|In the 1970s, Bell Labs {{developed}} {{higher rate}} systems. T-1C {{with a more}} sophisticated modulation scheme carried 3 Mbit/s, on those balanced pair cables that could support it. T-2 carried 6.312 Mbit/s, requiring a special low-capacitance cable with foam insulation. This was standard for Picturephone. T-4 and T-5 used coaxial cables, similar to the old L-carriers used by AT&T Long Lines. TD microwave <b>radio</b> <b>relay</b> <b>systems</b> were also fitted with high rate modems {{to allow them to}} carry a DS1 signal in a portion of their FM spectrum that had too poor quality for voice service.
