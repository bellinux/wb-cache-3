50|$|Sulai is {{generally}} stored in clear, glass bottles. It {{has a strong}} pungent odour and is therefore often brewed in fields or away from people's homes. As the brew does not undergo multiple distillation, {{it has a very}} high alcohol content and is considered a <b>rectified</b> spirit. <b>Alcohol</b> content can be as much as 40-45%.|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of application of steam recompression for epuration column heating {{was carried out}} in the work. Researches on epuration process were carried out on an industrial brew rectification apparatus of Veselolopansky distillery. During the experiment, column apparatus operating parameters interrelations with the heat pump energy characteristics were analyzed, variants for epuration column operation with a heat pump with different vapor pressure entering the compressor by varying the compression pressure were examined. The experiments carried out allowed to determine the optimum vapor pressure of compression, providing the column operation without the heating steam supply. At a slight overpressure of vapor the optimal compression ratio is 3. 4 – 3. 7 kPa, the pressure after the compressor is 352 – 376 kPa; in the bottom part of column at the atmospheric pressure the optimal compression pressure is 303 – 325 kPa, the compression ratio is 4. 0 – 4. 4. For the low-pressure-regime use the optimum pressure is 252 – 275 kPa, the degree of compression-stump is 4. 9 – 5. 5. Thermodynamic analysis modes of epuration showed that epuration column working with a heat pump has the highest exergy efficiency (32. 6 %). Use of heat pump saves 1. 03 – 1. 15 kg of steam at the rate of 1 liter of ethanol, introduced in the column with supply. Heat pumps can be used to reduce the energy intensity of BRA in obtaining high-quality <b>rectified</b> <b>alcohol...</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates {{dynamics}} of rectification process on one plate of a column. The basic channels controlling brew-rectification process {{are described in}} the paper. The paper also considers problems pertaining to synthesis of an adaptive system that controls non-stationary objects with delay. Synthesis of adaptive systems that automatically control product quality and saving on power resources and productivity {{with the help of}} the second method of Lyapunov has been carried out in the paper. Industrial introduction of the given automatic control system of technological process shall permit to increase productivity of a rectification (10 – 15) %, to decrease specific power consumption by (5 – 10) % while preserving the specified quality of <b>rectified</b> ethyl <b>alcohol</b> and decrease alcohol losses with luting water and malt-residue. </p...|$|R
50|$|Carnival roses {{are made}} with three discs of faworki dough of {{decreasing}} size. The dough is made from flour, eggs, salt, sugar {{and a bit of}} <b>rectified</b> spirit (95% <b>alcohol).</b> After the discs are pressed together and cut to resemble the petals of a rose, they are deep-fried, either in oil or preferably in lard. After cooking, the pastries are dusted with icing sugar, and a glace cherry, cherry jam, or marmalade made from wild roses, is placed in the middle before serving.|$|R
30|$|Molasses {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important by-products of sugar industries. This has many industrial uses, viz., generation of alcohol, preparation of animal feeds, and food stuffs. Molasses containing large fractions of fermentable sugars which is diluted (three times) with good water and allowed to ferment in the presence of yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisae) either by batch or continuous process of fermentation. The fermentable sugars are recovered by the action of yeast as an <b>alcohol</b> (<b>rectified</b> spirit)/ethanol, leaving unfermented lower order sugars (such as dioses, trioses, tetroses, pentoses, etc.), water soluble amino acids, lignins, and other organic fractions, etc., in spentwash. The organic constituents present in higher concentration undergo reduction generating unpleasant odour.|$|R
40|$|Fusel oil is a {{side product}} of ethanol {{manufacturing}} process through the fermentation of molasses. Sometimes, fusel oil is accidently mixed with liquid waste {{from the bottom}} of <b>alcohol</b> <b>rectifying</b> column. This mixture is called lutter washer. Fusel oil contains isoamyl alcohol, n-amyl alcohol, and other alcohols. Isoamyl alcohol is the raw material of organic ester. Further processing is required to increase the economic value of fusel oil, such as the separation of components by distillation. In this study, the composition of isoamyl alcohol and n-amyl alcohol in the residue in the distillation process as a function of distillation time in a packing column was evaluated. An artificial waste lutter washer was used as a raw materials in this experiment. The processes were conducted using a distillation column with a cylindrical dan spherical glass packing materials. Lutter washer was distilled with total reflux until the equilibrium temperature was reached, then the data of the experiment was taken during 180 minutes at the condition of reflux at 5 / 5 (5 minutes distillate was returned to the tower and 5 minutes distillate was collected). The composition of the distillation residue were evaluated at interval time of 30 minutes. The same processes were evaluated using different heights of packing materials. The data show that the highest composition of isoamyl alcohol and n-amyl alcohol are 21. 99 % and 3. 70 % of the 15 mL total residue, respectively. It is obtained in the distillation process that used the packing materials with ball shape, the column with 85 cm of height and 3. 5 cm of diameter...|$|R
