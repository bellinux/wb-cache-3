40|$|Abstract — The {{potential}} {{analysis of}} having electric vehicles (EVs) provide <b>regulating</b> {{power has been}} implemented. The possible <b>regulating</b> power capacity from EVs and the economic return for EV users by providing <b>regulating</b> power are obtained. A spot price based charging schedule scenario {{has been used to}} do the day-ahead charging schedule for all EVs based on the predicted driving pattern. On top of the obtained charging schedule, the predicted EV availability and the charging schedule are used to calculate the possible <b>regulating</b> power capacity from EVs for both up <b>regulating</b> power and down <b>regulating</b> power. The activated <b>regulating</b> power and <b>regulating</b> power prices in the Denmark West System in 2010 have been used to calculate the economic return for EV users if all the <b>regulating</b> power is provided by EVs...|$|R

5|$|Even {{before the}} end of the first {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, there were efforts by the authorities to stem the upward pressure on wages and prices, with parliament passing the emergency Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. The efforts to <b>regulate</b> the economy continued as wages and prices rose, putting pressure on the landed classes, and in 1363 parliament attempted unsuccessfully to centrally <b>regulate</b> craft production, trading and retailing. A rising amount of the royal courts' time was involved in enforcing the failing labour legislation – as much as 70% by the 1370s. Many land owners attempted to vigorously enforce rents payable through agricultural service rather than money through their local manor courts, leading to attempts by many village communities to legally challenge local feudal practices using the Domesday Book as a legal basis for their claims. With the wages of the lower classes still rising, the government also attempted to <b>regulate</b> demand and consumption by reinstating the sumptuary laws in 1363. These laws banned the lower classes from consuming certain products or wearing high-status clothes, and reflected the significance of the consumption of high-quality breads, ales and fabrics as a way of signifying social class in the late medieval period.|$|E
