The width control consists of the bar-to-bar width control for the mean width of bars, the in-bar width control for the width variation within bars and the head/tail width control for reducing the crop loss at the crop-shear in front of the finishing mills. Back-Propagation (BP) neural networks and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks were applied to model and predict the bar-to-bar width and the in-bar width. The training and the testing of the neural networks are based on the data collected from the BHP Steel SPPD <b>roughing</b> <b>mill.</b> Bias and momentum are used in the learning process of BP networks for speeding up the learning process. Also Cauchy method is applied here to avoid the local minimum of the learning process. Moreover, polynomial regression models were developed for the comparison between the neural network models and the regression models. The comparison is also conducted for the performances between the BP networks and the RBF networks. The factor analysis both by BP networks and the regression models are used to show the most effective parameters for the width variation. The performance of the head 2 ̆ 6 tail stroking system is dependent on the original head/width shape of the incoming bar and the trace of the edger roll for the stroking. The original shapes can be classified as a limited number of basic shapes. On the other hand, the trace of the edger roll for the stroking can be represented by three parameters. Based on expert knowledge, BP neural networks are set up for representing the relationships between the basic shapes and the stroking parameters. Well trained networks can be used to automatically identify the original shapes and then provide the suitable parameters for the stroking system. The results of training and testing by some data from the BHP Steel <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> are provided. General Regression neural networks are also proposed here for the comparison between these two kinds of networks. An approach of Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLC) is suggested for the bar-to-bar width control. In the set-up (learning) process of the FLC, it is found that BP method can lead to the failure of the learning. In order to overcome this problem, a hybrid learning algorithm is proposed for the set-up of the FLC. This algorithm includes a self-organised learning phase, a supervised learning phase and a mixed learning phase. The methods of the self-organised learning used here are the competitive learning and the input-output product-space clustering. This hybrid methodology is used to generate initial fuzzy rules and initial membership functions, to adjust membership functions and to refine final fuzzy rules. It is applied to the learning of the FLC for the bar-to-bar width model. Guide-lines to develop the expert system for all quality items at the hot strip mills are provided in this thesis. Under these guide-lines a prototype expert system is developed for the width control of the <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> of a hot strip mill. This expert system is built on G 2 system introduced by Gensym Corporation. Neural network models for the bar-to- bar width, in-bar width and head/tail width can be deployed to C programs which are recalled by the expert system. A rule-based system for the <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> width monitoring is integrated into this expert system. The results of the test running of the expert system by the raw data collected from the <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> are shown through the photos of the main window work-spaces provided in this thesis.

It addresses the choice of architectures, the choice of training strategies and the problems of convergence and generalisation.

These factors include the formations of input and output variables for BP networks, the number of layers and nodes per layer, the type of transfer functions, the learning rule, the sample sizes of training and testing, as well as the number of training cycles.

This thesis contains the simulation of different vibration modes in a hot <b>Roughing</b> <b>mill</b> which consists of a Horizontal mill with an attached Edger (Fig. 5. 1). Four vibrations of the <b>Roughing</b> <b>Mill</b> system have been studied: (i) torsional vibration of Horizontal mill (ii) vertical vibration of Horizontal mill (iii) torsional vibration of Vertical Edger (iv) horizontal vibration of slab between the two mills. There are many published works on torsional and vertical vibration of rolling mills especially for cold rolling. In their simulations, the vibrations were calculated with the excitation of a step or ramp-step function, {{but they did not}} consider the oscillation of rolling force and torques caused by the rolls having different velocities due to torsional vibration under asymmetrical rolling conditions. However, the following parameters have been taken into account when calculating the vibration in this thesis: (i) asymmetry in horizontal mill (different roll speed) (ii) variation of rolling force and torques (top and bottom rolls) in horizontal mill (iii) backlash on the drives couplings (iv) non-linear stiffness and damping of hot slab (v) push-pull between the two mills during interaction conditions The study showed that the asymmetry and slab vertical damping introduced the greatest damping on the torsional and vertical vibration of horizontal mill respectively. Moreover, higher vibrations amplitudes achieved in both mills as a result of backlash on shafts or push-pull between the two mills.

Secondly, the confidence that can be attached to the pattern when the diagnostic decision is computed is taken into account. The diagnostic decision is based on multicriteria fuzzy decision-making: it aggregates the pattern validity and the similarity of the current signal features to this pattern.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{the development of}} a physically-based model describing the microstructural evolution during hot deformation of microalloyed steels. The work is mainly focused on the recrystallization kinetics. During hot rolling, the repeated deformation and recrystallization provides progressively refined recrystallized grains. Also, recrystallization enables the material to be deformed more easily and knowledge of the recrystallization kinetics is important in order to predict the required roll forces. Hot strip rolling is generally conducted in a reversing <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> followed by a continuous finishing mill. During rolling in the <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> the temperature is high and complete recrystallization should occur between passes. In the finishing mill the temperature is lower which means slower recrystallization kinetics and partial or no recrystallization often occurs. If microalloying elements such as Nb, Ti or V are present, the recrystallization can be further retarded by either solute drag or particle pinning. When recrystallization is completely retarded and strain is accumulated between passes, the austenite grains will be severely deformed, i. e. pancaking occurs. Pancaking of the grains provides larger amount of nucleation sites for ferrite grains upon transformation and hence a finer ferrite grain size is achieved. In this work a physically-based model has been used to describe the microstructural evolution of austenite. The model is built-up by several sub-models describing dislocation density evolution, recrystallization, grain growth and precipitation. It is based on dislocation density theory where the generated dislocations during deformation provide the driving force for recrystallization. In the model, subgrains act as nuclei for recrystallization and the condition for recrystallization to start is that the subgrains reach a critical size and configuration. The retarding effect due to elements in solution and as precipitated particles is accounted for in the model. To verify and validate the model axisymmetric compression tests combined with relaxation were modeled and the results were compared with experimental data. The precipitation sub-model was verified by the use of literature data. In addition, rolling in the hot strip mill was modeled using process data from the hot strip mill at SSAB Strip Products Division. The materials investigated were plain C-Mn steels and Nb microalloyed steels. The results from the model show good agreement with measured data.  QC 2010070...|$|E

Although T-bars having a web height {{of at least}} twice the flange width are generally required for ships, the dimensions of existing hot-rolled T-bars are not suitable.

The equations are often empirical or semi-empirical, i. e. they are derived for certain steel grades and are consequently only applicable to steel grades similar to these. To be able to describe the recrystallization kinetics {{for a variety of}} steel grades, more physically based models are necessary. During rolling in hot strip mills, recrystallization enables the material to be deformed more easily and knowledge of the recrystallization kinetics is important in order to predict the required roll forces. SSAB Tunnplåt in Borlänge is a producer of low-carbon steel strips. In SSAB’s hot strip mill, rolling is conducted in a reversing <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> followed by a continuous finishing mill. In the reversing <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> the temperature is high and the inter-pass times are long. This allows for full recrystallization to occur during the inter-pass times. Due to the high temperature, the rather low strain rates and the large strains there is also a possibility for dynamic recrystallization to occur during deformation, which in turn leads to metadynamic recrystallization after deformation. In the finishing mill the temperature is lower and the inter-pass times are shorter. The lower temperature means slower recrystallization kinetics and the shorter inter-pass times could mean that there is not enough time for full recrystallization to occur. Hence, partial or no recrystallization occurs in the finishing mill, but the accumulated strain from pass to pass could lead to dynamic recrystallization and subsequently to metadynamic recrystallization. In this work a newly developed physically based model has been used to describe the microstructural evolution of austenite. The model is based on dislocation theory where the generated dislocations during deformation provide the driving force for recrystallization. The model is built up by several submodels where the recrystallization model is one of them. The recrystallization model is based on the unified theory of continuous and discontinuous recovery, recrystallization and grain growth by Humphreys. To verify and validate the model, rolling in the hot strip mill was modeled using process data from SSAB’s hot strip mill. In addition axisymmetric compression tests combined with relaxation was modeled using experimental results from tests conducted on a Gleeble 1500 thermomechanical simulator at Oulu University, Finland.

40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of rough machining operations can produce significant productivity improvement in mould and die making {{because most of the}} metal is removed in the roughing stage. In this paper, a high-efficiency 2. 5 -dimensional <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> strategy for mould core machining is presented. The strategy consists of three different tool paths. The first tool path is generated {{on the basis of the}} convex hull boundary of a machining region. Owing to the absence of concave tool path segments, the convex hull based tool path can eliminate the chip load fluctuation problem encountered in corner cutting. The second tool path is an enhanced unidirectional straight-line tool path, which has the virtue of maintaining a steady cutting resistance throughout. The large staircases left behind by these two tool paths are refined by using the third tool path which is a contour-parallel tool path that cuts the mould core layer by layer in an upward manner. After applying these three tool paths, the stock material left on the mould core surface can be post-processed by the subsequent finish milling operation.

The asymmetric contact pressure between backup and work rolls is the key factor for the frequent roll spalling accidents. Based {{on the principle of}} homogenizing contact pressure between rolls, minimizing harmful contact zone in different strip widths and considering roll wearing as a whole, SCR (Smart Contact Backup Rolls) was developed. The simulation reveals when using the SMS 200 backup roll contour, the peak position of contact pressure keeps consistent with the practical spalling position. Instead, the peak value of the roll contact pressure with SCR technology decreases significantly with various strip widths. The unevenness coefficients of roll contact pressure with SCR technology decline sharply from 1. 36 and more to less than 1. 18 with different strip widths. The roll consumption decreases from 0. 1254 kg/t to 0. 055 kg/t.

The materials ability to withstand thermal cycling is strictly correlated to its microstructural properties, which are the result of the solidification process and following heat treatment. Rolls for hot strip rolling mills are usually produced by centrifugal casting, without subsequent forging. A crucial role is played by the eutectic carbide network developing on solidification, which represents a preferential pattern for crack propagation. For this reason conventional highly alloyed HSS are not a popular substitute for traditional Chromium steel rolls in rougher stands. The so- called “semi-HSS”, containing less C (0. 7 - 0. 9 %C) and alloying elements are usually preferred by users requiring improved roll material. Specially developed “HSS for roughers ” are being tested in various mills, but they are out of the scope of this paper. The present work is part of a continuing effort by INNSE Cilindri (RIVA Group) and Trento University to improve the “semi HSS ” grades. In particular the thermal fatigue resistance of a new class of low-C semi HSS is evaluated. For purpose of comparison, both a conventional semi-HSS and a HSS grade were also considered. The test is based on induction heating (Tmax= 670 °C) and water cooling of cylindrical discs. Experimental results confirm the lower susceptibility towards heat checking of the new grades, containing reduced amount of eutectic carbides, the best behaviour being exhibited by a steel with a mixed martensite-bainite matrix microstructure.

Investigations looked closely at how the cause of surface roughening {{is related to the}} thermomechanical processing. The four products studied exhibited different degrees of surface roughening during uniaxial tensile deformation. Detailed investigation of the microstructure of these four products was carried out. It was found that the plates that exhibited severe roughening had large flat and elongated grains at the surface. It is the rotation of these surface grains during tensile deformation that was thought to be inducing the roughness in the material. The microstructure evolution was explained relative to the thermomechanical history of the plates. Plane strain compression (PSC) tests were used to simulate the thermomechanical processing cycles on the HFM. Large strain rates used in the industry were compensated with an adjustment in temperature so that an equivalent Zener-Holloman parameter (Z) could be achieved. The microstructure of the PSC specimen was characterised using the electron back scattered technique. It was found that the grain size increases with a decrease in the value of Z...|$|E
40|$|The milling {{of complex}} pockets bounded by NURBS {{surfaces}} is usually broken into <b>rough</b> and finish <b>milling,</b> {{with the former}} taking {{up the bulk of}} the machining time. This time can be reduced if the proper combination of end-mills of different sizes are used to machine in different regions. The greedy tool heuristic presented in this paper is a new approach for determination of the machining volume that should be allocated to different tools selected from among a large set of available tools. Subsequent machining planning can be performed by repeat application of standard 2 D milling algorithms. This new approach in multiple-tool <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> of complex shapes promises to reduce machining time of parts with complex shapes, such as modern moulds and casting patterns...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePocket milling is an {{essential}} issue in <b>rough</b> <b>milling.</b> Although the technology progress increased the machining capacities and enabled new machine structures, no significant evolution was observed about pocket milling trajectories. Trochoïds and plunge milling are new types of strategies which have found practical applications in hard materials <b>rough</b> <b>milling,</b> especially die manufacturing. On a productivity point of view, they were not favourable until the development of high-speed machine tools. This paper aims at evaluating the potential of trochoïdal milling and plunge cutting strategies in rough pocket millings. Algorithms were developed to generate trochoïdal and plunge cutting trajectories for pocket milling, with cycle time optimisation regarding to milled surfaces quality. Then, an experimental campaign {{has been done to}} compare the new strategies with classical ones. The study focused both on productivity and quality issues. The influence of the machine tool capacities and architecture was also examined. Two different high speed milling dedicated machine tools were tested: a serial three-axis machine tool with "classic" dynamic capacities, and a parallel kinematics five-axis machine tool with high dynamic capacities. The results of this work leads to a better definition of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} trochoïdal milling and plunge cutting strategies in aluminium alloys rough machining with the focus to optimize the choice of strategies...|$|R
40|$|In <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> of {{sculptured}} surface parts, decisions on process parameters concern feedrate, spindle speed, cutting speed, width of cut, raster pattern angle {{and number of}} machining slices of variable thickness. In this paper three <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> objectives are considered: minimum machining time, maximum removed material and maximum uniformity of the remaining volume {{at the end of}} roughing. Owing to the complexity of the modelled problem and the large number of parameters, typical genetic algorithms cannot achieve global optima without defining case-dependent constraints. Therefore, to achieve generality, a hierarchical game similar to a Stackelberg game is implemented in which a typical Genetic Algorithm functions as the leader and micro-Genetic Algorithms as followers. In this game, one of the leader's parameters is responsible for creating a follower's population and for triggering the optimisation. After properly weighing the three objectives, the follower performs single-objective optimization in steps and feeds the leader back with the objective values as they appear prior to weighing. Micro-Genetic Algorithm (follower) chromosome consists of the distribution of machining slice thickness, while the typical Genetic Algorithm (leader) consists of the milling parameters. The methodology is tested on {{sculptured surface}} parts with different properties, and a representative case is presented here...|$|R
