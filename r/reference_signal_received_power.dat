In this paper, we utilize the coordinated beamforming technique to mitigate the interference problem.

40|$|Signal {{occlusion}} {{by building}} blockages is {{a double-edged sword}} {{for the performance of}} millimeter-wave (mmW) communication networks. Buildings may dominantly attenuate the useful signals, especially when mmW base stations (BSs) are sparsely deployed compared to the building density. In the opposite BS deployment, buildings can block the undesired interference. To enjoy only the benefit, we propose a building-aware association scheme that adjusts the directional BS association bias of the user equipments (UEs), based on a given building density and the concentration of UE locations around the buildings. The association of each BS can thereby be biased: (i) toward the UEs located against buildings for avoiding interference to other UEs; or (ii) toward the UEs providing their maximum <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> <b>received</b> <b>powers</b> (RSRPs). The proposed association scheme is optimized to maximize the downlink average data rate derived by stochastic geometry. Its effectiveness is validated by simulation using real building statistics.

The RSRP is measured for the current serving eNB (SeNB) as well as for other eNBs in the user's vicinity. It is used for ranking the different cells as input for HO and cell reselection decisions.|$|E
30|$|Various {{algorithms}} for static clustering {{were already}} presented in earlier works [29 – 31]. However, {{due to their}} limited performance gain, dynamic clustering has attracted more attention in recent years [32 – 35]. For example, the work in [32] {{is based on the}} graph theory with the aim of maximizing the sum-capacity. Indeed, each BS will be associated with the cluster which has the maximum joint capacity rate with other BSs belonging to that cluster. In [33] cells are clustered dynamically according to whether perfect channel state information (CSI) is available or not. In [34], a co-channel inter-cluster interference canceler is proposed for MIMO networks by performing linear processing combined with multiuser beamforming. Also, the authors in [35] introduce overlapping clustering. Requiring high level of computational complexity is the major drawback of the aforementioned algorithms. In addition, <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>power</b> (RSRP) is used in [36, 37] to select cooperating BSs. The authors in [37] propose a resources allocation algorithm based on non-cooperative game considering the throughput of users and their QoS to evaluate the system performance.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{the total}} network en- ergy {{efficiency}} (EE) of cellular-WLAN heterogeneous network (HetNet) that employs cell range expansion (CRE) technique, {{in order to}} control the user association to either WLAN or cellular network. To this end, we model the system with OFDM based cellular macro-cells and WiFi access points for a saturated (i. e., full-buffer) downlink scenario, considering practical aspects of each type of access technology. Then we evaluate the EE of network by considering realistic power consumption models for each access network type. We compare the performance of the CRE scheme with two benchmark user association schemes; namely, WLAN-first and Max-RSRP (<b>Reference</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Receive</b> <b>Power).</b> The results demonstrate that CRE with negative biasing performs best in terms of network EE, while the WLAN-first scheme demonstrates the worst performance. However, the CRE with negative biasing lacks fairness in terms of user throughput, while the WLAN-first scheme shows better fairness. Hence, there is a trade-off between the user fairness and the system EE. We show that by optimising the bias factor of each APs individually, with appropriate utility function, a better balance of this trade-off can be achieved...|$|R
3000|$|On the {{expanded}} region (ER) of picocells in Hetnets, the power unbalance between DL and UL {{leads to a}} mismatch between the DL and UL handover boundaries. Therefore, associating a UE to the BS which provides the strongest DL <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>power</b> (DL RSRP) {{may not always be}} the best strategy and is not an efficient way of network resource usage. Cell range expansion (CRE) is an alternative cell association that has been widely discussed in literature [29]. In CRE, generally, a positive bias is added to the DL RSRPs of PBSs pilot signals at UEs to increase PBSs’ DL coverage footprints, thus compensating for the DL/UL mismatch. Although CRE allows more UEs to be associated with PBSs, the UEs in the expended region of PBSs without using any intercell interference coordination (ICIC) scheme will suffer severe DL cross-layer interference. Therefore, such victim CRE UEs are classified into the protected UE group. In order to improve the service quality of these UEs, a level of radio resource management coordination between the MBSs and the overlaid PBSs is needed. When a new UE enters the Hetnets, the UE-BS association process strives to balance the load of the network, aiming at lowering the network blocking probability. Therefore, the new UE is prone to choose these BSs with relatively lower load and better channel condition (i.e., larger RSRP). We then combine the conventional RSRP association method with CRE and ICIC technique. The path loss-based BS selection procedure is adopted in this paper to realize CRE, namely, associating UEs to BSs with the lowest path loss. If the new UE cannot find a proper MBS or PBS to serve its required rate, then it is blocked. Particularly, a new UE chooses a candidate MBS and a candidate PBS (if there exists one) from the potential serving BSs with the strongest RSRP, respectively, which are denoted as P [...]...|$|R

Thus, cell service areas can not only be re-sized but also re-shaped. To avoid instabilities in the HO process, a hysteresis region can be maintained by synchronizing changes in both directions of the adjacency (i.e., if the margin from cell i to j is increased by + X dB, the margin from j to i is reduced by −X dB).|$|E
