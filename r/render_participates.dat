In this paper {{we present a}} novel method for efficiently rendering such effects that achieves interactive speed for dynamic scenes with both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. It is based on instant radiosity, which is typically used to approximate indirect illumination between surfaces by computing direct lighting from a set of virtual point lights (VPLs). The same principle {{can be applied to}} participating media: we describe a particle tracing algorithm to create a set of VPLs within the medium, such that the combined single scattering contribution thereof yields full multiple scattering. Compared to indirect illumination, it is even more important to avoid clamping and singularities from VPLs when <b>rendering</b> <b>participating</b> media effects.

Direct and indirect contributions {{can be stored in}} the records but also multiple scattering. An adaptive shape of the influence zone of records, depending on geometrical features and irradiance variations, is introduced. To avoid a high density of cached records in low interest areas, a new method controls the density of the cache when adding new records. This record density control depends on the interpolation quality and on the photometric characteristics of the medium. Reducing the number of records accelerates both the computation pass and the rendering pass by decreasing the number of queries to the cache data structure (Kd-tree). Finally, instead of using an expensive ray marching to find records that cover the ray, we gather all the contributive records along the ray. With our method, pre-computing and rendering passes are significantly speeded-up...|$|R

Our method handles all types of light scattering including anisotropic scattering, and it works in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. A key contribution in the article is a technique for computing gradients of radiance evaluated in participating media. These gradients take the full path of the scattered light into account including the changing properties of the medium {{in the case of}} heterogeneous media. The gradients can be computed simultaneously with the inscattered radiance with negligible overhead. We compute gradients for single scattering from lights and surfaces and for multiple scattering, and we use a spherical harmonics representation in media with anisotropic scattering. Our second contribution is a new radiance caching scheme for participating media. This caching scheme uses the information in the radiance gradients to sparsely sample as well as interpolate radiance within the medium utilizing a novel, perceptually based error metric. Our method provides several orders of magnitude speedup compared to path tracing and produces higher quality results than volumetric photon mapping.

To address this problem, we propose an adaptive and unbiased sampling technique using kd-tree based space partitioning. A key contribution of our method is an automatic scheme that partitions the spatial domain into sub-spaces (partitions) based on a cost model that evaluates the expected sampling cost.

In this paper, we present a method which takes advantage of density estimation to efficiently reconstruct volume irradiance from the photon map.

In order to obtain high fidelity rendered images it is required that the physical processes of materials and the behavior of light are accurately modelled and simulated. Most computer graphics algorithms assume that light passes freely between surfaces within an environment. However, in many applications, ranging from evaluation of exit signs in smoke filled rooms to design of efficient headlamps for foggy driving, realistic modelling of light propagation and scattering is required.

The sample is fitted to the ray while it is crossing the medium. An independent solution is proposed for the multiple scattering effects. This new approach has numerous advantages. With a low memory and computation cost, the medium parameters are easy to change. The most important advantage is that all the physical and optical properties of volumes are designed, even the multiple scattering. Moreover, the density varies inside the medium using a non-linear function. Thus, we can represent a wide range of participating media without making important change in the implementation...|$|R

Recently, {{it has been shown}} that efficient and unbiased free path sampling methods can be constructed based on Woodcock tracking. The key concept for improving the efficiency is to utilize space partitioning (e. g., kd-tree or uniform grid), and a better space partitioning scheme is important for better sampling efficiency. Thus, an estimation framework for investigating the gain in sampling efficiency is important for determining how to partition the space. However, currently, there is no estimation framework that works in 3 D space. In this paper, we propose a new estimation framework to overcome this problem.

Conversely, we can also use this estimation framework for determining the optimal space partitioning.

Our technique is based on instant radiosity, which is used to approximate indirect illumination between surfaces by gathering light from a set of virtual point lights (VPLs). It has been shown that this principle can be applied to participating media as well, so that the combined single scattering contribution of VPLs within the medium yields full multiple scattering. As in the surface case, VPL methods for participating media are prone to singularities, which appear as bright “splotches ” in the image. These artifacts are usually countered by clamping the VPLs’ contribution, but this leads to energy loss within the short-distance light transport. Bias compensation recovers the missing energy, but previous approaches are prohibitively costly. We investigate VPL-based methods for <b>rendering</b> scenes with <b>participating</b> media, and propose a novel and efficient approximate bias compensation technique. We evaluate our technique using various test scenes, showing it to be visually indistinguishable from ground truth...|$|R
