5|$|As {{it connects}} to I-580, I-205 is a frequently-congested major {{commuter}} {{route to the}} Bay Area.

The Altamont Commuter Express provides commuters with an alternate route over Altamont Pass to San Jose and San Francisco, the latter through a transfer to BART.|$|E

5|$|In April 1863, {{the fort}} was {{named in honor}} of the {{recently}} deceased Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed on December 13, 1862, at the Battle of Fredericksburg. At the time of its dedication, the fort was roughly complete. Round in shape and surrounded by trenches and abati, the fort's guns faced north, overlooking River Road. A service road crossed the trenches in the southern half of the fort, connecting with River Road behind the fort. Rifle pits extended northeast to Fort <b>Reno</b> <b>and</b> southwest to Fort Simmons. A small battery of guns, named Battery Bayard, was an outwork of the fort and covered a blind spot in the ravine to the northwest of the fort.|$|E
5|$|Born Anna Louise Mohan, as a {{young girl}} she began using the last name of her stepfather, Sheridan Bryant, instead of her father's name. She grew up in rural Nevada and {{attended}} the University of Nevada in <b>Reno</b> <b>and</b> the University of Oregon in Eugene, graduating with a degree in history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the Spectator newspaper and freelanced for The Oregonian, both in Portland, Oregon. During her years in Portland (1909–1915), she became active in the women's suffrage movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to Greenwich Village, she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as The Masses, or at meetings of a women's group, Heterodoxy, or through work with the Provincetown Players. During a National Woman's Party suffrage rally in Washington, D.C., in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail. Like Reed, she had lovers outside of marriage, and during her Greenwich Village years (1916–1920) these included playwright Eugene O'Neill and painter Andrew Dasburg.|$|E

5|$|James Beckwourth {{opened the}} Beckwourth Trail over Beckwourth Pass in 1851, {{crossing}} the Sierra Nevada {{at a lower}} elevation than the existing Donner Pass route of the California Trail. This split from the Truckee Route of the California Trail near <b>Reno</b> <b>and</b> roughly followed the present SR 70 to Quincy, but, rather than passing through the Feather River Canyon, it followed Oroville-Quincy Highway along ridges to Bidwell's Bar. A company was incorporated on July 23, 1855 to build the Quincy and Spanish Ranch Wagon Road, which bypassed the older trail from Quincy west to Spanish Ranch and began collecting tolls in November. The Pioneer Wagon Road, another toll road, was built in 1856 and 1857, continuing the improvements southwest to Buckeye (just before the Butte County line). An 1866 law authorized Plumas County to improve the portion from Quincy east to Beckwourth. The county also improved the road east from Beckwourth over the pass {{as part of the}} Red Clover Wagon Road, which began at Genesee and was completed in the 1870s.|$|E

As the year ended, KroniK were hired by their former enemies, the Natural Born Thrillers, {{during which they}} helped them at the Starrcade event, by facing <b>Reno</b> <b>and</b> Big Vito in a tag team match, during which Reno turned on Vito and had been revealed {{as the one who}} had paid KroniK to assault Vito in the previous weeks. A month later, at Sin, KroniK turned faces by ending their association with Thrillers, as they turned on Thrillers leader Mike Sanders by helping Ernest Miller beat Sanders to become the WCW Commissioner. The following month, at SuperBrawl Revenge, KroniK made their final pay-per-view appearance, where they were scheduled to face Totally Buffed (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell), in a #1 contender's match for the tag team titles. Clark was injured by Mike Awesome before the match, leaving Adams to face them in a handicap match, which he lost. KroniK remained with WCW until the company was purchased by WWF on March 23, 2001.|$|E

25|$|Brothels {{have been}} allowed in Nevada {{since the middle of}} the 19th century. One brothel in Elko has been in {{business}} since 1902. In 1937, a law was enacted to require weekly health checks of all prostitutes. In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an order to suppress prostitution near military bases—affecting the red-light districts of <b>Reno</b> <b>and</b> Las Vegas. When this order was lifted in 1948, Reno officials tried to shut down a brothel as a public nuisance; this action was upheld by the Nevada Supreme Court in 1949. In 1951, both <b>Reno</b> <b>and</b> Las Vegas had closed their red-light districts as public nuisances, but brothels continued to exist throughout the state.|$|E
