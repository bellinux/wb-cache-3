40|$|Many {{learning}} situations involve {{learning the}} conditional distribution ppy|xq when the training instances {{are drawn from}} the training distribu-tion ptrpxq, even though it will later be used to predict for instances drawn from a different test distribution ptepxq. Most current approaches fo-cus on learning how to <b>reweigh</b> the training ex-amples, to make them resemble the test distribu-tion. However, reweighing does not always help, because (we show that) the test error also de-pends on the correctness of the underlying model class.

We characterize when such reweighing is needed, and also provide an algorithm, robust covariate shift adjustment (RCSA), that provides relevant weights.

In a first step, treatment propensity scores given the mediator and observed covariates or given covariates alone are estimated by nonparametric series logit estimation.

We establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of this approach as well as a weighted version thereof.

40|$|Compressive sensing {{claims that}} the sparse signals can be reconstructed exactly from many fewer {{measurements}} than traditionally believed necessary. One of issues ensuring the successful compressive sensing is {{to deal with the}} sparsity-constraint optimization. Up to now, many excellent theories, algorithms and software have been developed, for example, the so-called greedy algorithm ant its variants, the sparse Bayesian algorithm, the convex optimization methods, and so on. The formulations for them consist of two terms, in which one is and the other is (, mostly, p= 1 is adopted due to good characteristic of the convex function) (NOTE: without the loss of generality, itself is assumed to be sparse). It is noted that all of them specify the sparsity constraint by the second term. Different from them, the developed formulation in this paper consists of two terms where one is with () and the other is.

40|$|GMM/UBM {{framework}} is wildly used in Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV), however, {{due to the}} insufficiency of the training data, both the hypothesized speaker and impostors are not well modeled, especially {{to some of the}} Gaussian component mixtures. Thus, the Gaussian mixtures in each GMM model have different discriminative capabilities, and the mismatch between testing and training data will also aggravate this situation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, namely, Component Score Weighing (CSW), to reweight the Gaussian mixtures and highlight those which have high discriminative capability by post-processing the log-likelihood ratio (LLR). The original log-likelihood in GMM systems is assigned to each Gaussian component mixture, deriving two component score serials, which we called the dominant score serial and the residual score serial. A nonlinear score weighting function is then applied to <b>reweigh</b> those scores, respectively. Experiments on NIST 2006 SRE corpus show that, this approach achieves notable performance gains over our previous baseline system (about 12 % relative improvement in minimum detection cost function (DCF) value). 1...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{selection}} methods, such as sib {{and best}} linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) selection, which increased genetic gain by increasing accuracy of evaluation have {{also led to}} an increased rate of inbreeding per generation (¿FG). This {{is not necessarily the}} case with genome-wide selection, which also increases genetic gain by increasing accuracy. This paper explains why genome-wide selection reduces ¿FG when compared with sib and BLUP selection. Genome-wide selection achieves high accuracies of estimated breeding values through better prediction of the Mendelian sampling term component of breeding values. This increases differentiation between sibs and reduces coselection of sibs and ¿FG. The high accuracy of genome-wide selection is expected to reduce the between family variance and <b>reweigh</b> the emphasis of estimated breeding values of individuals towards the Mendelian sampling term. Moreover, estimation induced intraclass correlations of sibs are expected to be lower in genome-wide selection leading to a further decrease of coselection of sibs when compared with BLUP. Genome-wide prediction of breeding values, therefore, enables increased genetic gain {{while at the same time}} reducing ¿FG when compared with sib and BLUP selection...|$|E
40|$|A {{persisting}} {{challenge in}} the field of information retrieval is the vocabulary mismatch between a user’s information need and the relevant documents. One way of addressing this issue is to apply query modeling: to add terms to the original query and <b>reweigh</b> the terms. In social media, where documents usually contain creative and noisy language (e. g., spelling and grammatical errors), query modeling proves difficult. To address this, attempts to use external sources for query modeling have been made and seem to be successful. In this article we propose a general generative query expansion model that uses external document collections for term generation: the External Expansion Model (EEM). The main rationale behind our model is our hypothesis that each query requires its own mixture of external collections for expansion and that an expansion model should account for this. For some queries we expect, for example, a news collection to be most beneficial, while for other queries we could benefit more by selecting terms from a general encyclopedia. EEM allows for query-dependent weighing of the external collections. We put our model to the test on the task of blog post retrieval and we use four external collections in our experiments: (i) a news collection, (ii) a Web collection, (iii) Wikipedia, and (iv) a blog post collection. Experiments show that EEM outperforms query expansion on the individual collections, as well as the Mixture of Relevance Models that was previously proposed by Diaz and Metzler [2006].

First, we present a brief overview of the method and discuss its potential {{for the analysis of}} multidimensional poverty and income inequality in Greece. We then present the SimAthens model, based on a combination of small-area demographic and socioeconomic information available from the Greek census of population with data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The model is based on an iterative proportional fitting (IPF) algorithm, and is used to <b>reweigh</b> EU-SILC records to fit in small-area descriptions for Athens based on 2001 and 2011 censuses. This is achieved by using demographic and socioeconomic characteristics as constraint variables.

40|$|Augmented visual {{feedback}} (VF) may offer benefits {{similar to those}} of rhythmic external cues in alleviating some mobility-related difficulties in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, due to an impaired ability to <b>reweigh</b> sensory information under changing circumstances, subjects with PD may be rather vulnerable to incongruity of visual information. In the present study, we investigatedwhether VF is indeed effective in improving motor functioning in a weight-shifting task during upright stance, and whether subjects with PD are affected more by incongruent VF than healthy controls. Participants performed sideways swaying motions based on tracking of real-time and delayed VF – the first providing congruent, and hence more accurate, visual information than the latter. We analyzed center-of-pressure signals patterns for 28 individuals with PD and 16 healthy, age- and gender-matched controls by estimating task accuracy, movement pattern variability, and normalized movement amplitude. For conditions without feedback and with real-time feedback, subjects with PD performed lateral swaying motions with greater error (F(1, 42) = 12. 065, p =. 001) and with more variablemovement patterns than healthy controls (F(1, 24) = 113. 086, p <. 001). Error change scores revealed that patients with PD were nevertheless still able to use VF to improve tracking performance (t(24) = 2. 366, p =. 026). However, whereas controls were able to adapt to a certain amount of visual incongruity, patients with PD were not. Instead, movement amplitude was significantly reduced in this group (F(1. 448, 60. 820) = 17. 639, p <. 001). By reducing movement amplitude, subjects with PD appear to resort to a ‘conservative’ strategy to minimize performance breakdown...|$|E
40|$|In Hurst v. Florida, the Supreme Court held Florida’s {{death penalty}} scheme {{violated}} the Sixth Amendment because judges, rather than juries, found sentencing facts necessary to impose death. That Sixth Amendment ruling {{has implications for}} Florida’s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. Under the Eighth Amendment rule of Caldwell v. Mississippi, capital juries must appreciate their responsibility for death sentencing. Yet, Florida has instructed juries that their fact-findings merely support sentencing recommendations, while leaving the ultimate sentencing decision to a judge. Because Hurst clarifies that the Sixth Amendment requires juries to find the operative set of facts on which sentences are actually determined, Florida must revisit whether its capital juries have felt {{the full weight of}} their proper constitutional role. Under the Eighth Amendment rule of Clemons v. Mississippi, appellate courts may <b>reweigh</b> sentencing facts and conduct harmless error analyses after finding an invalid aggravating factor was used at sentencing. Florida has permitted Clemons review on judge-found facts. After Hurst, Florida must revisit whether such review required sentencing facts found by juries. Florida’s pre-Hurst death penalty scheme was held to satisfy the Eighth Amendment in Proffitt v. Florida. That holding relied on the involvement of juries in finding sentencing facts and automatic review by the Florida Supreme Court. Hurst makes clear that Florida juries had no involvement in finding sentencing facts, and appellate review was based on facts improperly found by judges. Hurst, therefore, requires that Florida revisit Proffitt. Repairs to Florida’s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence should be made {{in the immediate aftermath of}} Hurst, while the finality of pre-Hurst death sentences already must be disturbed to satisfy the Sixth.

40|$|The {{domain of}} this {{research}} is the use of computer vision methodologies in utilizing radiation for smart robotic applications for driving assistance. Radiation can be emitted by an object, reflected or transmitted. Understanding the nature and the properties of the radiation forming an image is essential in interpreting the information in that image which can then be used by a machine e. g. a smart vehicle to make a decision and perform an action. Throughout this work, different types of images are used to help a robotic vehicle make a decision and perform a certain action. This work presents three smart robotic applications; the first one deals with polarization images, the second one deals with thermal images and the third one deals with visible images. Each type of these images is formed by light (radiation) but in a way different from other types where the information embedded in an image depends on the way it was formed and how the light was generated. For polarization imaging, a direct method utilizing shading and polarization for unambiguous shape recovery without the need for nonlinear optimization routines is proposed. The proposed method utilizes simultaneously polarization and shading to find the surface normals, thus eliminating the reconstruction ambiguity. This can be useful to help a smart vehicle gain knowledge about the terrain surface geometry. Regarding thermal imaging, an automatic method for constructing an annotated thermal imaging pedestrian dataset is proposed. This is done by transferring detections from registered visible images simultaneously captured at day-time where pedestrian detection is well developed in visible images. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features are extracted from the constructed dataset and then fed to a discriminatively trained deformable part based classifier {{that can be used to}} detect pedestrians at night. The resulting classifier was tested for night driving assistance and succeeded in detecting pedestrians even in the situations where visible imaging pedestrian detectors failed because of low light or glare of oncoming traffic. For visible images, a new feature based on HOG is proposed to be used for pedestrian detection. The proposed feature was augmented to two state of the art pedestrian detectors; the discriminatively trained Deformable Part based models (DPM) and the Integral Channel Features (ICF) using fast feature pyramids. The proposed approach is based on computing the image mixed partial derivatives to be used to redefine the gradients of some pixels and to <b>reweigh</b> the vote at all pixels with respect to the original HOG. The approach was tested on the PASCAL 2007, INRIA and Caltech datasets and showed to have an outstanding performance...|$|E
