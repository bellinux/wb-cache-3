5|$|In August 2012, the Scottish {{population}} {{reached an}} all-time high of 5.25 million people. The <b>reasons</b> <b>given</b> were that, in Scotland, births were outnumbering the number of deaths, and immigrants were moving to Scotland from overseas. In 2011, 43,700 people moved from Wales, Northern Ireland or England to live in Scotland.|$|E

At least seven allegations of sexual assault made to police during Savile's lifetime were not linked by police, with Savile as the same alleged perpetrator. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that {{the allegations}} made to Surrey Police between 2007 and 2009 could have resulted in prosecutions being undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Naylor had scouted Australia {{to get an}} idea of {{locations}} and finance costs, with pre-production beginning in 2004 and filming planned for 2005. However, finding sufficient funding has been difficult. Naylor explained at a Red Dwarf Dimension Jump convention that the film had been rejected by the BBC and the British Film Council. <b>Reasons</b> <b>given</b> for the rejections were that while the script was considered to be funny, it was not ready.|$|E
5|$|This is the set {{of points}} in 3-{{dimension}}al Euclidean space found exactly one unit away from the origin. It is called the 2-sphere, S2, for <b>reasons</b> <b>given</b> below. The same idea applies for any dimension n; the equation x02 + x12 + ⋯ + x'n2 = 1 produces the n-sphere as a geometric object in (n + 1)-dimensional space. For example, the 1-sphere S1 is a circle.|$|E

5|$|On 26 December 1920, Goodison Park {{hosted a}} match between; Dick, Kerr's Ladies & St Helens Ladies. An {{estimated}} 53,000 attended the match, {{at a time}} when the average gate at Goodison Park in 1919–20 was near 29,000. Dick, Kerr's Ladies won 4–0. More than £3,000 was raised for charity. Shortly after, the Football Association banned women's football. The <b>reasons</b> <b>given</b> by the FA were not substantial and it is perceived by some that the women's teams were a threat to the men's game. The ban was lifted in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Since common {{starlings}} eat {{insect pests}} such as wireworms, {{they are considered}} beneficial in northern Eurasia, {{and this was one}} of the <b>reasons</b> <b>given</b> for introducing the birds elsewhere. Around 25million nest boxes were erected for this species in the former Soviet Union, and common starlings were found to be effective in controlling the grass grub Costelytra zelandica in New Zealand. The original Australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes to help this mainly insectivorous bird to breed successfully, and even in the US, where this is a pest species, the Department of Agriculture acknowledges that vast numbers of insects are consumed by common starlings.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reasons why the {{government}} may wish to increase the school leaving age, considering it has raised the age numerous times over the 19th and 20th centuries, the last time being in 2015. With past age raisings, the <b>reasons</b> <b>given</b> have been focused mainly on generating more skilled labour by providing additional time for students to gain additional skills and qualifications. In recent years, {{it became apparent that}} most 16 to 18 year-olds have not been motivated to continue their education after completion of their GCSEs, thus increasing the overall unemployment rate given many are unable to find work. The British government hoped that by making education compulsory up to the age of 17 by 2013 and 18 by 2015, it could change this.|$|E

5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the <b>reasons</b> <b>given</b> for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them {{with the impression that}} he might have been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|A major push {{occurred}} in 2002 when officials from Emery County, joined by Utah governor Mike Leavitt, petitioned President George W. Bush {{to use the}} authority of the Antiquities Act and create a San Rafael Swell National Monument. This effort lost momentum after the governor promised to honor the wishes of Emery County residents via a non-binding referendum, which did not pass. Common <b>reasons</b> <b>given</b> by residents for opposing the designation included fear of the federal government restricting access and a repetition of events that occurred with the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. This monument was established in 1996, by President Bill Clinton. In that case the monument was proposed at the federal level in secret. Boundaries were drawn without the consent or even knowledge of local residents. This incited anger and triggered a backlash in rural Utah.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was fired}} from the band later that year due to musical differences, via a fax from {{keyboard}} player Roddy Bottum; and Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance {{was brought in to}} record their next album. However, Spruance left the band before the subsequent tour, and was replaced by the band's keyboard roadie, Dean Menta. <b>Reasons</b> <b>given</b> for the change differ—the band claim Spruance was unwilling to commit to a long touring schedule in support of the album, whilst Spruance claims he was never meant to be a permanent member in the first place. Roddy Bottum also claims to have been mostly absent during this period, owing to the deaths of his father and Kurt Cobain, whose wife Courtney Love was a close friend of his and one of the temporary lead singers of the band before Chuck Mosely joined. Bottum's absence led to the album being written largely without keyboards. Around the recording of the album in 1994, Mike Patton also got married to Italian woman Cristina Zuccatosta.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} rebellions {{broke out in}} late 1067 William adopted a policy of {{conciliation}} towards the church. He gave Stigand a place at court, as well as giving administrative positions to Ealdred of York and Æthelwig, Abbot of Evesham. Archbishop Stigand appears {{on a number of}} royal charters in 1069, along with both Norman and English leaders. He even consecrated Remigius de Fécamp as Bishop of Dorcester in 1067. Once the danger of rebellion was past, however, William had no further need of Stigand. At a council held at Winchester at Easter 1070, the bishops met with papal legates from Alexander II. On 11 April 1070 Stigand was deposed by the papal legate, Ermenfrid, Bishop of Sion in the Alps, and was imprisoned at Winchester. His brother Æthelmær, Bishop of Elmham, was also deposed at the same council. Shortly afterwards Aethelric the Bishop of Selsey, Ethelwin the Bishop of Durham and Leofwin Bishop of Lichfield, who was married, were deposed at a council held at Windsor. There were three <b>reasons</b> <b>given</b> for Stigand's deposition: that he held the bishopric of Winchester in plurality with Canterbury; that he not only occupied Canterbury after Robert of Jumièges fled but also seized Robert's pallium which was left behind; and that he received his own pallium from Benedict X, an anti-pope. Some accounts state that Stigand did appear at the council which deposed him, but nothing is recorded of any defence that he attempted. The charges against his brother are nowhere stated, leading to a belief that the depositions were mainly political. That spring he had deposited his personal wealth at Ely Abbey for safekeeping, but King William confiscated it after his deposition, along with his estates. The king appointed Lanfranc, a native of Italy and a scholar and abbot in Normandy, as the new archbishop.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{argues that}} in {{contemporary}} legal thinking, {{the concept of}} the rule of law has become inseparable from the idea that legal decision-makers should <b>give</b> <b>reasons</b> to justify their decisions. Yet, how far can {{the concept of the}} rule the law be understood as establishing a rule of reasons? I examine whether <b>reason</b> <b>giving</b> is necessarily connected with the rule of law in the sense that a legal system would not conform to the rule of law if its decisions were not supported by publicly articulated reasons. I proceed by arguing that the focus on <b>reason</b> <b>giving</b> vindicates both procedural and substan-tive conceptions {{of the rule of law}}. In my view, <b>reason</b> <b>giving</b> is an essential component of the procedural conception because all the procedural account seems to require is that the state does whatever it does in a predictable and consistent way and justify it by <b>reasons.</b> Likewise, <b>reason</b> <b>giving</b> can serve to characterize the core of the substantive proposal. Substantive conceptions of the rule of law claim that the rule of law’s central purpose is to ensure certain just outcomes. In that perspective, requiring that legal decision-makers <b>give</b> <b>reasons</b> is more apt to protect us against abuse than other forms of decision-making. In line with this reframing, I conclude that theoretical refl ections on the rule of law should pay more attention to the legal duty to <b>give</b> <b>reasons</b> than has been done in the past, thereby leading to a context-sensitive assessment of the rule of law and its virtue(s) ...|$|R
