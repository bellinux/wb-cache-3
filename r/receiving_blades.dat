40|$|In this paper, the {{sensitivity}} of the structural integrity of wind turbine blades to debonding of the shear web from the spar cap was investigated. In this regard, modal analysis, static and fatigue testing were performed on a 45. 7 m blade for three states of the blade: (i) as <b>received</b> <b>blade</b> (ii) when a crack of 200 mm was introduced between the web and the spar cap and (iii) when the crack was extended to 1000 mm. Calibration pull-tests for all three states of the blade were performed to obtain the strain-bending moment relationship of the blade according to the estimated target bending moment (BM) which the blade is expected to experience in its service life. The resultant data was used to apply appropriate load in the fatigue tests. The blade natural frequencies in flapwise and edgewise directions over a range of frequency domain were found by modal testing for all three states of the blade. The blade first natural frequency for each state was used for the flapwise fatigue tests. These were performed in accordance with technical specification IEC TS 61400 - 23. The fatigue results showed that, for a 200 mm crack between the web and spar cap at 9 m from the blade root, the crack did not propagate at 50 % of the target BM up to 62, 110 cycles. However, when the load was increased to 70 % of target BM, some damages were detected on the pressure side of the blade. When the 200 mm crack was extended to 1000 mm, the crack began to propagate when the applied load exceeded 100 % of target BM and the blade experienced delaminations, adhesive joint failure, compression failure and sandwich core failure...|$|R

40|$|The airflow {{around a}} {{helicopter}} and especially around the main rotor is very complex, non-uniform and highly non-linear. The {{wake of a}} helicopter’s main rotor interacts very strongly with the rotor itself, giving rise {{to a number of}} problems that can only be addressed if the geometry and intensity of the wake is known {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. The best compromise between computational cost and accuracy are vortex-lattice formulations known as Freewake codes. The Institute of Flight Systems of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with DLR’s Simulation and Software Technology operates a modern Freewake implementation which has been optimized for computations on a workstation using GPGPU accelerators. The code is coupled via file IO to a comprehensive rotor simulation tool called S 4. Freewake <b>receives</b> <b>blade</b> motion and circulation data from S 4 for a trimmed state, then calculates a number of revolutions using this steady-state and returns induced inflow velocities. This conventional weak coupling scheme for Freewake codes is very robust and converges after only a few iterations. The flip-side is that only trimmed steady-state solutions can be computed. While these cases cover most of the flight time of a helicopter, there are phases that cannot be covered e. g. take-off and landing, maneuvering flight, flight in turbulent atmosphere and autorotation which is an emergency maneuver helicopters use in case of engine failure. Here the Rotor is decoupled from the engine and is only driven by the slipstream. During this maneuver the rotor speed varies significantly making a weak coupling scheme all but useless. This talk focuses on the integration of the Freewake code base into S 4 and the development of different coupling schemes. Another focus are recent developments of the Freewake pertaining to the integration of fuselage-rotor-interference as an additional induced velocity and its transport through the wake as well as further optimizations of the code and a nested MPI/OpenMP parallelization scheme...|$|R

Once extracted from the tusk, the handle was polished on both sides and hollowed out to <b>receive</b> the <b>blade.</b> The thickness of the handle around the tang of the blade varies from 2 to 3 mm, which explains that the ivory is cracked there, with some pieces lost.

5000|$|The hunt is also {{associated}} with the administering of a herbal viaticum in the medieval chansons de geste, in which traditional heroic culture and Christian values interpenetrate.

Sarah Kay views this substitute rite as communion with the Girardian [...] "primitive sacred," [...] speculating that [...] "pagan" [...] beliefs lurk beneath a Christian veneer. In the Raoul de Cambrai, the dying Bernier <b>receives</b> three <b>blades</b> of grass {{in place of the}} corpus Domini. Two other chansons place this desire for communion within the mytheme of the sacrificial boar hunt. In Daurel et Beton, Bove is murdered next to the boar he just killed; he asks his own killer to grant him communion [...] "with a leaf," [...] and when he is denied, he then asks that his enemy eat his heart instead. This request is granted; the killer partakes of the victim’s body as an alternative sacrament. In Garin le Loheren, Begon is similarly assassinated next to the corpse of a boar, and takes communion with three blades of grass.|$|R

40|$|New turbine runners {{designed}} for safer fish passage will {{be installed in}} Units 1, 2 and 3 at Ice Harbor Lock and Dam. Installation of the new runners will begin in 2015 with completion anticipated in 2018. Unit 2 will <b>receive</b> a fixed <b>blade</b> runner and {{will be the first}} installed. Unit 1 and Unit 3 will <b>receive</b> identical adjustable <b>blade</b> (Kaplan) runners. Installation of Unit 2 will be complete in early 2016; Units 3 and 1 will be complete in 2017 and 2018 respectively. These new turbine runners are designed to reduce risk of injury to juvenile fish caused by mechanisms such as blade strike and shear, as well as pressure injuries known as barotrauma. Extensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and physical hydraulic modeling efforts have focused on achieving good hydraulic conditions with minimum pressures of 83 kPa to 103 kPa. Maintaining nadir pressures ≥ 83 kPa will greatly reduce risk of pressure related injury and mortality experienced by turbine passed juvenile salmonids. Once installed the new turbine runners require a biological evaluation to establish the biological performance and to validate the design process and criteria. The biological study design should produce precise, accurate survival estimates with the least associated bias possible. A combination of balloon tag and acoustic telemetry study methods will provide turbine survival estimates encompassing both direct and indirect effects of turbine passage. These study methods have been Regionally accepted and used to establish the most recent estimates of turbine passage survival at the lower Snake and Columbia River dams. Turbine pressure and acceleration data will be collected. These data will be used correlate conditions fish experience as they pass through the turbines with injury and mortality. These data provide evidence of blade strike, shear, and pressure and will also be used to determine how well the new turbine designs meet the biological criteria, and for comparison with and validation of CFD model results. Pertinent factors are discussed for consideration in choosing and implementing each study design. Statistical analysis methods and preliminary sample sizes associated with these study designs are presented, as well as design assumptions and biases, project operations, and sample season considerations. Internal and external acoustic and balloon tagging methods, release locations for upstream releases and direct turbine intake releases, and acoustic detection array locations are discussed as well...|$|R
40|$|A linear {{microphone}} array {{is shown to}} be a simple tool to locate aerodynamic sound sources on a horizontal axis wind turbine. This paper discusses the capabilities and limitations of a linear {{microphone array}} to locate sound sources and measure aerodynamic noise on the blades of a horizontal axis wind turbine rotor.

For a linear array, areas exist in the rotor plane where the sources cannot be located unambiguously. For certain applications, {{it is not necessary to}} map the whole rotor plane. This paper also shows the result of an experimental test aimed at locating and measuring aerodynamic sound sources on the three blades of a wind turbine.

40|$|Layer 5 {{pyramidal}} neurons comprise {{an important}} but heterogeneous group of cortical projection neurons. In motor-frontal cortex, these neurons are centrally {{involved in the}} cortical control of movement. Recent studies indicate that local excitatory networks in mouse motor-frontal cortex are dominated by descending pathways from layer 2 / 3 to 5. However, those pathways were identified in experiments involving unlabeled neurons in wild type mice. Here, to explore the possibility of class-specific connectivity in this descending pathway, we mapped the local sources of excitatory synaptic input to a genetically labeled population of cortical neurons: YFP-positive layer 5 neurons of YFP-H mice. We found, first, that in motor cortex, YFP-positive neurons were distributed in a double blade, {{consistent with the idea}} of layer 5 B having greater thickness in frontal neocortex. Second, whereas unlabeled neurons in upper layer 5 received their strongest inputs from layer 2, YFP-positive neurons in the upper <b>blade</b> <b>received</b> prominent layer 3 inputs. Third, YFP-positive neurons exhibited distinct electrophysiological properties, including low spike frequency adaptation, as reported previously.

40|$|The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera {{provides}} one of {{the most}} productive ecosystems on the planet. This alga is highly dependent upon environmental factors, such as water flow, light intensity, and temperature. In this study, growth rates of M. pyrifera were compared between exposed and sheltered sites on Catalina Island, California. Growth patterns in exposed sites were predicted to have faster elongation growth rates, whereas sheltered sites were expected to have higher on-plant herbivore abundances and slower growth rates. Multiple transects were placed throughout each site and fifteen M. pyrifera individuals were randomly selected and tagged (n= 15 /per site). Following the hole-punched method of Parke (1948) and Brown (1997), each <b>blade</b> <b>received</b> a centered hole-punch. Tagged individuals were re-measured weekly for growth and herbivore counts. To further investigate blade morphology between M. pyrifera in exposed and sheltered sites, mature and juvenile blades were selected and surface area comparisons were conducted. Herbivore abundances were highest in the sheltered site. This suggests energy that would normally be allocated toward growth could possibly be diverted toward defense. Therefore the exposed site resulted with the highest elongation growth rate. In contrast, the sheltered site had the highest total surface area of blades making growth comparisons between sites more complex. By monitoring the growth rates and morphological variation of M. pyrifera, insight is gained on these interconnected systems harboring over 200 species of algae, invertebrates, fishes, and mammals...|$|R
