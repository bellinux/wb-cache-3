This means that the <b>rotating</b> <b>tool</b> or shaft, instead of being centrally aligned, will rotate about a secondary axis.

50|$|The {{accessory}} is {{fitted to}} the tool by some mechanism which allows that accessory to be rapidly rotated {{back and forth}} (oscillated). This creates friction with the sanding attachments or rapid cutting motions with the saw and grinding attachments.The narrow angle of oscillation allows for precise control over the tool as it does not kick like a <b>rotating</b> <b>tool</b> can. The angle of oscillation creates increasing friction further {{from the center of}} the tool as these areas travel a greater distance. The increased friction is particularly apparent with the triangular sanding and grinding attachments which allow the operator to reach into corners and confined spaces, a feature unique to this type of power tool. The saw blade attachments use the angle of oscillation in the same way.|$|E
50|$|In {{friction}} stir processing (FSP), a <b>rotating</b> <b>tool</b> is {{used with}} a pin and a shoulder to {{a single piece of}} material to make specific property enhancement, such as improving the material’s toughness or flexibility, in a specific area in the micro-structure of the material via fine grain of a second material with properties that improve the first.(MA) Friction between the tool and workpieces results in localized heating that softens and plasticizes the workpiece. A volume of processed material is produced by movement of materials {{from the front of the}} pin to the back of the pin. During this process, the material undergoes intense plastic deformation and this results in significant grain refinement. (Misha) FSP changes physical properties without changing physical state which helps engineers create things such as “high-strain-rate superplasticity”. The grain refinement occurs on the base material improving properties of the first material, while mixing with the second material. This causes for the base material’s properties. This allows for a variety of materials to be altered to be changed for things that may require other difficult to acquire conditions. The processes branches off of friction stir welding (FSW) which uses the same process to weld two pieces of different materials together without heating, melting, or having to change the materials’ physical state.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is {{a simple}} process {{involving}} a <b>rotating</b> <b>tool</b> (with an extended pin) traversing on the joining line of the two work pieces leaving behind the required weld. Tool geometry (pin and shoulder), rotational speed, traverse speed, and tilt angle are important parameters which determine the resultant properties of weld. Milling machines due to <b>rotating</b> <b>tool</b> and traversing {{can be used as}} a method of doing laboratory scale FSW experiment. In cases where milling machines have a fixed head, limitation of zero degree tool tilt angle results in substantial defects (e. g. tunnel defect) in weldments. In this study a new approach is developed and adopted for overcoming this limitation of a fixed head vertical milling machine to incorporate the flexibility of tool tilt. The results for welding with and without this approach are presented along with discussion and conclusion...|$|E

40|$|Large {{improvements}} in cutting tool design and technology {{have been achieved}} in the last decades. But the problem of improving the tool body material is not adequately studied. In the present study, the different aspects associated with the steel properties as related to the milling cutter body application are reviewed. The working performance of a tool holder depends in particular on the fatigue strength, high temperature properties and machinability of the <b>tool</b> steel used. <b>Rotating</b> <b>tools,</b> tool {{going in and out}} of cutting engagement, impose dynamic stresses and require adequate fatigue strength off the tool. Different publications, as well as internal investigation at Uddeholm Tooling AB show that the working temperatures of milling cutter bodies in the insert pocket vary from 300 to 600 degrees Celsius depending on the cutting conditions and material of the workpiece. As a result, steel for this application needs good hot properties such as high temper resistance, high hot hardness values, etc. Machinability is also essential as machining of steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a milling cutter. Its complex shape with flutes and insert pockets as well as small thread holes and small deep holes for cooling channels require time consuming and advanced machining operations. The essential properties mentioned above were characterized with the emphasis to the steel type, its microstructure and purity, processing and surface treatment and strong interrelations between them...|$|R

40|$|New Developments in High Speed Cutting {{and their}} Effect on Designing Milling Tools.

Modern HSC milling tools, e. g. for aluminum and magnesium applications, are designed with consideration according to centrifugal load. Talking about fast <b>rotating</b> <b>tools,</b> cutting forces play only a minor role. For cast iron and steel roughing processes centrifugal forces are usually low according to low cutting speeds. Hence, the design of these tools is mainly based on cutting forces.

That is why this article examines, whether the continuous increase in cutting speed for cast iron and steel machining leads to the need of considering centrifugal forces for the tool design...|$|R
