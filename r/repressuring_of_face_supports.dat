40|$|Many {{modern face}} {{verification}} algorithms {{use a small}} set of reference templates to save memory and computational resources. However, both the reference templates and {{the combination of the}} corresponding matching scores are heuristically chosen.

For each client, our method learns a support vector machine using the given matching algorithm as the kernel function, and determines a set of reference templates, that we call <b>support</b> <b>faces,</b> corresponding to its support vectors.

Yet, the relation between perceptual awareness and perceptual categorization has remained largely uncovered so far.

We used morphed continua between two face identities and we assessed, through a masked priming paradigm, the perceptual processing <b>of</b> these morphed <b>faces</b> under subliminal and supraliminal conditions. We found that priming from subliminal faces followed linearly the information present in the primes, while priming from visible faces revealed a non-linear profile, indicating a categorical processing <b>of</b> <b>face</b> identities. Our results thus point to a special relation between perceptual awareness and categorical processing <b>of</b> <b>faces,</b> and <b>support</b> the dissociation between two modes of information processing: a subliminal mode involving analog treatment of stimuli information, and a supraliminal mode relying on discrete representation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCurrent models <b>of</b> <b>face</b> {{processing}} <b>support</b> an orientation-dependent expert face processing mechanism. However, {{even when}} upright, faces are encountered from different viewpoints, across which a face processing {{system must be}} able to generalize. Different computational models have generated competing predictions of how viewpoint variation might affect the perception of upright versus inverted faces. Our goal was to examine the interaction between viewpoint variation and orientation on face discrimination. Sixteen normal subjects performed an oddity paradigm requiring subjects to discriminate changes in three simultaneously viewed morphed faces presented either upright or inverted. In one type of trial all the faces were seen in frontal view; in the other all faces varied in viewpoint, rotated 45 ° from each other. After the effects of orientation were adjusted for perceptual difficulty, there were only main effects of orientation and viewpoint, with no interaction between orientation and viewpoint. We conclude that the effects of viewpoint variation on the perceptual discrimination <b>of</b> <b>faces</b> is not different for upright versus inverted faces, indicating that its effects are independent of the expertise that exists for upright faces...|$|R
40|$|Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) {{network is}} one of the largest public works {{projects}} undertaken by the Singapore government. This thesis summarizes and evaluates the performance of Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) construction in Singapore's MRT network. Surface settlement induced by the tunneling process can cause damage to underground utilities and foundations and buildings and/or disrupt daily life by damaging roads and pavements, and is used in this thesis as a measure of performance. The influence of encountered geology and adopted construction methods (referring to the type of TBM used) on settlement is discussed. The dominant construction method on all four existing MRT lines involved the use of shield TBMs, with the main difference being the method <b>of</b> <b>face</b> <b>support</b> adopted. The North-South East-West (NS-EW) line employed largely compressed air as <b>face</b> <b>support,</b> while a move towards greater use of Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) was observed on the North-East line (NEL) and Circle Line (CCL). The use of EPB on the NEL resulted in 22 incidences of large, localized ground losses, which were of two types; 1. subsurface voids, or voids which formed above the tunnel face but were grouted before they could migrate to the surface, 2. surface sinkholes, or local depressions which were found by visual inspection to appear over the tunnels as the machine advanced. These large, localized ground losses usually occurred when tunneling through different weathering grades within a single formation or through mixed <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> different geological formations. The variability in ground conditions which resulted from these mixed weathering grades and mixed faces is a direct result of extensive tropical weathering of Singapore's soils, and poses a challenge to the performance of EPB machines during construction. The employment of slurry machines on the CCL was intended to mitigate some <b>of</b> the difficulties <b>faced</b> by EPB machines on the NEL, though with limited success. The use of slurry machines on the CCL resulted in the additional problem of slurry discharging to the surface and disrupting traffic. Given Singapore's plans to double the length of her rail network by 2030, the need to understand the impact of construction projects on adjacent structures and surface activities remains just as important, if not more so. by Wanling Chong.
