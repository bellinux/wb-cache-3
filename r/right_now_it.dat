25|$|Back at UNIT, Captain Mike Yates and Sergeant Benton were {{watching}} {{the end of the}} broadcast as it went dead. In the morning they arrive at the village just as a heatwave engulfs the village. The Brigadier finds himself unable to enter the village, as there is an invisible dome-shaped barrier, 10 miles in diameter and one mile high, surrounding it that causes anything trying to enter to heat up and burst into flame. The barrier is centred on the church. He contacts Yates and is briefed on the situation while the Doctor and Jo return to the dig where they find a small spaceship in the mound, which has been condensed. From this, the Doctor realises that the Master is trying to conjure up an ancient and all-powerful demon, who is seen on Earth to be the Devil, but actually an alien. The Doctor explains that the Dæmons have influenced Earth throughout its history, becoming part of human myth, and see the planet as a giant experiment. The Master has called the Dæmon up once, and <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> is so small as to be invisible. The third summoning, however, could signal the end of the experiment, and the world.|$|E

Hill has spoken frequently about how having a child lessened the amount of time she had for climbing but not her love for it. As she said in one interview, [...] "I feel that <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> doesn't have to be all about me and my experiences. I was ready to begin a new role; to face new challenges and adventures as a mother. It's a good learning experience adjusting to the sacrifices that need to be made." ...|$|E

As big as that song is getting for us <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> was {{definitely}} a song that we thought we had to have in the show. She cut a thing for us to use, and I cut a thing for her to use in her show if she wants to do that. It's a cool way to have her be a part of the show even though she's not going to be there every night." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stefan Schumacher: [...] "I'm {{not happy}} <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it's</b> a shame {{it has to}} end this way. For my career it's a big step, because it's my biggest win so far, but still I'm not happy <b>right</b> <b>now.</b>|$|R

500|$|Likewise {{the first}} film, {{the film was}} shot in and around Vancouver Island. [...] "We know the arena, we know the people up there and let's be honest, there’s an {{enormous}} economic incentive to shoot there. We were very fortunate to get [...] Justis Greene, who’s been working as a line producer up there for 30 years and {{who was able to}} get us the best crew working in town <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> <b>It</b> was advantageous to us on so many levels, that it was just the right place to go for this movie," [...] Perry stated as the reason for the film's production in British Columbia. British Columbia Highway 19 was utilized as Route 23. The Plaza of Nations was used as a stand-in for Ellis Medical Complex, the site of Tim's death.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Just Jared, Rihanna explained how the bright and colorful was more representational of her persona, saying [...] "I've started to incorporate {{a lot of different}} colors into my wardrobe now. I'm loving that direction. <b>Right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> feels good and right. It was a cool concept too because it was kind of one side of me and now, it's evolving into the new colorful stuff that we've been doing." [...] In {{an interview}} for MTV News, Guetta explained his role in the music video, saying [...] "I'm DJing from a spaceship. It's actually really funny, because we shot that in Los Angeles in a place where they used to shoot Star Trek, but like the old ones. And so it's kind of retro futuristic, you know? It's like how people were seeing the future back in the 80s. It has a sense of humor in the video." [...] The nighttime version was released as the song's official music video to download digitally on 1 February 2011.|$|E
500|$|As the character's storyline progressed, {{he became}} [...] "one {{of the most}} devious {{characters}} on daytime" [...] {{as part of a}} Gothic plot in which Adam secretly torments Ashley, Victor's love interest, to get revenge on his father. The story called for Adam to be blind, with uncertainty whether his condition is genuine. Engen told Julie McElwain of Soaps In Depth that he was not sure how to portray the blindness. He said, [...] "I didn't want to nail it on the head completely with the blindness, because I wasn't sure if the blindness was real. Signy [...] won awards for her portrayal of retinitis pigmentosa, and I {{thought it would be a}} dishonor to that if I came too close to the mark." [...] Engen said that he thought that former executive producers, Maria Arena Bell and Paul Rauch, and the writers [...] "know what they're doing, and <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> would seem like Adam is instigating more...drama." [...] The actor worried whether the character's actions might lead to him becoming [...] "irredeemable", but also said he took it as a challenge to make what Adam does [...] "interesting and human".|$|E

5000|$|While [...] "Ramblin' Rose" [...] and [...] "Motor City Is Burning" [...] {{open with}} {{inflammatory}} rhetoric, {{it was the}} opening line to the title track that stirred up controversy. Vocalist Rob Tyner shouted, [...] "And <b>right</b> <b>now...</b> <b>right</b> <b>now...</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>it's</b> time to... kick out the jams, motherfuckers!" [...] before the opening riffs. Elektra Records executives were offended by the line and had preferred to edit {{it out of the}} album (replacing the offending words with [...] "brothers and sisters"), while the band and manager John Sinclair adamantly opposed this.|$|R

2500|$|On 15 July 2006, Ahmadinejad {{compared}} {{the actions of}} Israel in launching an offensive against Lebanon to that of Nazi Germany.

[...] Charleston, West Virginia has the worst divorce rate among 100 cities in the nation. Stephen Smith, {{the executive director of the}} West Virginia Healthy Kids and Families Coalition, said that poor employment prospects are to blame: [...] "The pressure to make a good living puts strain on a marriage, and <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> is infinitely harder to make a living here than it was 40 years ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{match was}} {{immediately}} abandoned.

5000|$|In February 2007 it was SourceForge.net's Project of the Month.

[...] and [...] "FreeCol, though, is here <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it’s</b> free, it’s stable, it’s pretty much feature-complete and unlike its parent it has multiplayer".

5000|$|At the 2011 release, Game Informer {{summarized}} {{the game as}} [...] "A Total Disaster", explaining that [...] "This might be a decent game after six more months of twice-weekly patching. <b>Right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it’s</b> a failure on every level."

2500|$|People's Park is now co-managed by the {{university}} and various community groups. During subsequent years, the [...] plot of land known as [...] "People's Park" [...] has remained a focus of controversy between {{the university}}, and disparate elements of the Berkeley community.

I love the idea of having some kind of memorial recognition there, but <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> is not a place {{that a lot of people}} are comfortable going to." [...] Current UC Berkeley students experience People’s Park in a much different way than did UC Berkeley students from the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|But in late 1990, {{while driving}} in Arizona {{en route to}} a show in Las Vegas, Nevada, the group's tour bus crashed, and drummer Andy Galeon was {{critically}} injured, needing more than a year to recover. Cavestany said at the time that [...] "n a way, it made perfect sense to have a major accident <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> really fit the story line. We've been pushing so hard for 8 years and just not getting that far, and getting so frustrated with not being where we should be after so long, it was time for something climactic to happen!" [...] Following the accident, Geffen Records and the band's manager pressured the group to hire another drummer and immediately go back to work. The band performed a few shows in Japan with drummer Chris Kontos, but when they declined to hire a long-term replacement, Geffen Records dropped them.|$|E
2500|$|Cork manager Conor Counihan {{expressed}} his feelings {{in the press}} room: [...] "Relief, {{at the end of}} the day. It's fantastic for the lads, each and every one of them. I spoke to them and we have 30 good guys here, but there are a lot of guys down the years who for one reason or another we had to move on from and those guys are part of this. And the last 20 years, we were landed with a fantastic group of players. They made it hard for themselves, but that makes it all the sweeter". Cork captain Graham Canty also {{expressed his}} feelings at a press conference: [...] "Ah. It feels all <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> <b>It</b> is humbling being captain of this bunch of players.

They performed at the Pukkelpop festival in Belgium with Sonic Youth on July 22, Albini's 25th birthday. At a sold-out show in London for 1,300 people, Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis of Wire joined Big Black onstage to play an encore of Wire's [...] "Heartbeat" [...] (Big Black had released a cover version of the song as a single in conjunction with Headache).

2500|$|Dir En Grey was {{preceded by}} the {{independent}} rock band La:Sadie's, which included four of Dir En Grey's members before it ended activities. They disbanded due to leader and bassist Kisaki not wanting to debut as he {{felt that it was}} too soon, but guitarist Kaoru believed that they were ready for it. After parting ways with Kisaki, members Kaoru, Kyo, Die and Shinya recruited bassist Toshiya and regrouped as a new band. After playing one show at Nagano Live House on January 24, they decided to stay together as [...] "Dir En Grey" [...] on February 2, 1997. They released their first EP, Missa, a few months later. According to Toshiya, the name [...] "Dir En Grey" [...] was chosen because it [...] "sounded right" [...] and is composed of words from several languages so that people {{would not be able to}} attach a specific meaning to it other than the band's name itself. However, in another interview Kaoru said [...] "At the time we chose the band name, it had some meaning but <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> doesn’t express the band anymore, so it has come to not mean anything specific. We chose the band name because it sounded right, and it also reflects an image that probably doesn’t exist elsewhere." ...|$|E
