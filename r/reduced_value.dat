The same practice which was used in other Commonwealth countries such as South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

25|$|In 2000, Apple {{released}} the Power Mac G4 Cube, their first desktop since the discontinued Power Macintosh G3, to slot between the iMac G3 and the Power Mac G4. Even with its innovative design, it was initially priced US$200 {{higher than the}} comparably-equipped and more-expandable base Power Mac G4, while also not including a monitor, making it too expensive and resulting in slow sales. Apple sold just 29,000 Cubes in Q4 of 2000 which was one third of expectations, compared to 308,000 Macs during that same quarter, and Cube sales dropped to 12,000 units in Q1 of 2001.

2500|$|Lavalle's most dire {{prediction}} {{came from}} the second report he released at the 2000 National Consumer Law Conference in Broomfield. [...] Lavalle's report, authored in 1999, foresaw the impending collapse of the mortgage and credit markets {{and the failure of}} major Wall Street firms and banks over their subprime mortgage investments. [...] On pages 30 to 33 of Lavalle's 21st Century Loan Sharks Report, [...] Lavalle wrote: [...] "The effects of a predator's behavior has a wide range effect on many, not just the borrowers being abused. [...] This includes the predator's own shareholders, investors, government and the public. [...] "The effects of predatory lenders and the subprime mortgage market on these constituencies and the financial markets include: 1) devaluing of various mortgage derivative products; 2) failure of major banks and Wall Street firms; 3) reluctance of corporations, mutual funds and other investors to invest in legitimate mortgage backed securities; 4) increased government regulation and supervision; 5) illegal stripping of equity of customer's homes; 6) outcries from shareholders and constituents; 7) credit downgrading of mortgage backed securities; 8) <b>reduced</b> <b>value</b> and marketability of mortgage backed securities; 9) reduced stock and option prices; 10) elimination of jobs due to cuts and layoffs; 11) overpayment of false and fraudulent claims by federal government; and 12) increase in foreclosed and abandoned homes in communities across America." [...] Virtually each of Lavalle's predictions came true in the collapse of the international mortgage and financial markets that was precipitated by the collapse of two Bear Stearns hedge funds specializing in MBS products in the summer of 2007.|$|E
6000|$|The efflux would {{continue}} until the currencies of all countries {{had come to}} a level; by which I do not mean, until money became of the same value everywhere, but until the differences were only those which existed before, and which corresponded to permanent differences in the cost of obtaining it. When the rise of prices had extended itself in an equal degree to all countries, exports and imports would everywhere revert to what they were at first, would balance one another, and the exchanges would return to par. If such a sum of money as $200,000,000, when spread over the whole surface of the commercial world, were sufficient to raise the general level in a perceptible degree, the effect would be of no long duration. No alteration having occurred in the general conditions under which the metals were procured, either in the world at large or in any part of it, the <b>reduced</b> <b>value</b> would no longer be remunerating, and the supply from the mines would cease partially or wholly, until the $200,000,000 were absorbed.(283) ...|$|E

Doing it too late would mean that trees would grow tall and slender and though some increment would come to the trees, they may be less marketable as thinness <b>reduces</b> <b>value.</b> Too early and epicormic shooting is a risk, and this can lead to tree branchiness and knots in the resultant timber harvest, again <b>reducing</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R

60|$|Suppose that, in {{a country}} of which the {{currency}} is wholly metallic, a paper currency is suddenly issued, to the amount of half the metallic circulation; not by a banking establishment, or in the form of loans, but by the Government, in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities. The currency being suddenly increased by one half, all prices will rise, and, among the rest, the prices of all things made of gold and silver. An ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin, by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship; and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured, until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper. Then prices will relapse to what they were at first, and there will be nothing changed, except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before. Suppose, now, a second emission of paper; the same series of effects will be renewed; and so on, until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared [see Chart No. XIV, Chap. XV, for the exportation of gold from the United States after the issue of our paper money in 1862]: that is, if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin; if not, as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments. The addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce, for a time, the value of the article; and as long as this is the case, even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation, as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the <b>reduced</b> <b>value</b> of the metallic material; but the value having fallen below the cost of production, a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction, after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value. We are here supposing, as we have supposed throughout, that the country has mines of its own, and no commercial intercourse with other countries; for, {{in a country}} having foreign trade, the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method.|$|E
