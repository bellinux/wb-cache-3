25|$|CART {{officials}} {{held out}} the possibility of rescheduling the race, but there was no room in the schedule and it was ultimately canceled. The race marked the first time a CART race had been canceled outright due to driver safety issues. The 1985 Michigan 500 was postponed six days due to concerns about Goodyear's new <b>radial</b> <b>tire.</b> After three major crashes, drivers refused to participate, and the race was run the following weekend with the old bias-ply tires.|$|E
25|$|Redline {{bias-ply}} tires {{continued as}} standard equipment on the 1968 GTO, {{though they could}} be replaced by whitewall tires at no extra cost. A new option was radial tires for improved ride and handling. However, very few were delivered with the radial tires because of manufacturing problems encountered by supplier B.F. Goodrich. The <b>radial</b> <b>tire</b> option was discontinued after 1968. Pontiac did not offer radial tires as a factory option on the GTO again until the 1974 model.|$|E

The GAF has painted bumpers and no spotlights in front, {{as well as}} chromed hubcaps {{rather than}} the sportier wheels of the better equipped models. Inside the center console was deleted, as were several gauges, and a more pedestrian two-spoke steering wheel replaced the original sportier looking three-spoked unit.

These tires are very popular with enthusiasts who want the vintage look, with the increased driving comfort of a <b>radial</b> <b>tire.</b> Coker Tire also has a Performance Division, which sells mostly drag racing tires. Coker sells Phoenix Race Tires, M&H Racemaster, Pro-Trac, Hoosier Pro Street Radials, and select Firestone vintage tires through its performance division.

50|$|In the {{interest}} of cost containment, cars may use either roller camshafts (a type used in Busch Series and Craftsman Truck Series engines), or flat tappet camshafts (used in Nextel Cup engines). All cars using a roller camshaft must run a 10.0:1 compression ratio, slightly higher than the former 9.5:1 ratio mandated by NASCAR for those series. All cars using a flat-tappet camshaft must run with current NASCAR regulations mandating a 12.0:1 compression ratio, adopted in the late 1990s. Cars must also run bias-ply tires, despite Goodyear's four-season transition (1989-92) to <b>radial</b> <b>tires.</b> The first race with radials was the 1989 First Union 400 at North Wilkesboro, NC. The last bias-ply race was the 1992 Food City 500 at Bristol, TN.
