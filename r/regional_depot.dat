50|$|North of Leipzig Hauptbahnhof, the {{continuously}} double-track line turns {{east and}} runs through a densely populated area. The platforms of Leipzig-Volkmarsdorf station, which have been dismantled, lay just before the Hermann-Liebmann-Straße road bridge (km 1.9) and at the following Bennigsenstraße bridge there is a track connection from the <b>regional</b> <b>depot</b> to the old LDE locomotive depot {{on the line to}} Dresden {{on the other side of}} the Leipzig-Geithain railway. The line now continues slightly to the southeast, while the now dismantled link to the Leipzig-Hof railway, connecting to Zwickau and Plauen (-Hof), formerly ran straight ahead and then took a 90 degree turn to the south and crossed a bridge over the Leipzig-Dresden line. Immediately after the bridge of Torgauer Straße, a single-track connection ran from the line to Hof to meet the Leipzig-Dresden line near Leipzig-Sellerhausen station at Püchauerstraße junction.|$|E
5000|$|In 1821 the North West Company was {{merged into}} the Hudson's Bay Company, which took {{ownership}} of the fort. Fort George continued to function the primary entrepôt of the Columbia Department until 1825. During {{a tour of the}} newly acquired assets on the Pacific shore, Governor George Simpson spent the winter of 1824 at Fort George. He found the station inappropriate both as a fur post and a <b>regional</b> <b>depot.</b> Simpson ordered the establishment of a new post and depot further in the interior along the Columbia River. A suitable prairie was selected by the Governor as having much more for agricultural projects. Besides his intention for this new post to supply foodstuffs for company stations in the Pacific Northwest, Simpson determined to relocate the Columbia Department administrative apparatus there as well. This new station was christened Fort Vancouver, with the initial construction completed in the spring of 1825. HBC personnel withdrew from Fort George two months later. Neighboring native villagers began to seasonally reside there, [...] "rapidly reducing it to a state of ruin & filth." [...] A small number of lodges, likely maintained by Clatsops, were established fairly close to Fort George.|$|E

40|$|Distribution is an {{indispensable}} component of logistics and supply chain management. Location-Routing Problem (LRP) is an NP-hard problem that simultaneously takes into consideration location, allocation, and vehicle routing decisions to design an optimal distribution network. Multi-layer and multi-product LRP {{is even more}} complex as it deals with the decisions at multiple layers of a distribution network where multiple products are transported within and between layers of the network. This paper focuses on modeling a complicated four-layer and multi-product LRP {{which has not been}} tackled yet. The distribution network consists of plants, central <b>depots,</b> <b>regional</b> <b>depots,</b> and customers. In this study, the structure, assumptions, and limitations of the distribution network are defined and the mathematical optimization programming model {{that can be used to}} obtain the optimal solution is developed. Presented by a mixed-integer programming model, the LRP considers the location problem at two layers, the allocation problem at three layers, the vehicle routing problem at three layers, and a transshipment problem. The mathematical model locates central and <b>regional</b> <b>depots,</b> allocates customers to plants, central <b>depots,</b> and <b>regional</b> <b>depots,</b> constructs tours from each plant or open depot to customers, and constructs transshipment paths from plants to depots and from depots to other depots. Considering realistic assumptions and limitations such as producing multiple products, limited production capacity, limited depot and vehicle capacity, and limited traveling distances enables the user to capture the real world situations...|$|R

One method for doing this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at <b>regional</b> <b>depots</b> after it had been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|R

40|$|We {{deal with}} a {{distribution}} network design problem that involves location, fleet assignment and routing decisions. Specifically, the distribution network under investigation is characterized by one central depot, a set of customers split into regions, and a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. The goal is to locate one <b>regional</b> <b>depot</b> in each region, to assign some vehicles to each region, and to design the vehicles routes, each starting and ending at the central depot, {{in such a way}} that the <b>regional</b> <b>depot</b> is visited once by all vehicles assigned to the corresponding region, the vehicle capacities are not exceeded, the customer demands are satisfied and the overall distribution cost is minimized. The study has been motivated by a real life application related to a company operating in the North of Italy. We propose a two-phase heuristic for this problem which first determines an initial feasible solution, and then improves it by using very large neighborhood search techniques. We characterize a local search neighborhood in terms of path and cyclic exchanges of customers among routes, the so-called multi-exchanges. We also extend the definition of multi-exchange in such a way to allow fleet assignment modifications. We then complement the multi-exchange methodology with a more classic relocation mechanism, designed to perform depot location adjustments. The proposed approach has been validated with the real life case study as well as with several randomly generated instances. The results of the extensive computational experimentation show that the proposed approach is very promising. In the case of instances characterized by a small or a medium size the heuristic was able to compute very good quality solutions in a limited amount of time. In the case of very large instances, including the real case study, the heuristic proved to be the only tool for determining feasible solutions to the problem, whereas a commercial solver such as CPLEX generally was not able to discover any feasible solution within a time limit of 25 h...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to solve a complex {{multi-product}} four-layer capacitated location-routing problem (LRP) in which two specific constraints are taken into account: 1) plants have limited production capacity, and 2) central depots have limited capacity for storing and transshipping products. The LRP represents a multi-product four-layer distribution network that consists of plants, central <b>depots,</b> <b>regional</b> <b>depots,</b> and customers.

50|$|The {{class had}} a {{reputation}} for being free steamers and strong pullers. Although they have a well-deserved reputation for their reliability, like any new class the W locos suffered some minor teething problems, including ashpan failures, and leaks in and around the foundation ring. The leaks were traced to faulty welding. The class suffered from stay failures in its early days, particularly in and around the throat plate. The first to fail was W913 in 1952. At one point, no less than 34 of the class were in Midland Railway Workshops or <b>regional</b> <b>depots</b> for stay repair. The problem was traced back to the thermic syphons creating significant water movement in the area, overstressing the boiler plates, as well as problems with the quality of the original stays. The syphons were progressively removed over a seven-year period, eliminating the problem.|$|R

40|$|Wales services. This {{followed}} {{several years}} of design work and extensive {{testing of a prototype}} train. The increase in passenger traffic on these routes, during {{the first two years of}} high speed operation, clearly indicates that there is a demand for such a service and that the train itself fully meets the need from the passenger viewpoint. Unlike some railway administrations, who have built separate lines dedicated to high speed services, it is British Rail policy to operate these units on the existing network, sharing it with passenger and freight trains running at conventional speeds. Because of this policy the designer is constrained by track impact force limitations specified by the Civil Engineer and he must also ensure that the train can be operated safely within the existing signalling arrangements. Bearing in mind the extent of technical innovation it is not surprising that a number of problems have arisen. However, as a result of prompt and effective action on the part of both the railway and the railway supply industries, modifications have soon been introduced to eliminate the problems. The paper starts with a brief description of the train and the facilities provided to ensure adequate maintenance resources both within <b>regional</b> <b>depots</b> and railway workshops. This is followed by a review of experience to date and the paper concludes with a forecast about future trends in high speed operation. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) supplemented in protein-restricted diets on the growth performance and the expression profile of amino acid transporters and energy metabolism related regulators in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of different <b>regional</b> <b>depots</b> including dorsal subcutaneous adipose (DSA) and abdominal subcutaneous adipose (ASA). A total of 24 crossbred barrows (7. 40  ±  0. 70  kg) were randomly divided into 4 groups and were fed the following isocaloric diets for 33 days: 1) a recommended adequate protein diet (AP, 20 % CP, as a positive control); 2) a low protein diet (LP, 17 % CP); 3) the LP diet supplemented with BCAA (LP + B, 17 % CP) to reach {{the same level of}} the AP diet group; 4) the LP diet supplemented with 2 times the amount of BCAA (LP +  2 B, 17 % CP). The daily gain and daily feed intake of the LP diet group were the lowest among all the treatments (P    0. 05). Moreover, BCAA supplementation down-regulated the expression levels of amino acid transporters including L-type amino acid transporter 1 and sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 in DSA, but up-regulated the expression level of L-type amino acid transporter 4 in ASA (P <  0. 05). Meanwhile, the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase α was activated in the DSA of pigs fed LP diet and in the ASA of the pigs fed AP or LP +  2 B diets (P <  0. 05). The mRNA expression profile of the selected mitochondrial component and mitochondrial biogenesis associated regulators in DSA and ASA also responded differently to dietary BCAA supplementation. These results suggested that the growth performance of growing pigs fed protein restricted diets supplemented with BCAA could catch up to that of the pigs fed AP diets. The results also partly demonstrated that the regulation mechanisms of BCAA are different in the adipose tissues of different depots...|$|R

40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with obesity-related chronic inflammation of adipose tissue. Current research has investigated what occurs in visceral (VAT) versus subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from an immunological perspective. To date, no studies have examined immunological differences in upper body vs. lower body SAT but research suggests that these regions differ in metabolic activity. It is hypothesized that 1) adipocyte size and number, and 2) the quantity and type of immune cells will differ in upper and lower body subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese adults and that these differences will be distinct in early-onset obesity (childhood weight gain) compared to late-onset obesity (adult weight gain). It is also hypothesized that immune cells will be associated with blood lipid concentrations. Thirteen subjects who had early-onset or late-onset obesity were recruited. Visits included fasting blood draws for lipid levels, dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT) scans for body composition, and SAT biopsies of the abdominal and femoral regions. Biopsy tissue samples were digested and stained with antibody markers for CD 3, CD 4 and CD 8 for T-cells, as well as CD 68 and CD 206 for macrophages and were analyzed using flow cytometry. For both groups as a whole, % of CD 4 + T-cells was associated (ρ= 0. 83; P= 0. 042) with cholesterol in the abdominal {{but not in the}} femoral region and HDL cholesterol concentrations were inversely correlated (ρ= - 0. 83; P= 0. 04) with abdominal CD 3 +CD 8 + T-cells but not in the femoral region. These correlations indicate an association between cardiac health risk factors and the presence of T-cells in obesity-induced inflammation. There were no significant differences detected between early- and late-onset groups for body composition, blood chemistry, or between <b>regional</b> <b>depots.</b> However, trends reported indicate that early-onset subjects had more upper than lower body SAT. Fat cell size was higher in the late-onset group while cell number was higher in the early-onset group. As well, T-cells and macrophages were more numerous in the femoral versus abdominal regions. The continuation of this study deserves merit, as early results seem to indicate the potential for interesting findings in the future...|$|R
