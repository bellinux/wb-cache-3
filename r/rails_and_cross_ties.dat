Potter and his Union Army troops [...] "discovered nine {{locomotives}} {{and approximately}} 200 cars from {{the rolling stock}} of the Wilmington & Manchester and South Carolina Railroads. His army proceeded to burn, blow up, and otherwise destroy these trains and tracks." [...] During World War II, much of the scrap metal from the wreckage was salvaged for the war effort.

5000|$|Each of Brunelleschi's stone chains {{was built}} like an {{octagonal}} railroad track with parallel <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> <b>ties,</b> all made of sandstone beams 43 cm {{in diameter and}} no more than 2.3 m long. The rails were connected end-to-end with lead-glazed iron splices. The cross ties and rails were notched together and then covered with the bricks and mortar of the inner dome. The cross ties of the bottom chain can be seen protruding from the drum {{at the base of the}} dome. The others are hidden. Each stone chain was supposed to be reinforced with a standard iron chain made of interlocking links, but a magnetic survey conducted in the 1970s failed to detect any evidence of iron chains, which if they exist are deeply embedded in the thick masonry walls. Brunelleschi also included vertical [...] "ribs" [...] set on the corners of the octagon, curving towards the center point. The Ribs, 13 feet (4 meters) deep, are supported by 16 concealed ribs radiating from center. The ribs had slits to take beams that supported platforms, thus allowing the work to progress upward without the need for scaffolding.|$|E
2500|$|Going into 1872, the {{railroad}} had five turnouts (switches), 3 miles of iron <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> 27,000 <b>cross</b> <b>ties</b> {{on hand for}} the work that year, but overall, progress on the road had been slowed for [...]."want of labor". However, during that period, the first train passed in January, from Littlestown to the banks of Big Pipe Creek, a distance of fourteen miles and within a mile of the Western Maryland railroad, which interchange was to be completed by February. This completed connections with the PRR-controlled Hanover and Littlestown railroads as well as the Western Maryland, allowing the Pennsylvania Company to run their engines over the road bringing in all the iron from the North Central (Littlestown) and Hanover branch.|$|R

40|$|A {{parameter}} {{study and}} grid search optimisation is performed on a parameterised crossing geometry. Crossing designs are evaluated {{with respect to}} the maximum Hertzian wheel‒rail contact pressure recorded during simulated freight traffic. Each crossing design is evaluated by running five simulation runs in each traffic direction (facing and trailing moves of the through route) with different combinations of wheel profile and friction coefficient. The sensitivity of nine design variables is estimated using regression analysis on the damage estimates for the different crossing designs. Two different categories of design variables are investigated: parameters related to the cross-sectional rail profiles of the wing <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> nose, <b>and</b> parameters controlling the longitudinal height profiles of the wing <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> nose. Parameter settings are found that provide lower objectives than the nominal design, but the improvements are typically small...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} robust geometry optimisation of railway crossings is presented. The robustness {{is achieved by}} optimising the crossing geometry for a representative set of wheel profiles. As {{a basis for the}} optimisation, a crossing geometry is created where <b>rail</b> cross-sectional profiles <b>and</b> longitudinal height profiles of both wing <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> nose are parameterised. Based on the approximation that the two problems are decoupled, separate optimisations are performed for the cross-sectional <b>rail</b> profiles <b>and</b> the longitudinal height profiles. The rail cross sections are optimised to minimise the maximum Hertzian wheel-rail contact pressure. The longitudinal height profiles are optimised to minimise the accumulated damage in the wing rail to crossing nose transition zone. The accumulated damage is approximated using an objective criterion that accounts for the angle of the wheel trajectory reversal during the transition from the wing rail to the crossing nose as well as the distribution of transition points for the utilised wheel profile set. It is found that small nonlinear height deviations from a linear longitudinal wing rail profile in the transition zone can reduce the objective compared to the nominal design. It is further demonstrated that the variation in wheel profile shapes, lateral wheel displacements and the feasible transition zone length of the crossing will determine the longitudinal height profiles of the wing <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> <b>crossing</b> nose if all wheel profiles are to make their transition within the transition zone...|$|R

This stiffness {{is affected by the}} size and shape of the cross section, the growth ring pattern, the stiffness properties of the wood and the boundary conditions. Various rectangular sections with concentric circular growth rings with systematic variation of pith location were studied for elastic orthotropic wood properties corresponding to a softwood species and a hardwood species. Two conventional and two periodic boundary conditions were considered. The results are presented in diagrams. Growth ring pattern <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> section size were found to be of great importance for the stiffness, in particular for softwood elements.
