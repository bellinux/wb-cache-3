5000|$|The English word {{apostasy}} {{is derived}} from the Greek noun, apostasia. Thayer defines apostasia as 'a falling away, defection, apostasy; in the Bible sc. from the true religion.'

A kindred word is the synonym apostasion. Thayer defines apostasion, as used in the Bible, as [...] "divorce, repudiation." [...] He cites Matthew 19:7 and Mark 10:4, ... "a bill of divorce apostasion." [...] He also cites Matthew 5:31, ... "let him give her a bill of divorce apostasion." [...] He cites the use of apostasion by Demosthenes as [...] "defection, of a freedman from his patron." [...] Moulton and Milligan cite the use of apostasion as a [...] "bond of relinquishing (of property sold) ... a contract of renunciation ... the <b>renunciation</b> of <b>rights</b> of ownership." [...] They also cite the use of apostasion [...] "with reference to 'a deed of divorce.'" [...] The meaning of the related verb aphistēmi ... is, of course, consonant with the meaning of the nouns. It is used transitively in Acts 5:37, ... "drew away people after him." [...] Intransitively, it means to depart, go away, desert, withdraw, fall away, become faithless, etc.|$|R
