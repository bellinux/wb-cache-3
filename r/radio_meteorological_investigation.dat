Recently, the Ka-band is being investigated for its possible employment as complementary channel of X-band that, to date, {{is one of the}} more diffuse for deep-space transmissions. In this context, Bepi Colombo (the ESA mission to Mercury planned in 2018) foresees both an X-band and a Ka-band channel for the transmission of the scientific data. For microwave frequencies above the X band, the troposphere impairments on the propagating signal represent a limitation to overcome. New emerging prediction techniques based on weather forecast and <b>radio</b> <b>meteorological</b> models, can be usefully adopted to optimize Ka-band transmission data rates (and maximize the received data volume) with respect to the forecasted channel state. We have recently demonstrated this concept for the Cebreros (Spain) ESA-Track station within Bepi Colombo mission for the sample year 2012. In this work we spatially and temporally extend the previous data volume analysis made for Cebreros in a more systematic way by considering a longer transmission period up to 4 years for both the ESA-track stations in Cebreros and Malargüe (Argentina) at X and Ka band. WE have tested the output of the <b>radio</b> <b>meteorological</b> forecast model for both Cebreros and Malargue sites using available measured data.

The relationship between wind shear and differential upwelling is established using a blend of oceanographic and <b>meteorological</b> <b>investigations.</b> Mesoscale aerial survey case studies form the observational basis from which the spatial variations in winds and upwelling are compared. Coastal winds, controlled by the pressure gradient between the South Atlantic Anticyclone and a summertime interior low, become modulated through interactions with the circumpolar jet stream. Low level winds accelerate over portions of the southern Benguela current region through deflections forced by three pronounced capes, two with mountain ridges exceeding 1000 m. Selected case studies are utilized to contrast the characteristics of deep and shallow wind flow, and the exposed and sheltered offshore regions. The spatial variability of the low level wind and sea surface temperature fields is correlated by means of aerial survey techniques applied at alongshore spacings of 10 to 50 km. Vertical transect and profile data collected at altitudes up to 1 km illustrate the variable depth of wind flow. Vertical wind shear controls the interaction of topography and winds. Field results show that vertical shears of - 2 (10 ⁻²) s⁻¹ produce horizontal wind vorticities of - 6 (10 ⁻⁴) s⁻¹ and alongshore sea surface temperature gradients of 1 °C (10 km) ⁻¹, a characteristic of summertime upwelling in the southern Benguela region...|$|R

This second paper of the series ‘‘Microclimate within beech stands’’ focuses on the thermal conditions that exist mainly in the near-surface layer at diﬀerent test plots. They were analysed by air temperature, Ta, (at 1. 5 m a. g. l) and soil temperature, Ts, at six depths measured continuously in the period 1999 – 2003. The main results can be summarized as follows. (1) The thermal situation within the beech stands described by Ta depended primarily on the turbulent air-mass exchange conditions which {{were based on the}} slope-speciﬁc energy balance of the forest ﬂoor and advective heat ﬂuxes. (2) The thermal situation within the soil described by Ts at 3 and 20 cm depth was governed by the molecular heat transport. Therefore, the heating and cooling rates of Ts were always lower than for Ta. Higher Ta and Ts values for the test plots on the SW slope showed that the thermal conditions within the beech stands depended primarily on the exposure. (3) Based on slope-speciﬁc diﬀerences of daily extremes of Ta and Ts at 3 cm depth between the silviculturally treated and control plots, the inﬂuence of the more pronounced height growth of the understorey vegetation under the near-surface thermal conditions could be clearly veriﬁed for the NE slope...|$|R

40|$|Three {{long-range}} 2 GHz radio paths {{have been}} established in the British Channel Islands in order to investigate the characteristics of long-range propagation of UHF radio waves over the sea {{as part of a}} project supported by Ofcom, UK. The relationship between specific over-sea propagation mechanisms (such as evaporation ducting and super-refraction) in the lower troposphere and signal strength distribution patterns has been examined, modelled and correlated with meteorological parameters. A number of <b>radio</b> <b>meteorological</b> statistics specifically related to evaporation duct propagation in a temperate region such as the English Channel has been presented to confirm the capability of this key propagation mechanism to guide radio waves to distances well beyond the normal radio horizon. Evaporation ducting and diffraction appear to be the dominant propagation mechanisms at most times. Signal strength enhancements have been observed on all three radio paths, primarily in the late afternoon and evening periods, {{in the spring and summer}} months. During periods of enhanced propagation, which occur approximately 8 % of the time of a 50 km path, the presence of additional higher-level ducting/super-refractive structures has been verified and their influence has been modelled with reasonable success. Additionally, the statistical variation of bulk meteorological parameters in the context of enhanced signal propagation has also been examined. The relatively long-term observations made during this study confirm the fact that the constantly changing weather patterns in the troposphere (e. g. the occurrence of anticyclonic weather) are directly responsible for the occurrence of enhanced signals at certain periods of time. The various issues under investigation are of direct relevance in the planning of radio communication systems operating in the UHF band (e. g. GSM and UMTS) in marine and coastal regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{mesoscale}} Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) {{model is}} gaining popularity among the hydrometeorological community in providing high-resolution rainfall forecasts at the catchment scale. Although {{the performance of}} the model has been verified in capturing the physical processes of severe storm events, the modelling accuracy is negatively affected by significant errors in the initial conditions used to drive the model. Several <b>meteorological</b> <b>investigations</b> have shown that the assimilation of real-time observations, especially the radar data can help improve the accuracy of the rainfall predictions given by mesoscale NWP models. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of data assimilation for hydrological applications at the catchment scale. Radar reflectivity together with surface and upper-air meteorological observations is assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using the three-dimensional variational data-assimilation technique. Improvement of the rainfall accumulation and its temporal variation after data assimilation is examined for four storm events in the Brue catchment (135. 2 km 2) located in southwest England. The storm events are selected with different rainfall distributions in space and time. It is found that the rainfall improvement is most obvious for the events with one-dimensional evenness in either space or time. The effect of data assimilation is even more significant in the innermost domain which has the finest spatial resolution. However, for the events with two-dimensional unevenness of rainfall, i. e. the rainfall is concentrated in a small area and in a short time period, the effect of data assimilation is not ideal. WRF fails in capturing the whole process of the highly convective storm with densely concentrated rainfall in a small area and a short time period. A shortened assimilation time interval together with more efficient utilisation of the weather radar data might help improve the effectiveness of data assimilation in such cases.

The study involved simulation of converging radio links over weather radar images of the radar reflectivity factor, from which the specific attenuation of rain at 30 GHz was derived. The average correlation of attenuation on two converging links as a function of their angular separation is shown to indicate the potential benefits in the use of cell-site diversity, especially in heavy rain. Results show that diversity gain exhibits a dependence on angular separation in the general form of sin (2). For links of identical lengths the model reduces to a root-sinusoidal shape (= 0 5), whereas links of unequal lengths lead to the ITU-R recommended model (= 1).

The measurements were taken {{as part of an}} interdisciplinary project on the effects of climate and forest management on structures and processes within beech dominated deciduous forests. Near-surface stations for continuous recording of meteorological variables in forests provide the basis of the investigations. Two each were installed on two opposite slopes (NE and SW) of a narrow valley: one within a control plot (no silvicultural thinning) and one within a silviculturally treated plot (strong shelterwood felling). Meteorological towers on each control plot provided data for the analysis of climatic conditions above the beech stands and within their canopies. The experimental design is well-suited for investigation of not only the influence of exposition, but also the effects of forest management and phenophases on the microclimate within differently handled beech stands. The plant area index PAI is used to characterize the canopy. The present article deals with the photosynthetically active radiation PAR at the near-surface stations and above the stands as a reference. PAR is measured horizontally. Above the stands, differences to PAR received parallel to the slopes can be estimated by use of model calculations for the incoming solar radiation G {{due to the fact that}} PAR/G is almost constant (1. 937 µmol/J) above the stands. For PAR and the PAR-interception within the canopy in the year 2001, the following results are discussed: mean diurnal courses in one month within the leafless period (February) and the vegetation period (August), daily mean values over the whole year and monthly mean values. For the leafless period the results show the influence of the exposition of both slopes on PAR at the near-surface stations and the PAR-interception. In the vegetation period, however, the influence of the fully developed canopy was more significant than exposition. With increasing PAI, results from regression analysis for the entire investigation period indicate a linear decrease of PAR/G below the canopy as well as an exponential increase of PAR-interception within the canopy and a logarithmic decrease of the PARtransmission through the canopy. The extinction coefficient k for PAR shows a tendency towards logarithmic decrease with increasing PAI...|$|R
