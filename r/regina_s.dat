Objectives. Determine outcome of the 2005 appropriateness use criteria (AUC) for SPECT in a diverse population of patients and physicians. Background. AUC for SPECT were the first cardiology document to identify 52 clinical indications for imaging, 49 of them for stress SPECT. AUC have been proposed as cornerstone of responsible use of perfusion imaging. Methods. 585 consecutive patients undergoing SPECT were evaluated prospectively. Appropriateness was examined for demographic variables, clinical variables, and for physician and patient subgroups. Combined end-point of total mortality, cardiac revascularization, and cardiac admissions at 1 year post SPECT was evaluated. Results. SPECT indications were: appropriate, 63 %; uncertain, 20 %; inappropriate, 14 %; not assigned, 3 %. Most appropriate SPECT were observed in patients with known coronary disease (72 %), chest pain syndrome (89 %), high pre-test likelihood of disease (100 %), men (70 %), inpatients (72 %), and cardiovascular physicians ’ referrals (69 %). End-point was reached in 53 patients (97. 4 % follow up). Unadjusted event rates were: appropriate (12 %), uncertain (7. 1 %), inappropriate (2. 4 %) SPECT (P =. 01). Conclusion. Appropriateness of SPECT differs in subgroups of patients and physicians. Clinically significant outcomes occur more frequently in the appropriate stress SPECT group. Focuse...|$|E
40|$|Wright, <b>Regina</b> <b>S.</b> Waist {{circumference}} (WC) measurement is {{a reliable}} indicator of preventable, central obesity-related, disease risk. Despite its predictive value, it is rarely measured {{in primary care}} (PC) settings. The absence of WC screening may be problematic for older adults. Older adults have higher rates of central obesity and greater risk for central obesity-related disease, such as Type 2 Diabetes (T 2 D), as compared to younger adults. Early detection of central obesity along with central obesity T 2 D disease risk education may prevent, delay, or control T 2 D in older adults. ☐ It is unknown if WC measurement and central obesity T 2 D disease risk education affects community-based older adults’ (a) acceptance of and willingness toward WC measurement, (b) perceived susceptibility to T 2 D and perceived benefits of WC measurement, and (c) health behaviors of physical activity and dietary behaviors. This study examined the effect of WC measurement and central obesity T 2 D disease risk education {{in comparison to the}} effect of the current standard practice of body mass index (BMI) calculation and obesity classification in PC. The Health Belief Model constructs of perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, and cues to action were integral to this study design. It was hypothesized that two experimental cues to action, (a) WC measurement and (b) central obesity T 2 D disease risk education would have a greater effect on acceptance of and willingness toward WC measurement, perceived susceptibility for T 2 D, perceived benefit of WC measurement, physical activity, and dietary behaviors than two control cues to action (c) BMI and (d) obesity classification in community-based older adults. ☐ This study found that 92 % of {{the participants in this study}} reported never having WC measurement in the PC setting and 75 % reported never having BMI calculation in the PC setting. The lack of BMI experience in both groups may have caused BMI calculation and obesity classification to function as interventional cues to action in both groups rather than control cues to action. The sample was educated and physically active. High baseline findings associated with (a) acceptance of and willingness toward WC measurement, (b) perceived susceptibility, and (c) physical activity, limited measurement of significant change at posttest. There was a significant change in perceived benefits of WC measurement and BMI calculation, as well as willingness to exercise in the experimental group compared to the control group. Changes in dietary behaviors were non-significant. ☐ High baseline acceptance of, and willingness toward, WC measurement in the absence of WC measurement experience, supports acceptability of WC measurement among community-based older adults. Combined use of WC measurement and BMI calculation is recommended in PC settings to influence community-based older adults’ perceived benefits and to motivate change in health behaviors.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Artificial {{surfaces}} that exhibit unidirectional water spreading and superhydrophobicity are obtained by Strelitzia reginae leaves.

Instead, the shrinkage of the leaf tissue, {{as a consequence of}} the natural dehydration process, induces an enhancement of the superficial corrugation. This results in the establishment of a superhydrophobic state, which shows a WCA of up to 160 °, and water rolling off. <b>S.</b> <b>reginae</b> leaves are therefore easily accessible stamps suitable for controlling wettability and realizing surfaces that exhibit various wetting behaviors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{shape of}} flowers {{frequently}} {{corresponds to the}} morphology of pollinators but some floral traits may also function to prevent non-pollinating flower visitors from stealing flower rewards. Despite the presence of such structures few studies have demonstrated their efficacy in limiting the nectar intake by nectar thieves. The flowers of Strelitzia reginae are regularly visited by sunbirds that do not effect pollination and act solely as nectar thieves. In this species, the nectary is covered by the convoluted bases of the petals (“nectar barriers”). In this study we investigate how non-pollinating sunbirds interact with these nectar barriers and whether nectar barriers {{play a role in}} limiting the amount of nectar sunbirds can steal. We quantified the volume of nectar that sunbirds consume while visiting flowers where nectar barriers were present and in flowers where these were experimentally removed. We found that sunbirds consume a median of 106. 8 µl of nectar when visiting flowers with nectar barriers present and consumed a significantly greater volume of nectar (median= 158. 03 µl) in flowers without nectar barriers. These results suggest that the convoluted petals that cover the nectary of <b>S.</b> <b>reginae</b> may function to reduce nectar theft but {{are likely to be more}} effective against insect nectar thieves.
