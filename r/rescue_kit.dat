40|$|Abstract The opioid use and {{overdose}} {{crisis is}} persistent and dynamic. Opioid overdoses were initially driven in the 1990 s and 2000 s by the increasing availability and misuse of prescription opioids. More recently, opioid overdoses are increasing at alarming rates due to wider use of heroin, {{which in some}} places is mixed with fentanyl or fentanyl derivatives. Naloxone access for opioid overdose rescue {{is one of the}} US Department of Health and Human Services 2 ̆ 019 three priority areas for responding to the opioid crisis. This article summarizes the known benefits of naloxone access and details unanswered questions about overdose education and naloxone <b>rescue</b> <b>kits.</b> Hopefully future research will address these knowledge gaps, improve the effectiveness of opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution programs, and unlock the full promise of naloxone <b>rescue</b> <b>kits...</b>|$|R

Both community-year strata with 1 - 100 enrollments per 100, 000 population (adjusted rate ratio 0. 73, 95 % confidence interval 0. 57 to 0. 91) and community-year strata with greater than 100 enrollments per 100, 000 population (0. 54, 0. 39 to 0. 76) had significantly reduced adjusted rate ratios compared with communities with no implementation.

Methods: Program participants were surveyed by telephone after their ED visit about their substance use, overdose risk knowledge, history of witnessed and personal overdoses, and actions in a witnessed overdose including use of naloxone. Results: A total of 415 ED patients received OE or OEN between January 1, 2011 and February 28, 2012. Among those, 51 (12 %) completed the survey; 37 (73 %) of those received a naloxone kit, and 14 (27 %) received OE only. Past 30 -day opioid use was reported by 35 % OEN and 36 % OE, and an overdose was reported by 19 % OEN and 29 % OE. Among 53 % (27 / 51) of participants who witnessed another individual experiencing an overdose, 95 % OEN and 88 % OE stayed with victim, 74 % OEN and 38 % OE called 911, 26 % OEN and 25 % OE performed rescue breathing, and 32 % OEN (n= 6) used a naloxone kit to reverse the overdose. We did not detect statistically significant differences between OEN and OE-only groups in opioid use, overdose or response to a witnessed overdose. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of ED-based opioid overdose prevention education and naloxone distribution to trained laypersons, patients and their social network. The program reached a high-risk population that commonly witnessed overdoses and that called for help and used naloxone, when available, to rescue people. While the study was retrospective with a low response rate, it provides preliminary data for larger, prospective studies of ED-based overdose prevention programs.

5000|$|Although her {{term was}} largely {{consumed}} by oversight of federally funded programs, upon assuming office as Deputy Director of the ONDCP, Madras {{became aware of}} a newly emerging threat, fentanyl overdose deaths in heroin addicts. She rapidly organized a conference in Philadelphia with treatment providers, emergency responders, emergency room professionals, law enforcement officials, representatives from city governments, other healthcare professionals, to create a coordinated response to eliminate this threat to life. Within months and {{for a number of}} reasons, fentanyl overdose deaths declined rapidly. Of over 170 media events and interviews during her term, she gave two interviews on Narcan distribution to heroin addicts and friends. At that time, she strongly supported narcan rescue by trained healthcare personnel, but opposed distribution to heroin users and their friends, of overdose <b>rescue</b> <b>kits</b> of opiate-antidote naloxone (Narcan) in i.v. or nasal spray form. Her opposition was based on discussions with NIDA and SAMHSA and a scientific literature survey by NIDA. She voiced opposition to [...] "take-home" [...] narcan on the basis of inadequate scientific evidence to support this policy and on the basis of several publications of potential adverse outcomes. [...] "Madras says drug users aren't likely to be competent to deal with an overdose emergency". This quote was based on a several studies and the views of EMT responders, e.g. Seal et al., 2003, that indicated risks related to naloxone administration to opioid-dependent people, by untrained personnel. Her opposition to [...] "take-home" [...] narcan arose from a number of factors cited in an National Public Radiointerview. These included quoting Seal's detailed study of heroin - injectors in the San Franscisco Bay area. In this survey of 82 street-recruited IDU's who had experienced one or more heroin overdose events, 51% reported soliciting emergency assistance, 87% were in favor of participating in an overdose training program, 35% predicted they would feel comfortable using greater amounts of heroin if they had narcan in their possession, 62% would be less inclined to call 911 for an overdose, 30% would leave an overdose victim after naloxone resusitation, and 46% {{might not be able to}} dissuade the victim from using heroin again to alleviate withdrawal symptoms induced by naloxone. Another article published by van Dorp, raised concerns that i) [...] "the induction of an acute withdrawal syndrome (the occurrence of vomiting and aspiration is potentially life threatening)" [...] - and that could lead to abandonment by a narcan provider/friend; ii) [...] "the effect of naloxone may wear off prematurely when used for treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression and require multiple doses and long-term vigilance". [...] "Risks warranting the cautious use of naloxone and adequate monitoring of the cardiorespiratory status of the overdose person after naloxone administration where indicated". Based on the Seal study, she was concerned that Narcan kits may encourage 35% of drug abusers to use greater amounts of heroin because they thought overdosing isn't as likely, again leading to unintended consequences. Madras also felt that in the presence of healthcare professionals, the opportunity to provide detoxification and referral to treatment would be greater than in a [...] "take-home" [...] narcan provision program. She was concerned that in a [...] "take-home" [...] narcan program, not all resuscitated heroin overdose events could be safely left alone. This concern was based on an article by Etherington et al. (2000): [...] "In the medical community, it is recommended that patients with heroin overdose be watched for 4 to 24 hours after naloxone. In a recent study, overdose patients were formally assessed 1 hour after receiving naloxone for presumed opioid overdose. Of 573 patients, 48% were discharged in less than 2 hours, 23% in 2-4 hours and 29% in >4 hours. 94 patients who were held in the emergency department (ED) or admitted required a critical intervention, including supplemental oxygen for hypoxia (74), repeat naloxone (52), antibiotics administered intravenously (IV) (14), assisted ventilations (13), fluid bolus for hypotension (12), charcoal for associated life-threatening overdose (6), IV inotropic agents (2), antiarrhythmics for sustained tachycardia >130 beats/min (1), and administration of bicarbonate for arterial HCO3 <5 or venous CO2 <5 (1)". This study concluded that emergency physicians can clinically identify patients at risk of deterioration after naloxone reversal of suspected opioid overdose. She was concerned that in the [...] "take-home program", additional emergency room measures needed for a significant number of people (e.g. 94/573), would not be available. Finally, the majority of the scientific literature on take-home narcan (according to a NIDA survey requested by Dr. Madras) was based on pilot studies, feasibility studies, or letters to the editor, an inadequate body of research for developing public policy or advocating a major change in medical procedures that could potentially save or cost precious lives.|$|R
50|$|Survival camping {{involves}} certain {{items that}} campers are recommended {{to have with}} them in case something goes wrong {{and they need to}} be <b>rescued.</b> A survival <b>kit</b> includes mandatory items which are small and must fit in one's pocket or which otherwise could be carried on one's person. This kit is useless in these circumstances if it is kept in the backpack that is left in camp. Such a kit should include a small metal container which can be used to heat water over a campfire, a small length of duct tape which can prove useful in many situations, and an emergency space blanket. These blankets are specially designed to occupy minimal space and are perfect for making emergency shelters, keeping the camper warm. Also because of the aluminum-like color this blanket is reflective which means it can be easily seen from an aircraft. Candle stubs are good in starting a fire as well as in warming an enclosed space. One or two band-aids are mandatory in this type of camping. Any camper, and not only the survival ones, need waterproof matches or a lighter and a large safety pin or fish hook which can be used in fishing. Rubber gloves, antiseptic wipes, tinfoil, jackknife, or halazone tablets (which purify the water) are also to be included into a survival kit. Although these seem too many items to be carried on one person, they are in fact small, lightweight and definitely useful.|$|R
