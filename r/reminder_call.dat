40|$|BACKGROUND: Absenteeism from {{outpatient}} appointments is common. Telephone appointment-reminder calls reduce outpatient-appointment absenteeism in many clinic settings. OBJECTIVE: To {{determine if}} telephone appointment-reminder calls reduce outpatient absenteeism at a hospital-based pulmonary function laboratory. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of our pulmonary function laboratory’s outpatient appointment records from April to November 2004. Data were col-lected from consecutive outpatient appointments, including patient age, sex, whether a telephone ap-pointment-reminder call was successfully made, {{and whether the}} patient showed up for the scheduled test. We performed 3 analyses. Differences in absenteeism between the groups was the primary outcome measure. First, appointments were separated into 2 groups: (1) appointments for which a <b>reminder</b> <b>call</b> was attempted (“called ” group) and (2) appointments for which a <b>reminder</b> <b>call</b> was not attempted (“not-called ” group). The appointments were then separated into 2 further groups: (1) the <b>reminder</b> <b>call</b> was successfully achieved (“contacted ” group) and (2) the patient either was not called or was called but {{could not be reached}} (“not-contacted ” group). Finally, the contacted group was separated into 2 further groups: (1) reminder calls that resulted in direct conversation with an appropriate person at the patient’s listed telephone number, and (2) reminder message left on an answering machine.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{efficacy}} of two strategies for improving general practitioner response to a survey. A secondary aim was to assess GPs’ self reported preferred mode of survey administration. A random sample of 1666 GPs practising in New South Wales was selected from the Australasian Medical Publishing Company database. Two randomised trials of strategies aimed at increasing response rates were embedded in a larger cross sectional survey. Of the 1666 GPs sampled, 52 were ineligible and 500 completed the survey. The response rates obtained {{in the trial of}} standard research group letterhead invitations alone (25. 8 %) versus division of general practice cover letter (32. 5 %) were not statistically significantly different; nor were the response rates obtained in the trial of a telephone <b>reminder</b> <b>call.</b> When asked about preferred mode of survey administration, 81. 1 % of respondents nominated mailed survey.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the differential completion rates {{and cost of}} sequential methods for a survey of adolescents enrolled in a regional health care delivery organization. Methods: Four thousand randomly selected enrollees were invited to complete a mailed health sur-vey. Techniques used to boost response included (1) a follow-up mailing, (2) varying {{the appearance of the}} survey, (3) <b>reminder</b> <b>calls,</b> and (4) phone calls to obtain parent and child consent and to administer the survey. We evaluated the outcome and costs of these methods. Results: Seven hundred eighty-three enrollees (20 %) completed the first mailed survey and 521 com-pleted the second, increasing the overall response rate to 33 %. Completion was significantly higher among respondents who received only the plain survey than those receiving only the color survey (P <. 001). <b>Reminder</b> <b>calls</b> boosted response by 8 %. Switching to administration of the survey by phone boosted response by 20 % to 61 %. The cost per completed survey was $ 29 for the first mailing, $ 26 after both mailings, $ 42 for mailings and <b>reminder</b> <b>calls,</b> and $ 48 for adding phone surveys. Conclusion: The response to mailings and <b>reminder</b> <b>calls</b> was low and the cost was high, with de-creasing yield at each step, although some low-cost techniques were helpful. Results suggest phone sur-veys may be most effective among similar samples of adolescents. (J Am Board Fam Med 2010; 23 : 534 – 541. ...|$|R

Those interviewed by telephone were sent a package and asked to return the swab by mail, with one follow-up <b>reminder</b> <b>call.</b> Telephone interviewing resulted in a higher response rate for the completion of household and individual-level questionnaires. However, face-to-face interviews resulted in a significantly higher proportion of interviewees who returned swabs making the participation rate higher for this mode of contact (33. 7 versus 25. 0 percent). Using multivariable logistic regression, higher rates of rectal swab return were associated with face-to-face interviewing while adjusting for the impact of household size and respondent age and sex.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of a callrecall approach in enhancing Pap smear practice by changes of motivation stage among non-compliant women. Methods; A cluster randomized controlled trial with parallel and un-blinded design was conducted between January and November 2010 in 40 public secondary schools in Malaysia among 403 female teachers who never or infrequently attended for a Pap test. A cluster randomization was applied in assigning schools to both groups. An intervention group received an invitation and <b>reminder</b> (<b>call</b> recall program) for a Pap test (20 schools with 201 participants), while the control group received usual care from the existing cervical screening program (20 schools with 202 participants). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the effect of the intervention program on the action stage (Pap smear uptake) at 24 weeks. Results; In both groups, pre-contemplation stage was found as the highest proportion of changes in stages. At 24 weeks, an intervention group showed two times more in the action stage than control group (adjusted odds ratio 2. 44, 95 CI 1. 29 4. 62).

40|$|BACKGROUND—DNA ("did not attend") at {{outpatient}} clinics is {{an important}} problem costing the NHS an estimated £ 266 million annually. The national DNA rate for 1996 - 1997 for all clinics was 12 %. The DNA rate at Hammersmith Hospital for the same year {{in the care of}} the elderly specialty was 21 %. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish why this was so, and to test the efficacy of a <b>reminder</b> <b>call</b> in increasing attendance rates at care of the elderly clinics.  METHODS— 23 DNAs from seven clinics were contacted to ascertain the reasons for non-attendance (group I). For seven further clinics, 84  patients were contacted in advance to reconfirm their appointment (group II).  RESULTS—From group II 12  patients were identified who were unaware of their appointment (14 %), six of whom agreed to attend; thus six potential DNAs were prevented. Eleven vacant appointments were identified in advance. The unexpected DNA rate was reduced to 5 % from a potential 21 % as a result of this exercise. The DNA rate for all patients with dementia (both groups) was 44 %, whereas the DNA rate for all patients without this diagnosis (both groups) was 16 % (p <  0. 001).  CONCLUSIONS—A preclinic phone call reminder to elderly patients is feasible, increases attendance rates, and identifies vacant appointments. Patients with dementia are more likely to miss clinic appointments; therefore they and their carers need specific reminders about appointment dates. ...|$|E

Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled study among 735, 218 patients who exhibited nonadherent behavior by not refilling a maintenance medication 3  days from an expected refill date. Patients {{were randomly assigned}} to an intervention group who received LTR <b>reminder</b> <b>calls</b> or to a control group. We used Walgreens pharmaceutical claims data from 2015 to estimate the impact of LTR calls on short-term and annual adherence. Results: The initial refill rate within the first 14  days of the expected refill date significantly increased in the intervention group by 22. 8 % (6. 09 percentage points) compared to the control group (P< 0. 001). The proportion of days covered (PDC) in the intervention group increased significantly by 1. 5 % (0. 856 percentage points) relative to the control group (P< 0. 001) over 365  days. Patients in the intervention group were significantly more adherent (PDC ≥ 80 %) by 3 % (0. 97 percentage points) compared to the control group (P< 0. 001). Over a 270 -day follow-up period, persistence significantly increased by 2. 15  days in the intervention group (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Results from this study suggest that LTR <b>reminder</b> <b>calls</b> increased adherence for Medicare Part D patients who are late in refilling their medications and therefore have the potential to reduce their risk for hospitalization and health care costs. Additionally, the intervention increased the number of patients with PDC ≥ 80 % by ~ 3 %, positively impacting Medicare Part D plan quality rating.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{epidemiological}} {{and public}} health surveys report increasing difficulty obtaining high participation rates. We conducted a pilot follow-up study {{to determine whether a}} mailed or telephone survey would better facilitate data collection in a subset of respondents to an earlier telephone survey conducted as part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. Methods We randomly assigned 392 eligible mothers to receive a self-administered, mailed questionnaire (MQ) or a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) using similar recruitment protocols. If mothers gave permission to contact the fathers, fathers were recruited to complete the same instrument (MQ or CATI) as mothers. Results Mothers contacted for the MQ, within all demographic strata examined, were more likely to participate than those contacted for the CATI (86. 6 % vs. 70. 6 %). The median response time for mothers completing the MQ was 17 [*]days, compared to 29 [*]days for mothers completing the CATI. Mothers completing the MQ also required fewer <b>reminder</b> <b>calls</b> or letters to finish participation versus those assigned to the CATI (median 3 versus 6), though they were less likely to give permission to contact the father (75. 0 % vs. 85. 8 %). Fathers contacted for the MQ, however, had higher participation compared to fathers contacted for the CATI (85. 2 % vs. 54. 5 %). Fathers recruited to the MQ also had a shorter response time (median 17 [*]days) and required fewer <b>reminder</b> <b>calls</b> and letters (median 3 reminders) than those completing the CATI (medians 28 [*]days and 6 reminders). Conclusions We concluded that offering a MQ substantially improved participation rates and reduced recruitment effort compared to a CATI in this study. While a CATI has the advantage of being able to clarify answers to complex questions or eligibility requirements, our experience suggests that a MQ might be a good survey option for some studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the impact of a Group Health Cooperative {{outreach}} and reminder program on initiation of the HPV vaccine among 10 - 12 year olds receiving care at seven Group Health clinics in Western Washington. Study Design: The outreach and reminder initiative was a randomized control trial. Eligible children were randomized to receive an outreach letter and <b>reminder</b> <b>calls</b> about the HPV vaccine (intervention) or usual care (control). Randomization was at the child-level and stratified by clinic and gender, but outreach and reminder efforts were addressed and targeted to parents. Methods: This study conducted a preliminary analysis of the impact of the outreach and reminder program on initiation of the HPV vaccine for the overall study population and stratified by age. Chi-square tests were used to assess associations between group assignment (intervention or control) and receipt of HPV dose 1. Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank tests were used to compare HPV vaccine initiation over time between the intervention and control groups. Results: A total of 1, 805 children were included in the study; 1, 354 were randomized to the intervention and 451 to control. Our analysis included 1, 770 children after excluding 35 children who disenrolled after randomization, but before the intervention began. Overall, the intervention was not significantly associated with initiation of the HPV vaccine; 398 (30. 1 %) intervention children received HPV dose 1 compared to 121 (27. 1 %) control children (Chi-square test, p= 0. 23). There was also no association between the intervention and initiation of the HPV vaccine when the children were stratified by age (Chi-square test, 10 yrs, p= 0. 78; 11 yrs, p= 0. 31; 12 yrs, p= 0. 38). The Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that the difference in the vaccine initiation rates between the groups was not significant, overall (Log-rank test, p= 0. 08), nor when the children were stratified by age (Log-rank test, 10 yrs, p= 0. 71; 11 yrs, p= 0. 10; 12 yrs, p= 0. 31). Yet, a secondary analysis looking at vaccine initiation from the start of the <b>reminder</b> <b>calls</b> to the end of the analysis period showed a 6. 2 % difference in vaccine initiation rates between the intervention and control groups for 11 year olds (Chi-square test, p= 0. 07, Log-rank test, p= 0. 06). Conclusions: Group Health’s outreach and reminder program was not significantly associated with an increase in initiation of the HPV vaccine. However, while not significant, our data suggests that <b>reminder</b> <b>calls</b> may increase the initiation of the HPV vaccine among 11 year old children eligible for the vaccine in an insured population...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Sub-optimal {{adherence}} to prescribed medications is well documented. Barriers to medication adherence include medication side effects, cost, and forgetting to take or refill medications. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems show promise {{as a tool}} for reminding individuals to take or refill medications. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of using an IVR system for prescription refill and daily medication reminders. We tested two novel features: personalized, medication-specific reminder messages and communication via voice recognition. Methods Patients enrolled in a study of electronic prescribing and medication management in Quebec, Canada who were taking chronic disease-related drugs were eligible to participate. Consenting patients had their demographic, telephone, and medication information transferred to an IVR system, which telephoned patients to remind them to take mediations and/or refill their prescriptions. Facilitators and barriers of the IVR system use and acceptability of the IVR system were assessed through a structured survey and open-ended questions administered by telephone interview. Results Of the 528 eligible patients who were contacted, 237 refused and 291 consented; 99 participants had started the pilot study when it was terminated because of physician and participant complaints. Thirty-eight participants completed the follow-up interview. The majority found the IVR system's voice acceptable, and did not have problems setting up the time and location of <b>reminder</b> <b>calls.</b> However, many participants experienced technical problems when <b>called</b> for <b>reminders,</b> such as incorrect time of calls and voice recognition difficulties. In addition, most participants had already refilled their prescriptions when they received the <b>reminder</b> <b>calls,</b> reporting {{that they did not have}} difficulties remembering to refill prescriptions on their own. Also, participants were not receptive to speaking to an automated voice system. Conclusion IVR systems designed to improve medication compliance must address key technical and performance issues and target those individuals with reported memory difficulties or complex medication regimens in order to improve the utility of the system. Future research should also identify characteristics of medication users who are more likely to be receptive to IVR technology. </p...|$|R

Methods: randomized controlled clinical trial at a Primary Health Care Service, involving three groups: EG (educative session and test demonstration), BG (recall ribbon) and standard intervention (card containing the return appointment - graphical <b>reminder),</b> <b>called</b> comparative group here (CG). To select the sample, the following was established: having started sexual activity and undergoing the pap smear during the study, resulting in 775 women. Results: among the 775 women, 585 (75. 5 %) returned to receive the test result within 65 days. The educative group presented the highest return rate (EG= 82 %/CG= 77 %/BG= 66 %), statistically significant only when compared to the behavioral group (p= 0. 000).

40|$|Objectives: We {{evaluated}} the feasibility {{and efficacy of}} a program to promote colorectal cancer screening (CRC) among uninsured Latinas receiving mammography through a cancer screening clinic in northern Manhattan. Methods: Between August 2009 and March 2010, unscreened, average CRC risk, uninsured Latinas, aged 50 – 64 years, undergoing mammography received a screening recommendation, education, and fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Socio-demographic information and level of acculturation was collected. Screening compliance was assessed. Results: Of 651 Latinas evaluated, 210 were eligible and, of these, 94 % (n = 197) consented to participate; 441 were excluded because they were up-to-date with CRC screening (n = 130), less than 50 (n = 285) or greater than 64 (n = 26) years of age. After intervention, 177 (90 %) completed FIT. Within 2 weeks, 87 % completed the FIT, and 69 % did so with no <b>reminder</b> <b>calls.</b> Acculturation was significantly lower among screeners (p = 0. 014). Compared with non-screeners, screeners {{were more likely to}} be foreign-born (p = 0. 009), to speak only Spanish (p = 0. 043), and to prefer to read (p = 0. 037), and think (p = 0. 015) in Spanish. Conclusion: This study suggests that pairing CRC education and screening with mammography is both feasible and efficacious...|$|R

40|$|Twins {{taking part}} in two {{unrelated}} studies were sent aquestionnaire together with a self-addressed envelope that either carried one or multiple (up to 5) stamps to the same value. The unprompted proportion of questionnaires returned (before commencement of telephone <b>reminder</b> <b>calls)</b> was increased from 62 % to 71 % in one study, and from 43 % to 52 % in the other study (test for common odds ratio in studies, p = 0. 04). A large number of procedures to improve response rate to mailed questionnaire surveys are described in the survey lit-erature (Linsky, 1975; Moser & Kalton, 1979; Fowler, 1993). These include optimisation of questionnaire layout and length, {{the use of an}} introductory or approach letter which can be separately mailed or mailed under the same cover, introductory telephone calls, and the provision of prepaid return envelopes. It has been shown in several experiments that subjects are more likely to return a ques-tionnaire if a stamped return envelope is provided, as opposed to a business reply envelope (Linsky, 1975). Presumably in the latter case the perception is that the researcher does not lose financially if the subject fails to return the envelope. In a similar vein, increasing the number of stamps on the questionnaire mail-out envelope has been shown to increase the response rate over those sent with a single stamp (Linsky, 1975). In the present study, we compare the response rate to a “supranormal ” stimulus by increasing the number of postage stamps from one up to five per pre-addressed return envelope...|$|R
25|$|After a {{traumatic}} experience, {{a person may}} re-experience the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma <b>reminders,</b> also <b>called</b> triggers, can be uncomfortable and even painful. It can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, {{as well as the}} ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to psychoactive substances including alcohol to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events is reoccurring. They can range from distracting to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing symptoms are a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.|$|R
50|$|For a {{few years}} in the early 1990s, due to his {{presence}} on Fox, Walsh also appeared in the network's Saturday morning educational public service announcement segments, Totally For Kids, for Fox Kids. Walsh would appear with the segments' usual roster of child actors to help illustrate scenarios in which children could often be in danger, and the solutions they could seek. Subjects ranged from child abuse to being lost in a public place, whereas others were milder in nature such as never inviting strangers indoors if home alone or the problems of sugar rushes. Most installments Walsh appeared in culminated with <b>reminder</b> to <b>call</b> 911 in an emergency, showing a child dressed up in a telephone costume.|$|R
40|$|This {{descriptive}} study {{of millions of}} US Facebook users documents "friending " and communication patterns, exploring parent-child relationships {{across a variety of}} life stages and gender combinations. Using statistical techniques on 400, 000 posts and comments, we identify differences in how parents talk to their children (giving advice, affection, and <b>reminders</b> to <b>call)</b> compared to their other friends, and how they address their adult sons and daughters (talking about grandchildren and health concerns, and linguistically treating them like peers) compared to their teenage children. Parents and children have 20 - 30 mutual friends on the site, 19 % of whom are relatives. Unlike previous findings on family communication, interaction frequency on Facebook does not decrease with geographic distance...|$|R
