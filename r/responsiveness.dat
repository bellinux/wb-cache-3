5|$|The {{name of the}} {{disorder}} emphasizes problems with attachment but the criteria includes symptoms such as failure to thrive, a lack of developmentally appropriate social <b>responsiveness,</b> apathy, and onset before 8 months.|$|E
5|$|According to CNET, these phones {{were growing}} in US {{market share and}} ranked highly in CNET reviews due to their <b>responsiveness.</b> Snapdragon SoCs are also used in most Windows phones and most phones {{entering}} the market in mid-2013. The LG G2 was the first phone to market using the Snapdragon 800 in August 2013.|$|E
5|$|Alertness is {{a global}} {{observation}} of level of consciousness i.e. awareness of, and <b>responsiveness</b> to the environment, and this {{might be described as}} alert, clouded, drowsy, or stuporous. Orientation is assessed by asking the patient where he or she is (for example what building, town and state) and what time it is (time, day, date).|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the DPMA withdrew its {{opposition}} to the standard, citing the <b>responsiveness</b> of the committee to public concerns. In the same year, a National Bureau of Standards study concluded that the proposed standard would present few problems. A year later, a COBOL-80 compiler was released to DEC VAX users, who noted that conversion of COBOL-74 programs posed few problems. The new EVALUATE statement and inline PERFORM were particularly well received and improved productivity, thanks to simplified control flow and debugging.|$|E
5|$|In Western societies, the {{domestic}} guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate <b>responsiveness</b> to handling and feeding; {{and the relative}} ease of caring for them, continue to make guinea pigs a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.|$|E
5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of <b>responsiveness</b> by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high boots to wade through the mud, and at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E
5|$|Pediatricians {{are often}} the first health {{professionals}} to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with non-organic failure to thrive and display abnormal <b>responsiveness</b> to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E
5|$|Price {{elasticity}} of demand (PED or Ed) {{is a measure}} used in economics to show the <b>responsiveness,</b> or elasticity, of the quantity demanded of a good or service {{to a change in}} its price, ceteris paribus. More precisely, it gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price (ceteris paribus).|$|E
5|$|When {{brain death}} is suspected, {{reversible}} differential diagnoses such as hypothermia-induced coma, electrolyte, neurological and drug-related cognitive suppression {{need to be}} excluded. Testing for reflexes can be of help in the decision, as can the absence of response and breathing. Clinical observations, including a total lack of <b>responsiveness,</b> a known diagnosis, and neural imaging evidence, may all {{play a role in}} the decision to pronounce brain death.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the shallow}} reef {{platforms}} inhabited by the epaulette shark often become {{isolated from the}} ocean by the receding tide. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the pool can drop 80% or more overnight from the combined respiration of all the organisms within the pool. The epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions, being able to survive for over three hours in 5% of the atmospheric O2 level without losing behavioral <b>responsiveness.</b> In the laboratory, epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30°C (86°F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver <b>responsiveness</b> to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Discussions on {{improving}} the UN's effectiveness and <b>responsiveness</b> to international security threats often include {{reform of the}} UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting {{the use of the}} veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts {{on the rest of the}} body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of <b>responsiveness</b> such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E
5|$|The Status and {{recommendations}} category houses four sub-sections: 1-Click Maintenance, Performance Optimizer, Fix Problems and Live Optimization. The 1-Click Maintenance section runs multiple routine maintenance tools at once. The Performance Optimizer and Fix Problems utilities {{are intended to}} provide tips to identify and fix potential problems and increase performance, such as disabling unnecessary visual effects and disabling or removing unused Windows services and programs. Live Optimization, according to the application's author, is intended to improve the <b>responsiveness</b> of Windows applications by tweaking their execution priorities.|$|E
5|$|The first {{clinical}} study of psilocybin {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1970—led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona {{and supported by the}} Heffter Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—studied the effects of psilocybin on patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The pilot study found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased <b>responsiveness</b> to serotonin.|$|E
5|$|When {{properly}} treated, {{people with}} malaria can usually expect a complete recovery. However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days. In {{the most severe}} cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria. Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased <b>responsiveness</b> to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.|$|E
25|$|Once {{injury is}} {{assessed}} the victim's level of <b>responsiveness</b> should be evaluated.|$|E
25|$|This {{intervention}} {{focused on}} low socio-economic group mothers with irritable infants, assessed on a behavioural scale. The randomly assigned group received 3 treatment sessions, {{between the ages}} of 6 and 9 months, based on maternal <b>responsiveness</b> to negative and positive infant cues. Intervention was based on Ainsworth's sensitive <b>responsiveness</b> components, namely perceiving a signal, interpreting it correctly, selecting an appropriate response and implementing the response effectively.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{emerging}} evidence {{showed that}} glucocorticoids {{could be used in}} the treatment of decompensated heart failure to potentiate renal <b>responsiveness</b> to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large dose of loop diuretics. Glucocorticoids induce a potent diuresis in heart failure because they could improve renal <b>responsiveness</b> to atrial natriuretic peptide by upregulating natriuretic peptide receptor A NPR-A expression in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, inducing a potent diuresis.|$|E
25|$|Process <b>responsiveness</b> monitoring: Host {{operating}} {{system will be}} able to detect whether the software on the guest {{operating system}} is responsive or hung.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} {{inadequate}} tissue perfusion (blood delivery to tissues) in distributive shock {{is a lack}} of normal <b>responsiveness</b> of blood vessels to vasoconstrictive agents and direct vasodilation.|$|E
25|$|Accessibility vs ignoring: This scale {{measures}} the maternal figure's accessibility and <b>responsiveness</b> to the baby. The scale ranges from highly accessible to highly inaccessible, ignoring or neglecting.|$|E
25|$|Habituation {{involves}} decreased {{levels of}} attention and <b>responsiveness</b> to a stimulus {{that is no longer}} perceived as being novel. In the realm of olfactory memory, habituation refers to a decrease in <b>responsiveness</b> to an odor as a result of prolonged exposure (restricted to a certain repeated stimulus), which involves adaptation of cells in the olfactory system. Receptor neurons and mitral cells located in the olfactory system adapt in response to odors. This includes the involvement of piriform cortical neurons which adapt rapidly, more completely and selectively to novel odors and are also thought to play a very important role in the habituation of odors. Norepinephrine is considered to {{have an effect on the}} functioning of the mitral cells by increasing their <b>responsiveness.</b> Acetylcholine is also regarded as an important neurotransmitter involved in the habituation of olfactory stimulus, though the exact means through which it operates are not yet clear.|$|E
25|$|To {{guarantee}} a minimum {{service to the}} population, Belgian law provides six basic functions for the local police: Community policing, <b>responsiveness,</b> intervention, victim support, local criminal investigation and maintaining public order.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{could be}} used in the {{treatment}} of decompensated heart failure to potentiate renal <b>responsiveness</b> to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large doses of loop diuretics.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 Drenth, van Genderen and Michiels {{distinguished}} between erythromelalgia and erythermalgia {{on the basis}} of <b>responsiveness</b> to aspirin. They established three categories: erythromelalgia (platelet-mediated and aspirin-sensitive), primary erythermalgia, and secondary erythermalgia.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacological {{doses of}} {{epinephrine}} stimulate α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3 adrenoceptors of the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic nerve receptors {{are classified as}} adrenergic, based on their <b>responsiveness</b> to adrenaline.|$|E
25|$|Since 1995, two Dutch Harness Horse stallions {{have been}} chosen to add elegance and <b>responsiveness,</b> though {{it is worth noting}} that these stallions had {{primarily}} Ostfriesen and Groningen pedigrees themselves, and no Hackney blood.|$|E
25|$|Since 2001, {{engineers}} at NASA Wallops Flight Facility have been developing new range technologies, systems and approaches {{to improve the}} cost and <b>responsiveness</b> of launch and flight test activities, within the constraints of available funding and program schedules.|$|E
25|$|Even well-intentioned support can {{negatively}} {{impact the}} care recipient's psychological adjustment to stressful events {{if it is}} inappropriate or excessive, or inadvertently highlights {{the fact that the}} care recipient does not have sufficient skills or resources to handle the stressor by him- or herself. Consequently, Niall Bolger and colleagues have put forward the idea that support is most effective when it is invisible, or operates outside of the care-recipient's direct awareness. To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State Bar Examination, and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited heightened levels of depression on days they reported receiving support, but lowered levels of depression on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law students reported receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the <b>responsiveness</b> of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support. One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when it was high in <b>responsiveness,</b> and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in <b>responsiveness.</b> That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both types of support hinges on <b>responsiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{determining}} whether a species can or {{should be used for}} falconry, the species' behavior in a captive environment, its <b>responsiveness</b> to training, and its typical prey and hunting habits are considered.To some degree, a species' reputation will determine whether it's used, although this factor is somewhat harder to objectively gauge.|$|E
25|$|In mutant yellow-orange {{mice and}} human redheads, both with {{nonfunctional}} MC1R, both genotypes display reduced sensitivity to {{noxious stimuli and}} increased analgesic <b>responsiveness</b> to morphine-metabolite analgesics. These observations suggest a role for mammalian MC1R outside the pigment cell, though the exact mechanism through which the protein can modulate pain sensation is not known.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{analysis}} of cannabinoid binding in CB1 and CB2 receptor knockout mice found cannabinoid <b>responsiveness</b> even when these receptors {{were not being}} expressed, indicating that an additional binding receptor may {{be present in the}} brain. Binding has been demonstrated by 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) on the TRPV1 receptor suggesting that this receptor may be a candidate for the established response.|$|E
25|$|Some {{language}} development experts have characterized child directed speech in stages. Primarily, the parents use repetition and also variation {{to maintain the}} infant's attention. Secondly, the parent simplifies speech to help in language learning. Third, any speech modifications maintain the <b>responsiveness</b> of the child. These modifications develop into a conversation that provides context for the development.|$|E
25|$|If a {{heart failure}} patient {{exhibits}} a resistance to or poor response to diuretic therapy, ultrafiltration or aquapheresis {{may be needed}} to achieve adequate control of fluid retention and congestion. The use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can produce meaningful clinical benefits in patients with diuretic-resistant heart failure and may restore <b>responsiveness</b> to conventional doses of diuretics.|$|E
25|$|A {{triggered}} {{business process}} should directly support revenue growth with cost containment, <b>responsiveness</b> to business conditions, or ability to pursue new market opportunities. Resulting business processes could also measure operational progress toward achieving goals, control operational costs by communicating {{just what is}} needed to just who needs to know, or report performance status of key processes to key decision makers.|$|E
