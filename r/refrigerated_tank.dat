Coatings of moderate thickness 1.8 μm to 25 μm (0.00007" [...] to 0.001") are known as Type II in North America, as named by MIL-A-8625, while coatings thicker than 25 μm (0.001") are known as Type III, hardcoat, hard anodizing, or engineered anodizing. Very thin coatings similar to those produced by chromic anodizing are known as Type IIB.

40|$|Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is {{generally}} stored in <b>refrigerated</b> <b>tanks</b> at temperatures of about- 160 °C and pressures slightly above atmospher e in liquefaction plants and LNG regasification terminals. Heat leaks, even in well-insulated tanks, cause a slow boil-off of the LNG, and this requires removal of some vapor. During this weathering process {{the composition of}} the LNG changes because the small amount of nitrogen present is much more volatile than the methane and the heavier hydrocarbons are effectively non-volatile at storage conditions. Natural convection causes circulation of the LNG within the storage tank, maintaining a uniform liquid composition. The addition of new liquid, however, can result in the formation of strata of slightly different temperature and density within the LNG storage tank. "Rollover " refers to the rapid release of LNG vapors from a storage tank caused by stratification. The potential for rollover arise when two separated layers of different densities (due to different LNG compositions) exist in a storage tank. This paper gives a more adequate theoretical framework for rollover analysis and presents quantitative computer results for the simulation of the La Spezia Rollover incident.

As Brucella abortus is an intracellular parasite heavy, prolonged, antibiotic therapy is necessary in the treatment of the disease. The danger of inadequate treatment of the acute disease is that it may become chronic, and response to antibiotic therapy in chronic brucellosis is not good. Five of the nine biotypes of Brucella abortus des-cribed by the W. H. O. /F. A. O.

40|$|Ammonia {{is used in}} the {{industry}} for the manufacture of fertilizers, explosives and polymers and is stored at - 33 °C in <b>refrigerated</b> <b>tanks.</b> In most cases, tanks are cylindrical and are composed of a steel liner that contains the ammonia, with the liner itself being protected by an outer reinforced concrete tank. The function of the concrete tank is to keep the ammonia safe in case of a leak in the liner. If a leak happens, the concrete wall will be suddenly subjected to a thermal shock, with a large temperature gradient between its internal and external faces (20 °C to - 33 °C). These thermal effects lead to cracks in concrete that allow the ammonia to escape. The junctions between walls and the base slab and, walls and the roof are particularly sensitive to this cracking phenomenon.

The researcher began analysing the potential and possible applications of cool storage as a tool for Demand Side Management (DSM) in central air conditioning systems in the Middle East in 1991. The coupling of a <b>refrigerated</b> water storage <b>tank</b> or an ice storage tank to an air-cooled chiller plant, operated at night for load shifting, electrical peak demand reduction and energy conservation has been the major interest of investigation. The model project commissioned in 1996 used as a typical example to investigate electrical demand management for an office building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The aim of this research was to develop new modified comfort cooling system coupled with a cool storage or commonly known as Thermal Energy Storage (TES) network. The research was expected to establish certain favouring conditions in relation to technical, economical and environmental criteria to make the TES application a viable option in comfort cooling systems in commercial buildings in the Middle East for electrical demand reduction, load shifting and energy conservation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design and {{optimize}} a heat pump process to reliquefy Boil-Off-Gas from Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) cryogenic tanks, and simulataneously vaporize LNG at high pressure. The process is meant for use onboard LNG fuelled ship different from LNG carriers, equipped with LNG fuel tanks at atmospheric pressure and 2 -strokes engines with high pressure gas injection, which is considered the most efficient propulsion arrangement for medium-large vessels. The studyis based on a patented concept from the norwegian companyLNG New Technlogies, within the thesis this concept is evolved to a more complex process layout, its distinctive features are low temperature suction of the heat pump refrigerant compressor, absence of heat discharge {{to the environment and}} condensation of the Boil-Off-Gas via recirculation of subcooled LNG. Four different operating scenarios of the process are simulated with the commercial software HYSYS&# 174;, the results of the simulations are presented in the form of case studies, sensitivity analyses, thermodynamic diagrams and tables, and analized in detail. Anumber of modifications to the selected layout are evaluated, e. g. Boil-Off-Gas feed to the Auxiliaryengine and compressor intercooling. Based on the simulation results a preliminary selection ofthe process equipment is outlined, with focus on the refrigerant compressor. The results prove that the proposed heat pump process can effectively <b>refrigerate</b> the LNG <b>tank</b> if the ship is operating in the normal mode or at half of the main engine load, however at lower engine loads, especially when the main engine is shut down, the system can not produce the required refrigeration effect. In this scenario the excess Boil-Off-Gas would be fed to the Auxiliary engines, or in the worst case burnt in Gas Combustion Units. The heat pump efficiency for the normal operation is 2 - 3 times higher than for commercial on-board Boil-Off-Gas reliquefaction processes, but the maximumreliquefaction capacity is intrinsically lower. The operating parameters of the compressor suggest the use of a reciprocating oil-free compressor with cryogenic material specifications, this is considered the most non-conventional and costly unit of the process. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{fresh milk}} sold in Cyprus comes from {{organized}} cattle farms, is collected, is {{transported to the}} processing plants in <b>refrigerated</b> stainless steel <b>tanks</b> and owing to the small distances, the milk is transported to the processing plants in maximum 2 - 3 hours. The processing plants in Cyprus are all HACCP certified and use similar pasteurizing methods. The above mean that the fresh milk sold by the four processors is of the same quality and due to regulations of the Ministry and of Commerce and Industry, the milk is sold at the same prices. The fresh milk companies can only increase their market share by adding some innovation in their product offering. The innovation which is used relates to the packaging of fresh milk which was made possible after the companies stopped selling fresh milk in glass bottles and adopted plastic bottles and the paper tetra-pack package. From the literature reviewed {{carried out in the}} context of this project, revealed how fresh milk marketers can use the packaging to gain competitive advantage. Some of the successful packaging ideas involved such parameters as size, shape, colours, wordings and other features. In order to discover what features to include in the design of the fresh milk packaging, qualitative and quantitative research was undertaken. Three specially selected focus groups discussed possible ways and arrived to definite suggestions which are given in chapters 4 and 5 of this project report. The quantitative research carried out amongst 800 fresh milk users was a telephone survey which had the objective to find out in what ways the packaging affects the sales of fresh milk and what design changes must be made which are originated from the consumers and not from the professional designers. Owing to the large size of the representative sample who took part in the telephone survey, the conclusions reached have a very high degree of validity...|$|R
