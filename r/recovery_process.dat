We present a comparative study on the role of intragranular root-mean-square strain and crystal-lographic texture on <b>recovery</b> <b>processes.</b> The detailed microstructure analysis with conventional X ray diffraction and in-situ synchrotron measurements during deformation are used to understand the various attributes of recovery mechanisms associated with annealing and deformation of electrodeposited NC nickel (grain size = 30 nm). Our results emphasize the dominance of local atomic rearrangements during thermal <b>recovery</b> <b>processes,</b> while deformation induced <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> are supported primarily by large-scale dislocation activity. The in-situ deformation of NC samples with two different textures illustrates further the influence of gran boundary character on <b>recovery</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Beginning on September1, 1948, the then-active volcano Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin Island in the Philippines {{began to}} release lava {{in a series}} of {{eruption}} events which continued for the ensuing three years. On December4, 1951, a large, Peléan eruption event later rated between a 2 and 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, sending pyroclastic flows and lahars down the northeast flank of the volcano. The resultant ash flows alone killed an estimated 500people on the island, {{making it one of the}} deadliest volcanic eruption events in recorded history. As the typhoon approached the archipelago, relief agencies were forced to divert aid operations to victims of the recent eruption, slowing the <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, episode 1 of The Mind of Evil {{contains}} no colour information. In principle, BBC engineers {{were supposed to}} filter out the chroma dots upon telerecording, to create a cleaner and nicer picture.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a collision with Esteban Gutiérrez in the Australian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso was ruled out of the event with broken ribs and a pneumothorax, and as a result was replaced with McLaren reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne. Gutiérrez received a new chassis after his team found that his original chassis was too damaged to be repaired, mostly caused by the crane during the <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> and not in the accident itself. Meanwhile, Ferrari were able to use the same engine in Kimi Räikkönen's car as they had done in Australia, even though it had caught fire following a failure of the turbo charger. Swift reactions by the team on the scene prevented damage to the combustion engine, with only the turbo changed for Bahrain. Alfonso Celis Jr. made his first appearance in a Formula One session during the first free practice for Force India.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a day of}} Cyclone Waka's {{passage in}} Tonga, the Government of New Zealand {{deployed}} an aircraft to survey the scale of damage and reestablish contact with the Tongan Islands. This aircraft was sent {{in accordance with the}} FRANZ Agreement, enacted in 1992, which states that assests from one country would be used in relief operations. On January2, the head of Tonga's Disaster Office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from the storm. Due to the substantial damage to agriculture, food shortages were expected to impact the region over the following months. By January7, the Red Cross began sending supplies to Tonga. Hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an Australian AC-130 to help with the <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b> On January12, a New Zealand Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid. An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by the storm. Of this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for emergency lighting, cooking and food supply recovery.|$|E

Equity theory is applied to hypothesize a negative relationship between co-production in recovery and satisfaction after recovery. Customers’ domain-specific expertise is included as a moderator of this relationship. Moreover, we examine the underlying cognitive process by including procedural justice as mediator. Using a scenario-experiment, we find that, in contrast to former results, customers who coproduce more are less satisfied after recovery. Particularly, we show that customers with high domain-specific expertise should not be required to highly co-produce in a recovery.

The activity of <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> was evaluated by using biochemical and morphological methods in dynamics on 30, 60, 90   and 180 days. Results. It was shown that in the II and III gr. significantly accelerated the <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> in damaged livers compared with the I gr. The normalization of biochemical parameters took place in II and III du- ring 30 days instead of 90 days in the I group. However, the normalization of morphological signs of hepatocytes theirs viability and a degree of defibrotic changes in liver were more pronounced and prolonged in the III group.

Higher levels and prolonged periods of <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> in damaged liver after CED transplanta- tion were due to the creation of biologically appropriate conditions for prolonged cell activity, included in their structure (donor liver cells and BM MMSC).   </div...|$|R

30|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} survey {{findings}} regarding disaster <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> among {{ethnic groups in}} a rural Texas community. The research was conducted over a 4 -year period {{with most of the}} survey data collected over the summer of 2004. The research was descriptive in nature, attempting to document processes and sources of recovery aid acquisition following a natural disaster, and viewed through the lens of cultural and ethnic literature regarding minorities and disaster <b>recovery</b> <b>processes.</b> The difficulty in explaining research findings {{comes from the fact that}} data was collected at the household level, yet the explanations which best elucidate the findings are derived from a different level of analysis than that of the survey. The variation in aid acquisition between ethnic groups is best understood as a manifestation of community cultural norms, which implies both individual, cognitive norms, as well as social norms. Ethnic literature focused on minorities in disaster situations, excerpts from qualitative data, and personal observations are used to support the interpretation of the data presented herein pointing to cultural flexibility in <b>recovery</b> <b>processes,</b> which are stifled by institutional barriers hampering recovery efficiencies.|$|R
40|$|Land-use history {{interacts with}} natural forces to {{influence}} the severity of disturbance events and the rate and nature of <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> in tropical forests. Although we are far from an integrated view of forest <b>recovery</b> <b>processes,</b> some generalizations can be made. Recovery of forest structure and composition is relatively rapid following disturbances that primarily impact forest canopies, such as hurricanes. Recovery is considerably slower following disturbances that heavily impact soils as well as aboveground vegetation, such as bulldozing, heavy or long-term grazing, and severe fires, often with long-lasting effects on species composition. The landscape matrix plays {{a critical role in}} local <b>recovery</b> <b>processes.</b> Proximity of disturbed areas to remnant forest patches promotes more rapid recovery, which depends heavily on seed dispersal. Recovery of aboveground biomass is constrained by soil fertility and texture across regions as well as across soil types within a region. Restoration of soil fertility may be a prerequisite for forest recovery on sites with severely degraded soils. Despite evidence of rapid forest recovery following large-scale deforestation, many degraded areas of today's tropics will require human assistance to recover forest structure, species composition, and species interactions typical of mature tropical forests...|$|R
