40|$|Abstract—In delay {{tolerant}} networks (DTNs) {{with uncertainty}} in node mobility, message forwarding usually employs a multi-copy, opportunistic forwarding scheme to improve delivery probability. Minimizing the delivery latency (delay) and minimizing the number <b>of</b> <b>forwardings</b> (message copies) {{have been two}} conflicting goals. On the other hand, utility-based routing has been proposed in multi-hop wireless networks, where a utility {{is defined as a}} compound metric that provides a trade-off between delay and forwarding cost. In this paper, we propose the first multi-copy utility-based opportunistic forwarding algorithm in DTNs. The proposed multi-copy opportunistic utility-based forwarding (MOUF) algorithm is able to improve the overall utility representing a user preferred trade-off between delay and forwarding cost so as to satisfy different requirements. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations are conducted to verify the improved performance of the proposed algorithm. ...|$|R

The gulf of Morbihan is strewn with many islands and islets. It was thus so called by Raymond Rallier du Baty at the time <b>of</b> its <b>forwardings</b> <b>of</b> the beginning of the 20th century in the honour of the Gulf of Morbihan in Brittany (Kerguelen was Breton, and many of the features in the islands have Breton names).

3000|$|Addition of a Fast Broadcast module For {{broadcast}} {{communication to}} occur in an ad hoc network with multi-hop routing, each node must, upon receiving a broadcast packet, forward it to its neighbors so every node in the network will receive the packet. This strategy causes network overloads due to {{the high number of}} packets generated in every broadcast forwarding. This is why the Fast Broadcast module [34] was added to the simulator. The module is an NS- 2 extension and implements an algorithm designed to reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>forwardings.</b> To initiate communication, Fast Broadcast uses a module-specific application to generate network traffic. This was not viable in WiNoC simulations, due to the use of an application (TrafficTrace) that schedules packet transmissions by reading trace files. As a solution, a modification was made so that Fast Broadcast was triggered directly from TrafficTrace by an agent [11]. c) [...]...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} in nodal mobility, DTN routing usually employs multi-copy forwarding schemes. To avoid the cost associated with flooding, much {{effort has been}} focused on probabilistic forwarding, which aims to reduce the cost of forwarding while retaining a high performance rate by forwarding messages only to nodes that have high delivery probabilities. This paper aims to provide an optimal forwarding protocol which maximizes the expected delivery rate while satisfying a certain constant on the number <b>of</b> <b>forwardings</b> per message. In our proposed optimal probabilistic forwarding (OPF) protocol, we use an optimal probabilistic forwarding metric derived by modeling each forwarding as an optimal stopping rule problem. We also present several extensions to allow OPF to use only partial routing information and work with other probabilistic forwarding schemes such as ticket-based forwarding. We implement OPF and several other protocols and perform trace-driven simulations. Simulation results show that the delivery rate of OPF is only 5 % lower than epidemic, and 20 % greater than the state-of-the-art delegation forwarding while generating 5 % more copies and 5 % longer delay...|$|R
40|$|Delay {{tolerant}} networks (DTNs) are {{a special}} type of wireless mobile networks which may lack continuous network connectivity. Multicast supports {{the distribution of}} data {{to a group of}} users, a service needed for many potential DTNs applications. While multicasting in the Internet and mobile ad hoc networks has been studied extensively, due to the unique characteristic of frequent partitioning in DTNs, multicasting in DTNs is a considerably different and challenging problem. It not only requires new destinations of multicast semantics, but also brings new issues to the design of routing algorithms. In this paper, we propose new forwarding models for DTNs multicast and develop several multicast forwarding algorithms. We use delegation forwarding (DF) in DTNs multicast and compare it&nbsp; with single and multiple copy multicast models, which are alsoproposed in this paper. From the analytical results, we have the following conclusions: (1) Although the single copy model has the smallest number <b>of</b> <b>forwardings,</b> its latency is much longer than the other two models. (2) Among these three models, the delegation forwarding model has the least delay. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through extensive simulation both in synthetic and real traces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — There {{has been}} much {{research}} focusing on the routing problem in delay tolerant networks (DTNs). Much of the work has mainly focused on coding schemes for message distribution, while other {{work has been done}} on the probabilistic forwarding. Coding schemes achieve higher delivery rate via redundancy before forwarding, while probabilistic forwarding efficiently limits the abuse of the store and forward scheme, maintaining relatively high performance. Providing a reliable and efficient forwarding scheme proves to be challenging as coding and forwarding schemes should be jointly considered. In our paper, we present an optimal probabilistic forwarding scheme using fountain code, which we name as CFP (Coded Forwarding Protocol), where reliability and efficiency can be achieved at the same time. In CFP, We use fountain codes to encode messages and provide the forwarding rule to decide whether to forward messages to another node. The probabilistic forwarding problem is modeled as an optimal stopping problem, and our forwarding rule also considers the influence of fountain codes. We perform trace-driven simulations and compare CFP with other protocols. Simulation results show that, considering the delivery rate, delay, and number <b>of</b> <b>forwardings,</b> CFP performs better than other implemented protocols- Epidemic, which is the most original protocol, and OPF, which represents the optimal probabilistic forwarding protocol- in our simulation.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, using {{directional}} antennas {{to reduce}} the amount of interference and collisions in mobile ad hoc networks has become more and more popular. Due to the problem of broadcast storm caused by flooding route requests, a novel route request flooding approach called Hexagonal Flooding Strategy (HFS) for Ad Hoc networks using directional antennas is introduced in this paper. With directional antennas, the flooding of route request packets is limited among selected forwarding nodes. By constructing a honeycomb pattern, the forwarding nodes which form the honeycomb vertices are selected. The transmissions between forwarding nodes which form the honeycomb edges are reshaped according to certain rules to optimize flow directions. Through simulations we evaluate the performance of HFS using route discovery success rate, average number <b>of</b> nodes and <b>forwardings</b> involved in the route discovery process. Simulation results show that HFS can: (a) improve route discovery success rate, (b) reduce the number <b>of</b> nodes and <b>forwardings</b> involved in the route discovery process...|$|R
