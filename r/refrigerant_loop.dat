50|$|Closed {{loop systems}} need a heat {{exchanger}} between the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop</b> {{and the water}} loop, and pumps in both loops. Some manufacturers have a separate ground loop fluid pump pack, while some integrate the pumping and valving within the heat pump. Expansion tanks and pressure relief valves may be installed on the heated fluid side. Closed loop systems have lower efficiency than direct exchange systems, so they require longer and larger pipe {{to be placed in}} the ground, increasing excavation costs.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{exchange}} {{heat pumps}} are closed-loop geothermal systems which rely on small copper pipes (¼” to 1-1/8”) to exchange heat with the earth. The copper pipes {{are placed in}} the ground and form a ground loop - sometimes also referred to as earth loop or <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop</b> - where the circulating refrigerant undergoes phase transition by exchanging heat with the ground: in heating mode it absorbs heat and changes from liquid to gas (evaporation), while in cooling mode it gives heat off and changes from gas to liquid (condensation).|$|E
5000|$|In direct {{exchange}} systems, the refrigerant exchanges heat {{directly with}} the soil through the copper tubing. The designation “direct exchange" [...] therefore refers to the heat transfer between {{the earth and the}} ground loop without the use of any intermediary. By contrast, water-based geothermal systems rely on two loops on the ground side: a primary <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop,</b> contained in the appliance cabinet where it exchanges heat with a secondary ground loop that is buried underground and is made of high-density polyethylene containing a mixture of water and anti-freeze (propylene glycol, denatured alcohol or methanol).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a simulation-optimization energy saving strategy for heating, ventilating {{and air conditioning}} (HVAC) systems' condenser water loop through intelligent control of single speed cooling towers' components. An analysis of system components has showed the interactions of control variables inside the cooling towers and between the cooling tower and chillers. Based on the analysis, a model based optimization approach was developed with evolutionary computation. A simulation application demonstrated {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed strategy. This strategy can also be easily modified and applied to single speed tools in the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loops...</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{they require}} more {{refrigerant}} and their tubing {{is more expensive}} per foot, a direct exchange earth loop is shorter than a closed water loop for a given capacity. A direct exchange system requires only 15 to 40% {{of the length of}} tubing and half the diameter of drilled holes, and the drilling or excavation costs are therefore lower. <b>Refrigerant</b> <b>loops</b> are less tolerant of leaks than water loops because gas can leak out through smaller imperfections. This dictates the use of brazed copper tubing, even though the pressures are similar to water loops. The copper loop must be protected from corrosion in acidic soil {{through the use of a}} sacrificial anode or other cathodic protection.|$|R
5000|$|The direct {{exchange}} {{geothermal heat}} pump (DX) {{is the oldest}} type of geothermal heat pump technology. The ground-coupling is achieved through a single loop, circulating refrigerant, in direct thermal contact with the ground (as opposed {{to a combination of}} a <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop</b> and a water loop). The refrigerant leaves the heat pump cabinet, circulates through a loop of copper tube buried underground, and exchanges heat with the ground before returning to the pump. The name [...] "direct exchange" [...] refers to heat transfer between the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop</b> and the ground without the use of an intermediate fluid. There is no direct interaction between the fluid and the earth; only heat transfer through the pipe wall. Direct exchange heat pumps are {{not to be confused with}} [...] "water-source heat pumps" [...] or [...] "water loop heat pumps" [...] since there is no water in the ground loop. ASHRAE defines the term ground-coupled heat pump to encompass closed loop and direct exchange systems, while excluding open loops.Direct exchange systems are more efficient and have potentially lower installation costs than closed loop water systems. Copper's high thermal conductivity contributes to the higher efficiency of the system, but heat flow is predominantly limited by the thermal conductivity of the ground, not the pipe. The main reasons for the higher efficiency are the elimination of the water pump (which uses electricity), the elimination of the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger (which is a source of heat losses), and most importantly, the latent heat phase change of the refrigerant in the ground itself.|$|E
50|$|In an {{open loop}} system (also called a {{groundwater}} heat pump), the secondary loop pumps natural water from a well or body of water into a heat exchanger inside the heat pump. ASHRAE calls {{open loop system}}s groundwater heat pumps or surface water heat pumps, depending on the source. Heat is either extracted or added by the primary <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop,</b> and the water is returned to a separate injection well, irrigation trench, tile field or body of water. The supply and return lines must be placed far enough apart to ensure thermal recharge of the source. Since the water chemistry is not controlled, the appliance {{may need to be}} protected from corrosion by using different metals in the heat exchanger and pump. Limescale may foul the system over time and require periodic acid cleaning. This is much more of a problem with cooling systems than heating systems. Also, as fouling decreases the flow of natural water, it becomes difficult for the heat pump to exchange building heat with the groundwater. If the water contains high levels of salt, minerals, iron bacteria or hydrogen sulfide, a closed loop system is usually preferable.|$|E
50|$|Most {{installed}} {{systems have}} two loops {{on the ground}} side: the primary <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop</b> is contained in the appliance cabinet where it exchanges heat with a secondary water loop that is buried underground. The secondary loop is typically made of high-density polyethylene pipe and contains a mixture of water and anti-freeze (propylene glycol, denatured alcohol or methanol). Monopropylene glycol has the least damaging potential when it might leak into the ground, and is therefore the only allowed anti-freeze in ground sources in {{an increasing number of}} European countries. After leaving the internal heat exchanger, the water flows through the secondary loop outside the building to exchange heat with the ground before returning. The secondary loop is placed below the frost line where the temperature is more stable, or preferably submerged in a body of water if available. Systems in wet ground or in water are generally more efficient than drier ground loops since water conducts and stores heat better than solids in sand or soil. If the ground is naturally dry, soaker hoses may be buried with the ground loop to keep it wet.|$|E
50|$|Several major design {{options are}} {{available}} for these, which are classified by fluid and layout. Direct exchange systems circulate <b>refrigerant</b> underground, closed <b>loop</b> systems use a mixture of anti-freeze and water, and open loop systems use natural groundwater.|$|R

40|$|Objectives] This paper {{presents}} {{the form and}} operation characteristics of a <b>refrigerant</b> water <b>loop</b> system of a large ship. [Methods] To address the flow distribution problem under different operating modes, an scaled experimental platform is developed for the system. Experiments on the backup pump water supply and single-pump and multi-pump combined water supply are carried out in order to study the flow rate distribution characteristics of the system. [Results] According to the results, when the backup pump {{in the middle of}} the ship supplies water to other zones, the flow rates of the users in each zone are all higher than 90 % of the designed values, with the hydraulic imbalance degree ranging from 0. 89 to 1. 02. When a single pump supplies water to all users of the ship, the flow rates of the users range from 20. 0 % to 37. 1 % of the designed values, with a peak imbalance ratio higher than 40 %. For the multi-pump combined water supply mode, the optimal operating conditions of the two-pump, three-pump and four-pump combined water supply modes can meet the water demands of different loads respectively, with a maximum imbalance ratio between zones of less than 15 %.

40|$|Abstract. The {{air-conditioning}} {{system is a}} source of energy consumption and consequently, it has a strong influence on the fuel consumption, the engine load and the pollutant emissions. The {{air-conditioning system}} has to be accounted for in the energy balance under the hood. This system is composed of a variable displacement compressor including an internal regulation valve. In this paper, we model a complete system step by step. We build the compressor system and gradually add components so as to end up with the complete system. The simulation results shows that when the suction pressure becomes at some point smaller than the regulation pressure, the valve controls the compressor displacement and tends to reduce it in order to maintain a certain level for the suction pressure. It will be easier to observe the influence of the regulation valve on the complete <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop</b> system...|$|E
40|$|The {{on-going}} {{development of}} a compact centrifugal compressor as a first stage or pre-compressor for cold climate operation of heat pumps is described.

The single stage motor driven centrifugal compressor runs on oil-free bearings. It is being configured to work in concert with a traditional heat pump compressor. The goal of this work is to enable air source heat pumps to efficiently extract heat from even the coldest ambient air without backup heat and without changing refrigerant type or the basic design of the positive displacement style compressors widely used in today’s heat pumps. Doing so will allow air source heat pumps to operate effectively in virtually all major population centers.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{performance}} of a segmentally baffled shell-and-tube evaporator working with liquid overfeeding is investigated. The refrigerant is R 134 a that flows inside the tubes, while water flows on the shell side. A single shell pass has been adopted for the water with one tube pass for the evaporating fluid. The test rig used for the experimental measurements consists of a primary <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop</b> plus the condenser and the evaporator water auxiliary loops. The evaporator can be fed with two-phase mixture from the expansion valve or with saturated liquid coming from the liquid-vapor separator (in this case a variable speed recirculation pump is used). Inlet and outlet temperatures have been measured for both fluids together with the flow rate allowing the determination of the overall heat transfer coefficient. In addition, pressure drop have been measured on the refrigerant side. Tests have been performed both without overfeeding and with overfeeding at different values of recirculation ratio. The recirculation ratio is defined as the ratio between refrigerant flow rate at the evaporator and the vaporized refrigerant flow rate. Furthermore, measurements have been taken at fixed water outlet temperature and varying the heat duty. In order to study the evaporator behavior, a computational procedure has been developed. Finally, the numerical model of the heat exchanger has been validated against experimental data...|$|E

40|$|Ice slurry is {{well known}} as a biphasic {{secondary}} refrigerant that presents several potential advantages compared to single phase secondary refrigerants. These potential advantages can be summarized {{in the ability to}} use the thermal storage and the high cooling capacity given by the latent heat. Theoretically, these features should allow important energy savings in secondary <b>refrigerant</b> distribution <b>loop.</b> However, an accurate evaluation of these energy savings requires the knowledge of the thermal and rheological performance of the refrigerant studied. Based on the experimental model developed by the authors for brine based ice slurry, a theoretical analysis of heat exchangers performance is presented in this work in order to calculate the potential energy savings associated to its use. The influence of ice concentration, mass flow rate, heat exchanger length and cooled fluid temperature over pumping power and heat transfer rate is studied. The ratio between heat transfer rate and pumping power is used as the evaluation parameter, which allows us to find the most favourable operation conditions for ice slurry flow. In order to assess the improvement obtained using ice slurry, results for ice slurry are compared to those obtained for carrier fluid at same inlet temperature.

Validation experiments have been performed with R- 134 a as the working fluid and a 3 -channel evaporator test section, designed with three separate outlets and kept under an adiabatic condition. The sum of the flow rates in the glass tubes for each phase was compared with the vapour or liquid flow rate determined from the total mass flow rate measured at the evaporator inlet and a heat balance in the pre-heater section of the pump-driven <b>refrigerant</b> flow <b>loop.</b> Validation tests yielded satisfactory results for both vapor and liquid phases, indicating the soundness of the measurement system based on the stratification tubes {{as well as the}} use of an ultrasonic flow meter and hot-film anemometer probes for phase average velocity measurements.

The first trial experiment has been performed with a 3 -channel test evaporator, and the vapour and liquid flow rates in each channel were determined separately. MULTI-CHANNEL TWO-PHASE FLOW LOOP In order to measure the two-phase flow rate distribution in parallel channels of compact heat exchangers, a freon flow loop was constructed as shown in Figure 1, equipped with hot-film anemometer probes and an ultrasonic flow meter (Gu and Kawaji, 2002).

40|$|All {{commonly}} used Hydro-Fluoro-Carbon (HFC) refrigerants {{have a high}} Global Warming Potential (GWP), higher than 1000, and some countries have already enacted legislative measures towards a limitation in the use or a gradual phase-out of HFCs. HFO 1234 ze(Z) {{was identified as a}} new low GWP refrigerant, which {{has the potential to be}} a global sustainable solution particularly for heat pump application. HFO 1234 ze(Z) is a pure compound which exhibits low pressure and is classified by ANSI / ASHRAE Standard 34 (2010) as class A 2 L refrigerants (lower flammability and lower toxicity). Therefore, it can be used in direct expansion systems without the need for a secondary loop as alternative for HFC 236 fa and HC 600 a. This paper presents the experimental heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop measured during HFO 1234 ze(Z) saturated vapour condensation inside a small commercial BPHE: the effects of refrigerant mass flux and saturation temperature were investigated. The experimental facility consists of a <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop,</b> a water-glycol loop and two water loops. In the first loop the refrigerant is pumped from the sub-cooler into the evaporator where it is evaporated to achieve the set condition at the condenser inlet. The refrigerant goes through the condenser where it is condensed and then it comes back to the post-condenser and the sub-cooler. A variable speed volumetric pump varies the refrigerant flow rate and a bladder accumulator, connected to a nitrogen bottle and a pressure regulator, controls the operating pressure in the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop.</b> The second loop is able to supply a water-glycol flow at a constant temperature used to feed the sub-cooler and the post-condenser. A set of 42 saturated vapour condensation data points with refrigerant down-flow and water up-flow was carried out at four different saturation temperatures: 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C. The experimental results were presented in terms of heat transfer coefficients and frictional pressure drop. The heat transfer coefficients show weak sensitivity to saturation temperature and great sensitivity to refrigerant mass flux. At low refrigerant mass flux (3 ̆c 20 kg/m 2 s) the heat transfer coefficients are independent of mass flux and condensation is controlled by gravity. For higher refrigerant mass flux (3 ̆e 20 kg/m 2 s) the heat transfer coefficients depend on mass flux and forced convection condensation occurs. The frictional pressure drop shows a linear dependence on the kinetic energy per unit volume of the refrigerant flow and therefore a quadratic dependence on the refrigerant mass flux. HFO 1234 ze(Z) shows heat transfer coefficients higher both than HC 600 a and HFC 236 fa and frictional pressure drop higher than HFC 236 fa and lower than HC 600 a. The experimental results were compared against theoretical models for condensation heat transfer coefficients (Nusselt 1916 and Akers et al. 1959) and a new linear correlation for two-phase frictional pressure drop was presented...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the motor}} vehicle {{directive}} of the European Community, as of January 2017 new cars {{will only be}} allowed to use air conditioning systems with refrigerants of GWP below 150. A moratorium to significantly extend this deadline {{is not to be}} expected considering the recently negotiated F-Gas-Regulation. One option will be flammable refrigerants of the ASHRAE classification A 3 or a future classification A 2 L. However they are subject to safety reservations when used in systems with direct evaporation. R 744 requires for a wide use and a complete realization with development, industrialization and validation probably more time than the remaining available time horizon. Therefore an option shall be discussed, which is based on a hybrid solution with R 744 and a flammable refrigerant and which may allow a sufficiently rapid implementation.

40|$|Capillary tube-suction line heat {{exchangers}} (CT-SLHX) introduce complex phenomena due to simultaneous 2 -phase flow expansion and heat transfer such as: reverse heat transfer, flow hysteresis and flow oscillations. Some {{of the negative}} consequences of these phenomena are: noise due to re-condensation, which is becoming an important quality issue; and reduction of the SLHX effectiveness, which also affects the global efficiency. Studies about how to solve the noise problem show that it disappears when there is enough subcooling at the capillary tube inlet. This fact also supports the idea that two-phase flow at the capillary tube inlet contributes to re-condensation phenomenon in the CT-SLHX. Different reasons may explain it, e. g. the small compressor capacity compared the expansion device capacity of the capillary tube used. Another important consequence would be wasting condenser surface due to the two-phase outlet. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to assess experimentally the actual conditions taking place at the capillary tube inlet and find a solution to the problems mentioned above. An innovative test bench has been designed in order to visualize and analyze the phenomena occurring at the condenser outlet, along the filter and at the capillary tube inlet. This experimental bench test is connected to an A+++ no-frost household refrigerator equipped with a fin-and-tube evaporator, a tube and wire condenser and a variable-speed 7. 24 cm³ hermetic reciprocating compressor. The refrigerant used is isobutane (R 600 a). In order to determine the refrigerant temperature, a set of thermocouples has been placed along the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop,</b> while a pressure transducer is installed at the condenser outlet. The mass flow rate is measured with a Coriolis meter installed at the compressor discharge line. The final part of the condenser and the filters were built with PFA (Perfluoroalkoxy) transparent pipes. Three different positions of identical filters were tested to analyze their influence on the flow configuration. The first filter is horizontally oriented, second and third ones are in a vertical position but with opposite flow directions. A system composed of three manual solenoid valves enables to test each of the three configurations independently from the two others. The transparent filters make possible the visualization of the refrigerant flow pattern at the capillary inlet. An adjustable system has been designed to modify the length of the capillary inside the filters. The set of experiments were tested in steady conditions, by using electrical heaters inside the cabinets to keep the setting point constant. Results show the description of the flow pattern at the capillary tube inlet and condenser outlet with the different capillary tubes and filter arrangements. The condenser outlet conditions were analyzed and the energy efficiency of the refrigerator was compared with a system with actual subcooled outlet conditions. Once characterized the refrigerant flow at the condenser outlet, a configuration has been proposed to ensure an effective subcooling and thus an improvement of the refrigerator performance...|$|E
40|$|Two-phase flow of {{gases and}} liquids or vapors and liquids in pipes, channels, equipment, etc. is {{frequently}} encountered in industry {{and has been}} studied intensively for many years. The reliable prediction of pressure drop in two-phase flow is thereby an important aim. Because {{of the complexity of}} these types of flow, empirical or semiempirical relationships are only of limited reliability and pressure drops predicted using leading methods may differ by up to 100 %. In order to improve prediction methods, this work presents an experimental and analytical investigation of two-phase pressure drops during evaporation in horizontal tubes. The goal of the experimental part was to obtain accurate two-phase pressure drop values over a wide range of experimental conditions. The existing LTCM intube <b>refrigerant</b> test <b>loop</b> has been modified and adapted to the new test conditions and measurement methods. Two new test sections have been also implemented into the modified test rig. The new test section consists of two zones: diabatic and adiabatic. This configuration allows tests to be run that obtain experimental two-phase pressure drop values under diabatic and adiabatic conditions simultaneously. The experimental campaign acquired 2543 experimental two-phase pressure drop values. Based on a comprehensive state-of-the-art review and comparison with two-phase frictional pressure drop prediction methods, it is proven that none of these methods were able to accurately, reliably predict the present experimental values. In the second part of this work, an analytical study was undertaken in order to develop a new two-phase frictional prediction method. It has been shown in the literature that the so called "phenomenological approach" tends to provide more accurate and realistic predictions as the interfacial structure between the phases is taken into account. Based on that, a phenomenological flow pattern approach was chosen in the present study. The recent Wojtan-Ursenbacher-Thome [155] map was chosen to provide the corresponding interfacial structure. The new model treats each flow regime (i. e. interfacial structure) separately and then ensures a smooth transition in between, being in agreement with the experimental observations. Another important feature of the proposed model is that it matches the correct limits at x = 0 (single-phase liquid flow) and x = 1 (single-phase gas flow). Based on a statistically comparison, it is concluded that the new two-phase frictional pressure drop model based on flow pattern map successfully predicts the new experimental data. The present work completes the fourth basic step in LTCM's flow pattern based work on two-phase flow and heat transfer inside horizontal round tubes: (i) generalized flow pattern map, (ii) flow boiling heat transfer model, (iii) convective condensation model and (iv) two-phase frictional pressure drop model...|$|R
40|$|At the moment, the {{worldwide}} demand for air conditioning is rapidly growing, {{and it is}} expected to exceed the demand for space heating by the 2060 s. However, traditional refrigerants such as CFCs and HCFCs are regulated or phased out by the Montreal and Kyoto protocol. Secondary <b>loop</b> <b>refrigerant</b> systems use less of these harmful refrigerants since they make use of a distribution fluid (for example water) as transport medium between the chiller and the coolers. The efficiency of these systems can be improved by using a phase change material as a secondary refrigerant. Tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) is a promising phase change material for air conditioning applications. The phase change can take places at a temperature up to 12. 5 ºC, which allows for an increase in the evaporation temperature. Furthermore, due to its phase change, the TBAB slurry has an up to 4 times larger cooling capacity than chilled water. This can be utilized {{in order to reduce the}} flow rates in the system. At his moment, the TU Delft has in collaboration with Hollander Techniek installed a small pilot air conditioning system in the sports hall 'De Jachtlust' located in Twello, the Netherlands. The system has a capacity of approximately 3. 5 kW. It has a single 300 L storage tank of and it is equipped with sensors to monitor the performance of the system. In this study, an existing model of a secondary air conditioning system is improved and extended taking into account the design parameters of the installation in Twello. This model is validated using the experimental data from the actual system. The simulations predict that using a 36. 5 wt% TBAB solution increases the COP of the system from 2. 96 to 4. 00, while the energy consumption reduces by 24. 8 %. This reduction is mainly due to a 30. 5 % decrease in the power consumption of the compressor. At the same time, the generation side pump consumes 204 % more electricity due to adhesion of the produced crystals to the heat transfer surface. The performance of the TBAB can still be improved by lowering the initial TBAB fraction to 35. 0 wt% or by further optimizing the control strategy for the crystal production. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Refrigeration is {{a process}} of {{removing}} heat from a colder medium. By using the latent heat properties of refrigerant, the heat will be rejecting to a warmer medium. The basic of requirements for the refrigeration are the compressor, chiller, expansion valve and also condenser. In the LNG industry, refrigeration plays a major part. The aims of this research are to compare the difference of refrigerants used in pre-cooling system. The refrigerants that used in this research are propane and carbon dioxide. Another part that must be focused on this research is the refrigerantsÃ¢Â�Â� parameters which are most important consideration for approving that the carbon dioxide can be replacing the propane as a refrigerant that can be used soon in pre-cooling loop system. A simple model of propane refrigeration loop is used to create a steady state simulation using Aspen HYSYS 7. 0 process simulator. By having a valid data from the propane loop, a simulation can be continued by replacing composition from propane to carbon dioxide. The same model constructed in the loop, but the other conditions must be changed to make it suitable and converged with the new refrigerant. The composition of <b>refrigerant</b> in the <b>loop</b> is still same 1, showing the purification of the component. The result shows the coefficient of performance (COP) for propane is 1. 73 and carbon dioxide is 4. 78. For the value of compressor duty using carbon dioxide is lower than the original loop, which the value is 96. 7808 kW and propane duty is at 162. 938 kW. Lastly, in terms of the costing of compressor using carbon dioxide is only at $ 54320 / yr which lower compared to compressor cost for propane is $ 91280 / yr. At this stage, we can conclude that the low duty, make the cost is low and this project will be more save. So, from this research, it can be conclude that it is successful because the main objective for replacing carbon dioxide as refrigerant has been achieved where the COP of carbon dioxide is higher than COP of propane...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the Department of Energy's (DOE's) FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies (FVCT) goals for volume, weight, efficiency, reliability, and cost, the cooling of the power {{electronic}} devices, traction motors, and generators is critical. Currently the power electronic devices, traction motors, and generators in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) are primarily cooled by water-ethylene glycol (WEG) mixture. The cooling fluid operates as a single-phase coolant as the liquid phase of the WEG does not change to its vapor phase during the cooling process. In these single-phase systems, two cooling loops of WEG produce a low temperature (around 70 C) cooling loop for the power electronics and motor/generator, and higher temperature loop (around 105 C) for the internal combustion engine. There is another coolant option currently available in automobiles. It is possible to use the transmission oil as a coolant. The oil temperature exists at approximately 85 C which can be utilized to cool the power electronic and electrical devices. Because heat flux is proportional to the temperature difference between the device's hot surface and the coolant, a device that can tolerate higher temperatures enables the device to be smaller while dissipating the same amount of heat. Presently, new silicon carbide (SiC) devices and high temperature direct current (dc) -link capacitors, such as Teflon capacitors, are available but at significantly higher costs. Higher junction temperature (175 C) silicon (Si) dies are gradually emerging in the market, which will eventually help to lower hardware costs for cooling. The development of high-temperature devices {{is not the only way}} to reduce device size. Two-phase cooling that utilizes the vaporization of the liquid to dissipate heat is expected to be a very effective cooling method. Among two-phase cooling methods, different technologies such as spray, jet impingement, pool boiling and submersion, etc. are being developed. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is leading the research on a novel floating <b>refrigerant</b> <b>loop</b> that cools high-power electronic devices and the motor/generator with very low cooling energy. The loop can be operated independently or attached to the air conditioning system of the vehicle to share the condenser and other mutually needed components. The ability to achieve low cooling energy in the floating loop is attributable to the liquid refrigerant operating at its hot saturated temperature (around 50 C+). In an air conditioning system, the liquid refrigerant is sub-cooled for producing cool air to the passenger compartment. The ORNL floating loop avoids the sub-cooling of the liquid refrigerant and saves significant cooling energy. It can raise the coefficient of performance (COP) more than 10 fold from that of the existing air-conditioning system, where the COP is the ratio of the cooled power and the input power for dissipating the cooled power. In order to thoroughly investigate emerging two-phase cooling technologies, ORNL subcontracted three university/companies to look into three leading two-phase cooling technologies. ORNL's assessments on these technologies are summarized in Section I. Detailed descriptions of the reports by the three university/companies (subcontractors) are in Section II...|$|E
