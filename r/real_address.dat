25|$|By design, the 286 {{could not}} revert from {{protected}} mode {{to the basic}} 8086-compatible <b>real</b> <b>address</b> mode ("real mode") without a hardware-initiated reset. In the PC/AT introduced in 1984, IBM added external circuitry, as well as specialized code in the ROM BIOS and the 8042 peripheral microcontroller to enable software to cause the reset, allowing real-mode reentry while retaining active memory and returning control to the program that initiated the reset. (The BIOS is necessarily involved because it obtains control directly whenever the CPU resets.) Though it worked correctly, the method imposed a huge performance penalty.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} game, Buddy Garrity {{switches}} allegiances {{due to his}} frustration with Panther leadership, and alerts Coach Taylor to the <b>real</b> <b>address</b> of West Dillon star running back, Luke Cafferty, who must attend East Dillon due to his <b>real</b> <b>address.</b> During the season, under Taylor's tutelage, sophomore quarterback, Vince Howard, emerges {{as one of the}} state's best players. With Howard and the acquisition of Cafferty from West Dillon, the Lions end the season respectably, defeating West Dillon in the final game on a field goal by Landry Clarke. Although the Lions end the season with a poor 2-8 mark, Taylor, Howard, and Cafferty lay the foundation for the next year's championship team.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the formal verification of a hardware subsystem {{consisting of a}} memory management unit and a cache. These devices are verified independently and then shown to interact correctly when composed. The MMU authorizes memory requests and translates virtual <b>addresses</b> to <b>real</b> <b>addresses.</b> The cache improves performance by maintaining a LRU (least recently used) list from the memory resident segment table...|$|R

You then send a message to the address in the confirmation.|$|E
5000|$|Real mode, {{also called}} <b>real</b> <b>address</b> mode, is an {{operating}} mode of all x86-compatible CPUs. Real mode {{is characterized by}} a 20-bit segmented memory address space (giving exactly 1 MiB of addressable memory) and unlimited direct software access to all addressable memory, I/O addresses and peripheral hardware. Real mode provides no support for memory protection, multitasking, or code privilege levels.|$|E
50|$|SVS {{provides}} a CCW translation service {{as part of}} the Execute Channel Program (EXCP) SVC. EXCP will do any necessary page fixing, allocate storage for IDA lists, translate virtual <b>addresses</b> to <b>real,</b> put the translated addresses into the appropriate IDA words and put the <b>real</b> <b>addresses</b> of the IDA lists into the translated CCW's. When an I/O completes, EXCP reverses the process, freeing storage and translating status back into virtual.|$|R

50|$|Portveien 2 was a children's TV-show {{produced}} by NRK, which premiered on 19 March 1985. It has had many reruns, {{and has become}} a part of Norwegian TV history. The show produced 140 episodes. The outdoor footage for the series was filmed in a little house in the allotment gardens at Sagene in Oslo, Norway. Portveien 2 is not a <b>real</b> <b>address,</b> the closest street is Kongsvingergata.|$|E

50|$|Callback {{verification}} can be {{compliant with}} SMTP RFCs, {{but it has}} various drawbacks. Since nearly all spam has forged return addresses, nearly all callbacks are to innocent third party mail servers that are unrelated to the spam. At the same time, there will be numerous false negatives due to spammers abusing <b>real</b> <b>addresses</b> and some false positives. One of the ways of reducing the load on innocent servers is to use other spam detection methods first and save callback verification for last.|$|R
50|$|Systems {{can have}} one page {{table for the}} whole system, {{separate}} page tables for each application and segment, a tree of page tables for large segments {{or some combination of}} these. If there is only one page table, different applications running at the same time use different parts of a single range of virtual addresses. If there are multiple page or segment tables, there are multiple virtual address spaces and concurrent applications with separate page tables redirect to different <b>real</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{solution}} is for A {{to form an}} untraceable return address [...] where [...] is its own <b>real</b> <b>address,</b> [...] is a public one-time key chosen for the current occasion only, and [...] is a key that will also act as a random string for purposes of sealing. Then, A can send this return address to B {{as part of a}} message sent by the techniques already described.|$|E
5000|$|In OS/VS1 {{and similar}} OSes, {{some parts of}} systems memory are managed in [...] "virtual-real" [...] mode, called [...] "V=R". In this mode every virtual address {{corresponds}} to the same <b>real</b> <b>address.</b> This mode is used for interrupt mechanisms, for the paging supervisor and page tables in older systems, and for application programs using non-standard I/O management. For example, IBM's z/OS has 3 modes (virtual-virtual, virtual-real and virtual-fixed).|$|E

2500|$|On most systems {{channels}} operate using <b>real</b> (or physical) <b>addresses,</b> {{while the}} channel programs are built using virtual addresses. [...] The operating system {{is responsible for}} translating these channel programs before executing them, and for this particular purpose the Input/Output Supervisor (IOS) has a special [...] "fast fix" [...] function which was designed into the OS Supervisor just for those [...] "fixes" [...] which are of relatively short duration (i.e., significantly shorter than [...] "wall-clock time"). Pages containing data {{to be used by}} the I/O operation are locked into real memory, or page fixed. [...] The channel program is copied and all virtual addresses are replaced by <b>real</b> <b>addresses</b> before the I/O operation is started. After the operation completes, the pages are unfixed.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{counterbalance}} to {{the risks}} of asking a user to give a [...] "permanent" [...] email address in a publicly accessible site, administrators {{have the option to}} prevent, the publication of users' email addresses or to give users the option of hiding their address. An [...] "email this user" [...] script can be used to allow communication with the user without the sender knowing his email address.This provides users with some minimal protection from spam and allows them to use <b>real</b> email <b>addresses,</b> which may make a ban on DEAs easier for users to accept. The problem is when the website itself is hacked, and the <b>real</b> <b>addresses</b> and other personal information is stolen, or when the website changes owners and email policies are changed without notifying the user, or if the website was set up from the beginning with the intention to spam the user.|$|R
5000|$|Address munging is the {{practice}} of disguisingan e-mail address {{to prevent it from}} being automatically collected by unsolicited bulk e-mail providers. Address munging is intended to disguise an e-mail address in a way that prevents computer software from seeing the <b>real</b> <b>address,</b> or even any address at all, but still allows a human reader to reconstruct the original and contact the author: an email address such as, [...] "", becomes [...] "no-one at example dot com", for instance.|$|E
