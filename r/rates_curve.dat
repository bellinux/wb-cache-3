40|$|AbstractThe stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{research}} for analysis of flow regime and design of hydraulic structure and river channel. To develop the reliable stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve,</b> numerous discharge data from the lowest to bankful stage should be observed {{over a long period}} of time. The river environment and topography of Nakdong River in Korea has been changed drastically due to the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project from the end of 2009 to 2012. Moreover, 8 weirs were built dividing the main river into nine sectors and it led the discontinuous flow and backwater effect for each sector. In such situations, the stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> should be re-determined with new data for the changed topography and flow characteristics. However, it takes long time to get the new stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve.</b> In this study, the alternative stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> was developed using the Hydraulic Performance Graph (HPG). HPG is a plot summarizing all the backwater profile for all possible discharge at a channel reach based on the flow equation that is derived from the energy equation. In this study, the 26 cross sections up to a length of 12. 3 km located between Gangjung weir and Dalsung weir in Nakdong River after the project were measured. The HPG for this sector was created. Using the results of discharge and water surface elevation from the HPG, the alternative stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> was created. Then the discharge from the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> was compared with measured data from the several cross sections. The discharge from the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> matched the measured data quite well.

The estimates were derived from isopach maps, cross-sections and drill holes or stratigraphic columns assuming regional similarity of the strata. Average solid phase volumes and accumulation rates were calculated for nine epochs approximately corresponding to geological periods: Palaeocene (≈ 66 - 58 Ma), Eocene (≈ 58 - 37 Ma), Oligocene(≈ 37 - 30 and 30 - 24 Ma), Miocene (≈ 24 - 17, 17 - 11 and 11 - 5 Ma), Pliocene (≈ 5 - 2 Ma) and Quaternary (≈ 2 - 0 Ma). These rates shed new light on the geological history of Asia since the onset of the collision of India with Asia (≈ 50 Ma). The overall average accumulation <b>rates</b> <b>curve</b> for Asian sedimentary basins {{since the beginning of}} the Tertiary shows an exponential form with slow accumulation rates (less than 0. 5 × 106 km 3 Myr− 1) until the beginning of the Oligocene, more than 15 Myr after the onset of the collision. From the Oligocene onwards rates increase quickly in an exponential manner, reaching their maximum values in the Quaternary (more than 1. 5 × 106 km 3 Myr− 1). From these observations we suggest that extrusion and crustal shortening are complementary processes that have been successively dominant throughout the India-Eurasia collision history. At smaller scales one may distinguish between independent histories at the subcontinental and basin scales.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between water level and discharge {{along the river}} channel are vital for decision support systems in river basin management. Normally {{the reliability of the}} so-called <b>rating</b> <b>curves</b> along the river channel depends greatly on the accuracy and duration of the measured discharge and water level data. In the Elbe Decision Support System (DSS), the <b>rating</b> <b>curves</b> are combined with the HEC- 6 model to investigate the effects of river engineering measures on the Elbe river system.

40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of river discharge is time consuming and financially demanding. Continuous river discharge measurements are therefore generally derived from continuous stage measurements, through a stage-discharge relation, also called a <b>rating</b> <b>curve.</b> <b>Rating</b> <b>curves</b> {{are determined by}} fitting a curve to {{a limited number of}} points (hi, Qi), whereby hi and Qi represent stage and discharge measured in a certain cross-section of a river at a fixed geographical location. Commonly these points (hi, Qi) originate from measurements done under regular flow conditions, due to which a considerable part of the curve is based on interpolation and extrapolation. Therefore the uncertainty in the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> particularly during floods can be considerable, which directly translates into uncertainty in the discharge data. Calibrating a model on uncertain discharge observations leads to biased model parameter estimates, which directly lead to biased model predictions. This research shows an approach whereby a conceptual rainfall-runoff model is calibrated on the basis of stage data only. In addition to the existing conceptual model parameters, extra parameters have been added that define the <b>rating</b> <b>curve.</b> A stepwise calibration method has been applied whereby first the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> parameters were determined and subsequently the remaining model parameters. Once the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> parameters had been fixed, the reanalysed hydrograph was established using the observed stage readings. Subsequently, the model hypotheses on catchment behaviour were tested by conventional methods. In this research these methods have been applied to the scarcely gauged Endau River catchment, located in the South-East of peninsula Malaysia. The initial results are promising. It was found that the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> parameters are well defined and optimise to values that correspond to the physical property they represent. When comparing the reanalysed <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> with the original <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> {{it can be seen that}} the initial part of the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> overlaps, corresponding with the most reliable part of the original <b>rating</b> <b>curve.</b> When comparing the reanalysed <b>rating</b> <b>curves</b> with discharge measurements, a high correspondence is observed, while the similarity between the measurements and the original <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> is very low. Finally, the modelled hydrographs appear to be relatively well able to mimic the reanalysed hydrograph, even though it was impossible to find a proper model for the original hydrograph. To test the sensitivity of the calibrated <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> to model structure, both a lumped and a topography driven model structure have been tested. Additionally, these models were exposed to two <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> definitions and a variable model forcing. The results of this sensitivity analysis show that the calibrated <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> is relatively insensitive to model structure and relatively sensitive to the number of parameters used for the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> definition. Concerning the forcing, the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> is highly sensitive to precipitation and less sensitive to potential evaporation. The reason for this sensitivity is that the established <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> is strongly determined by the water balance, which is dominated by the primary driver P. The calibrated models have been validated on independent data by split-sample validation and by transfer to a different catchment. The topography driven models appear to perform best during both forms of validation. An additional way of validating was carried out by coupling the best performing rainfall-runoff model to a steady state salt intrusion model: a novel approach which offers mutual model validation. The results show that the predicted discharge of the rainfall-runoff model corresponds rather well with the discharge determined by the salt model. So, the most important conclusions from this research are: calibration of a rainfall-runoff model on stage reduces discharge uncertainty in scarcely gauged basins; topography driven models are better transferable than lumped models; and linking a salt intrusion model to a rainfall-runoff model offers mutual model improvement.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of propene polymerization catalyzed by ansa-metallocenes {{were studied}} using quenched-flow techniques. Two catalyst systems were investigated, (SBI) ZrMe 2 /AliBu 3 /[Ph 3 C][CN{B(C 6 F 5) 3 } 2] (1 : 100 : 1) at 25. 0 °C and (SBI) ZrCl 2 /methylalumoxane at 40. 0 °C (Al:Zr = 2400 : 1) (SBI = rac-Me 2 Si(1 -Indenyl) 2). The {{aims of the}} study were to address fundamental mechanistic aspects of metallocene-catalyzed alkene polymerizations, catalyst initiation, the quantitative correlation between catalyst structure and the rate of chain propagation, and the nature of dormant states. One of the most important but largely unknown factors in metallocene catalysis is the distribution of the catalyst between dormant states and species actively involved in polymer chain growth. Measurements of polymer yield Y versus reaction time t for propene concentrations [M] = 0. 15 - 0. 59 mol L- 1 and zirconocene concentrations in the range [Zr] = (2. 38 - 9. 52) × 10 - 5 mol L- 1 for the borate system showed first-order dependence on [M] and [Zr]. Up to t ˜ 1 s, the half-life of catalyst initiation is comparable to the half-life of chain growth; that is, this phase is governed by non-steady-state kinetics. We propose a rate law which takes account of this and accurately describes the initial <b>rates.</b> <b>Curve</b> fitting of Y(t) data provides an apparent chain growth rate constant kpapp on the order of 103 L mol- 1 s- 1. By contrast, the evolution with time of the number-average polymer molecular weight, which is independent of the concentration of catalyst involved, leads to a kp which is an order of magnitude larger, (17. 2 ± 1. 4) × 103 L mol- 1 s- 1. The ratio kpapp/kp = 0. 08 indicates that under the given conditions only about 8 % of the total catalyst is actively engaged in chain growth at any one time. The system (SBI) ZrCl 2 /methylalumoxane is significantly less active, kpapp = 48. 4 ± 2. 7 and kp = (6 ± 2) × 102 L mol- 1 s- 1, while, surprisingly, the mole fraction of active species is essentially identical, 8 %. Evidently, the energetics of the chain growth sequence are strongly modulated {{by the nature of the}} counteranion. Increasing the counteranion/zirconium ratio from 1 : 1 to 20 : 1 has no influence on catalyst activity. These findings are consistent with a model of closely associated ion pairs throughout the chain growth sequence. For the borate system, propagation is ~ 6000 times faster than initiation, while for the MAO catalyst, kp/ki ˜ 800. Polymers obtained at 25 °C show 0. 1 - 0. 2 mol % 2, 1 -regioerrors, and end-group analysis identifies 2, 1 -misinsertions as the main cause for chain termination (66 %), as compared to 34 % for the vinylidene end groups. The results suggest that 2, 1 -regioerrors are a major contributor to the formation of dormant species, even at short reaction times...|$|E
40|$|In the {{classical}} interest rate models, {{have always been}} supposed the important no-arbitrage relationships, that relate the prices of the zero-coupon bonds and the LIBOR rates. These equalities allow, inside a model, to hedge perfectly forward-rate agreements in terms of zero-coupon bonds. As a consequence, forward rates of different tenors are {{related to each other}} by sharp constraints, that however might not hold in practice. For long time the gap between the models and the real market has been considered negligible, but starting from summer 2007, with the beginning of the credit crunch, the market quotes of zero-coupon bonds and of the LIBOR rates, started to violate {{the classical}} constraints in a macroscopic way. This because the counterparties began to consider the default of their creditors a realistic possibility, and lending money became a risky investment. Evidences of this fact can be seen for example in the historical data of the spread between the OIS swap rate with maturity one year and the EURIBOR swap rate with the same maturity. While before the crisis was nearly zero, consistently with the usual interest rate models, after the summer 2007 the situation drastically changed, and the OIS-IRS spread started growing, making the financial scenario totally inconsistent with the traditional models. This brought to the need to model separately the forward rates of the various tenor quoted in the market, since they couldn't no more obtained from the classical one-curve models. The result is a multi-curve model where each forward rate dynamic of a given tenor quoted in the market is described by a stochastic equation. The aim of the work is to present the main approaches proposed in literature {{for the construction of a}} multi-curve framework. The first chapter is an introduction of the main definitions, the classical no-arbitrage formulas and the main interest rate derivatives, with a focus on the differences of the formulas in the case of the classical models and in the multi-curve models. Also are described the main techniques needed for bootstrapping the forward <b>rates</b> <b>curve.</b> The second chapter is about a multi-curve model, adopting a short rate approach. Is supposed the existence of a risk-free short rate and of a risky short rate, and are chosen dynamics for the risk-free rate and for the spread between the two rates. Is obtained a formula for the FRA contracts, that can be used for the calibration. In the third chapter are described two models, adopting an Heath–Jarrow–Morton approach. For each tenor quoted in the market is supposed the existence of an instantaneous forward rate and are chosen HJM-dynamics for each one of them. In both models are deduced formulas for pricing swaptions, that can be used in the calibration. In the fourth chapter is presented a model for the national bonds market. The shapes of the yield curves of the European states, while are similar for short maturities, present significant spreads for long maturities. This reflects the different reliability the investors has in the states, and the different liquidity risk attributed to the states by the market. This suggests, as in multi-curve frameworks, to produce a model, where each national bond dynamic is described by a different stochastic equation. Hence, as in the multi-curve short rate model, is supposed, for each state, the existence of a short rate, modelled as sum of a risk-free rate and a spread. The result is a multi-curve model for the bonds market. The last part also presents a possible pricing methodology for call and put options with underlying a national bond...|$|E
40|$|The flood data {{reported}} by gauging authorities, though perceived as measured data, is rather estimated from a <b>rating</b> <b>curve.</b> The <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> represents a relationship {{at a particular}} gauged location between water level and flow values. The {{lower part of the}} <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> is generally established based on flow measurements during smaller flood events typically up to an annual exceedance probability (AEP) of 1 in 10; however, the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> usually needs extrapolation to flood magnitudes corresponding to AEPs of 1 in 100 and beyond. There are different methods of <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> extrapolation, with different degrees of uncertainty associated with them. Most hydrologic models use at-site flood data as “accurate” measured values in evaluating the model performance, thus creating a misconception in hydrologic practice. This paper examines the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty levels for a set of New South Wales (NSW) catchments, which have been assembled as a part of Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) Project 5 ‘Regional Flood Methods’. ARR-FLIKE is used to assess the impacts of <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty on at-site flood quantile estimates. The results indicate that a higher assumed value of <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty in flood frequency analysis inflates the uncertainty bounds of the estimated flood quantiles (i. e. increases the width of the 90 % confidence limits). This is more noticeable for smaller AEP floods. Based on results from the 96 catchments examined here, it has been found that the difference in flood quantile estimates for different assumed <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty values do not depend on standard deviation and skew of log-space annual maximum flood series data. It is noted that the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty issue needs to be recognised in flood frequency analysis as this represents a significant source of uncertainty in flood frequency analysis, which is often ignored in practice. The findings of this study are based on 96 NSW catchments only, and hence caution should be applied in drawing inferences for other catchments and/or other parts of Australia. Further study with a greater number of catchments from all Australian states should be undertaken to understand better the impacts of <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> extrapolation uncertainty on flood frequency analysis results in different situations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Sediment-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> is {{well known}} method in {{predicting}} suspended sediment discharge. The correlation is usually developed as a relationship between suspended sediment load and discharge. Ideally, the measured of discharge and sediment concentration are carried out continuously, as suspended sediment load is more depended on the sources, i. e. the erosion rate on the catchment rather than the river hydraulic. In practice, the discharge and sediment concentration are carried out intermittently or in spot, as it is time and cost consuming. Therefore, the use of sediment-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> to predict suspended sediment may generate an error.

40|$|Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is {{the most}} common nonparametric method for {{estimating}} the volatility structure of Gaussian interest rate models. One major difficulty in the estimation of these models is the fact that forward <b>rate</b> <b>curves</b> are not directly observable from the market so that non-trivial observational errors arise in any statistical analysis. In this work, we point out that the classical PCA analysis is not suitable for estimating factors of forward <b>rate</b> <b>curves</b> due to the presence of measurement errors induced by market microstructure effects and numerical interpolation. Our analysis indicates that the PCA based on the long-run covariance matrix is capable to extract the true covariance structure of the forward <b>rate</b> <b>curves</b> in the presence of observational errors. Moreover, it provides a significant reduction in the pricing errors due to noisy data typically founded in forward <b>rate</b> <b>curves.</b> Comment: 27 page...|$|R

We tested synthetically thinned high-resolution (more than 2 points/m 2) ALS data {{as a proxy for}} low-resolution data at a point density equivalent to that obtained within most national-scale ALS strategies. Our results show that the errors incurred due to the effect of low-resolution versus high-resolution ALS data were less than those due to flow measurement and empirical <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> fitting uncertainties. As such, although there likely are scale and technical limitations to consider, it is theoretically possible to generate <b>rating</b> <b>curves</b> in a river network from ALS data of the resolution anticipated within national-scale ALS schemes (at least for rivers with relatively simple geometries). This is promising, since generating <b>rating</b> <b>curves</b> from ALS scans would greatly enhance our ability to monitor streamflow by simplifying the overall effort required...|$|R

40|$|A grey-based {{technique}} for characterizing both the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty due to discharge measurement errors {{and its effect}} on flood frequency analysis is here presented. On the basis of river stage measurements (affected by negligible errors) and corresponding discharge measurements (affected by uncertainty here represented through grey numbers) made in a gauged section, the grey parameters of the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> are estimated by using a grey non-linear regression. The <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> with grey parameters can be interpreted both (a) as a grey function which provides an uncertain (grey) estimation of the discharge for a given river stage and (b) as a sheaf of crisp <b>rating</b> <b>curves</b> whose crisp parameters are included within the corresponding grey parameters. Given a set of annual maximum stages observed in the section, the frequency distribution (here assumed of EV 1 type) of the annual maximum grey discharges is thus estimated through two approaches consistent with the two interpretations of the <b>rating</b> <b>curve,</b> i. e. exploiting the definition of grey function a) of the grey discharges and b) of the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> grey parameters. The application of the methodology proposed to the data pertaining to a gauged section of the river Po (Italy) shows that the first approach yields a wider grey EV 1 distribution with respect to that resulting from the second approach; {{this is due to the}} fact that, unlike the former, the latter explicitly takes into account the hydraulic consistency between discharges associated with different stages...|$|R
40|$|Accurate stream {{discharge}} measurements {{are important for}} many hydrological studies. In remote locations, however, {{it is often difficult}} to obtain stream flow information because of the difficulty in making the discharge measurements necessary to define stage-discharge relationships (<b>rating</b> <b>curves).</b> This study investigates the feasibility of defining <b>rating</b> <b>curves</b> by using a fluid mechanics-based model constrained with topographic data from an airborne LiDAR scanning. The study was carried out for an 8 m-wide channel in the boreal landscape of northern Sweden. LiDAR data were used to define channel geometry above a low flow water surface along the 90 -m surveyed reach. The channel topography below the water surface was estimated using the simple assumption of a flat streambed. The roughness for the modelled reach was back calculated from a single measurment of discharge. The topographic and roughness information was then used to model a <b>rating</b> <b>curve.</b> To isolate the potential influence of the flat bed assumption, a ‘hybrid model’ <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> was developed on the basis of data combined from the LiDAR scan and a detailed ground survey. Whereas this hybrid model <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> was in agreement with the direct measurements of discharge, the LiDAR model <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> was equally in agreement with the medium and high flow measurements based on confidence intervals calculated from the direct measurements. The discrepancy between the LiDAR model <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> and the low flow measurements was likely due to reduced roughness associated with unresolved submerged bed topography. Scanning during periods of low flow can help minimize this deficiency. These results suggest that combined ground surveys and LiDAR scans or multifrequency LiDAR scans that see ‘below’ the water surface (bathymetric LiDAR) could be useful in generating data needed to run such a fluid mechanics-based model. This opens a realm of possibility to remotely sense and monitor stream flows in channels in remote locations...|$|R
