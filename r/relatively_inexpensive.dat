5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in cases of {{undisclosed}} synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E
5|$|The {{equipment}} is <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{industry}} would ultimately {{prove to be}} a resource curse to Wichita Falls, and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.|$|E

5|$|The {{process is}} {{versatile}} {{and can be}} performed with <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2018 {{edition of}} R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, only the pieces from 1882 to 1887 catalog {{for more than}} $100 in worn Good-4 condition; common dates list for $15 to $20 in that condition. The highest value listed is for the 1877, struck only in proof with a mintage of 900, at $2,000. David F. Fanning, in his 2001 article on the three-cent pieces, {{suggested}} that rarer specimens of the nickel three-cent piece are <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> compared with coins of similar mintage in more popular series, such as the Morgan dollar.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive.</b> Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more {{of their own money}} than in the past.|$|E

5|$|Painting {{on linen}} cloth using glue size as a binder {{was at the}} time a <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> {{alternative}} to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century. Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing them to show as matt and opaque, giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes easily, and this work {{is one of the best}} preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period; the majority extant today were executed on wood using oil or egg tempera. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.|$|E
5|$|Power remains <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> {{along the}} Columbia, {{and in recent}} years {{high-tech}} companies like Google have begun to move server farm operations into the area to avail themselves of cheap power. Downriver of Grand Coulee, each dam's reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various Washington public utility districts to ensure flow, flood control, and power generation objectives are met. Increasingly, hydro-power operations are required to meet standards under the US Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish, and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The F-16 was {{designed}} to be <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy lamination coatings. The number of lubrication points, fuel line connections, and replaceable modules is significantly lower than predecessors; 80% of access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E

5|$|The {{park service}} gave {{priority}} {{to life and}} property {{in their efforts to}} suppress the fires. Of the more than 1,000 structures located in the park, only 67 were destroyed. There were 400 structures in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed, 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> to replace. Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially at times of immediate danger. Fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes, yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non-critical personnel at least once during the fires.|$|E
5|$|Rather than direct {{involvement}} in the European land war, the English Parliament preferred a <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> naval attack on Spanish colonies in the New World, hoping for the capture of the Spanish treasure fleets. Parliament voted to grant a subsidy of £140,000, which was an insufficient sum for Charles's war plans. Moreover, the House of Commons limited its authorisation for royal collection of tonnage and poundage (two varieties of customs duties) to a period of one year, although previous sovereigns since Henry VI of England had been granted the right for life. In this manner, Parliament could delay approval of the rates until after a full-scale review of customs revenue. The bill made no progress in the House of Lords past its first reading. Although no Parliamentary Act for the levy of tonnage and poundage was obtained, Charles continued to collect the duties.|$|E
5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (<b>relatively)</b> <b>inexpensive</b> and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E

50|$|In {{the uterus}}, balloon tamponade can {{alleviate}} or stop postpartum hemorrhage. Inflating a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube in the uterus successfully treats atonic postpartum hemorrhage refractory to medical management in approximately 80% of cases. Such procedure is <b>relatively</b> simple, <b>inexpensive</b> and has low surgical morbidity. A Bakri balloon is a balloon tamponade specifically constructed for uterine postpartum hemorrhage.|$|R
50|$|Open-heart surgery {{developed}} rapidly {{beginning in}} the 1950s, and many methods were developed for oxygenating blood outside the body. A bubble oxygenator was introduced in 1950 by Clark, Gollan, and Gupta. The method faced initial skepticism but in 1956 the University of Minnesota's De-Wall-Lillehei bubble oxygenator was demonstrated to be <b>relatively</b> simple, <b>inexpensive,</b> and easy to operate.|$|R
5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are <b>relatively</b> <b>inexpensive</b> compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E
