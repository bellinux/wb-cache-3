40|$|BackgroundWe {{compared}} our {{clinical experience}} with currently available <b>reference</b> <b>oxygen</b> saturation <b>level</b> (SpO 2) values from the American Academy of Pediatrics/American Heart Association (AAP/AHA) neonatal resuscitation program guidelines. MethodsWe enrolled 145 healthy full-term neonates; infants showing respiratory distress {{and those with}} serious congenital anomalies were excluded. SpO 2 values at every 1 minute until 10 minutes after birth were measured and recorded. Infants were classified into the cesarean section (CS) and normal spontaneous delivery (NSD) groups for evaluating differences. The 10 th percentiles of SpO 2 at each minute were used as the lower limits of normal oxygen saturation, and these were compared with the lowest target values recommended in the AAP/AHA guidelines. ResultsOverall, 130 vigorous full-term neonates (median gestational age: 38 5 / 7 weeks; body weight at birth: 2405 – 3960  g) were analyzed. The median SpO 2 were 67 % and 89 % at the 1 st and 4 th minute, respectively. On average, SpO 2 values reached > 90 % at the 5 th minute. No statistical differences were noted in the SpO 2 values between the CS and NSD groups after 5  minutes; however, a trend of higher SpO 2 was observed in the NSD group. We noted a gradually increasing trend for SpO 2 values over time, similar to that noted in the AAP/AHA guidelines. However, SpO 2 values at the 10 th percentiles of each minute within the first 5 minutes in our study were equal to or significantly lower {{than those in the}} AAP/AHA guidelines; moreover, at the 10 th minute, SpO 2 values at the 10 th percentiles were significantly higher than those in the guidelines. ConclusionThe delivery modes did not affect the SpO 2 values of full-term healthy neonates. Discrepancies in SpO 2 changes in full-term neonates not requiring resuscitation between this study and the AAP/AHA guidelines were significant. SpO 2 ranges for each time point within the first 10 minutes after birth should therefore be reevaluated locally...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether culturing {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} at atmospheric <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> skews responses {{in comparison with}} culturing lymphocytes at physiologic <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels,</b> we cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 5 %, 10 %, and atmospheric (20 %) gas-phase oxygen for 5 days. We found that incubator <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> influenced lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by two commonly used stimuli: Con A and antibodies that crosslink surface CD 3 and CD 28 to mimic antigen presentation. In both cases, proliferation increased as gas-phase <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> increased. In contrast, <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> did not influence proliferation stimulated by phytohemagglutinin, another commonly used mitogen. Similarly, <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> did not impact cell viability in unstimulated cultures. Thus, we conclude that the influence of <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> on proliferation depends on the stimulus, and, most importantly from the standpoint of immune responses, culturing cells at atmospheric rather than physiologic <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> results in significantly increased proliferation responses to the CD 3 /CD 28 crosslinking, a proliferation stimulus commonly used to mimic T cell antigen receptor signaling...|$|R
50|$|The Big Table's {{oxygen supply}} is dwindling. Therefore, one {{necessity}} for survival is to refill low oxygenated areas and thus avoid asphyxiation. Overuse of firearms depletes the oxygen more quickly. In some areas, oxygen can be replenished (an unlimited number of times) by finding yellow oxygen boxes known as Air Systems (AS). When the player has a regulator, an AS {{allows him to}} refill it. If the player is not using the <b>oxygen</b> <b>level</b> indicator, a red emergency light will indicate a low <b>oxygen</b> <b>level.</b> Low <b>oxygen</b> <b>level</b> rooms will appear in red on the player's map.

40|$|The use of pure oxygen can {{significantly}} increase the carrying {{capacity of a}} culture system both by supporting increased fish density and by allowing reuse of the water. The minimum allowable dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>level</b> is well defined, but considerably less information {{is available on the}} maximum allowable dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>level.</b> The maximum allowable dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>level</b> appears to be influenced primarily by (1) oxygen toxicity, (2) physiological and developmental problems caused by high or rapidly fluctuating dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels,</b> (3) gas bubble trauma, and (4) biological effects of increased loading and density.

40|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that self-regulation relies on glucose as a limited energy source, such that self-regulation is impaired when glucose is lower and is improved when glucose is higher.

40|$|By {{measuring}} the lactate response {{it is possible}} to determine whether a teleost is able to adapt to a certain <b>oxygen</b> <b>level.</b> It is hypothesized that recovery will occur at <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> above the critical <b>oxygen</b> <b>level</b> (PO 2) (crit) reflected by a transient lactate increase. In contrast, continuous lactate accumulation occurs at <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> below the (PO 2) (crit), which will be lethal in case of prolonged exposure. Since catecholamines as well as cortisol increase the availability of glucose, it is expected that these stress hormones are involved in the activation of the anaerobic metabolism. Common carp and rainbow trout were cannulated and exposed to stepwise decreasing <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels.</b> At each <b>oxygen</b> <b>level</b> blood samples were taken at several time-points and analyzed for plasma lactate, adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol. The results show that both individual and inter-specific differences in lactate response occur during exposure to hypoxia. These differences can be associated with observed differences in behaviour. Whereas carp stayed quiet during the hypoxia treatment, trout displayed individually different behaviour. In contrast to the passive responders, the active responding trout did not survive as a result of continuous lactate accumulation. Interestingly, both in carp and trout a strong correlation exists between the lactate and catecholamine levels. This may indicate that these stress hormones are of importance for the metabolic changes occurring during anaerobic activation...|$|R

50|$|Gaps in the {{evidence}} from ancient rocks have failed to explain the discrepancy between Earth’s atmospheric and oceanic <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels.</b> By tracing the movement of chromium isotopes from land to ocean, {{a process that is}} sensitive to atmospheric <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels,</b> the earliest signs of significant chromium oxidation have been found. This suggests <b>levels</b> of atmospheric <b>oxygen</b> to have significantly increased around 800 million years ago. Small amounts of oxygen can convert insoluble chromium, a constituent of the continental crust to a soluble form which is then transported to the ocean and deposited in ironstone. By studying the chromium isotope composition in ancient ironstones, measuring the ratio of heavier 53Cr (which is more sensitive to oxidation) to the lighter 52Cr, researchers can determine ancient <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels.</b> This research revealed very low <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> during the Boring Billion, which are below 0.1% of present atmospheric levels.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{cold water}} fish that live in clean cold waters become {{stressed}} when oxygen concentrations fall below 8 mg/l while warm water fish generally need at least 5 ppm (5 mg/l) of dissolved oxygen. Fish can endure short periods of reduced <b>oxygen.</b> Depleted <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> {{are the most common}} cause of fish kills. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> normally fluctuate even over the course of a day and are affected by weather, temperature, the amount of sunlight available, and the amount of living and dead plant and animal matter in the water. [...] In temperate zones <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> in eutrophic rivers in summertime can exhibit very large diurnal fluctuations with many hours of oxygen supersaturation during daylight followed by oxygen depletion at night. Associated with these photosynthetic rhythms there is a matching pH rhythm as bicarbonate ion is metabolised by plant cells.

5000|$|Oxygen {{saturation}} {{is a term}} {{referring to}} the fraction of oxygen-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin (unsaturated + saturated) in the blood. The human body requires and regulates a very precise and specific balance of oxygen in the blood. Normal blood <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> in humans are considered 95-100 percent. If the level is below 90 percent, it is considered low resulting in hypoxemia. [...] Blood <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> below 80 percent may compromise organ function, such as the brain and heart, and should be promptly addressed. Continued low <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> may lead to respiratory or cardiac arrest. Oxygen therapy {{may be used to}} assist in raising blood <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels.</b> Oxygenation occurs when oxygen molecules (...) enter the tissues of the body. For example, blood is oxygenated in the lungs, where oxygen molecules travel from the air and into the blood. Oxygenation is commonly used to refer to medical oxygen saturation.|$|R
5|$|Low <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels.</b> Low <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels,</b> if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|R

40|$|Oxygen is a {{key factor}} in the {{regulation}} of cytotrophoblast differentiation, proliferation and invasion in early pregnancy. Abnormalities in oxygen concentration have also been linked to a number of pregnancy disorders. Cell culture models have been used to study the effect of oxygen on cytotrophoblast behaviour in vitro, however, there is often little or no validation of <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> in these cell culture systems. In this study, dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> in culture medium maintained in standard culture conditions (18 % O 2) measured 18 %. On transfer to a low oxygen environment (2 % O 2), <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> decreased to 6 – 8 % after 4 h and reached 2 % only after 24 h in culture. Culture medium pre-gassed with nitrogen to remove dissolved oxygen quickly absorbed oxygen when exposed to ambient air during dispensing and required further incubation in a 2 % oxygen environment before dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> equilibrated to 2 %. Thus, cultured cells placed in a low oxygen environment would be exposed to varying <b>levels</b> of <b>oxygen</b> before the desired <b>level</b> of <b>oxygen</b> exposure is reached.

Exposure to less hypoxic levels also changes ion fluxes and ammonia excretion, but there is no clear relationship between both parameters in this species.
