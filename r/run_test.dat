Two types of multivariate runs are defined: (i) an elliptical extension of the spherical runs proposed by Marden (1999), and (ii) an original concept of matrix-valued runs. The resulting <b>runs</b> <b>tests</b> themselves exist in various versions, one of which {{is a function of the}} number of data-based hyperplanes separating pairs of observations only. All proposed multivariate <b>runs</b> <b>tests</b> are affine-invariant and highly robust: in particular, they allow for heteroskedasticity and do not require any moment assumption.

40|$|The paper {{shows the}} results {{obtained}} by drying 38 -mm thick beech timber, namely one control <b>test</b> <b>run</b> under usual, conventional drying schedule and four <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> dried under the same schedule but with oscillations of equilibrium moisture content. During oscillation drying, temperature curve was identical with the temperature curve in the control <b>test</b> <b>run,</b> and the values of equilibrium moisture content oscillated according to previously set amplitudes and frequencies. Oscillation amplitudes were ± 10 % {{in the first two}} <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> and ± 20 % in the second two <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> compared to the value anticipated in the schedule. Duration of each oscillation was 3 h in the first and third <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> and 6 h in the second and fourth <b>test</b> <b>runs.</b> Special addition to the manufacturer’s software was developed for the realization of these oscillations. When comparing the results, drying time (for the same intervals of initial and final timber moisture content), energy consumption and drying quality were taken into consideration. Drying quality was determined {{at the end of each}} <b>test</b> <b>run</b> (both before and after conditioning), and based on the value of final timber moisture content, distribution of moisture content across thickness and gap size. Drying time was shorter in all four <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with oscillations, and energy consumption was lower than in the conventional <b>test</b> <b>run.</b> Slightly shorter drying period was recorded in <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with oscillation frequency of 3 hours compared to the <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with 6 hour oscillations. Final timber moisture content was almost even in all <b>test</b> <b>runs.</b> Profiles of moisture content across timber thickness were also similar in the <b>test</b> <b>runs,</b> but the biggest difference between core and surface at the end of drying was achieved in the <b>test</b> <b>run</b> without oscillations.
