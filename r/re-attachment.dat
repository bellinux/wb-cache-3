40|$|The {{concentration}} {{and type of}} free radicals from the decay (termination stage) of pyrolysis at slow and fast heating rates and at high temperatures (above 1000 °C) in biomass char have been studied. A room-temperature electron spin resonance spectroscopy study was conducted on original wood, herbaceous biomass, holocelluloses, lignin and their chars, prepared at high temperatures in a wire mesh reactor, an entrained flow reactor, and a tubular reactor. The radical concentrations in the chars from the decay stage range up between 7 · 1016 and 1. 5 · 1018 spins g− 1. The {{results indicated that the}} biomass major constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) had a minor effect on remaining radical concentrations compared to potassium and silica contents. The higher radical concentrations in the wheat straw chars from the decay stage of pyrolysis in the entrained flow reactor compared to the wood chars were related to the decreased mobility of potassium in the char matrix, leading to the less efficient catalytic effects of potassium on the bond-breaking and radical <b>re-attachments.</b> The high Si levels in the rice husk caused an increase in the char radical concentration compared to the wheat straw because the free radicals were trapped in a char consisting of a molten amorphous silica at heating rates of 103 – 104  K s− 1. The experimental electron spin resonance spectroscopy spectra were analyzed by fitting to simulated data in order to identify radical types, based on g-values and line widths. The results show that at high temperatures, mostly aliphatic radicals (g =  2. 0026 – 2. 0028) and PAH radicals (g =  2. 0027 – 2. 0031) were formed...|$|R
40|$|Potential of the {{combination}} of nanofluids and dimpled channels for possible heat transfer enhancement has recently been demonstrated by Li et al. (2014) [36] {{in the context of}} small length scale channels through numerical simulations. The present work reports real time, non-intrusive experimental investigation of this concept wherein the convective heat transfer enhancement has been achieved with the coupled effects of Al 2 O 3 /water-based dilute nanofluids and surface roughened compact channels. One of the thermally active walls of the channel has been engraved with hemispherical inward dimples of 3 mm diameter with a pitch of 8 mm. Forced convection experiments have been conducted with water and Al 2 O 3 /water-based dilute nanofluids as the coolant medium for a range of Reynolds numbers. Real time measurements have been made in a completely non-intrusive manner using a Mach Zehnder interferometer and the images of the convective fields have been recorded in infinite as well as wedge fringe setting modes of the interferometer. Results revealed a clear influence of {{the combination}} of nanopartides and surface protrusions on phenomena such as disruption of thermal boundary layer profiles, periodic flow separation and <b>re-attachments</b> along the principal wall of the channel. The coupled effects of inward dimples and nanoparticles resulted into a clear reduction in the thickness as well as flattening of the thermal boundary layer in comparison with that achieved with the base fluid. An enhancement by approximate to 66. 5 % in the average heat transfer coefficient with 0. 05 % volumetric concentration of alumina nanoparticles was achieved with respect to that of the de-ionized water at a Reynolds number of Re = 350.

2500|$|Macropsia may be {{a result}} of optical {{magnification}} differences between the eyes, retinal receptor distribution, or the cortical processing of the sampled image. The current hypothesis for the occurrence of dysmetropsia is due to the stretching or compression of the retina leading to the displacement of receptors. [...] Macropsia arises from a compressed receptor distribution leading to a larger perceived image size and conversely, micropsiaresults from stretching of the retina leading to a more sparse receptor distribution that gives a smaller perceived image size. [...] In the case of macropsia, the greater density of photoreceptor cells leads to greater stimulation making the object seem larger. [...] In some cases, the effects of macropsia {{have been shown to be}} field dependent, in that the degree of visual distortion is related to the visual field angle. [...] Non-uniform stretching or compression of the receptor distribution could explain the field dependency of the macrospia. [...] If the compression forces were closer to the fovea the resulting compression would cause a greater amount of macropsia at lower field angles with little effect at higher field angles where the receptor distribution is not as compressed.

50|$|As {{seen in the}} {{mechanism}} above, bornyl diphosphate synthase catalyzes the cyclization cascade of GPP into (+)- bornyl diphosphate. Following the initial metal-activated diphosphate departure from GPP, the molecule isomerizes to linalyl diphosphate (LPP), which then allows for the rotation around the carbon-carbon bond, and consequent reattachment of the PPi group. The pyrophosphate then stabilizes the cyclization into the terpinyl cation, and another final cyclization yields the 2-bornyl cation. This cation is then neutralized by the stereo-specific C-O bond formation with the final <b>re-attachment</b> of pyrophosphate to create the final product, BPP. Careful consideration of the BPPS structure shows that the active site, discussed in further detail below, guides the positions and conformations of the isoprenoid functionality of the substrate, while the diphosphate position remains essentially anchored in a single location and conformation. Overall, the pyrophosphate {{plays an important role}} in stabilizing the carbocations formed throughout the cyclization in the active site of the enzyme. These interactions and the strategic positioning of pyrophosphate is what is believed to lead to its endo-specific recapture in the final step by the bornyl cation.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{fracture}} strength of three techniques used to re-attach tooth fragments in sound and endodontically treated fractured teeth with or without fiber post placement. Material and methods: Ninety human lower incisors were randomly divided into three groups of 30 teeth each. In group A teeth were not subjected to endodontic treatment; while teeth from groups B and C were endodontically treated and the pulp chamber restored with a composite resin. All teeth were fractured by an axial load applied to the buccal area in order to obtain tooth fragments. Teeth from each group were then divided into three subgroups, according to the <b>re-attachment</b> technique: bonded-only, buccal-chamfer and circumferential chamfer. Before the <b>re-attachment</b> procedures, fiber posts were placed in teeth from group C using dual cure resin luting cement (Duo-Link). All teeth (groups A-C) had the fragments re-attached using a same dual cure resin luting cement. in the bonded-only group, no additional preparation was made. After <b>re-attachment</b> of the fragment, teeth from groups buccal and circumferential chamfer groups had a 1. 0 mm depth chamfer placed in the fracture line either on buccal surfaceor along the buccal and lingual surfaces, respectively. increments of microhybid composite resin (Tetric Ceram) were used in subgroups buccal chamfer and circumferential chamfer to restore the chamfer. The specimens were loaded until fracture in the same pre-determined area. The force required to detach each fragment was recorded and the data was subjected to a three-way analysis of variance where factors Group and <b>Re-attachment</b> technique are independent measures and Time of fracture is a repeated measure factor (first and second) and Tukey`s test (alpha = 0. 05). Results: The main factors <b>Re-attachment</b> technique (p = 0. 04) and Time of fracture (p = 0. 02) were statistically significant. The buccal and circumferential chamfer techniques were statistically similar (p > 0. 05) and superior to the bonded-only group (p < 0. 05). The first time of fracture was statistically superior to second time of fracture (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: The use of fiber post is not necessary for the reinforcement of the tooth structure in <b>re-attachment</b> of endodontically treated teeth. When bonding a fractured fragment, the buccal or circumferential <b>re-attachment</b> techniques should be preferable in comparison with the simple <b>re-attachment</b> without any additional preparation. None of the techniques used for <b>re-attachment</b> restored the fracture strength of the intact teeth. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
