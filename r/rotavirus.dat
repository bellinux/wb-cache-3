5|$|In 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommended}} that <b>rotavirus</b> vaccine {{be included in}} all national immunisation programmes. The incidence and severity of <b>rotavirus</b> infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using <b>rotavirus</b> vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that <b>rotavirus</b> vaccines have reduced <b>rotavirus</b> hospitalisations by 49-92 percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17-55 percent. In Mexico, which in 2006 {{was among the first}} countries in the world to introduce <b>rotavirus</b> vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 <b>rotavirus</b> season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a <b>rotavirus</b> vaccine, severe <b>rotavirus</b> infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, <b>rotavirus</b> vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of <b>rotavirus</b> deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months, and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by 70 percent. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by <b>rotavirus</b> have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction of the vaccine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rotavirus</b> A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of <b>rotavirus</b> gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year <b>rotavirus</b> causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from <b>rotavirus,</b> 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with <b>rotavirus</b> by age five. <b>Rotavirus</b> is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for <b>rotavirus.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Thomas Henry Flewett {{suggested}} the name <b>rotavirus</b> after observing that, when viewed through an electron microscope, a <b>rotavirus</b> particle {{looks like a}} wheel (rota in Latin); the name was officially recognised by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses four years later. In 1976, related viruses were described in several other species of animals. These viruses, all causing acute gastroenteritis, were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and animals worldwide. <b>Rotavirus</b> serotypes were first described in 1980, and in the following year, <b>rotavirus</b> from humans was first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys, by adding trypsin (an enzyme found in the duodenum of mammals and now known to be essential for <b>rotavirus</b> to replicate) to the culture medium. The ability to grow <b>rotavirus</b> in culture accelerated the pace of research, and by the mid-1980s the first candidate vaccines were being evaluated.|$|E

5|$|<b>Rotaviruses</b> infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, <b>rotaviruses</b> cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These <b>rotaviruses</b> are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human <b>rotaviruses.</b> There is evidence that animal <b>rotaviruses</b> can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|R
40|$|Particles morphologically {{identical}} to <b>rotaviruses</b> {{were found in}} the faeces of a nine week-old child with gastroenteritis. Analysis of the viral RNA genome by polyacrylamine gel electrophoresis revealed 10 bands (probably 11 segments) some of wich differed in migration rate from those of the great majority of <b>rotaviruses</b> infecting man and other animal hosts. The virus was not detected by a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and therefore probably lacked the crossreactive antigen(s) shared by the majority <b>rotaviruses.</b> This was the only strain with such behaviour among 230 <b>rotaviruses</b> of human origin examined in this laboratory since 1979. The implications of the existence of non-crossreactive <b>rotaviruses</b> are discussed...|$|R
5|$|<b>Rotavirus</b> B, {{also called}} adult {{diarrhoea}} <b>rotavirus</b> or ADRV, has caused major epidemics of severe diarrhoea affecting {{thousands of people}} of all ages in China. These epidemics occurred as a result of sewage contamination of drinking water. <b>Rotavirus</b> B infections also occurred in India in 1998; the causative strain was named CAL. Unlike ADRV, the CAL strain is endemic. To date, epidemics caused by <b>rotavirus</b> B have been confined to mainland China, and surveys indicate a lack of immunity to this species in the United States.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rotavirus</b> {{is highly}} {{contagious}} and cannot {{be treated with}} antibiotics or other drugs. Because improved sanitation does not decrease the prevalence of rotaviral disease, {{and the rate of}} hospitalisations remains high despite the use of oral rehydrating medicines, the primary public health intervention is vaccination. Two vaccines against <b>Rotavirus</b> A infection are approved for global use and are safe and effective in children: Rotarix by GlaxoSmithKline and RotaTeq by Merck. Both are taken orally and contain attenuated live virus. Three vaccines are licensed for use in national markets only: ROTAVAC®, licensed in India in 2014; Rotavin-M1™, licensed in Vietnam in 2007; and Lanzhou Lamb <b>Rotavirus</b> Vaccine, licensed in China in 2000. Additional <b>rotavirus</b> vaccines are under development.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rotavirus</b> {{vaccines}} are licensed in over 100 countries, {{and more}} than 80 countries have introduced routine <b>rotavirus</b> vaccination, almost half {{with the support of}} Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. To make <b>rotavirus</b> vaccines available, accessible, and affordable in all countries—particularly low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia where the majority of <b>rotavirus</b> deaths occur PATH, the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance have partnered with research institutions and governments to generate and disseminate evidence, lower prices, and accelerate introduction.|$|E

40|$|Human group B <b>rotaviruses</b> were {{isolated}} from hospitalized patients in Bangladesh between July 2003 and December 2004.

5|$|During the infection, <b>rotavirus</b> {{produces}} mRNA {{for both}} protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the <b>rotavirus</b> proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus {{as early as}} two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought {{to be made by}} two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results in a sharp decrease in <b>rotavirus</b> replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, a <b>rotavirus</b> vaccine was {{licensed}} {{for use in}} the United States. Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by <b>rotavirus</b> A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} that shellfish can be used to detect enteric viruses in marine waters where they are present at very low concentrations. Aqua-cultured mussels were placed in the sea just off the mouth of a drainage channel affected by human and animal faecal contamination. Samples were taken from the channel, the sea and the mussels at intervals over two 4 -week periods. The samples were tested to verify the presence of both <b>rotaviruses</b> and E. coli. <b>Rotaviruses</b> were detected by Real Time-PCR, typed by multiplex PCR and subsequently sequenced. E. coli was enumerated in water matrices by a filtering method and in mussels by the MPN method. The presence of E. coli in the examined matrices demonstrates contamination of faecal origin throughout the studied environments. <b>Rotaviruses</b> were recorded in channel waters, but not in sea water. In both experiments, <b>rotaviruses</b> were detected in mussels 21 and 28 days after being placed in the sea water off the channel mouth. The use of mussels thus enabled the detection of <b>rotaviruses</b> in waters where the high dilution rendered direct investigation impossible.

40|$|Our {{investigations}} of interferon induction by <b>rotaviruses</b> showed that only when cells were pretreated with interferon, i. e., primed, could infectious <b>rotaviruses</b> induce significant quantities of interferon. As little as 0. 5 U of interferon provided sufficient priming for this induction. UV-irradiated <b>rotaviruses</b> induced significant levels of interferon, and priming only marginally enhanced the yields. Neither heat-inactivated virus nor serum-neutralized virus {{was able to}} induce interferon, even when cells were primed. When cells were treated with purified virus double-stranded RNA {{in the presence of}} DEAE-dextran to facilitate uptake, interferon was induced, although priming did not enhance yields. These results strongly implicate the viral double-stranded RNA as the effector for interferon induction. The insensitivity of <b>rotaviruses</b> to interferon in vitro was also studied. Results suggested that this lack of sensitivity was not due to any inherent resistance of the virus to the antiviral proteins, but rather to lack of activation of cellular enzymes exhibiting antiviral activity...|$|R

To acquire additional information on the VP 4 and VP 7 specificities of buffalo <b>rotaviruses,</b> a total of 125 fecal samples were collected from buffalo calves affected with diarrhoea, in seven dairy farms in Southern Italy. <b>Rotaviruses</b> were detected in 21 samples (16. 8 %) by an immunochromatographic assay and by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Analysis of the VP 7 gene revealed that 57 % (12 of 21) of the isolates were G 6, 23. 8 % were G 8 (5 of 21) and 19 % (4 of 21) were G 10. Analysis of the VP 4 revealed that 71. 4 % (15 of 21) of the isolates were P[5] and that 28. 6 % (6 of 21) were P[1]. The most common combination of G and P types was P[5],G 6 (57 %), followed by P[1],G 10 (19 %), P[5],G 8 (14 %) and P[1],G 8 (9. 5 %). While P[5],G 6 <b>rotaviruses</b> are very common in Italian bovine herds, the antigenic combination P[1],G 10 is unusual and presumably derives from reassortment between P[1] and G 10 strains, {{that appear to be}} more frequent in buffaloes and bovines, respectively. The presence of bovine-like G and P serotypes suggests that in Italy the epidemiology of buffalo <b>rotaviruses</b> overlaps the epidemiology of bovine <b>rotaviruses,</b> presumably because of the strict species affinity and/or of the intermingled distribution over the same geographical areas of the buffalo and bovine herds...|$|R
