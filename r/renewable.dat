40|$|Abstract—Electricity grids are {{transforming}} as <b>renewables</b> proliferate, yet operational concerns due to {{fluctuations in}} <b>renewables</b> sources could limit the ultimate potential for high penetrations of <b>renewables.</b> In this paper, we compare three electricity grids – California, Germany, and Ontario – studying {{the effects of}} relative cost of solar and wind generation on {{the selection of the}} <b>renewables</b> mix, and examine the resulting excess generation. We then observe the effects of the <b>renewables</b> mix and the use of baseload energy generation on the limits to <b>renewables</b> penetration, quantifying what proportion of delivered energy can be provided by <b>renewables.</b> Our study shows that the optimal <b>renewables</b> mix, from the perspective of minimizing total cost of generation, is highly dependent on the relative costs of technology, and that above a certain penetration rate, different for each grid, the optimal mix must contain both solar and wind generation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the causal relationship between economic growth, combustible <b>renewables</b> and waste consumption, and CO 2 emissions {{for a balanced}} panel of five North Africa countries during the period 1971 - 2008. The panel cointegration test results indicate that in the short-run there is a unidirectional causality running from real GDP per capita to per capita CO 2 emissions. However, {{there is evidence of}} no causality between combustible <b>renewables</b> and waste consumption and real GDP and between combustible <b>renewables</b> and waste consumption and CO 2 emissions. In the long-run, we find that there is evidence of a unidirectional causality running from CO 2 emissions and combustible <b>renewables</b> and waste consumption to real GDP. The results from panel FMOLS and DOLS estimates show that emissions is the most significant variable in explaining economic growth in the region which is followed by the consumption of combustible <b>renewables</b> and waste. In the long-run, increases in combustible <b>renewables</b> and waste consumption and emissions lead to increase economic growth. The finding of this paper is that North Africa region can use combustible <b>renewables</b> and waste as a substitutable energy to the fossil one and avoid the disaster on atmosphere by reducing emissions without impeding economic growth in the long-run. ...|$|R
