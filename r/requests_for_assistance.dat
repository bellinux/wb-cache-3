5|$|At the time, Baden-Powell {{intended}} {{that the}} scheme {{would be used}} by established organizations, in particular the Boys' Brigade, from the founder William A. Smith. However, because of the popularity of his person and the adventurous outdoor games he wrote about, boys spontaneously formed Scout patrols and flooded Baden-Powell with <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance.</b> He encouraged them, and the Scouting movement developed momentum. In 1910 Baden-Powell formed The Boy Scouts Association in the United Kingdom. As the movement grew, Sea Scouts, Air Scouts, and other specialized units {{were added to the}} program.|$|E
5|$|One {{shrimp boat}} was {{initially}} reported missing and the tug Myra White transmitted a distress signal as its engines failed near an oil rig off of Galveston. High winds shattered glass windows at Port Arthur, Texas City, and Galveston, while schools {{were shut down}} in Galveston, Lamarque, Texas City, Alvin, and most of Galveston and Jefferson counties. Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm. Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and tore off shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, {{and the other three}} apparently traveled to Galveston. Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed {{for the duration of the}} storm. Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> by residents of flooded homes. Two children, initially unaccounted for, were later found safe under a bridge abutment.|$|E

On December1, a United States Navy vessel arrived in Palau in case <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> were made after the storm. As a precautionary measure, the nations electric grid was shut down at 6:00p.m. local time on December2.

5|$|Italy began {{operations}} in the Mediterranean, initiating a siege of Malta in June, conquering British Somaliland in August, and making an incursion into British-held Egypt in September 1940. In October 1940, Italy started the Greco-Italian War because of Mussolini's jealousy of Hitler's success but within days was repulsed with few territorial gains and a stalemate soon occurred. The United Kingdom responded to Greek <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> by sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece.

25|$|The RAAF {{was also}} {{involved}} in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation.

The other flying units were No. 2 Squadron, which operated Canberra bombers and a small number of Dakota transports, and the UH-1 Iroquois-equipped No. 5 Squadron. No. 78 Wing and No. 2 Squadron had been based at Butterworth since 1958 and No. 5 Squadron arrived in 1964 in response to one of the Malaysian Government's <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance.</b>|$|E

The decision came alongside Foreign Minister Ramos-Horta's request to the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate allegations of human rights violations by the East Timorese police forces, as alleged by Human Rights Watch and the United States Department of State. On 12 May, Prime Minister of Australia John Howard announced that although {{there had not been}} any formal <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> from the Government of East Timor, Australian forces were standing by in readiness to provide assistance, with the amphibious transport ships HMAS Kanimbla and HMAS Manoora moving to northern waters in preparation.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{remaining}} {{neutral in}} the conflict, however, Habibullah {{did in fact}} accept a Turkish-German mission in Kabul and military assistance from the Central Powers as he attempted to play {{both sides of the}} conflict for the best deal. Through continual prevarication he resisted numerous <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance,</b> however he failed to keep in check troublesome tribal leaders, intent on undermining British rule in India, as Turkish agents attempted to foment trouble along the frontier. The departure of {{a large part of the}} British Indian Army to fight overseas and news of British defeats at the hands of the Turks aided Turkish agents in efforts at sedition, and in 1915 there was unrest amongst the Mohmands and then the Mahsuds. Notwithstanding these outbreaks, the frontier generally remained settled at a time when Britain could ill afford trouble.|$|E
25|$|As the {{infantry}} {{of the two}} armies fought at Bethesda Church on May 30, Sheridan began to receive <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> from Warren, who was concerned that his isolated advanced position on the left flank of the Union army put him at risk. Sheridan initially {{paid little attention to}} Warren's requests because he still harbored ill feelings from arguments the two generals had had at Spotsylvania, but as Warren's requests became more urgent, Sheridan agreed to screen roads leading to Warren's left flank, assigning the task to his division under Brig. Gen. Alfred T. A. Torbert, who delegated the responsibility to the brigade of Col. Thomas C. Devin, which was encamped at the Old Church crossroads. He placed his brigade in a good defensible position on the north bank of Matadequin Creek and sent a squadron to a forward position at the Barker farm, south of the creek.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} July a large Viet Cong {{force had}} been {{detected}} by SAS patrols east of Nui Dat, near the abandoned village of Long Tan. In response, 6 RAR launched a battalion search and destroy operation. During a series of fire-fights on 25 July a company from D445 Battalion bounced off C Company, {{and in the process}} of retreating assaulted B Company occupying a blocking position, before being driven off with heavy casualties. In the following days further clashes occurred around Long Tan, resulting in 13 Viet Cong killed and 19 wounded, and Australian losses of three killed and 19 wounded. Yet with the inhabitants resettled, the village fortified and the perimeter regularly patrolled, the Australians considered the area secure. However, with the 274th and 275th Regiments still at large, uncertainty resulted in growing tension in 1 ATF. Believing Viet Cong sympathisers had returned to Long Tan, they planned to search the area again on 29 July. That afternoon, as 6 RAR commenced a detailed search following its initial sweep, Jackson ordered its immediate return to Nui Dat in response to South Vietnamese reports of a large Viet Cong presence close to the base, with the battalion airlifted out by early evening. Although the warnings were unconfirmed and an attack against Nui Dat was considered unlikely, 1 ATF was re-postured. Company patrols were sent out in each direction over the following days, but found little of significance. Jackson had seemed to over-react, and his <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> from US II FFV were denied. Later intelligence discredited the original reporting and the crisis subsided, yet it was indicative of the alarms 1 ATF experienced during the first months of its lodgement and their effect.|$|E

500|$|Eric XIV, the new King of Sweden, {{turned down}} Kettler's <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance,</b> {{along with a}} similar request from Poland. Kettler turned to Sigismund for help. The {{weakened}} Livonian Order was dissolved by the second Treaty of Vilnius in 1561. Its lands were secularised as the Duchy of Livonia and Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and assigned to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Kettler became the first Duke of Courland, in doing so converting to Lutheranism. Included in the treaty was the Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti by which Sigismund guaranteed the Livonian estates [...] privileges including religious freedom {{with respect to the}} Augsburg Confession, the Indygenat, and continuation of the traditional German administration.

500|$|Elements of the ADF are {{frequently}} [...] "called out" [...] {{to contribute to}} relief efforts following natural disasters. The arrangements through which this are done are set out in Australia's emergency management plans. The ADF typically contributes specialist capabilities, such as engineers or transport, to support the civil authorities. For major disasters, this can involve a large-scale deployment of personnel and assets. While the ADF has a commitment to assist relief efforts, several defence white papers have specified {{that this is a}} secondary responsibility to the force's focus on maintaining combat capabilities. As a result, <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> have to be balanced against military priorities. No elements of the ADF are specifically tasked with or equipped for disaster relief efforts. The ADF can also be tasked with providing aid to civil authorities outside of natural disasters; for instance in response to industrial action or to assist civilian police maintain law and order. This rarely occurs, however.|$|E
500|$|The {{collapse}} of British {{power in the}} Pacific also led Australia to reorient its foreign and military policy towards the United States. Curtin stated in December 1941 [...] "that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom." [...] In February 1942 the US and British Governments agreed that Australia would become a strategic responsibility of the United States and the Allied ANZAC Force was created specifically to defend the Australian continent. [...] In March, General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Australia after escaping from the Philippines and assumed command of the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). All of the Australian military's combat units in this area were placed under MacArthur's command, and MacArthur replaced the Australian Chiefs of Staff as the Australian Government's main source of military advice {{until the end of}} the war. Australian General Thomas Blamey was appointed the Allied land force commander, but MacArthur did not permit him to command American forces. MacArthur also rejected US Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall's request that he appoint Australians to senior posts in his General Headquarters. Nevertheless, the partnership between Curtin and MacArthur proved beneficial for Australia between 1942 and 1944 as MacArthur was able to communicate Australian <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> to the US Government.|$|E

500|$|Small, {{independent}} resistance groups {{first appeared}} in 1941–42 but the first to co-ordinate with the Freedom Council was the Samsing Group, responsible for most operations from early 1943. The Samsing group, along with others in and around Aarhus, was dismantled in June 1944 when Grethe [...] "Thora" [...] Bartram turned her family and acquaintances over to German authorities. In response, <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> was sent to contacts in England and in October 1944 the Royal Air Force bombed the Gestapo headquarters successfully destroying archives and obstructing the ongoing investigation. The 5 Kolonne group was established with assistance from Holger Danske to restore a resistance movement in Aarhus along with the L-groups, tasked with assassinating collaborators. Resistance operations escalated from mid-1944 with most major sabotage operations and assassinations occurring in the period 1944–45. The growing resistance was countered with 19 Schalburgtage terror operations by the Peter group from August 1944, including large-scale fire bombings and murders. The increasingly destructive occupation was compounded when an ammunition barge exploded in 1944, destroying much of the harbour and damaging the inner city. On 5 May 1945 German forces in Denmark surrendered but during the transitional period fighting broke out in Aarhus between the resistance and German soldiers resulting in 22 dead. Order was restored {{by the end of}} the day and on 8 May the British Royal Dragoons entered the city.|$|E
