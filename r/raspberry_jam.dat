They are usually topped with strawberry jam, bilberry jam, hjortron jam, <b>raspberry</b> <b>jam,</b> bilberry and <b>raspberry</b> <b>jam,</b> sugar and butter, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.

40|$|Sucrose is {{the main}} sugar used in jams preparation; however his {{excessive}} consumption has been related to several diseases; therefore its replacement by alternative sweeteners is an attractive solution. Nonetheless, substitution of sucrose in jam’s preparation can cause changes in texture, structure, and flavor, making them less attractive to the consumers. Thus, {{the aim of this}} work was to develop strawberry, <b>raspberry,</b> and cherry <b>jams</b> with more adequate nutritional profile, maintaining their textural and flavor characteristics in comparison with the traditional formulation. Sucrose was replaced by fructose, sorbitol, or fructooligosaccharides (FOS), given the product different nutritional profiles: potential low glycemic index, reduced calories in the case of sorbitol and FOS, and enrichment with dietary fiber, in the case of FOS. After sensorial and rheological evaluation we found that the sweeteners used interfered, significantly, in the parameters measured. Fructose was the alternative sweetener yielding jams more similar to those of sucrose; however, the use of formulations containing fructose and FOS or sorbitol and FOS resulted in a 51 % to 68 % decrease of the energy value. Nevertheless, consumer sensorial tests are needed to evaluate, in a more consistent way, the use of these alternative sweeteners for jams production at industrial level...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports about}} the content of {{polyphenols}} and volatiles in fresh fruits of two sour cherry cultivars (Marasca and Oblačinska), some berry fruits (strawberry Maya, raspberry Willamette and wild blueberry) and the corresponding low sugar jams. Phenolic compounds (hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, flavan 3 -ols and flavonols) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Those found in the fruits were also found in the jams. Jams contained lower amounts of polyphenols than fresh fuits, but their overall retention in jams was relatively high. Among fruits, sour cherry Marasca had the highest level of polyphenols, while sour cherry Marasca <b>jam</b> and <b>raspberry</b> Willamette <b>jam</b> had the highest level of polyphenols among jams. The major flavonoid in all investigated fruits, except in sour cherry Oblačinska, was (–) -epicatechin. Sour cherry Marasca had the highest level of (–) -epicatechin (95. 75 mg/kg), and it also contained very high amounts of flavonols, derivatives of quercetin and kaempferol. Hydroxybenzoic acids (HBAs) were not found in sour cherries Marasca and Oblačinska, but were found in berry fruits and jams. Phenolic compound (+) -gallocatechin was found only in Marasca fruit and jam. Ellagic acid was found in the highest concentration in raspberry Willamette fruit and jam. Hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) were found in all the investigated fruits, {{with the exception of a}} derivative of ferulic acid, which was not found in strawberry. Derivatives of caffeic, p-coumaric and chlorogenic acids were found in all the investigated fruits, with chlorogenic acid being the most abundant, especially in sour cherry Marasca. Volatiles were determined by gas chromatography (GC) and expressed as the peak area of the identified compounds. All investigated volatiles of fresh fruit were also determined in the related jams with relatively high retention. Sour cherries Marasca and Oblačinska contained the same volatile compounds, but Marasca had higher level of total volatiles. The main volatile compound in both sour cherry cultivars was benzaldehyde (characteristic cherry aroma compound), which was followed by hexanal, 2 -hexenal, 2 -heptanone, linalool, nerol, and α-terpineol. Our results show that γ-decalactone and linalool were the most abundant volatile compounds in strawberry Maya and raspberry Willamette, respectively. The most abundant group of volatiles in wild bluberry was esters, and they were followed by terpenes, ethyl butanoate and linalool...|$|R

60|$|The trouble {{began at}} ten a.m. on January 6, when Mrs. Golding heard a great smash of crockery, an event 'most {{incident}} to maids'. The lady {{went into the}} kitchen, when plates began to fall from the dresser 'while she was there and nobody near them'. Then a clock tumbled down, so did a lantern, a pan of salt beef cracked, and a carpenter, Rowlidge, suggested that a recent addition of a room above had shaken {{the foundation of the}} house. Mrs. Golding rushed into the house of Mr. Gresham, her next neighbour, and fainted. Meanwhile Ann Robinson was 'mistress of herself, though china fall,' and seemed in no hurry to leave the threatened dwelling. The niece of Mrs. Golding, Mrs. Pain, was sent for to Mr. Gresham's, Mrs. Golding was bled, when, lo, 'the blood sprang out of the basin upon the floor, and the basin broke to pieces!' A bottle of rum, of sympathetic character, also burst. Many of Mrs. Golding's more fragile effects had been carried into Mr. Gresham's: the glasses and china first danced, and then fell off the side-board and broke. Mrs. Golding, 'her mind one confused chaos,' next sought refuge at Mr. Mayling's for three-quarters of an hour. Here nothing unusual occurred, but, at Mr. Gresham's (where Ann Robinson was packing the remains of her mistress's portable property) a 'mahogany waiter,' a quadrille box, a jar of pickles and a pot of <b>raspberry</b> <b>jam</b> shared the common doom. 'Their end was pieces.' Mrs. Pain now hospitably conveyed her aunt to her house at Rush Common, 'hoping all was over'. This was about two in the afternoon.|$|E

But she understood right well; remarked it must be bad for the health, and sat a while gravely reflecting on that picture of unwonted sorrows. I am sure it roused her pity, for it struck in her another thought always uppermost in the Marquesan bosom; and she began with a smiling sadness, and looking on me out of melancholy eyes, to lament the decease of her own people.

6000|$|When we had {{sufficiently}} enjoyed claret {{and politics}} below-stairs, the gentlemen {{went to the}} drawing-room to partake of coffee and the ladies' delightful conversation. We had heard previously the tinkling of the piano above, and the well-known sound {{of a couple of}} Miss Rosey's five songs. The two young ladies were engaged over an album at a side-table, when the males of the party arrived. The book contained a number of Clive's drawings made in the time of his very early youth for the amusement of his little cousins. Miss Ethel seemed to be very much pleased with these performances, which Miss Mackenzie likewise examined with great good-nature and satisfaction. So she did the views of Rome, Naples, Marble Hill in the county of Sussex, etc., in the same collection: so she did the Berlin cockatoo and spaniel which Mrs. Newcome was working in idle moments: so she did the [...] "Books of Beauty," [...] "Flowers of Loveliness," [...] and so forth. She thought the prints very sweet and pretty: she thought the poetry very pretty and sweet. Which did she like best, Mr. Niminy's [...] "Lines to a bunch of violets," [...] or Miss Piminy's [...] "Stanzas to a wreath of roses"? Miss Mackenzie was quite puzzled to say which of these masterpieces she preferred; she found them alike so pretty. She appealed, as in most cases, to mamma. [...] "How, my darling love, can I pretend to know?" [...] mamma says. [...] "I have been a soldier's wife, battling about the world. I have not had your advantages. I had no drawing-masters, nor music-masters as you have. You, dearest child, must instruct me in these things." [...] This poses Rosey: who prefers to have her opinions dealt out to her like her frocks, bonnets, handkerchiefs, her shoes and gloves, and the order thereof; the lumps of sugar for her tea, the proper quantity of <b>raspberry</b> <b>jam</b> for breakfast; who trusts for all supplies corporeal and spiritual to her mother. For her own part, Rosey is pleased with everything in nature. Does she love music? Oh, yes. Bellini and Donizetti? Oh, yes. Dancing? They had no dancing at grandmamma's, but she adores dancing, and Mr. Clive dances very well indeed. (A smile from Miss Ethel at this admission.) Does she like the country? Oh, she is so happy in the country! London? London is delightful, and so is the seaside. She does not really know which she likes best, London or the country, for mamma is not near her to decide, being engaged listening to Sir Brian, who is laying down the law to her, and smiling, smiling with all her might. In fact, Mr. Newcome says to Mr. Pendennis in his droll, humorous way, [...] "That woman grins like a Cheshire cat."
