5|$|The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in {{hospital}} and asks her {{to confess to}} burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses. Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. Ryan confronts Stacey at the hospital, shocked with her confession, refuses to acknowledge his daughter, and goes on his honeymoon with Janine. Peggy goes into the pub and looks around as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him. Her niece Ronnie (Samantha Womack) tells Peggy she is five months pregnant and asks Peggy not to leave as she is like a mother to her. Peggy tells Ronnie to give her <b>real</b> <b>mother,</b> Glenda (Glynis Barber), another chance.

Peggy gives her jewellery to Sam to sell so she has some money. Peggy speaks to Phil, accepting responsibility for making him {{the way he is}} and offering to help him get off the drugs. He says she needs him more than he needs her and that she suffocates him. Realising that he is right, Peggy asks the rest of her family to look after him, saying emotional goodbyes. Though Phil claims not to have meant what he said, Peggy says she has to leave for his sake. As she leaves the house, Phil begins to follow her, but she sends him back inside. She looks at the pub and walks out of Walford.|$|E
25|$|In the end, Poirot assembles {{everyone}} in the study. He tells them that Chevenix intended to disinherit Ruth {{if she did not}} marry Hugo Trent. However, it was too late, as she was already married to Lake. Poirot says that Ruth killed Chevenix, but Ms Lingard confesses in the murder. She is the <b>real</b> <b>mother</b> of Ruth and she killed Chevenix to prevent him from disinheriting her.|$|E

25|$|A man arrives from Corinth {{with the}} message that Oedipus's father has died. Oedipus, to the {{surprise}} of the messenger, is made ecstatic by this news, for it proves one half of the prophecy false, for now he can never kill his father. However, he still fears that he may somehow commit incest with his mother. The messenger, eager to ease Oedipus's mind, tells him not to worry, because Merope was not in fact his <b>real</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|E

Over a year later, Zoe and Kat argue about Zoe's decision {{to move away from}} Walford to live with her uncle Harry Slater (Michael Elphick). Kat tells Zoe she cannot go but Zoe walks out. Kat follows and blurts out that she is Zoe's <b>real</b> <b>mother.</b> She then explains that she fell pregnant at 13 after Harry raped her. Zoe is shell-shocked, and Kat slashes her wrists in despair. Zoe runs away, unable to take in all the recent revelations.|$|E
25|$|According to the Midrash, the {{two women}} were mother- and daughter-in-law, both of whom had borne sons and whose husbands had died. The lying daughter-in-law was obligated {{by the laws of}} Yibbum to marry her {{brother-in-law}} unless released from the arrangement through a formal ceremony. As her brother-in-law was the living child, she was required to marry him when he came of age or wait {{the same amount of time}} to be released and remarry. When Solomon suggested splitting the infant in half, the lying woman, wishing to escape the constraints of Yibbum in the eyes of God, agreed. Thus was Solomon able to know who the <b>real</b> <b>mother</b> was.|$|E
25|$|The Yongzheng Emperor {{ruled the}} Qing Empire for 13 years before dying {{suddenly}} in 1735 {{at the age}} of 56. Legend holds that he was assassinated by Lü Siniang, a daughter or granddaughter of Lü Liuliang, whose family was executed for literary crimes against the Qing government. Another theory was that Lü Siniang was the Yongzheng Emperor's lover, and the <b>real</b> <b>mother</b> of the Qianlong Emperor, but he refused to let her become the empress. It is generally accepted that he died while reading court documents, and it is likely that his death was the result elixir poisoning from an overdose of the elixir of immortality he was consuming in the belief that it would prolong his life.|$|E

5000|$|The {{children}} {{discover that}} Mrs. Quickly {{is just as}} cruel as they suspected when she breaks their <b>real</b> <b>mother's</b> rattle (the only thing they had left of her). When everybody is gathered for the marriage ceremony, they disturb the ceremony by pretending there are bees (mimicking the way Quickly told them to [...] "be-have"), chasing the guests, and throwing the pastries intended for the banquet at everyone present. Cedric understands {{they do not like}} the bride and, recognising that he does not like her either, joins in the commotion himself. Mrs. Quickly cancels the marriage and storms off in anger. This seems to mean that Adelaide's marriage deadline is missed, but Lily asks Evangeline whether she loves Cedric. She first denies, explaining that it would be inappropriate because of her station as maidservant, but then confirms she does. Cedric marries Evangeline the same day, satisfying Aunt Adelaide's conditions for maintaining his allowance; and Nanny McPhee (who is now beautiful), magically makes it snow, which transforms the wedding scene, and restores the children's <b>real</b> <b>mother's</b> rattle for them.|$|R
5|$|Another account {{mentions}} the Maha-matrikas (the great mothers), {{a group of}} the wives of six of the Saptarishis (7 great sages), who were accused of being Skanda's <b>real</b> <b>mothers</b> and thus abandoned by their husbands. They request Skanda to adopt them as his mothers. Skanda agrees and grants them two boons: to be worshipped as great goddesses and permission to torment children {{as long as they}} are younger than 16 years and then act as their protectors. These six goddesses as well as the Saptamatrikas are identified or associated with Vedic Krittikas, the constellation Pleiades.|$|R
25|$|The bullet {{which killed}} Chevenix hit the gong (as {{the door to}} the study was open), which made Susan think that she heard the first gong (dinner was usually served after the valet would strike the gong 2 times), and it was Ms Lingard who smashed the mirror and made the whole affair look like suicide. She blew a paper bag to fake a shot. Poirot claims to suspect Ruth because he {{suspected}} Ms Lingard would rescue her daughter and confess, and he had no evidence against Ms Lingard. After everyone leaves and Ms Lingard stays alone in the room, she asks Poirot not to tell Ruth that she is her <b>real</b> <b>mother.</b> Poirot agrees as Ms Lingard is terminally ill, and does not reveal anything to Ruth who wonders why Ms Lingard committed the murder.|$|E
25|$|The tomb was wrong. Munisai lived a {{good deal}} longer, later than 1590 possibly. Musashi, then, was born to Munisai's first wife, Yoshiko (daughter to Bessho Shigeharu, who {{formerly}} controlled Hirafuku village until he lost a battle in 1578 to Yamanaka Shikanosuke). Munisai divorced her after Musashi's birth, whereupon she decamped for her father's house, leaving Musashi with Munisai. Musashi grew up treating Munisai's second wife, Omasa (daughter to Lord Shinmen) as his mother. This second scenario is laid out in an entry to the Tasumi family's genealogy. The daughter of Bessho Shigeharu first married Hirata Muni and was divorced from him a few years later. After that she married Tasumi Masahisa. The second wife of Tasumi Masahisa {{was the mother of}} Miyamoto Musashi. Musashi's childhood name was Hirata Den. During his childhood, he went to Hirafuku to find his <b>real</b> <b>mother.</b> He moved in with the Tasumi family.|$|E
25|$|Louie De Palma (Danny DeVito)– Louie is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of the sitcom. The vain head dispatcher of the Sunshine Cab Company, Louie spends his time holding court inside the caged-in dispatch office at the garage bullying and arguing with the drivers. He not only lacks in morals, he is openly proud of his misdemeanors. Louie {{will do anything to}} benefit himself, from taking advantage of a drunken friend of his on, off girlfriend Zena Sherman (played by DeVito's real-life wife Rhea Perlman) to gambling with a young boy to stealing from the company to even spying on Elaine while she is changing (almost costing him his job). He lives with his mother (DeVito's <b>real</b> <b>mother,</b> Julia, in two episodes). On very rare occasions he helps his workers, as in the episode in which a cruel hairstylist (played by Ted Danson) gives Elaine a garish makeover just before a very important event, it is Louie who bolsters her confidence to confront him. In 1999, TV Guide ranked De Palma first on its list of the 50 greatest TV characters of all time.|$|E

25|$|While Genie {{lived with}} the Riglers her mother usually met with her once {{a week at a}} park or restaurant, and their {{relationship}} continued to grow stronger. Although the Riglers never expressed antipathy towards Genie's mother their efforts to be polite to her inadvertently came off as condescension, and years later Marilyn said she was uncomfortable acting as a mother to Genie in her house with Genie's <b>real</b> <b>mother</b> present. With the exception of Jay Shurley, who felt the other scientists did not treat her as an equal, Genie's mother did not get along well with the other researchers, some of whom disliked her due to her apathy during Genie's childhood. The scientists speculated Genie's mother gave them a mostly cool reception because they reminded her of her earlier inaction on behalf of her children, and David Rigler also thought she was in denial about Genie's condition and the hand she had in causing it. Curtiss wrote that Genie's mother often gave conflicting statements about her married life and Genie's childhood, seemingly saying what she thought people wanted to hear, which the research team believed was out of fear of reprobation or ostracism for telling the truth.|$|E

A phone call to the house is strangely cut off when Clarissa tells the caller that she is not Mrs. Brown but Mrs. Hailsham-Brown. Clarissa tells Sir Rowland that the house used to belong to a Mr. Sellon, a now-deceased antique dealer in Maidstone and the furnishings are his. His former trade means that enquiries are received about some of his furniture, including one for the desk that, unbeknown to her, Jeremy had been searching through earlier. Walking in on the conversation, Pippa tells the two that she has found out that the desk has a secret drawer and she shows it to them together with its contents: an envelope with three autographed papers inside with the signatures of Queen Victoria, John Ruskin and Robert Browning on them.|$|E

Alfie warns Kat {{to wait for the}} right time and make friends first, but Kat confides in Agnes's husband, Lance Byrne (Ian McElhinney), that her son was taken away from her in 1983 and she believes he is in Redwater. Lance tells Agnes this, and Agnes immediately says Kat should not be told the truth as it would unravel everything they have built. Kat visits the Byrnes' farm and talks to Andrew about his life, but then Lance warns him to give the Moons a wide berth. Kat then admits to Alfie that she is scared of seeing how disappointed her son would be in her.

500|$|Darren was {{initially}} characterised as a [...] "bad boy" [...] who has matured throughout his tenure. One of Darren's more notable storylines included his {{battle with a}} gambling addiction which led him to lose his share in The Dog in the Pond, be disowned by his father and have his family reject him. Darren later helped his father, Jack (Jimmy McKenna), to fake his own death {{as part of a}} scam, which drew comparisons to the John Darwin disappearance case. Other storylines have included a relationship with Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring), a [...] "shotgun" [...] marriage to Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) and a brief affair with his mother-in-law, Suzanne Ashworth (Suzanne Hall). More recently Darren's storylines have seen him form a relationship with Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) that [...] "came out of nowhere" [...] but was kept long term as the pairing was popular with the serial's audience. Pressure was then put on Darren and Nancy's relationship when Suzanne returned pregnant with Darren's twins, leading to Darren and Nancy splitting up when he became a father.
