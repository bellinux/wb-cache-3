25|$|The {{separate}} {{range and}} bearing receiver units could {{operate on a}} number of frequency bands. A common oscillator was used by both receivers, which was sent into the four-tube radio frequency (RF) section. The frequency of the oscillator could be switched between two broad bands, LF band from 54.5 to 66.7MHz, and the HF band from 66.7 to 84.0MHz. The receivers were then fine-tuned using conventional rotating iron cores, which were mechanically connected to tune both receivers from a single dial. To correct for slight differences in the two receivers, the output of one of the cores could be adjusted by sliding a copper ring along post on the core. To ensure that the signal would not reflect off of one of the RF stages, the range receiver added a buffer circuit at the end of <b>RF</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E

2500|$|To {{suppress}} the unwanted image, the tuning of the <b>RF</b> <b>stage</b> and the LO {{may need to}} [...] "track" [...] each other. In some cases, a narrow-band receiver can have a fixed tuned RF amplifier. In that case, only the local oscillator frequency is changed. In most cases, a receiver's input band is wider than its IF center frequency. For example, a typical AM broadcast band receiver covers 510kHz to 1655kHz (a roughly 1160kHz input band) with a 455kHz IF frequency; an FM broadcast band receiver covers 88MHz to 108MHz band with a 10.7MHz IF frequency. In that situation, the RF amplifier must be tuned so the IF amplifier does not see two stations at the same time. If the AM broadcast band receiver LO were set at 1200kHz, it would see stations at both 745kHz (1200455kHz) and 1655kHz. Consequently, the <b>RF</b> <b>stage</b> must be designed so that any stations that are twice the IF frequency away are significantly attenuated. The tracking {{can be done with}} a multi-section variable capacitor or some varactors driven by a common control voltage. An RF amplifier may have tuned circuits at both its input and its output, so three or more tuned circuits may be tracked. In practice, the RF and LO frequencies need to track closely but not perfectly.|$|E

50|$|A {{drawback}} {{of early}} vacuum tube designs was that, when the circuit was adjusted to oscillate, it could {{operate as a}} transmitter, radiating an RF signal from its antenna at power levels as high as one watt. So it often caused interference to nearby receivers.

50|$|If a {{stage in}} a {{transmitter}} is unstable {{and is able to}} oscillate then it can start to generate RF at either a frequency close to the operating frequency or at a very different frequency.

A major defect of the TRF receiver was that, due to the high interelectrode capacitance of early triode vacuum tubes, feedback within the <b>RF</b> amplifier <b>stages</b> gave them a tendency to oscillate, creating unwanted radio frequency alternating currents. These parasitic oscillations mixed with the carrier wave in the detector, creating heterodynes (beat notes) in the audio frequency range, which were heard as annoying whistles and howls from the speaker.|$|R
