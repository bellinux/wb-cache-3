40|$|Some {{techniques}} and instruments like stereomicroscopy and confocal microscopy used for observing neural cells are too complicated and dependent on preparation and cell fixation methods. This may question {{the results of}} these methods. Though, we have used scanning electron microscopy on replicated specimens to observe p 19 neural cells and their cellular extensions. This manuscript has shown the feasibility of using replica (indirect) method instead of direct methods for observing morphological characteristics of this high sensitive cell line. As neural cells are very sensitive to fixation solutions and processes, we have used <b>replica</b> <b>mode</b> and observed neural cells with a novel indirect method. We have used <b>replica</b> <b>mode</b> in this study to indirectly and noninvasively evaluate the state of p 19 neural cells and their cellular extensions.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{structural}} dynamics, rotationally periodic structures (RPS) {{have always been}} an area of interest for engineers and scientists. RPS is found in almost all industries and could be as large as jet turbines to as small as hard disk drives. We come across with RPS on daily routine like washing machine tub, small gears in home appliances and brakes in automobile etc. With such an influence in our life, an RPS dynamic response to the environment is crucial to keep them working and hence {{is the focus of}} the thesis. The research involves three major responses on rotationally periodic structures (RPS) namely vibration, thermal and shock. Hard disk drives and integrally bladed rotors (IBR) has been selected as research models. On vibratory response in rotationally periodic structures, effects on structural designs and free vibrations of integrated bladed rotor (IBR) have been investigated in this research. The migration of natural frequencies is characterized through parametric studies considering changes in blade angle and blade thickness of an underlying uniform axis-symmetric rotor. Recurring coupled repeated doublet <b>modes,</b> defined as <b>replica</b> <b>modes,</b> have been observed in this study by characterizing blade vibrations in-phase or out-of-phase to disk vibrations. Veering and clustering of replica modes’ natural frequencies are observed with respect to the blade design parameters. Existence of <b>replica</b> <b>modes</b> has been verified via experimental studies. Fourier content for the low frequency replica component is found to be sensitive and tuneable to blade angle design. For the thermal response of RPS, structural thermal analysis of spindle disk assembly used in hard disk drives (HDDs) was adopted. With the view toward understanding the underlying physics and to minimize the corresponding repeatable run-out (RRO) of track following position error signal (PES) in high track per inch (TPI) magnetic disk drives, analytical representations of thermal expansion mismatch between disk and spindle hub structure formulated in form of operators and finite element analysis (FEA) are employed. Parametric studies with analysis taken at different operational temperatures suggested that RRO can be minimized significantly when location of spindle notch is properly located. RRO harmonics resulted from the thermal expansion mismatch and structure misalignments are studied and concluded with simple algebraic expression related to number of fasteners used in the disk-spindle assembly. On shock response of RPS, head gimbal assembly (HGA) in HDD was analysed. Experimental observation of de-bonding phenomena between head gimbal assembly (HGA) and suspension for a commercial 3. 5 -inch enterprise HDD under non-operational 250 G shock test was performed. In this research the experimental observation and numerical finite element studies were conducted to understand the effect on the mechanical failure of HGA when it is subjected to non-operational shock in the parked position on the ramp. Different design modifications were adapted to withstand shock waves. It was observed that by changing flexure angle in HGA, shock stress can be reduced. FEA simulation results have been presented to verify the findings. The research findings in this thesis can be implemented in the industry where RPS has been widely used, as for example the new <b>replica</b> <b>modes</b> discovery in bladed rotors can also been applied on small scales like as on hard drive, where no. of blades can be replaced by no. of fasteners and the spinning hard drive will be benefited by studying its vibrations with concentration on <b>replica</b> <b>modes.</b> Furthermore, the serendipitous finding of HDD platters expansion under thermal stress can be beneficial in actually storing more data per inch as it has been recently used in TAMR (thermally assisted magnetic recording) technology. Gears, brakes, washing machines to name a few can get supported from the findings in the thesis where controlling vibrations, shock and heat is crucial...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that electron-phonon interaction in quantum dots embedded in one-dimensional systems leads to pronounced, non-Markovian decoherence of optical transitions. The experiments we present {{focus on the}} lineshape of photoluminescence from low-temperature axially localized carbon nanotube excitons. The independent boson model that we use to model the phonon interactions reproduces with very high accuracy the broad and asymmetric emission lines and the weak red-detuned radial breathing <b>mode</b> <b>replicas</b> observed in the experiments. The intrinsic phonon-induced pure-dephasing of the zero-phonon line is two orders of magnitude larger than the lifetime broadening and is {{a hallmark of the}} reduced dimensionality of the phonon bath. The non-Markovian nature of this decoherence mechanism may have adverse consequences for applications of one-dimensional systems in quantum information processing. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMatched-Mode {{processing}} (MMP) is {{an alternative}} to Matched-Field processing(MFP) that explicitly uses the modal description of the acoustic field to estimate sourceposition and/or oceanic environmental parameters. MMP involves two steps, first themodes are separated, and then they are compared to <b>mode</b> <b>replicas</b> in order to infer thedesired parameter values. If the source emits a short time broadband signal, modalseparation can be achieved with a single hydrophone using a time-frequency analysis toolcalled warping. Within this framework, a method that allows to predict MMP performanceis provided: the Ziv-Zakai bound is derived, which gives a bound on the achievableperformance that is much tighter than the Cramer-Rao bound. The results are then used toperform quantitative performance analyses of the single receiver MMP source localizationproblem. Particularly, performance with respect to noise is examined for incoherentMMP...|$|R
40|$|In {{distributed}} systems that use active replication to achieve robustness, {{it is important}} to efficiently enforce consistency among <b>replicas.</b> The nonblocking <b>mode</b> helps to speed up system execution. Unfortunately, this benefit comes at the expense of introducing decision conflicts when the replicas form a single logical token ring and client requests are processed in sequence following the ring. In order to reach an agreement regarding request total orders, this paper proposes a forward-confirmation (FC) approach to identify and solve decision conflicts when up to k successive replicas fail simultaneously. The FC approach can obtain consistent decisions among replicas. An implementation of the FC approach, namely, the queueing method, is proposed. Test results show that our protocol in the nonblocking mode outperforms the Totem protocol regarding delays and failure recovery...|$|R
