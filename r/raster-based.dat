25|$|On {{the stock}} Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), {{as well as}} on most 8-bit arcade hardware, {{platform}} games generally only scroll in one direction at a time, usually horizontally. This means designers must use a very narrow level progression, or break levels up into subareas that scrolled either horizontally or vertically, {{as was the case in}} Metroid and Mega Man — or effectively upgrade the system using memory management controller chips, embedded into each relevant cartridge. One of the first platform games to scroll in all four directions freely and follow the on-screen character's movement is in a vector game called Major Havoc, which comprises a number of mini-games, including a simple platformer, a shoot 'em up sequence, a landing sequence, and a Breakout clone. One of the first <b>raster-based</b> platform games to scroll fluidly in all directions in this manner is the previously mentioned 1984 classic, Legend of Kage.|$|E
50|$|Difficulty {{integrating}} <b>raster-based</b> applications. With some effort, {{this could}} be accomplished by texturing the entire <b>raster-based</b> application to a vector-based plane (though the disadvantages of <b>raster-based</b> graphics would still stand).|$|E
5000|$|Since current 3D Graphics {{are usually}} vector-based, rather than <b>raster-based,</b> vector-based {{graphical}} user interfaces would be suitable for 3D {{graphical user interfaces}}. This is because <b>raster-based</b> 3D models take up {{an enormous amount of}} memory, as they are stored and displayed using voxels. Current operating systems such as Windows Vista, Mac OS X, and UNIX-based operating systems (including Linux) have enjoyed much benefit from using 3D graphical user interfaces. In Windows Vista, for example, Flip3D textures each window to a 3D plane based on vector graphics. Even though the window itself is still <b>raster-based,</b> the plane onto which it is textured is vector-based. As a result, the windows, when rotated, appear flat. In Linux desktops, Compiz Fusion can texture each <b>raster-based</b> workspace onto a 3D vector-based cube. As operating systems evolve, eventually the entire window would be made from 3D vector graphics, so that when rotated, it does not appear [...] "flat". Also, advanced lighting may make 3D graphical user interfaces more aesthetically pleasing.|$|E
50|$|Slower rendering, greater system requirements. Because today's {{monitors}} display only <b>raster-based</b> information, {{the vector}} information {{would have to}} be rasterized (and optionally anti-aliased) before appearing.|$|E

50|$|<b>Raster-based</b> image editors, such as Painter, Photoshop, Paint.NET, MS Paint, and GIMP, {{revolve around}} editing pixels, unlike vector-based image editors, such as Xfig, CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, or Inkscape, which revolve around editing lines and shapes (vectors). When an image is {{rendered}} in a <b>raster-based</b> image editor, {{the image is}} composed of millions of pixels. At its core, a raster image editor works by manipulating each individual pixel. Most pixel-based image editors work using the RGB color model, but some also allow the use of other color models such as the CMYK color model.|$|E
5000|$|Some vector editors support animation, {{while others}} (e.g. Adobe Flash, Animatron or Synfig Studio) are {{specifically}} geared towards producing animated graphics. Generally, vector graphics are {{more suitable for}} animation, though there are <b>raster-based</b> animation tools as well.|$|E
5000|$|... 2D {{computer}} graphics {{started in the}} 1950s, based on vector graphics devices. These were largely supplanted by <b>raster-based</b> devices in the following decades. The PostScript language and the X Window System protocol were landmark developments in the field.|$|E
50|$|Corel Painter is a <b>raster-based</b> digital art {{application}} {{created to}} simulate as accurately as possible the appearance {{and behavior of}} traditional media associated with drawing, painting, and printmaking. It {{is intended to be}} used in real-time by professional digital artists as a functional creative tool.|$|E
50|$|GeoMod is a <b>raster-based</b> land change {{modeling}} {{tool in the}} GIS software TerrSet that simulates the gain or {{the loss of a}} land category over a specified time interval. The model only simulates the spatial allocation of change between two land categories either forwards or backwards in time.|$|E
50|$|Traps can {{be applied}} at several stages in the digital workflow, using one of two {{trapping}} technologies: vector-based and <b>raster-based.</b> The right choice {{will depend on the}} type of products (packaging applications including flexo-printing have other requirements than commercial printing on offset systems) and the degree of interactivity or automation that is wanted.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{computer}} graphics card displays almost overwhelmingly use raster techniques, dividing the screen into a rectangular grid of pixels, {{due to the}} relatively low cost of <b>raster-based</b> video hardware as compared with vector graphic hardware. Most graphic hardware has internal support for blitting operations or sprite drawing. A co-processor dedicated to blitting {{is known as a}} Blitter chip.|$|E
50|$|FlipBook {{supports}} scanning physical drawings with a TWAIN-compliant scanner or webcam, {{or direct}} digital input via a Wacom tablet. In either case, the internal format is <b>raster-based,</b> not vector-based. Inbetweening is done using onion skinning. Each frame must be drawn separately; FlipBook intentionally {{does not support}} skeletal animation or morph target animation, as these {{are not part of}} the traditional animator's toolkit.|$|E
50|$|SVG is {{an earlier}} {{standard}} for drawing shapes in browsers. However, unlike canvas, which is <b>raster-based,</b> SVG is vector-based, i.e., each drawn shape is remembered {{as an object}} in a scene graph or Document Object Model, which is subsequently rendered to a bitmap. This means that if attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the scene.|$|E
5000|$|An Antics [...] "Scene" [...] {{can be made}} up of {{any number}} of [...] "Drawings", {{consisting}} of any number of individual [...] "Cels".

A wide range of tools is included for creating drawings, and in almost any style.|$|E
5000|$|Flash {{is able to}} {{integrate}} bitmaps and other <b>raster-based</b> art, as well as video, though most Flash films are created using only vector-based drawings, which often result in a somewhat clean graphic appearance. Some hallmarks of poorly produced Flash animation are jerky natural movements (seen in walk-cycles and gestures), auto-tweened character movements, lip-sync without interpolation, and abrupt changes from front to profile view.|$|E
50|$|The USGS DEM {{standard}} is a geospatial file format {{developed by the}} United States Geological Survey for storing a <b>raster-based</b> digital elevation model. It is an open standard, and is used throughout the world. It has been superseded by the USGS's own SDTS format but the format remains popular due to large numbers of legacy files, self-containment, relatively simple field structure and broad, mature software support.|$|E
50|$|The Hewlett-Packard Raster Transfer Language (HP RTL) is {{a subset}} of the Printer Command Language (PCL) language. It is used to embed true raster images (bitmaps) into plotter files. Modern {{plotters}} (like HP DesignJets) are raster devices, so they need a <b>raster-based</b> language. For backward compatibility they also support the HP-GL/2 (formerly HP-GL) vector language, so the HP RTL language is designed for mixing with the HP-GL/2 language.|$|E
5000|$|Components of 3D city {{models are}} encoded by common file and {{exchange}} formats for 2D <b>raster-based</b> GIS data (e.g., GeoTIFF), 2D vector-based GIS data (e.g., AutoCAD DXF), 3D models (e.g., [...]3DS, [...]OBJ), and 3D scenes (e.g., Collada, Keyhole Markup Language) such as supported by CAD, GIS, and computer graphics tools and systems. All {{components of a}} 3D city model have to {{be transformed into a}} common geographic coordinate system.|$|E
50|$|All modern {{moving image}} capture systems either use a {{mechanical}} or an electronic shutter. Shutter allows the image {{for a single}} frame to be integrated over a shorter period of time than the image change period. Another important function of the shutter in <b>raster-based</b> systems {{is to make sure}} that the part of frame scanned first (e.g. the topmost part) contains image of the scene integrated over exactly the same period of time as the part of frame scanned last.|$|E
50|$|The digital {{elevation}} model (DEM) is a <b>raster-based</b> digital dataset of the topography (hypsometry and/or bathymetry) of {{all or part of}} the Earth (or a telluric planet). The pixels of the dataset are each assigned an elevation value, and a header portion of the dataset defines the area of coverage, the units each pixel covers, and the units of elevation (and the zero-point). DEMs may be derived from existing paper maps and survey data, or they may be generated from new satellite or other remotely sensed radar or sonar data.|$|E

Adobe Photoshop (a <b>raster-based</b> program for photo editing) and Adobe Illustrator (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed raster images and vector graphics in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled {{in one of the}} major page layout programs, including Adobe InDesign. Graphic designers are expected to be proficient in these programs.|$|E

50|$|The {{cathode ray}} tube is a Samsung model 240RB40 {{monochrome}} unit measuring 9 × 11 inches, displaying a picture of 240 mm diagonal; it is an off-the-shelf picture tube manufactured for small black/white television sets. The brightness of the CRT is controlled using a circular knob {{on the back of}} the display. A vector CRT display such as the one in the Vectrex does not require a special tube, and differs from standard <b>raster-based</b> television sets only in the control circuits. Rather than use sawtooth waves to direct the internal electron beam in a raster pattern, computer-controlled integrators feed linear amplifiers to drive the deflection yoke. This yoke has similar, if not identical inductances, unlike a TV deflection yoke. The yoke uses a standard TV core. The high-voltage transformer also uses a standard core and bobbin. There is special circuitry to turn off the electron beam if the vector generator stops or fails. This prevents burning of the screen's phosphors. This design is a great deal smaller than the electronics found in the free-standing, full-sized Asteroids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Raster-based</b> stacked {{surfaces}} {{depict the}} surface of each buried geologic unit, and can accommodate data on lateral variations of physical properties. In this example from Soller and others (1999), the upper surface of each buried geologic unit was represented in raster format as an ArcInfo Grid file. The middle grid is the uppermost surface of an economically important aquifer, the Mahomet Sand, which fills a pre- and inter-glacial valley carved into the bedrock surface. Each geologic unit in raster format can be managed in the data model, in a manner not dissimilar from that shown for the stack-unit map. The Mahomet Sand is continuous in this area, and represents one occurrence of this unit in the data model. Each raster, or pixel, on the Mahomet Sand surface has a set of map coordinates that are recorded in a GIS (in the data model bin that is labeled “Pixel coordinates”, which is the raster corollary of the “Geometry” bin for vector map data). Each pixel can have {{a unique set of}} descriptive information, such as surface elevation, unit thickness, lithology, transmissivity, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Vector-based GIS is {{typically}} related to operations such as map overlay (combining {{two or more}} maps or map layers according to predefined rules), simple buffering (identifying regions of a map within a specified distance {{of one or more}} features, such as towns, roads or rivers) and similar basic operations. This reflects (and is reflected in) {{the use of the term}} spatial analysis within the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) “simple feature specifications”. For <b>raster-based</b> GIS, widely used in the environmental sciences and remote sensing, th{{is typically}} means a range of actions applied to the grid cells of one or more maps (or images) often involving filtering and/or algebraic operations (map algebra). These techniques involve processing one or more raster layers according to simple rules resulting in a new map layer, for example replacing each cell value with some combination of its neighbours’ values, or computing the sum or difference of specific attribute values for each grid cell in two matching raster datasets. Descriptive statistics, such as cell counts, means, variances, maxima, minima, cumulative values, frequencies and a number of other measures and distance computations are also often included in this generic term spatial analysis. Spatial analysis includes a large variety of statistical techniques (descriptive, exploratory, and explanatory statistics) that apply to data that vary spatially and which can vary over time. Some more advanced statistical techniques include Getis-ord Gi* or Anselin Local Moran's I which are used to determine clustering patterns of spatially referenced data.|$|E
30|$|In this package, we also {{provided}} three <b>raster-based</b> functions, fwiRaster, hffmcRaster, and fbpRaster to satisfy users who have inputs in raster maps; this saves users from converting raster maps to point data (tabular data format). Data conversions usually consume {{significant amount of}} computation time and require extra efforts in data preparation. Using functions provided by the raster package (Hijmans 2014), the three <b>raster-based</b> cffdrs functions are not only easy to use, but outputs are also easy to visualize because of the plot function inherited from the raster package. Although the general calculation method is similar, {{the design of the}} two <b>raster-based</b> FWI system functions is indeed different from their data.frame-based counterparts, where the <b>raster-based</b> functions process data for only one single time step.|$|E
40|$|A new {{paradigm}} for investigating the environment consequences of urban texture is proposed.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{parallel}} geocomputation based on raster data is constantly increasing {{with the increase}} of the volume of raster data for applications and the complexity of geocomputation processing. The difficulty of parallel programming and the poor portability of parallel programs between different parallel computing platforms greatly limit the development and application of parallel <b>raster-based</b> geocomputation algorithms. A strategy that hides the parallel details from the developer of <b>raster-based</b> geocomputation algorithms provides a promising way towards solving this problem. However, existing parallel <b>raster-based</b> libraries cannot solve the problem of the poor portability of parallel programs. This paper presents such a strategy to overcome the poor portability, along with a set of parallel <b>raster-based</b> geocomputation operators (PaRGO) designed and implemented under this strategy. The developed operators are compatible with three popular types of parallel computing platforms: graphics processing unit supported by compute unified device architecture, Beowulf cluster supported by message passing interface (MPI), and symmetrical multiprocessing cluster supported by MPI and open multiprocessing, which make the details of the parallel programming and the parallel hardware architecture transparent to users. By using PaRGO in a style similar to sequential program coding, geocomputation developers can quickly develop parallel <b>raster-based</b> geocomputation algorithms compatible with three popular parallel computing platforms. Practical applications in implementing two algorithms for digital terrain analysis show the effectiveness of PaRGO...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{integrating}} fuzzy clustering theory with <b>raster-based</b> GIS for zonal analysis. A new approach, named the 'Usher's Approach ' (UshA), is proposed to provide {{a solution to the}} problem. Characterised by its simplicity, yet very practical, this approach has three main advantages: i) it increases the applicability of fuzzy clustering theory in <b>raster-based</b> GIS; ii) it improves the efficiency of data processing and iii) increases overall accuracy of the modeling result...|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{technique is}} described {{in the context of}} <b>raster-based</b> DEMs, the prevalent representation of DEMs for environmental and geomorphological applications. Since the Eqs. (1) and (2) are general, the method could be adapted for other terrain representations such as point clouds. However, GIS software typically lacks the ability to manipulate large point clouds {{in a way that would}} match the efficiency and variability in processing functionality of raster representation [25]. The presented <b>raster-based</b> solution can be therefore implemented efficiently in any GIS software with raster support.|$|E
40|$|The Earth’s {{surface is}} uneven, and {{conventional}} area calculation methods {{are based on}} the assumption that the projection plane area can be obtained without considering the actual undulation of the Earth’s surface and by simplifying the Earth’s shape to be a standard ellipsoid. However, the true surface area is important for investigating and evaluating land resources. In this study, the authors propose a new method based on an efficient vector-raster overlay algorithm (VROA-based method) to calculate the surface areas of irregularly shaped land use patches. In this method, a surface area raster file is first generated based on the <b>raster-based</b> digital elevation model (<b>raster-based</b> DEM). Then, a vector-raster overlay algorithm (VROA) is used that considers the precise clipping of raster cells using the vector polygon boundary. Xiantao City, Luotian County, and the Shennongjia Forestry District, which are representative of a plain landform, a hilly topography, and a mountain landscape, respectively, are selected to calculate the surface area. Compared with a traditional method based on triangulated irregular networks (TIN-based method), our method significantly reduces the processing time. In addition, our method effectively improves the accuracy compared with another traditional method based on <b>raster-based</b> DEM (<b>raster-based</b> method). Therefore, the method satisfies the requirements of large-scale engineering applications...|$|E

The <b>raster-based</b> GIS format of the VICAR/IBIS software system allows simple and rapid tabulation of areas, and facilitates the selection of random locations for ground sampling. Algorithms that simplify the complex spatial pattern of <b>raster-based</b> information, and convert raster format data to strings of coordinate vectors, provide a link to conventional vector-based geographic information systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Inequalities in {{geographic}} {{access to}} health care result from the configuration of facilities, population distribution, and the transportation infrastructure. In recent accessibility studies, the traditional distance measure (Euclidean) has been replaced with more plausible measures such as travel distance or time. Both network and <b>raster-based</b> methods are often utilized for estimating travel time in a Geographic Information System. Therefore, exploring the differences in the underlying data models and associated methods and their impact on geographic accessibility estimates is warranted. Methods We examine the assumptions present in population-based travel time models. Conceptual and practical differences between raster and network data models are reviewed, along with methodological implications for service area estimates. Our case study investigates Limited Access Areas defined by Michigan’s Certificate of Need (CON) Program. Geographic accessibility is calculated by identifying the number of people residing more than 30 minutes from an acute care hospital. Both network and <b>raster-based</b> methods are implemented and their results are compared. We also examine sensitivity to changes in travel speed settings and population assignment. Results In both methods, the areas identified as having limited accessibility were similar in their location, configuration, and shape. However, the number of people identified as having limited accessibility varied substantially between methods. Over all permutations, the <b>raster-based</b> method identified more area and people with limited accessibility. The <b>raster-based</b> method was more sensitive to travel speed settings, while the network-based method was more sensitive to the specific population assignment method employed in Michigan. Conclusions Differences between the underlying data models help to explain the variation in results between raster and network-based methods. Considering that the choice of data model/method may substantially alter the outcomes of a geographic accessibility analysis, we advise researchers to use caution in model selection. For policy, we recommend that Michigan adopt the network-based method or reevaluate the travel speed assignment rule in the <b>raster-based</b> method. Additionally, we recommend that the state revisit the population assignment method. </p...|$|E

40|$|The cost of {{transporting}} {{forest products}} from harvest site to processing facility is a critical indicator of timber project feasibility. In order to accurately assess these timber haul costs, least-cost travel-time estimates among the site and the facility can be estimated using vector- or <b>raster-based</b> GIS methods. This study explores the applicability of both the raster- and vector-techniques within a variety of landscapes, including forested areas where comprehensive transportation data is limited. A comparison between the travel-time estimates derived from both methods was performed on three study sites using real-world data. The comparison also tested the effect of resolution on the reliability of <b>raster-based</b> calculations.
