40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a <b>Reverse</b> <b>Frame</b> Selection (RFS) {{scheme based on}} dynamic {{programming}} to solve for the problem of video streaming over VBR channels. In particular, we first consider forward frame selection (FFS) for video streaming over CBR channels. We propose to discard non-optimal states in FFS to reduce the computational cost of dynamic programming. Then {{we find that the}} problem can also be solved by RFS with one additional benefit of finding all the optimal results for different preloads in one round. Furthermore, we extend RFS for video streaming over VBR channels where we do not know when and how the channel is going to change in the future. The major advantage of our proposed scheme is that we only need to run RFS several times, and the obtained results can be applied to any type of VBR channels with bandwidth changes occurring at any time. Preliminary results show the good performance of our proposed scheme. I...|$|E
40|$|Time-reversed masker {{processed}} {{from the}} target speech, which is different from other maskers because of its unsteadiness, has the highest masking efficiency. For time and economical reason, other than subjective measurement, appropriate objective measurements of speech intelligibility for speech masked by time reversed masker processed {{from the target}} speech should be considered. Four objective evaluation methods are analyzed in this paper to find which of them has the highest correlation with speech intelligibility of speech masked by time-reversed masker processed from the target speech in open-plan offices. Results showed that although STI has high correlation with speech intelligibility for masking speech by steady noise, it cannot represent the subjective speech intelligibility very well for masking speech by time reversed signal. A Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI), Modified normalized covariance method (mNCM) and Perceptually Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) all has high efficiency to predict speech intelligibility of speech masked by time-reversed masker processed from the target speech. We further applied STOI to investigate the effect of two parameters (<b>reversed</b> <b>frame</b> length and Target-to-Masker Ratio) in this masker on speech intelligibility. The experiment results showed that <b>reversed</b> <b>frame</b> length between 120 ms and 240 ms and Target-to-Masker Ratio lower than - 5 dB will lead to poor speech intelligibility...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} optimal frame selection algorithms based on dynamic programming for deliv-ering stored VBR video under both bandwidth and buffer size constraints. Our {{objective is to}} find a feasible set of frames that can maximize the video’s accumulated motion values without violating any constraint. It is well known that dynamic programming has high complexity. In this research, we propose to eliminate non-optimal intermediate frame states, which can effectively reduce the complexity of dynamic program-ming. Moreover, we propose a <b>reverse</b> <b>frame</b> selection (RFS) algorithm, where the selection starts from the last frame and ends at the first frame. Compared with the conventional dynamic programming based forward frame selection, the RFS is able to find all the optimal results for different preloads in one round. We further extend the RFS scheme {{to solve the problem of}} frame selection for VBR channels. In particular, we first perform the RFS algorithm offline, and the complexity is modest and scalable with the aids of frame stuffing and non-optimal state elimination. During online streaming, we only need to retrieve the optimal frame selection path from the pre-generated offline results, and it can be applied to any VBR channels as long as the VBR channels can be modelled as piecewise CBR channels. Experimental results show good performance of our proposed algorithms...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that observers use learned object motion to recognize objects. For instance, {{studies have shown that}} reversing the learned direction in which a rigid object rotated in depth impaired recognition accuracy. This motion reversal can be achieved by playing animation sequences of moving objects in <b>reverse</b> <b>frame</b> order. In the current study, we used this sequence-reversal manipulation to investigate whether observers encode the motion of dynamic objects in visual memory, and whether such dynamic representations are encoded {{in a way that is}} dependent on the viewing conditions. Participants first learned dynamic novel objects, presented as animation sequences. Following learning, they were then tested on their ability to recognize these learned objects when their animation sequence was shown in the same sequence order as during learning or in the reverse sequence order. In Experiment 1, we found that non-rigid motion contributed to recognition performance; that is, sequence-reversal decreased sensitivity across different tasks. In subsequent experiments, we tested the recognition of non-rigidly deforming (Experiment 2) and rigidly rotating (Experiment 3) objects across novel viewpoints. Recognition performance was affected by viewpoint changes for both experiments. Learned non-rigid motion continued to contribute to recognition performance and this benefit was the same across all viewpoint changes. By comparison, learned rigid motion did not contribute to recognition performance. These results suggest that non-rigid motion provides a source of information for recognizing dynamic objects, which is not affected by changes to viewpoint...|$|E

40|$|Speech reading enhances {{auditory}} {{perception in}} noise. One {{means by which}} this perceptual facilitation comes about is through information from visual networks reinforcing the encoding of the congruent speech signal by ignoring interfering acoustic signals. We tested this hypothesis neurophysiologically by acquiring EEG while individuals listened to words with a fixed portion of each word replaced by white noise. Congruent (meaningful) or incongruent (<b>reversed</b> <b>frames)</b> mouth movements accompanied the words. Individuals judged whether they heard the words as continuous (illusion) or interrupted (illusion failure) through the noise. We hypothesized that congruent, as opposed to incongruent, mouth movements should further enhance illusory perception by suppressing the auditory cortex’s response to interruption onsets and offsets. Indeed, {{we found that the}} N 1 auditory evoked potential (AEP) to noise onsets and offsets was reduced when individuals experienced the illusion during congruent, but not incongruent, audiovisual streams. This N 1 inhibitory effect was most prominent at noise offsets, suggesting that visual influences on auditory perception are instigated to a greater extent during noisy periods. These findings suggest that visual context due to speech-reading disengages (inhibits) neural processes associated with interfering sounds (e. g., noisy interruptions) during speech perception...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFacial {{movement}} conveys {{important information}} for social interactions, yet its neural processing is poorly understood. Computational models propose that shape- and temporal sequence sensitive mechanisms interact in processing dynamic faces. While face processing regions {{are known to}} respond to facial movement, their sensitivity to particular temporal sequences has barely been studied. Here we used fMRI to examine the sensitivity of human face-processing regions to two aspects of directionality in facial movement trajectories. We presented genuine movie recordings of increasing and decreasing fear expressions, each of which were played in natural or <b>reversed</b> <b>frame</b> order. This two-by-two factorial design matched low-level visual properties, static content and motion energy within each factor, emotion-direction (increasing or decreasing emotion) and timeline (natural versus artificial). The results showed sensitivity for emotion-direction in FFA, which was timeline-dependent as it only occurred within the natural frame order, and sensitivity to timeline in the STS, which was emotion-direction-dependent as it only occurred for decreased fear. The occipital face area (OFA) was sensitive to the factor timeline. These findings reveal interacting temporal sequence sensitive mechanisms that are responsive to both ecological meaning and to prototypical unfolding of facial dynamics. These mechanisms are temporally directional, provide socially relevant information regarding emotional state or naturalness of behavior, and agree with predictions from modeling and predictive coding theory...|$|R

Participants also completed a survey assessing intuitive and quantitative risk perceptions, risky intentions and behaviors, sensation seeking, behavioral inhibition, and behavioral activation. Intuitive thinking about risk was correlated with perceived global risks of sex and negatively correlated with perceived global benefits of having sex, intentions to have sex, total sexual partners, and sensation seeking, while quantitative risk assessment was correlated with total sexual partners. This suggests that qualitative representations of risky situations are protective, while quantitative thinking supports risk-taking, findings which have potential policy implications for risk reduction in adolescents.

40|$|Risky {{decision}} making, and how {{it changes}} over the lifespan, is important for theory and public policy. Studies examining decision making from childhood through adolescence on to adulthood have rarely examined choice on the same task. However, this is crucial in order to fully understand the factors that affect decisions through development and to make defensible comparisons. A framing task was administered to groups of 2 nd graders (n = 31), adolescents (n = 35), and adults (n = 41). Of interest is how factors affected choices between a sure option and an option that involved risk. In addition to choices, ratings were elicited on a 7 -point smiley-face scale to indicate degree of preference. Factors that were examined include frame (gain, loss), risk (. 5,. 67, and. 75), reward magnitude ($ 5, $ 20, and $ 150), induced and measured mood of the decision maker (positive, neutral, or negative), and the decision makers' optimism. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that participants chose the gamble option more when options were presented as losses versus when they were presented as gains (a standard framing pattern). Overall, participants chose the gamble most at the lowest risk level (defined as the probability of the bad outcome in the gamble), and chose the gamble less often as the reward magnitude increased. This effect was qualified by a reward magnitude by age group interaction. The decreasing trend in choosing the gamble was found only for adults and adolescents. The decrease in choices of the gamble as magnitude differences increased (favoring the gamble) is further evidence for fuzzy-trace theory's explanation that standard framing results from gist-based processing in adults. Children's opposite trend, favoring larger outcomes in the gamble, is consistent with fuzzy-trace theory's developmental prediction that younger subjects would be more verbatim processors. Negative mood was found to increase verbatim processing, indicated {{by an increase in}} <b>reverse</b> <b>framing</b> (greater preference for the gamble in the gain frame than in the loss frame, the opposite of standard framing). Participants in neutral and positive moods showed the standard framing pattern. Decisions were not found to be influenced by the level of optimism...|$|R

We show, in the context of direction perception in spatially filtered two-frame random-dot kinematograms, that two quite different mechanisms operate simultaneously in the detection of such patterns. One mechanism causes reversal of the perceived direction (reversed-phi motion) when the image contrast is <b>reversed</b> between <b>frames,</b> and is highly dependent on the spatial-frequency content of the image. These characteristics are both signatures of detection based on motion energy. The other mechanism does not produce reversed-phi motion and is unaffected by spatial filtering. This appears to involve the tracking of unsigned complex spatial features. The perceived direction of a filtered dot pattern typically reflects a mixture of the two types of behaviour in any given instance. Although both types of mechanism have previously been invoked to explain the perception of motion of different types of image, the simultaneous involvement of two mechanisms in the detection of the same simple rigid motion of a pattern suggests that motion perception in general results from a combination of mechanisms working simultaneously on different principles in the same circumstances...|$|R
