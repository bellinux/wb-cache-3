Battisti's request for asylum was first denied by the National Committee for Refugees, {{in a decision}} taken by simple majority. His defense appealed to the Minister of Justice, who granted in January 2009 refugee status, a decision which divided Brazilian public opinion. Refugee status, however, halts the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>extradition,</b> which is being considered by the Brazilian Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 24 May, Great Britain {{requested}} al-Husseini's extradition, arguing {{that he was}} a British citizen who had collaborated with the Nazis. Despite {{the fact that he was}} on the list of war criminals, France decided to consider him as a political prisoner and refused to comply with the British request. France refused to extradite him to Yugoslavia where the government wanted to prosecute him for the massacres of Serbs. Poussot believed al-Husseini's claims that the massacre of Serbs had been performed by General Mihailovic and not by him. Al-Husseini also explained that 200,000 Muslims and 40,000 Christians had been assassinated by the Serbs and that he had established a division of soldiers only after Bosnian Muslims had asked for his help, and that Germans and Italians had refused to provide any support to them. In the meantime, Zionist representatives—fearing that al-Husseini would escape—backed Yugoslavia's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>extradition.</b> They stated that al-Husseini was also responsible for massacres in Greece and pointed out his action against the Allies in Iraq in 1941; additionally they requested the support of the United States in the matter.|$|E

500|$|After the war an {{indictment}} was issued against Jevđević in Sarajevo. It charged that {{under his command}} in [...] "the first half of October 1942 in and around Prozor they [...] butchered and killed 1,716 persons of both sexes, Croatian and Muslim nations, and plundered and burnt about 500 households". A month after the massacre, Jevđević and Baćović wrote a self-critical report on Prozor to Mihailović in order to distance their responsibility. Jevđević fled to Italy {{at the end of}} the war where Allied military authorities arrested and detained him at a camp. They ignored Yugoslavia's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>extradition</b> and set him free. He avoided trial and died in Rome in 1962. Baćović was killed by the Ustaše in 1945 and also did not come to trial.|$|E
500|$|In January 1908, {{a number}} of {{individuals}} were arrested while attempting to exchange the notes. The New York Times reported that one woman {{who had tried to}} cash a marked 500-ruble note later tried to swallow evidence of her plans to meet her accomplices after the police were summoned, but the police stopped her from swallowing the paper by grabbing her throat, retrieved the paper, and later arrested her accomplices at the train station. Most prominent among those arrested was Maxim Litvinov, caught while boarding a train with his mistress at Paris's Gare du Nord with twelve of the 500-ruble notes he intended to cash in London. The French Minister of Justice expelled Litvinov and his mistress from French territory, outraging the Russian government, which had requested his extradition. [...] Officially the French government stated that Russia's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>extradition</b> had been submitted too late, but by some accounts, they denied the extradition because French socialists had applied political pressure to secure his release.|$|E

Increasingly positive {{relations between the two}} states required the two states to explore imaginative work-arounds to {{the disagreement}}.

2500|$|According to an {{inscription}} of his in Susa, {{the control of}} the region is considered to have been Artabanus's. Elsewhere, Vologases VI's coins found in Seleucia show his control over the land. In Rome, Caracalla rose to power after the death of Septimius Severus, his father. Although the information about the contest between Artabanus and Vologases is trace, the Latin sources say that Caracalla gave special attention to the internal contest of Parthians and reported the disruption of the Parthians' status to the Roman Senate. Knowledge about the civil war in the Parthian Empire might have encouraged [...] "the idea of a military conquest" [...] in Caracalla and stimulated him towards successes larger than those of his father's (Septimius Severus) in fighting the Parthians. At the time while Emperor Caracalla had already been formulating a plan to start a new war with the Parthians, he sent a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>extradition</b> of two fugitives, a philosopher named Antiochus and an unknown man called Tiridates, to Vologases searching for an excuse to start a war in 214 or early 215; Vologases returned the two fugitives; but Caracall invaded Armenia anyway.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his release}} {{on grounds of}} ill health, the {{unprecedented}} detention of Pinochet {{in a foreign country}} for crimes against humanity committed in his own country, without a warrant or <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>extradition</b> from his own country, marks a watershed in international law. Some scholars consider {{it one of the most}} important events in judicial history since the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals. Judge Garzón's case was largely founded on the principle of universal jurisdiction—that certain crimes are so egregious that they constitute crimes against humanity and can therefore be prosecuted in any court in the world. The British House of Lords ruled that Pinochet had no right to immunity from prosecution as a former head of state, and could be put on trial. In Spain, the Court of Appeal of the Audiencia Nacional affirmed Spanish jurisdiction over Argentine and Chilean cases, declaring that domestic amnesty laws (in the case of Chile, the 1978 amnesty law passed by Pinochet's regime) could not bind the Spanish courts. Both for matters concerning the [...] "Dirty War" [...] in Argentina and for Chile, they characterized the crimes as genocides. However, both the Spanish and British decision did not rely on international law, but on domestic legislation: [...] "They talked about universal jurisdiction, but grounded their decision in domestic statutory law." ...|$|E
2500|$|The current Extradition Treaty {{between the}} United States of America and the United Mexican States (see 31 U.S.T. 5061) {{was signed by}} President Jimmy Carter in 1978 and {{went into effect in}} 1980. [...] Like many such treaties, it {{provides}} for the extradition of a party who has been charged with or found guilty of an offense committed in the United States, who has fled to Mexico. An offense is extraditable if it is a crime in both countries and punishable by incarceration for a period of one year or more. [...] In theory this allows for the extradition of child abductors who have absconded to Mexico as child abduction is a federal crime there. [...] In practice US authorities rarely request extradition in preference of Hague Convention litigation and, even when they do, Mexico is not bound to deliver up its nationals. [...] If extradition is denied based on nationality, the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>extradition</b> is automatically converted into a foreign prosecution pursuant to Article IV of the Mexican Federal Penal Code. [...] Although by law Mexican authorities are authorized to extradite their own nationals in “exceptional circumstances”, [...] in practice they most often will refuse to do so. [...] (See “Ley De Extradicion Internacional”, enacted May 19, 1897, revised [...] January 10, 1994: “extradition of Mexican nationals is prohibited except in “exceptional” circumstances”.) [...] “Nationality” is also liberally construed and often, marriage to a national, having dual citizenship, parents or other close relatives who are Mexican nationals, or simply having a Hispanic surname will suffice for purposes of extradition.|$|E
50|$|Indicted in 1980 in {{relation}} with the heroin trafficking network, he was convicted to six-and-a-half years jail sentence for heroin trafficking in Palermo (the sentence in absentia was confirmed by Italy’s Supreme Court in 1985).

2500|$|On December 1, 2008, Multiven {{filed an}} {{antitrust}} lawsuit against Cisco Systems, Inc. {{in an effort}} to open up the network maintenance services marketplace for Cisco equipment, promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value. Multiven's complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes/patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services (SMARTnet) and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and anticompetitive acts designed to maintain Cisco's alleged monopoly in the network maintenance services market for Cisco networking equipment. In May 2010, Cisco accused the person who filed the antitrust suit, British-Nigerian technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye, with hacking and pressured the US government to extradite him from Canada. Alfred-Adekeye was arrested while in the middle of testifying against Cisco in an anti-trust hearing. Although he was released after 28 days on bail, the case has stretched for a year, because the U.S. Attorney's office was unable to present the evidence required for the extradition. The antitrust lawsuit has been settled 2 months after Alfred-Adekeye's arrest. In May 2011, the US extradition request has been denied. Canadian Supreme Court Justice Ronald McKinnon, who oversaw the extradition hearing, commented on the arrest saying [...] "It is simply not done in a civilized jurisdiction that is bound by the rule of law". He also stated that the real reason for the extradition proceedings was because Alfred-Adekeye [...] "dared to take on a multinational giant." [...] Judge McKinnon has also condemned the US prosecutor for hiding the fact that Alfred-Adekeye was in legal proceedings against Cisco Systems, for stating that Alfred-Adekeye had left the USA in a time period when he had not and a formal <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>extradition</b> was not filed against Alfred-Adekeye when he was taken into custody. He described the information provided by Cisco and the US prosecutor as [...] "full of innuendo, half-truths and falsehoods," [...] adding that [...] "This speaks volumes for Cisco's duplicity" [...] and accused them of [...] "unmitigated gall" [...] in using such a heavy-handed move as an unsupportable arrest and jailing to pressure Alfred-Adekeye to drop or settle his civil antitrust complaint.|$|E
