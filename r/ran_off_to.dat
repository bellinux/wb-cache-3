She attends Eugene Debs Elementary School.|$|E

In the Yiddish edition, for example, when Buchenwald was liberated: [...] "Early the next day Jewish boys <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Weimar to steal clothing and potatoes. And to rape German shiksas [...]" [...] In the 1958 French and 1960 English editions: [...] "On the following morning, {{some of the young}} men went to Weimar to get some potatoes and clothes—and to sleep with girls [...] But of revenge, not a sign." ...|$|E

In 1987, a 29-year-old man was {{attacked}} by a raging moose near the station. The man <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a shop [...] away, and left the accident with broken ribs and a punctured lung. The reason for the moose's rage is unknown, but it was seen a few days earlier with a calf, and it is assumed that the moose wanted to protect it from foreigners. The man was sent to Ullevål University Hospital shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols) {{is later}} seen with a {{photograph}} of Genevieve as a teenager, revealing that the two dated before she <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Australia with Colin. When Victor goes missing, Tucker enlists Genevieve’s help and promises to reward her if she does. Genevieve finds Victor in Los Angeles suffering from amnesia. [...] Victor believes his name is [...] "Christian." [...] Genevieve poses as a barmaid, calling herself Jenny, so she can watch Victor. [...] After Victor regains his memory, Genevieve helps him get home to Genoa City. After their return, Genevieve is shunned by the town for keeping Victor away. Afterward, someone began impersonating Samantha, and when Cane found the woman, she insisted that Genevieve put her up to this. Genevieve denied any involvement but was convinced Colin was behind the plot. When the woman's hotel room was found trashed with blood on the floor, Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson) considered Genevieve a suspect. Fearing conviction for something she didn't do, {{she was able to}} get Tucker's help to disappear; they shared a heartfelt goodbye before she left town.|$|E
500|$|When they <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> France in {{the summer}} of 1814, Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley began a joint journal, which they {{published}} in 1817 under the title History of a Six Weeks' Tour, adding four letters, two by each of them, based on their visit to Geneva in 1816, along with Percy Shelley's poem [...] "Mont Blanc". The work celebrates youthful love and political idealism and consciously follows the example of Mary Wollstonecraft and others who had combined travelling with writing. The perspective of the History is philosophical and reformist rather than that of a conventional travelogue; in particular, it addresses the effects of politics and war on France. The letters the couple wrote on the second journey confront the [...] "great and extraordinary events" [...] of the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo after his [...] "Hundred Days" [...] return in 1815. They also explore the sublimity of Lake Geneva and Mont Blanc as well as the revolutionary legacy of the philosopher and novelist Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E

Michael Quin of the Melbourne Weekly said that Papps will always be remembered to [...] "legions of Australian girls" [...] as [...] "Frank Morgan: the hot guy with the mullet". Robin Oliver writing for The Sydney Morning Herald said that Frank was Home and Away's [...] "good-looking young hero". Linda Barnier and Ben Doherty of The Newcastle Herald summed Frank up as [...] "the bloke who married tomboy Bobby after he left Roo at the altar, after he recovered from a serious car accident that left him in a coma at a general hospital and before he <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the States for a sea change." [...] Doherty also named Frank an [...] "old favourite" [...] of the series. [...] Although Matt Buchanan from The Sydney Morning Herald admitted {{that he could not}} remember the name of the character that Papps [...] "once pretended to be". Helen Mitchell of the Evening Times said that [...] "hunky Frank" [...] was Home and Away's answer to Michael J. Fox and [...] "the local heart-throb".|$|E
500|$|In 1814, Shelley spent a {{considerable}} amount of time at the Godwins' and he and Imlay may have fallen in love. Later, Claire Clairmont claimed that they had been. Imlay was sent to Wales in May of that year; Todd speculates that Godwin was trying to separate her from Shelley while Seymour hints that Mrs Godwin was trying to improve her despondent mood. Meanwhile, the Godwin household became even more uncomfortable as Godwin sank further into debt and as relations between Mary and her stepmother became increasingly hostile. Mary Godwin consoled herself with Shelley and the two started a passionate love affair. When Shelley declared to Godwin that the two were in love, Godwin exploded in anger. However, he needed the money that Shelley, as an aristocrat, could and was willing to provide. Frustrated with the entire situation, Mary Godwin, Shelley, and Claire Clairmont <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Europe together on 28 June 1814. Godwin hurriedly summoned Imlay home from Wales to help him handle the situation. Her stepmother wrote that Imlay's [...] "emotion was deep when she heard of the sad fate of the two girls; she cannot get over it". In the middle of this disaster, one of Godwin's protégés killed himself, and young William Godwin ran away from home and was missing for two days. When news of the girls' escapade became public, Godwin was pilloried in the press. Life in the Godwin household became increasingly strained.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plantations}} that enslaved {{over three}} million black people were the principal source of wealth. Most were concentrated in [...] "black belt" [...] plantation areas (because few white {{families in the}} poor regions owned slaves.) For decades there had been widespread fear of slave revolts. During the war extra men were assigned to [...] "home guard" [...] patrol duty and governors sought to keep militia units at home for protection. Historian William Barney reports, [...] "no major slave revolts erupted during the Civil War." [...] Nevertheless, slaves {{took the opportunity to}} enlarge their sphere of independence, and when union forces were nearby, many <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> join them.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{persons of}} African descent in Puerto Rico are found along coastal areas, areas {{traditionally}} associated with sugar cane plantations, {{especially in the}} towns Loiza, Carolina, Fajardo, and Guayama. However, due to the DNA evidence that is being presented by UPR at Mayaguez, many African bloodlines have been recorded in the central mountains of the island, though not written in the Spanish history books of the time. [...] Consequently, Taino bloodlines have begun appearing in the coastal towns. [...] All of this suggests that escaped enslaved Africans <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the mountains to escape the slaveowners, while some Tainos remained close to their main staple food, fish.|$|E

2500|$|Marciano, the {{original}} Ray, left the series {{after the second}} season; however, he appeared {{in the first and}} last of the post-1997 episodes. His replacement was Callum Keith Rennie as Stanley Raymond Kowalski, a detective who was under orders to impersonate Vecchio while the real Vecchio was undercover. Marciano did return for the series finale, in which Vecchio returned to Chicago to break up a weapons-smuggling ring, and eventually <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Florida with Kowalski's ex-wife, Stella. Also in that episode, Benton and his father's ghost finally solve Benton's mother's murder, resulting in Fraser Sr.'s departure to rejoin his wife. The series ends with Benton and Kowalski in search of the graves of the Franklin expedition, immortalized in the Canadian folk song [...] "Northwest Passage", which Paul Gross sings in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|Around this time, the Lazarević {{brothers}} had a falling-out. The rift apparently stemmed from Vuk's perception {{that he had}} not emerged from the battle as a victor. Lazarević complained about the casualties under Vuk's command and wanted him to train in the art of war. Lazarević took to instructing his brother in military matters, but Vuk felt slighted after Lazarević said [...] "some hard words" [...] during instructions. Feeling hurt, with a gap between them, Vuk [...] "waited some time, and finding the right time" [...] <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Süleyman in the summer of 1403. Kalić believes that there was also a disagreement on the division of lands, while Blagojević believes that Lazarević's continued opposition to the Ottomans in light of the truce played a role.

She owns a cat home (where Dog was born) on Prince Phillip Drive in Tauranga. She is conservative, reveres the British monarchy, always addresses people by their proper names, and she disapproves of Wal's relationship with Cheeky Hobson. Beneath her strictness she has a kind heart and takes to mothering abandoned lambs in the winter. Dog despises her for giving him his name.|$|E

When Bronson encounters an Amish community, for example, a local boy becomes enraptured by the outside world and steals Bronson's motorcycle <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Reno, Nevada.

2500|$|The Bhairab once {{flowed from}} the Ganges, across the present beds of the Jalangi, and further eastwards towards Faridpur. [...] The Bhairab {{is no more}} a very active river. [...] The Mathabhanga is a younger stream than Jalangi {{and it was not}} till very {{recently}} that the river completed its junction with the Hooghly by adopting the River Churni (now its lower reaches) for its main course. Earlier most of the water of the Mathabhanga <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the east down the Kumara, Chitra, Coboduk (Bhairab), and Ichamati, but all these escape routes have been shut off, except a small amount for the Ichamati. The point to note is that while earlier the rivers in the region flowed in a south-easterly direction, but later some force pulled the Jalangi and the Mathabhanga in a south-westerly direction. The inference is that it occurred because of a local subsidence, which was active for some period prior to 1750 and which has since become inactive.|$|E

Actually, according to a July 2012 Ultimate Classic Rock article, Plant and Griffin had been dating for over a year, spending half of their time together in Austin, Texas. On 23 August 2014, The Independent, a UK publication, indicated Plant had broken up with Patty Griffin: [...] "“Patty and I tried a sort of zig-zag across the Atlantic,” Plant told the publication, “but she didn’t share my penchant for cider and she used to marvel at the Black Country character I became after four pints of Thatchers. My feelings are very much ones of sadness and regret." ...|$|E
2500|$|Byron {{was the son}} of Captain John [...] "Mad Jack" [...] Byron and {{his second}} wife, the former Catherine Gordon, heiress of Gight in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The Byron family had a spotted history, with a history of inconstancy and debt, and the fifth Lord Byron gained reputations of being a whoremaster and a murderer. The poet's father, John Byron, was the first child of Vice-Admiral John [...] "Foulweather Jack" [...] Byron, the second son of the fourth Lord Byron. Like the rest of his family, his {{personal}} history was one of turmoil; he was one of nine children and was sent to a military school {{when it became clear that}} he was unfit for academia. He gambled profusely until his parents refused to pay off his debts, and he soon developed a reputation for womanising and exploiting his companions for money. In 1778, when 22, he <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> France with the already married Amelia D'Arcy, the heiress of the Earl of Holderness and of Baroness Conyers and the current Marchioness of Carmarthen. [...] He married her in 1779; they had three children, of whom only their daughter Augusta Leigh survived. Conyers died in 1784, and John Byron, in debt and deprived of his wife's £4000 a year income, went to Bath in search of another rich wife. Here he met Catherine Gordon, who was called his [...] "Golden Dolly" [...] for her fortune of £23,000; she was a direct descendant of James I of Scotland.|$|E
