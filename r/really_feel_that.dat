500|$|Coldplay {{announced}} {{details about}} [...] "X" [...] in March 2004 while {{the album was}} being recorded. Their initial plans were {{to stay out of}} the public eye throughout the year. Lead singer Chris Martin stated, [...] "We <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> we have to be away for a while and we certainly won't release anything this year, because I think people are a bit sick of us." [...] This plan was not carried out, because of the pressure their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head had induced; but they were trying [...] "to make the best thing that anyone has ever heard".|$|E
500|$|Bowie was not {{concerned}} with the album's relative poor performance in the charts, saying [...] "I've made about 20 albums during my career, and so far this is my third biggest seller. So I can't be that disappointed, yet, it is a letdown that it hasn't been as buoyant as it should be. ... But I don’t <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> negative about it. As far as I'm concerned it's {{one of the better}} albums I've made. As I've said. Never Let Down has been a pretty big seller for me. So I'm quite happy." [...] Despite growing criticism in the press, Bowie said that Never Let Me Down {{was one of the most}} enjoyable and energetic albums he had made in a long time.|$|E
500|$|During {{the tour}} for One Hot Minute, all {{songs from the}} album except “One Hot Minute”, “Tearjerker” and “Falling Into Grace” were played. Those three songs have never been played live by the band. As of 2016, “Pea” and “Aeroplane” are the only songs from One Hot Minute that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have played in full since Dave Navarro left the band. The band however did tease [...] "My Friends", “Let's Make Evil” and [...] "Walkabout" [...] during the I'm With You World Tour. Chad Smith was asked by fans during a February 2014 online {{interview}} about the band's reasons behind not performing the songs and he responded by saying [...] "We don't <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> connected to that record anymore. No special reason, not to say we would never play those songs but we don't feel that emotionally connected to that music right now." ...|$|E

5000|$|O'Reilly {{had made}} the {{following}} remark about Michelle Obama and lynching on February 21, 2008: [...] "I don't {{want to go on}} a lynching party against Michelle Obama unless there's evidence, hard facts, that say this is how the woman <b>really</b> <b>feels.</b> If <b>that's</b> how she <b>really</b> <b>feels</b> — <b>that</b> America is a bad country or a flawed nation, whatever — then that's legit." [...] He later apologized, saying, [...] "I'm sorry if my statement offended anybody", on his February 22, 2008 program.|$|R
500|$|The Sugababes wrote [...] "In the Middle" [...] in {{collaboration}} with Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Niara Scarlett, Shawn Lee, Lisa Cowling, Andre Tegler, Phil Fuldner and Michael Bellina, for their third studio album, Three (2003). Group member Heidi Range revealed that the band {{wanted to write a}} song with which they could have fun; it was inspired by different situations experienced during a night out. Keisha Buchanan, another member of the Sugababes, told Digital Spy that she wrote 90% of the song but could not comprehend the meaning of the lyrics: [...] "I think it's because as I've got older I don't really relate to the lyrics. It was more of a fun song but I just don't <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> attached to it any more." [...] Higgins, Xenomania and Jeremy Wheatley produced the song; the latter mixed it at the Town House Studios, London. [...] "In the Middle" [...] was programmed by Matt Duguid, Nick Coler, Tim Powell and Tim Larcombe.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing I <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E
500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
5000|$|Drew {{expressed}} an interest in working in film early in his music career. In an interview about Who Needs Actions When You Got Words, he said: [...] "We're still promoting this album and I've started work on the next one, but I'm really getting into film at the moment.

500|$|On 30 March 2005 the BBC {{confirmed}} that Eccleston {{would not be}} staying in the role for a second series, claiming that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that,</b> because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Island {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", Michael was {{supposed}} to return in the season three finale, but Perrineau was filming the pilot of Demons, so was unable to return. Instead he returned in the seventh episode of season four, [...] "Ji Yeon". His return {{was meant to be}} announced during Losts slot at the 2007 Comic-Con International, however there were complaints at the Television Critics Association Press Tour when ABC's President of Entertainment Stephen McPherson commented that [...] "some big announcements" [...] would be made at the Lost panel. Some journalists felt that any announcements should be made to them at the press meeting, rather than at a fan convention. After numerous reporters asked about what would be announced, Lost producer Damon Lindelof was contacted, and he gave permission for McPherson to say Harold Perrineau would be returning to Lost. At Comic-Con, Lindelof confirmed Perrineau would be back as a cast member, not just for a flashback. Lost producer Carlton Cuse said [...] "Michael's story is for us one of the most becoming storylines on the show because here's a character who ... undertook some very extreme actions in order to basically get his son off the Island, and then when he sailed off in that boat I think everyone was very curious about what happened to him, what is his fate ... we <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Michael's story will be a really compelling part of the season." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed, and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are all these questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] Cuse responded [...] "We pride ourselves on having a very racially diverse cast. It's painful when any actor's storyline ends on the show. Harold is a fantastic actor whose presence added enormously to Lost". Perrineau later said he should have thought before making a racial comment, and although he felt like that, he never discussed the matter with the producers. Perrineau said that although he would be happy to return to Lost, he would have to know what the storyline would be.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{residents}} {{complained that}} the new mosque would have a harmful effect on traffic and housing values, noting that it was located in a primarily residential area. Commission officials rejected the criticism, stating that the plans met zoning requirements and that the law did {{not allow them to}} reject a project on religious grounds. The tenor of the opposition attracted criticism, with some residents calling the dispute [...] "one of the ugliest displays of religious intolerance in the county's history." [...] Rabbi Rami Shapiro of Middle Tennessee State University blamed misinformation and misplaced fears, commenting that [...] "there are some who are just anti-Muslim and will do anything to keep a mosque out of their neighborhood. They <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Islam is a threat to America and American values." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ponting {{continued}} in the role for the series against the West Indies in 1996–97 in Australia. After two Test matches and three scores under 10, he was replaced by Justin Langer, despite scoring 88 in the First Test. He {{was out of the}} team for six months, and missed the remaining three Tests against the West Indies, the three Tests on the tour to South Africa, both series victories to Australia. Many [...] "experts" [...] thought the decision was unjustifiable. Former Australian coach, Bob Simpson, said: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Ricky could have been persevered with. He's a fine young cricketer and he'll now have to prove that he's got the tenacity and temperament to go with it." [...] Ponting's axing meant he had time to regain his form in the Sheffield Shield.
