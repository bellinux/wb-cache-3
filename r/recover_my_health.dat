6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Holiday, [...] "I am {{travelling}} to <b>recover</b> <b>my</b> <b>health,</b> {{and every}} thing must {{give way to}} that. If I can only get well, I can earn money fast enough, when I go home, to replace what we expend. The only question is, Which way will be the pleasantest and the most comfortable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you noticed}} that I looked ill this morning," [...] he said, [...] "I {{told you that}} I had been {{thinking}} {{of a way to}} <b>recover</b> <b>my</b> <b>health,</b> and that I meant to speak to you about it later in the day. That latter time has come. I have been out of sorts, as the phrase is, for some time past. You have remarked it yourself, Allan, more than once; and, with your usual kindness, you have allowed it to excuse many things in my conduct which would have been otherwise unpardonable, even in your friendly eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|In that desponding state I {{was found}} by my friend Panta, who was {{constant}} in his visits at all hours; and when in answer to his anxious inquiries I pointed to the pulpy mass on the mud floor, he turned it over with his foot, and then, bursting into a loud laugh, kicked it out, remarking that he had mistaken the object for some unknown reptile that had crawled {{in out of the}} rain. He affected to be astonished that I should regret its loss. It was all a true narrative, he exclaimed; if I wished to write a book for the stay-at-homes to read, I could easily invent a thousand lies far more entertaining than any real experiences. He had come to me, he said, to propose something. He had lived twenty years at that place, and had got accustomed to the climate, but it would not do for me to remain any longer if I wished to live. I must go away at once to a different country--to the mountains, where it was open and dry. [...] "And if you want quinine when you are there," [...] he concluded, [...] "smell the wind when it blows from the south-west, and you will inhale it into your system, fresh from the forest." [...] When I remarked despondingly that in my condition {{it would be impossible to}} quit Manapuri, he went on to say that a small party of Indians was now in the settlement; that they had come, not only to trade, but to visit one of their own tribe, who was his wife, purchased some years ago from her father. [...] "And the money she cost me I have never regretted to this day," [...] said he, [...] "for she is a good wife not jealous," [...] he added, with a curse on all the others. These Indians came all the way from the Queneveta mountains, and were of the Maquiritari tribe. He, Panta, and, better still, his good wife would interest them on my behalf, and for a suitable reward they would take me by slow, easy stages to their own country, where I would be treated well and <b>recover</b> <b>my</b> <b>health.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Catherine {{asserted}} her {{own opinion}} against her mother's opinion, {{for the second}} time. [...] "I have <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health</b> at Sandyseal," [...] she said. [...] "I like the place, and I am sorry to leave it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have quite}} <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health</b> and <b>my</b> cheerfulness," [...] said I. [...] "You {{know how good}} my {{guardian}} is and what a happy life we lead, and I have everything {{to be thankful for}} and nothing in the world to desire." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were not}} allowed to {{converse}} for any length of time, for the precarious state of <b>my</b> <b>health</b> rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{events which}} ensued {{have already been}} detailed, and little more remains to be related. On {{reaching}} the Julia, I was lifted over the side, and my strange appearance, and remarkable adventure, occasioned the liveliest interest. Every attention was bestowed upon me that humanity could suggest; but to such a state was I reduced, that three months elapsed before I <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health.</b>|$|R
60|$|We {{set sail}} and took our course towards the East Indies by the Persian Gulf, having {{the coast of}} Persia upon our left hand and upon our right the shores of Arabia Felix. I was at first much troubled by the uneasy motion of the vessel, but speedily <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health,</b> and since that hour have been no more plagued by sea-sickness.|$|R
5000|$|While {{exploring}} the Louisiana Purchase with Lewis and Clark, he took ill {{at the end}} of July 1804. On July 31, Floyd wrote in his diary, [...] "I am very sick and have been for sometime but have <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health</b> again." [...] However, this apparent recovery was soon followed by a severe turn for the worse. William Clark described Floyd's death as one [...] "with a great deal of composure" [...] and that before Floyd died he said to Clark, [...] "I am going away. Please write me a letter." ...|$|R
60|$|The more I knew of {{the inmates}} of Moor House, the better I liked them. In a few days I had so far <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health</b> that I could sit up all day, and walk out sometimes. I could join with Diana and Mary in all their occupations; {{converse}} with {{them as much as}} they wished, and aid them when and where they would allow me. There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{the crash}} which I had {{foreseen}} has come--and that no further back than yesterday. The university authorities have taken my lectureship from me. It {{has been done}} in the most delicate way, purporting to be a temporary measure to relieve me from the effects of overwork, and to give me the opportunity of <b>recovering</b> <b>my</b> <b>health.</b> None the less, it has been done, and I am no longer Professor Gilroy. The laboratory is still in my charge, but I have little doubt that that also will soon go.|$|R
2500|$|According to Palace Museum records, {{the first}} Chinese {{historical}} archive, Emperor Yongzheng paid {{particular attention to}} his health and {{made a habit of}} taking a type of traditional Chinese medicine called GuilingJi each day. The medicine had been originally created for Qianlong and was said to have a variety of health benefits. He was so impressed with it effects that he began to pay great attention to its production. He was known to reward nobility and courtiers with GuilingJi to show his goodwill. There is even a piece of calligraphy Emperor Yongzheng in red ink which roughly translated means “I have fully <b>recovered.</b> <b>My</b> <b>health</b> owes a great debt to GuilingJi.” ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{exploring}} the Louisiana Purchase with Lewis and Clark, Floyd took ill {{at the end}} of July 1804. On July 31, Floyd wrote in his diary, [...] "I am very sick and has been for sometime but have <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health</b> again." [...] However, this apparent recovery was soon followed by a severe turn for the worse. William Clark described his colleague's death as one [...] "with a great deal of composure", and said that before Floyd died, he told Clark: [...] "I am going away. I want you to write me a letter." [...] The sergeant died on August 20. The expedition held a funeral and buried Floyd on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River; they named it Floyd's Bluff in his honor.|$|R
60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. I did kill myself. It {{was quite}} easy. I left {{a suit of}} clothes by the {{seashore}} during the bathing season, with documents in the pockets to identify me. I then turned up in a strange place, pretending that I had lost my memory, {{and did not know}} my name or my age or anything about myself. Under treatment I <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health,</b> but not <b>my</b> memory. I have had several careers since I began this routine of life and death. I have been an archbishop three times. When I persuaded the authorities to knock down all our towns and rebuild them from the foundations, or move them, I went into the artillery, and became a general. I have been President.|$|R
6000|$|Catherine {{advanced}} a few steps; it {{was time}} to stop her mother, if the thing could be done. She felt just embarrassment enough to heighten her color, and to show her beauty to the greatest advantage. It literally staggered the Captain, the moment he looked at her. His customary composure, as a well-bred man, deserted him; he bowed confusedly; he had not a word to say. Mrs. Presty seized her opportunity, and introduced them to each other. [...] "My daughter Mrs. Norman--Captain Bennydeck." [...] Compassionating him under the impression that he was a shy man, Catherine tried to set him at his ease. [...] "I am indeed glad to have an opportunity of thanking you," [...] she said, inviting him by a gesture to be seated. [...] "In this delightful air, I have <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health,</b> and I owe it to your kindness." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dear Amelia,--I {{send you}} the [...] "Orphan of the Forest." [...] I was {{too ill to}} come yesterday. I leave town to-day for Cheltenham. Pray excuse me, if you can, to the amiable Miss Sharp, for my conduct at Vauxhall, and entreat her to pardon and forget every word I may have uttered when excited by that fatal supper. As soon as I have <b>recovered,</b> for <b>my</b> <b>health</b> is very much shaken, I shall go to Scotland for some months, and am ...|$|R
60|$|It little {{concerns}} any man to {{know how}} I slowly <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health</b> after certain failings back into the shadow of death. Therefore I need not tell how I was physicked, and bled, and how I drew on from a diet of milk to one of fish, and so to a meal of chicken's flesh, till at last I could sit, wrapped up in many cloaks, on {{a seat in the}} garden, below a great mulberry tree. In all this weary time I knew little, and for long cared less, as to what went on {{in the world and the}} wars. But so soon as I could speak it was of Elliot that I devised, with my kind nurse, Charlotte Boucher, the young daughter of Jacques Boucher, the Duke's treasurer, in whose house I lay. She was a fair lass, and merry of mood, and greatly hove up my heart to fight with my disease. It chanced that, as she tended me, when I was at my worst, she marked, hanging on a silken string about my neck, a little case of silver artfully wrought, wherein was that portrait of my mistress, painted by me before I left Chinon. Being curious, like all girls, and deeming that the case held some relic, she opened it, I knowing nothing then of what she did. But when I was well enough to lie abed and devise with her, it chanced that I was playing idly with my fingers about the silver case.|$|R
60|$|In {{the prime}} of life I had visited this region in a society which afforded me the pleasures of {{intellectual}} friendship and the delights of refined affection; later I had left the burning summer of Italy and the violence of an unhealthy passion, and had found coolness, shade, repose, and tranquillity there; in a still more advanced period I had sought for and found consolation, and partly <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health</b> after a dangerous illness, the consequence of labour and mental agitation; there I had found the spirit of my early vision. I was desirous, therefore, of again passing some time in these scenes {{in the hope of}} re-establishing a broken constitution; and though this hope was a feeble one, yet at least I expected to spend a few of the last days of life more tranquilly and more agreeably than in the metropolis of my own country. Nature never deceives us. The rocks, the mountains, the streams always speak the same language. A shower of snow may hide the verdant woods in spring, a thunderstorm may render the blue limpid streams foul and turbulent; but these effects are rare and transient: in a few hours or at least days all the sources of beauty are renovated. And Nature affords no continued trains of misfortunes and miseries, such as depend upon the constitution of humanity; no hopes for ever blighted in the bud; no beings full of life, beauty, and promise taken from us in {{the prime of}} youth. Her fruits are all balmy, bright, and sweet; she affords none of those blighted ones so common in the life of man and so like the fabled apples of the Dead Sea--fresh and beautiful to the sight, but when tasted full of bitterness and ashes. I have already mentioned the strong effect produced on my mind by the stranger whom I had met so accidentally at Paestum; the hope of seeing him again was another of my motives for wishing to leave England, and (why, I know not) I had a decided presentiment that I was more likely to meet him in the Austrian states than in England, his own country.|$|R
60|$|So papa and I {{went down}} to Ramsgate for a month, and a very great deal of good it did us. The fresh air and sea-bathing soon cured my nervousness, and the change of scene and the variety and life of the place--so {{different}} from the quiet sleepiness of Canterbury--gradually softened the bitterness of my grief; while nearly every day I had letters from Percy--long, loving letters, very cheering and dear to me--painting our future life together, and making me feel very happy; so happy, that I sometimes blamed myself for feeling so, so soon after my dear mother's death. It was a tranquil, quiet life, and I rapidly <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> <b>health</b> and strength again. I had no acquaintances down there, for Ramsgate is too near to Canterbury for the people from there to visit it. Besides, Canterbury {{is a great deal}} too genteel to patronize so exceedingly vulgar a place as Ramsgate. I had a chatting acquaintance with several of the boatmen, and papa was very fond of sitting of an evening {{at the end of the}} pier, on the great stone posts to which the steamers are fastened, and talking to the fishermen of the wrecks they had known on those terrible Goodwins, and of the vessels which had been lost in trying to make the entrance to the Harbour. I also struck up a great acquaintance with the old bathing-woman--not, certainly, from any use that she was to me, for I would never let her take me by the hands and plunge me under water as I saw some girls do, but I used to talk to her of an evening when her work was done, and she was hanging up the towels to dry. She was a very worthy old body, and not so frightfully ugly as she looked in her bathing-costume, with her draggled clothes and weather-beaten bonnet, but was a quiet respectable-looking old woman. She had been a bathing-woman there for years and years; and had, I have no doubt, saved up a snug little sum of money. She told me that she had a married daughter who lived near London, and who had a very nice cottage down at Putney, and who let part of it to lodgers; and she hoped that if I were ever going near London, I would patronize her. I told her that there was not the remotest probability of such a thing; but she suggested that I might know some one who might one day go, and, accordingly, to please her, I took the address down in my pocket-book, but certainly without the remotest idea that it would ever turn out of the slightest use to me.|$|R
500|$|Maria Amélia and her mother, who had {{accompanied}} her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, {{the capital of}} Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day <b>recover</b> <b>my</b> previous robust <b>health,</b> isn't that so mommy, we will stay {{a long time in}} this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!" [...] She died later that morning at around 04:00.|$|R
60|$|I rowed {{a couple}} of hundred feet along the beach so as to <b>recover</b> <b>my</b> nerves, and then stepped ashore again.|$|R

5000|$|In summer 2009, Patients First {{sponsored}} a six-week [...] "Hands Off <b>My</b> <b>Health</b> Care" [...] bus tour. Hands Off <b>My</b> <b>Health</b> Care events included rallies protesting against {{the health care}} plan and collected signatures {{in an effort to}} raise awareness about free-market-based health care reforms. AFP held Hands Off <b>My</b> <b>Health</b> Care events in more than 250 cities, according to AFP president Phillips.|$|R

60|$|The daughter's {{pleading}} was {{not without}} effect. In the meantime I had fainted. When I <b>recovered</b> <b>my</b> senses I found myself in Governor Maitland's mansion.|$|R
