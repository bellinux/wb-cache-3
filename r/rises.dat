5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear {{different}} from that of the Moon.

Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of calcium carbonate {{in the waters}} of Buffalo Creek ranges from less than 10 milligrams per liter to 100 milligrams per liter.

The concentration declines to 70 milligrams per liter at the confluence with Spruce Run, but <b>rises</b> to about 80 milligrams per liter at the mouth of Buffalo Creek. One tributary of the creek has a {{concentration of}} 250 milligrams per liter. The calcium concentration in the creek ranges from virtually 0 milligrams per liter to over 40 milligrams per liter.

At Mifflinburg, the concentration <b>rises</b> to its peak before dropping to around 30 milligrams per liter between Mifflinburg and the Susquehanna River.|$|E
