40|$|The recent {{description}} of a prion disease (PD) case in a free-ranging bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) prompted us to carry out an extensive search for the disease-associated isoform (PrPSc) of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) {{in the brain and}} in a range of lymphoid tissues from 23 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), 5 bottlenose <b>dolphins</b> and 2 <b>Risso</b> <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Grampus griseus) found stranded between 2007 and 2012 along the Italian coastline. Three striped dolphins and one bottlenose dolphin showed microscopic lesions of encephalitis, with no evidence of spongiform brain lesions being detected in any of the 30 free-ranging cetaceans investigated herein. Nevertheless, we could still observe a prominent PrPC immunoreactivity in the brain as well as in lymphoid tissues from these dolphins. Although immunohistochemical and Western blot investigations yielded negative results for PrPSc deposition in all tissues from the dolphins under study, the reported occurrence of a spontaneous PD case in a wild dolphin is an intriguing issue and a matter of concern for both prion biology and intra/inter-species transmissibility, as well as for cetacean conservation medicine...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a fine-scale habitat selection study of Heaviside <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii) at two sites in Namibia; Walvis Bay and Lüderitz. Walvis Bay and Lüderitz are the two largest embayments along the Namibian Coast, and therefore the two industrial ports in Namibia are located there. These bays are also inhabited year-round by Heaviside <b>s</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and, at Walvis Bay, a resident population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Heaviside <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> are endemic to the western coast of southern Africa ranging within the Benguela current ecosystem from Table Bay, South Africa, to southern Angola. They are not well-studied in the northern half of their range to date, and little is known about geographical variation in the ecology of this species. Furthermore, their coastal distribution and year-round residency near developing industrial ports could potentially put them at risk from human impacts, as industrial use of these areas increases. This study was conducted in order to obtain baseline information on fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns of distribution and important habitat parameters for this species in the northern half of its range in order to inform future management of commercial and industrial activities in these areas. Two complementary methods were used to obtain data on dolphin presence: visual surveys from a small boat were conducted at both study sites over multiple years, and continuous acoustic monitoring was done at Lüderitz over a short period concurrent with one year s surveys. Visual surveys provided the flexibility to cover a wider area and to obtain presence and absence data, including positons of groups, while acoustic monitoring allowed for a continuous observational presence even during nighttime hours, allowing for the ability to detect diel patterns in area use. The Namibian Dolphin Project has been conducting small boat surveys for cetaceans in Walvis Bay since 2008 and in Lüderitz since 2010, with a focus on Heaviside <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> and common bottlenose dolphins. Surveys were conducted in a non-systematic way, with the aim of covering the entire study area while maximizing opportunities for data collection from groups of animals, and was thus rather more focused on high-density areas for these two species. Effort-corrected encounter data from these surveys were mapped and linked spatially to habitat parameters using ArcGIS in order to identify areas of frequent dolphin presence for both species. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used to discover the parameters relevant to habitat selection at each site for Heaviside <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> and at Walvis Bay for bottlenose dolphins. Habitat selection at Lüderitz was not examined for bottlenose dolphins, because there were too few encounters there. Acoustic monitoring for dolphins at Lüderitz was conducted continuously over a two-month period in 2014 using five click-logging instruments called C-PODS moored at different sites from the harbour mouth westward across a series of small bays towards the open ocean, which make up the core study area for visual surveys at this study site. The data obtained give information on relative presence, both spatially between the deployment sites, and also temporally. Another aspect of the acoustic data which was examined was the prevalence of very rapid series of echolocation clicks used when an echolocating animal acoustically investigates a specific target, oftentimes a potential prey item. Spatial and temporal variation in the prevalence of these rapid click trains, hereafter referred to as potential feeding buzzes, has implications regarding patterns of foraging. Strong habitat preferences over a fine scale were found at both study sites, with areas of near-constant presence close to areas with very little presence. There are similarities between the most frequented areas at each study site: Pelican Point, in Walvis Bay, and Diaz Point, in Lüderitz. Animals in Lüderitz, however, made use of sheltered inshore waters, and were found much closer to the coastline, and in shallower waters, than animals in Walvis Bay. This {{may be due to the}} presence to bottlenose dolphins close inshore in Walvis Bay as the two species showed remarkably little overlap in distributions given the small scale of the study site. Patterns of acoustic detections between C-POD deployment locations closely matched encounter rates from the small boat surveys around those locations, though with lower detections at night on all C-PODS, implying a diel movement offshore. Highest detections overall were at midday, except at Guano Bay (the most westerly site) where early morning detections were highest. Analysis of inter-click intervals showed a similar diurnal pattern in the proportion of potential feeding buzzes to overall acoustic activity. The continuous presence close to shore and strong habitat preferences of dolphins within both of these industrial ports put them at risk from anthropogenic activities that occur there. Continued monitoring of these populations in the future will help to identify and mitigate these risks. Identification of areas with the most frequent occurrence of dolphins at each study site should be used to inform management decisions in the future.

30|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{about the number of}} species within the genus Sousa (see review by Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). Until recently, the most widely accepted view was of two species: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, and Atlantic humpback dolphin, Sousa teuszii (see Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2004). However, mounting molecular and morphological evidence suggested that taxonomic revision was needed (see Frère et al. 2008, 2011; Mendez et al. 2013) and led to a new proposed arrangement that included four species within the genus (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). Sousa teuszii remained unchanged while what previously comprised Sousa chinensis was divided into the Indo-Pacific humpback <b>dolphin</b> (<b>S.</b> chinensis), the Indian Ocean humpback <b>dolphin</b> (<b>S.</b> plumbea), and a newly described species, the Australian humpback <b>dolphin</b> (<b>S.</b> sahulensis). Due to concerns about poor sampling from important areas in these studies, this new four-species arrangement was accepted only conditionally by the Taxonomy Committee of the Society for Marine Mammalogy (2014). Although several subspecies were also suggested, none were formally described.|$|R

This study describes observations of adults carrying dead calves and juveniles in 7 odontocetes (toothed cetaceans) species and discusses the subject in mammals in general. Observations are based on 14 events from 3 oceans and constitute the 1 st records for Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris), killer whales (Orcinus orca), Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis), and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), as well as presenting additional records for Risso 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Grampus griseus) and shortfinned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus).

However, what is missing are catalogues of commonly recorded sounds. Sounds related to geophysical events (e. g. earthquakes) and weather (e. g. wind and precipitation), to human activities (e. g. ships) and to marine animals (e. g. crustaceans, fish and marine mammals) commonly occur. Marine mammals are distributed throughout Australia 2 ̆ 7 s oceans and significantly contribute to the underwater soundscape. However, due to a lack of concurrent visual and passive acoustic observations, it is often not known which species produces which sounds. To aid in the analysis of Australian and Antarctic marine soundscape recordings, a literature review of the sounds made by marine mammals was undertaken. Frequency, duration and source level measurements are summarised and tabulated.

40|$|Odontocetes use {{echolocation}} to detect, track, and discriminate their prey, {{as well as}} negotiate their environment. Their hearing abilities {{match the}} frequency of greatest sensitivity to the higher frequencies used for foraging and navigation. Hearing and echolocation together provide odontocetes with a highly developed biosonar system. This dissertation examines the hearing ability of several odontocete species to understand what signals they can perceive during echolocation. The variability in hearing ranges between species is examined {{in the context of}} phylogenetic and ecological differences among taxa. An autonomous hydrophone array is also developed {{that could be used in}} an expanded form in field deployments to study echolocation signals in a wider range of species. Methods for measuring hearing sensitivity include both psychophysical and electrophysiological procedures. Behavioral methods require a large time commitment, for both training and data collection, and can only be performed on captive dolphins. Auditory evoked potential (AEP) methods are non-invasive, rapid measurements of the brain 2 ̆ 7 s response to sound stimuli and allow for audiograms to be collected on stranded, high risk dolphins. By determining the hearing abilities of odontocetes either in captivity or during stranding, data can be collected about inter- and intraspecies variability, and the occurrence of hearing impairment. It can also be used as another diagnostic tool to determine the releasability of a stranded animal. A juvenile male short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) that stranded in Curacao had severe hearing impairment at all frequencies tested. Four female short-finned pilot whales tested had the best sensitivity at 40 kHz. The juveniles had greater high frequency sensitivity than the adult pilot whales. Cutoff frequencies were between 80 and 120 kHz. Hearing sensitivity was determined for the two mother/calf pairs of Risso 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Grampus griseus) before and after antibiotic treatment in order to measure any potential effects of antibiotic treatment. Greatest sensitivity occurred at 40 kHz and cutoff frequencies were around 120 kHz for all dolphins tested. Changes in hearing sensitivity after antibiotic dosage were 12 dB or less in all cases except one. The adult female Betty showed a threshold shift at 120 kHz of 54 dB from May to June, which partially demonstrates the presence of an ototoxic effect at one frequency. Dosages of antibiotics during drug treatment detailed in this study should be considered safe dosages of antibiotics for Risso 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>dolphins.</b> AEP and behavioral methods were used to collect audiograms for three Stenella spp. dolphins. The frequency of best hearing for the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the spinner dolphin was 40 kHz, and their upper cutoff frequencies were above 120 kHz. The pantropical spotted dolphin had the greatest sensitivity at 10 kHz, and had severe high frequency hearing loss with a cutoff frequency between 14 and 20 kHz. Comparisons of high frequency hearing sensitivities among the species tested show two distinct groups. Short-finned pilot whales and Risso 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> have a cutoff frequency below 120 kHz, whereas Stenella spp. dolphins have cutoff frequencies above 120 kHz. Expanding the comparison to include other species, killer whales, pygmy killer whales, false killer whales, and long-finned pilot whales also have cutoff frequencies below 120 kHz. Common bottlenose dolphins, white-beaked dolphins, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, and common dolphins have cutoff frequencies above 120 kHz. Genetic evidence exists for two subfamilies within Delphinidae (Vilstrup et al., 2011) and those species with cutoff frequencies below 120 kHz belong to the subfamily Globicephalinae and those species with cutoff frequencies above 120 kHz belong to the subfamily Delphininae. An autonomous, field-deployable hydrophone array was developed to measure free-swimming echolocation. The array contained 25 hydrophones, two cameras, and a synchronization unit on a PVC frame. The distinct click train was used to time-align all 25 channels, and the light was used to synchronize the video and acoustic recordings. Echolocation beam patterns were calculated and preliminary evidence shows a free-swimming dolphin utilizes head movement, beam steering and beam focusing. Among all areas of cetacean biology more research is necessary to gain a clearer picture of how odontocetes have adapted to function in their acoustic environment. The array system developed can be used to study how dolphins use echolocation in the wild, the impacts of anthropogenic sound on echolocation production, and the potential consequences of high frequency hearing loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{expansion}} of pelagic longline tuna fisheries, along with increasing fisheries observer coverage, {{has resulted in}} an increased documentation of interactions with small cetacean marine mammals. In particular, western North Atlantic fisheries interact with short- and long-finned pilot whale and Rosso 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>dolphins,</b> while the central North Pacific fisheries interact with false killer whales. Other species infrequently also interact with this gear type, including bottlenose and common dolphins. Small cetacean interactions include depredation of caught fishes, hooking events, and entanglements. Although some seasonality and area effects occur with small cetacean interaction rates, such effects are generally weak, and time-area closure discussions for these fisheries have met with strong opposition within U. S. constituent-based take reduction teams. A variety of alternative mitigation methods have instead been examined, including restrictions on the lengths of pelagic longline sets, limited soak times, and changes to baits. Another strategy involves requiring vessels to move a selected distance away from the location of any interaction. More recently, investigations into so-called “weak hook” technology, which exploit the weight difference between the target tunas and the bycatch small cetaceans, have been underway in the central North Pacific and the western North Atlantic. All of these strategies will be discussed {{within the context of}} reducing small cetacean interactions with pelagic longline fisheries...|$|R

Ship-based, line-transect abundance surveys were conducted in oceanic waters (> 200 m deep) of the northern GMx within U. S. waters (380, 432 square km) during summer 2003 and spring 2004. Data from these surveys were pooled and minimum abundance estimates were based on 10, 933 km of effort and 433 sightings of at least 17 species. The most commonly sighted species (number of groups) were pantropical spotted dolphin, Stenella attenuata (115); sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus (85); dwarf/pygmy sperm whale, Kogia sima/breviceps (27); Risso’s dolphin, Grampus griseus (26); and bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus (26).

40|$|ABSTRACT. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus × pearyi) of the Dolphin and Union herd migrate {{across the}} sea ice between Victoria Island and the {{adjacent}} Canadian Arctic mainland twice each year, southward in fall–early winter and northward in late winter–spring. As a result of warmer temperatures, sea ice between Victoria Island and the mainland now forms 8 – 10 days later {{than it did in}} 1982, raising questions about the impact of delayed ice formation on the ecology of the herd. We examined movements of female Dolphin and Union caribou as they relate to sea-ice crossings using four satellite collar datasets (46 caribou) obtained between 1987 and 2006. Since the late 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>Dolphin</b> and Union caribou have been moving by early October to the southern coast of Victoria Island, where they stage until sea-ice formation allows migration {{across the sea}} ice to winter range on the mainland. Caribou spending the summer farther north on Victoria Island arrive later at the coast, which shortens their time spent on the staging area. During the study period, the collared caribou began crossings as soon as sea-ice formation allowed. Most caribou departed from just a few areas and tended to use the same departure areas each year. Highest mortality occurred during the fall–early winter ice crossing and in mid to late winter. Our research raises the question of how the Dolphin and Union caribou will persist in supporting harvesting if the crossing becomes riskier for them or if the seasonal migrations between Victoria Island and the mainland are interrupted.

These species are difficult to differentiate at sea. Atlantic spotted dolphins are distributed in tropical and warm temperate waters of the western North Atlantic (Leatherwood et al. 1976). Their distribution is from southern New England, south through the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean to Venezuela (Leatherwood et al. 1976; Perrin et al. 1987). The large, heavily spotted form of the Atlantic spotted dolphin along the southeastern and Gulf coasts of the United States inhabits the continental shelf, usually being found inside or near the 200 m isobath (within 250 - 350 km of the coast) but sometimes coming into very shallow water adjacent to the beach. Off the northeast U. <b>S.</b> coast, spotted <b>dolphins</b> are widely distributed on the continental shelf, along the continental shelf edge, and offshore over the deep ocean south of 40 o N (CETAP 1982). Atlantic spotted dolphins regularly occur in the inshore waters south of Chesapeake Bay and near the continental shelf edge and continental slope waters north of this region (Payne et al. 1984). Sightings have also been made along the north wall of the Gulf Stream and warm-core ring features (Waring et al. 1992). Stock structure in the western North Atlantic is unknown. POPULATION SIZ...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{adaptive}} filter-based {{method for detection}} and frequency estimation of whistle calls, such as the calls of birds and marine mammals, which are typically analyzed in the time-frequency domain using a spectrogram. The approach taken here is based on adaptive notch filtering, which is an established technique for frequency tracking. For application to automatic whistle processing, methods for detection and improved frequency tracking through frequency crossings as well as interfering transients are developed and coupled to the frequency tracker. Background noise estimation and compensation is accomplished using order statistics and pre-whitening. Using simulated signals as well as recorded calls of marine mammals and a human whistled speech utterance, it is shown that the proposed method can detect more simultaneous whistles than two competing spectrogram-based methods while not reporting any false alarms on the example datasets. In one example, it extracts complete 1. 4 and 1. 8 <b>s</b> bottlenose <b>dolphin</b> whistles successfully through frequency crossings. The method performs detection and estimates frequency tracks even at high sweep rates. The algorithm is also shown to be effective on human whistled utterance...|$|R
5000|$|Until 1998, all {{bottlenose}} dolphins {{were considered}} {{members of the}} single species T. truncatus. In that year, the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin was recognized as a separate species. The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin is generally smaller than the common bottlenose dolphin, has a proportionately longer rostrum, and has spots on its belly and lower sides. [...] It also has more teeth than the common bottlenose dolphin — 23 to 29 teeth {{on each side of}} each jaw compared to 21 to 24 for the common bottlenose dolphin. [...] There is evidence the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin may actually be more closely related to certain dolphin species in the genera Stenella and Delphinus, especially the Atlantic spotted <b>dolphin</b> (<b>S.</b> frontalis), than it is to the common bottlenose dolphin.|$|R
40|$|Cetacean morbilliviruses (CeMV) are {{viruses that}} can cause mass mortalities among various odontocete species. In this study levels of “herd” {{immunity}} in cetaceans from the U. S. coast are described from the distribution and prevalence of antibodies against morbilliviruses. Neutralizing antibody titers against dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), porpoise morbillivirus (PMV), phocine distemper (PDV), and canine distemper viruses (CDV) were measured. Positive samples had higher titers against the CeMV than against the other morbilliviruses tested, indicating that although PDV or CDV {{can be used to}} investigate exposure their use may result in a higher false negative rate. The results suggest that morbillivirus did not persist in coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) after the major outbreaks that occurred in the 1980 s and 1990 <b>s.</b> Bottlenose <b>dolphins</b> from Beaufort, North Carolina; St. Joseph Bay, Florida; and Cape May, New Jersey had anti-DMV seroprevalences ranging from between 15 % and 33 % but those from Charleston, South Carolina and Sarasota Bay, Florida, sampled in recent years were largely negative. These latter groups are therefore now vulnerable to infection and could experience high mortality if exposed to CeMV. Sero-surveys of this kind are therefore vital for assessing the risk of new and recurring viral outbreaks in coastal cetaceans...|$|R
40|$|Delphinids are long-lived, have delayed {{maturity}} and low reproductive rates which necessitate long-term monitoring programs to detect changes in abundance. Between 1990 and 2013, an observational study of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) {{was conducted in}} the Port River estuary (Adelaide, Australia). The estuary has received pollution from industry, sewage plants and storm water. In recent years, pollution entering the system has reduced {{and the establishment of}} the Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary (ADS) increased dolphin protection from harassment and deliberate attacks. Nevertheless, the estuary remains a busy port. Over a 24 yr period, we conducted boat-based surveys (n = 735) for dolphin groups (n = 3, 634) along a predetermined route in the Inner and Outer Estuary of Adelaide's Port River estuary. It is our conjecture that major infrastructure changes and pollution abatement have yielded a more favorable marine environment for dolphins, resulting in an estimated 6 % annual increase in sightings, from a near absence of sightings in the 1980 <b>s.</b> Increased <b>dolphin</b> numbers were likely the result of improved water quality, augmented by surveillance and education arising from the proclamation of the ADS. This study highlights the importance of long-term monitoring and has implications for dolphin conservation in heavily impacted urban areas and their protection via protected areas...|$|R

40|$|The world 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> river <b>dolphins</b> (Inia, Pontoporia, Lipotes and Platanista) {{are among}} the least known and most {{endangered}} of all cetaceans. The four extant genera inhabit geographically disjunct river systems and exhibit highly modified morphologies, leading many cetologists to regard river dolphins as an unnatural group. Numerous arrangements have been proposed for their phylogenetic relationships {{to one another and}} to other odontocete cetaceans. These alternative views strongly affect the biogeographical and evolu- tionary implications raised by the important, although limited, fossil record of river dolphins. We present a hypothesis of river dolphin relationships based on phylogenetic analysis of three mitochondrial genes for 29 cetacean species, concluding that the four genera represent three separate, ancient branches in odontocete evolution. Our molecular phylogeny corresponds well with the first fossil appearances of the primary lineages of modern odontocetes. Integrating relevant events in Tertiary palaeoceanography, we develop a scenario for river dolphin evolution during the globally high sea levels of the Middle Miocene. We suggest that ancestors of the four extant river dolphin lineages colonized the shallow epicontinental seas that inundated the Amazon, Parana, Yangtze and Indo-Gangetic river basins, subsequently remaining in these extensive waterways during their transition to freshwater with the Late Neogene trend of sea-level lowering...|$|R
