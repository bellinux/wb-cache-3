40|$|<b>Refrigerator-freezers</b> {{are one of}} {{the major}} energy users in the {{residential}} sector of Malaysia. In line with rapid economic growth, the ownership of household <b>refrigerator-freezers</b> increased rapidly for the last several years. There has been a tremendous increase in the use of household <b>refrigerator-freezers</b> (878000 units) from 1990 to 1999 and by the year 2020, it will be about 5624000 units. So, there is a huge saving potential by introducing cost-effective energy policy like energy efficiency standards. Energy efficiency standards are cost-effective approaches that can help to improve the efficiency of these appliances. In the present study, six household <b>refrigerator-freezers</b> of different capacities and models have been tested in the energy conservation laboratory to investigate the energy consumption behavior of these appliances. The test has been carried out according to ISO <b>refrigerator-freezers</b> test specifications. Using the experimental data of ISO test conditions, a baseline standard has been developed by the statistical method. From the baseline standard, 5 and 10 standards as a function of adjusted volume have been developed. Impacts of energy efficiency standards have been calculated and presented in this paper as well...|$|R
40|$|As <b>refrigerator-freezers</b> {{are one of}} {{the major}} energy {{consuming}} appliances in the household environment, {{a great deal of attention}} has been paid to improve their efficiency throughout the world. In order to reduce their energy consumption, cost effective policy and strategies, such as energy efficiency standards and labels are in place for a number of countries and several other countries are in the processes of establishing these strategies. To attain standards and labels, an appliance grading or rating system must be established to demonstrate the products performance in the most comprehensive way. The grading or rating system provides a clear idea to consumers about the products’ energy performance.

Stand-alone refrigerator or freezer units are best for storage needs. With retail pharmacies now playing a major role in pneumonia, influenza and shingles immunization programs, the value of critical vaccines being stored in pharmacy refrigerators has reached a new high. In fact, it is not uncommon for many pharmacies to now have over $100,000 of product in a single refrigerator during peak seasons.|$|E

When the <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> door is opened, the moist warm ambient air enters into the cooler cabinets. The warm moisture gets cool and forms ice. On the other hand, during the defrosting system, the ice is warm up and defrosted.

40|$|A linear {{compressor}} for {{a domestic}} <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> has {{energy saving potential}} compared with a reciprocating compressor because of a low friction loss and free piston system. A linear compressor can control the piston stroke since {{it does not have}} mechanical restriction of piston movement. Therefore, the energy consumption of a domestic <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> using a linear compressor can be reduced by changing the cooling capacity of the compressor. In order to investigate the performance of a <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> with parallel evaporators using a linear compressor and the relation between cooling capacity of the linear compressor and cooling load, experimental simulation is conducted with variation of the capacity of a linear compressor, an ambient temperature, and cooling load. In addition, the power consumption of a linear compressor is compared to that of an inverter reciprocating compressor in a <b>refrigerator-freezer.</b> The performance of a linear compressor is measured with variation of the capacity of a linear compressor from 60 % to 100 % of the maximum capacity in a <b>refrigerator-freezer.</b> Based on the experimental data, the power consumption of a linear compressor is reduced by 22. 4 % with 70 % capacity compared to 100 % but on-time ratio is increased by 12. 8 %...|$|E

Malaysian authority is considering implementing minimum energy efficiency standards for <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> sometime in the coming year. This paper attempts to analyze cost-benefit of implementing minimum energy efficiency standards for household refrigerator-freezers in Malaysia. The calculations were made based on growth of ownership data for refrigerators in Malaysian households. The number of <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> has increased from 175, 842 units in 1970 to 4, 196, 486 in 2000 and it will be about 11, 293, 043 in the year of 2020. Meanwhile it has accounted for about 26. 3 of electricity consumption in a single household.

40|$|In the {{development}} of effective product efficiency policy, the critical element for policy makers is comprehensive, independent information. However, easily accessible, reliable information on the energy performance of products and policies is often scarce within a particular market, and rarer still if the policy maker is seeking comparisons on an international level. This article presents a method (Mapping & Benchmarking) to compare energy efficiency of products across countries, and the results for 3 products: refrigerators–freezers, washing machines and laundry driers. The results show an improvement of the efficiency over time for these products. However, part of this improvement is due to increased capacity of the products and not to lower energy consumption. Therefore policy makers should consider {{the development}} of policies based on product energy consumption and not (only) on product efficiency in order to capture the full potential of technology improvements for energy savings.

40|$|The results {{presented}} here were obtained during Phase 4 {{of the first}} CRADA, which had the specific objective of determining the lifetime of superinsulations when installed in simulated refrigerator doors. The second CRADA was established to evaluate and test design concepts proposed to significantly reduce energy consumption in a <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> that is representative of approximately 60 % of the US market. The stated goal of this CRADA is to demonstrate advanced technologies which reduce, by 50 %, the 1993 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) standard energy consumption for a 20 ft{sup 3 } (570 L) top-mount, automatic-defrost, <b>refrigerator-freezer.</b> For a unit this size, the goal translates to an energy consumption of 1. 003 kWh/d.

In order to do so, we have tested six household refrigerator-freezers of different capacities and brands in the laboratory. Using response surface methodology (RSM), we developed a mathematical model to co-relate energy consumption as a function of room temperature, thermostat setting positions, and door opening. Finally, modelled energy consumption was compared with the ISO specified standard energy consumption and field energy consumption to justify the possibilities of introducing ISO <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> energy test procedure in Malaysia.

50|$|A vapor {{compression}} {{cycle is}} used in most household refrigerators, <b>refrigerator-freezers</b> and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below {{the temperature of the}} refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the condenser; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as auto-refrigeration. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment ("box air") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.|$|R
40|$|In {{almost all}} {{domestic}} refrigerators-freezers all components are {{assembled in the}} same relative position since several years ago. It is also known that the condenser releases heat at high temperatures (first law of thermodynamics) {{as well as the}} compressor. This heat is rejected to the environment in almost all practical situations partially by natural air convection. However, part of it is due to thermal radiation that causes an overheating of the <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> surfaces adjacent to those equipments. As a consequence there are more heat gains to the <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> through these surfaces and hence higher air temperatures inside. This paper describes how a simple technique can be very useful in order to minimize that part of heat transfer by radiation. The improvement is achieved by placing a radiation shield - a sheet of aluminium foil - over the surfaces close to the condenser and the compressor. For validating this technique a <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> was monitored with thermocouples for the measurements of the inside air temperatures in two situations: with and without the radiation shield. Results show that with this practice the average inside air temperatures in the <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> could decrease to about 2 K. An available commercial code was used in order to simulate the air temperature distribution and air velocities inside the refrigerator cabinet in both situations. Results from the experimental apparatus and from simulations show that there is a good agreement between them which validates the experiments carried out. Also an available commercial code, the Fluent, was used to simulate the internal air temperature in both situations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years, {{government}} regulations for energy standards, coupled with the utility industry`s promotion of energy-efficient appliances, have prompted appliance manufacturers to reduce energy consumption in refrigerator-freezers by approximately 40 %. Global concerns over ozone depletion have also required the appliance industry to eliminate CFC- 12 and CFC- 11 while concurrently improving energy efficiency to reduce greenhouse emissions. In response to expected future regulations that will be more stringent, several design options were investigated for improving the energy efficiency of a conventionally designed, domestic <b>refrigerator-freezer.</b> The options, such as cabinet and door insulation improvements and a high-efficiency compressor were incorporated into a prototype <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> cabinet and refrigeration system. Baseline energy consumption of the original 1996 production <b>refrigerator-freezer,</b> along with cabinet heat load and compressor calorimeter test results, were extensively documented to provide a firm basis for experimentally measured energy savings.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the effect of frost fonnation on the perfonnance evaporator coils typically found in domestic <b>refrigerator-freezers.</b> The effect of fin spacing on evaporator perfonnance was also studied. The study was carried out by setting the conditions of air inlet temperature, air inlet relative humidity, and refrigerant inlet temperature, and by varying the volumetric airflow rate over a wide range to study its effect on the evaporator overall heat transfer coefficient and the evaporator pressure drop. These values were monitored while frost accumulated on the evaporator over a ten hour period. The data was modeled using a least-squares curve fit where the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop were taken to be functions of the airflow rate and the mass of accumulated frost. Using a characteristic fan curve and the models for the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop, conditions closely emulating actual systems were simulated and the actual variation of heat transfer coefficient as a function of accumulated frost was found It showed the expected trend of rising to a point and then dropping off. The overall heat transfer coefficient increased up to 40 % of its starting value and was reached after the airflow rate had decreased to about 70 % of its starting value. These were dependent on the fan characteristic curve that was used. The effect of fin spacing was studied by comparing a 5 fin per inch evaporator to a 2. 5 fin per inch evaporator. The overall heat transfer coefficient was found to be directly proportional to the air-side surface area but the amount of frost deposited did not show this trend.

However, the maximum energy savings and CO 2 emissions reduction achievable via minimum efficiency performance standards (MEPS) has not yet been fully characterized. The Bottom Up Energy Analysis System (BUENAS), first developed in 2007, is a global, generic, and modular tool designed to provide policy makers with estimates of potential impacts resulting from MEPS for a variety of products, at the international and/or regional level. Using the BUENAS framework, we estimated potential national energy savings and CO 2 emissions mitigation in the US residential sector that would result from the most aggressive policy foreseeable: standards effective in 2014 set at the current maximum technology (Max Tech) available on the market. This represents the most likely characterization of what can be maximally achieved through MEPS in the US. The authors rely on the latest Technical Support Documents and Analytical Tools published by the U. S.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{improvements in}} end-uses constitute a large potential to curb primary energy demand {{into a more}} sustainable direction. This thesis addresses some of the challenges for policy measures that tap into that potential (minimum efficiency performance standards (MEPS) and energy labels) and investigates how these measures can be made more effective and efficient. Both MEPS and energy labels can become more effective by: •Countries learning from each other’s policies. This thesis demonstrates a method, mapping and benchmarking, how to compare energy efficiency levels across countries. Three products have been benchmarked and an improvement {{has been shown in}} efficiency over time in all countries for which data was collected. The mapping of these products for the EU shows large energy efficiency potential: between 37 % and 63 %. Furthermore, the dynamic aspect of policies, i. e. the regular update of MEPS and energy labels, seems to be more important in improving efficiency than the choice of a specific policy. •Applying experience curves in life cycle cost (LCC) calculations. Experience curves provide an estimate for the experience ratio, the reduction in costs when cumulative production volume is doubled. Currently prices used in LCC calculation are mostly overestimated. Using experience curves provides more realistic, lower price estimates and thereby results in more stringent MEPS levels. For the EU Ecodesign scheme additional savings were estimated to be more than 140 % for laundry driers and 100 % for <b>refrigerator-freezers.</b> •Using a top runner approach that allows for more stringent MEPS, regarding level and/or timing. Furthermore, the top runner approach can be used as an alternative for products were the price does not relate to the energy efficiency and therefore LCC calculations can not guide the setting of MEPS. This thesis shows that for 15 consumer electronic and information and communication products price does not relate to the efficiency of the product if also performance and time are taken into account. For these products, the MEPS level can be set by the level of ambition of the policy, and the average price decrease of the product guides the entry into force date of the measure. The process of preparing and adopting MEPS and energy labels can be made more efficient by: •Using the concept of the policy action window (PAW) to make the overall process more efficient by avoiding spending time on policy measures for products that improve efficiency fast enough without measures. Since the process of preparation and adoption of product efficiency measures can easily take three years or more, policy makers should be cautious in preparing measures that have a PAW of less than three years. •Applying a horizontal approach where in one measure MEPS are set for a single functional aspect for a large number of products. •Taking into account characteristics of the product allowing for better tuning the process. Products that have a lower than average technical complexity and political sensitivity could have a shorter process. A shorter process results in more savings, because measures can come into force earlier...|$|R

Improvement is mainly related to the possibility in increasing evaporation temperature during fresh food compartment operation. The present paper describes prototype of SDE <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> charged with R 600 a and equipped with variable speed compressor. To exploit main advantage of the SDE cycle experiments focus on the fresh food loop operation. Results at various compressor speeds are discussed and analyzed by the means of second law analysis {{in order to identify}} losses in each component in the loop. Major part of losses are observed in the compressor and in fresh food compartment evaporator, over 40 % and 23 % of available energy even at most favorable minimum compressor speed. The paper proposes modification of the fresh food compartment evaporator design by implementing slab with phase-change material which increases COP at maximum by 8 % at 1600 RPM. However, results of numerical simulation also demonstrate that join change on the evaporator and condenser side brings COP improvements up to 50 %...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the effects of}} different operating variables on energy consumption of <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> that had two phases. The first phase is to investigate {{the effects of the}} number of door opening, duration of each door remain open, ambient temperature, cabinet load and thermostat setting position on energy consumption during the open door conditions. The second phase is to investigate the effects of the ambient temperature, cabinet load, thermostat setting position and open surface water pan area inside the cabinet on energy consumption during the closed door conditions. All the experiments were conducted in the environmental controlled chamber. The result shows that there is a great influence of different variables on energy consumption and average consumption is about 3. 3 kWh day - 1. The effects of number of door opening, ambient temperature and cabinet load are more compared to the others. The open door energy consumption is 40 % more compared to the closed door test. It is found that the average of the maximum energy consumption is 27. 3 % more compared to average consumption and 55. 6 % more compared to average of the minimum consumption. If the users be serious, a significant amount of energy could be saved with the proper utilization of <b>refrigerator-freezer...</b>|$|E
