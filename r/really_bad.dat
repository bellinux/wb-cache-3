The circumstances of the last record {{and the way that}} we worked was <b>really</b> <b>bad.</b>|$|E
25|$|Panic {{disorder}} is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or {{a feeling that}} something <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> is going to happen. The maximum degree of symptoms occurs within minutes. There may be ongoing worries about having further attacks and avoidance of places where attacks {{have occurred in the}} past.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that there}} is a big {{difference}} between pool types. Indoor pools of 25 m give the advantage of being able to use the turning point to push off again using ones legs, thus giving a clear advantage over 50 m and of course open water venues. Open sea gives the <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> side effect of large waves and the tides, which will sometimes push the swimmer back to where they came from, this can be clearly seen in the differences in times between the Channel crossing and the almost double in length Maraton Acuatica Rio Coronda which she performed in two hours less.|$|E

25|$|Macleod {{returned}} to the shadow cabinet under Home after the 1964 election. His remit of opposing steel nationalisation came to naught as given his tiny majority Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson did not proceed with this measure. Macleod’s speech opposing steel nationalisation had been trailed as his comeback to frontline politics, but in the event was a damp squib. Nigel Fisher wrote {{that it was the}} only <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> speech of his career. Macleod did not contest the first ever Conservative Party leadership election in 1965, but backed Edward Heath, whom he did not particularly like but thought would be a better leader than Maudling. He expected to have received 40-45 votes had he stood.|$|E
25|$|In late 1976 McCarthy was {{approached}} by manager Fr. Harry Bohan to become the new coach of the Clare senior hurlers. McCarthy accepted the offer, a decision which {{came as a surprise}} to many people in Cork. His first season in charge was a successful one from the very beginning. Clare had had a good National League campaign and qualified for the final in 1977. Kilkenny, the reigning champions and victors over Clare in the final of 1976, provided the opposition on this occasion and an interesting game ensued. Clare's ability to get goals at crucial times proved vital and they claimed the 2–8 to 0–9 victory. With this victory under their belt Clare were widely tipped for success in the provincial championship. The team did reach the Munster final that year where McCarthy's native county of Cork provided the opposition. Clare got off to a <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> start when they conceded a penalty after seventy-five seconds which was duly converted by Tim Crowley. Instead of crumbling Clare battled back and really put Cork to the pin of their collar. At half-time they trailed by only one point, however, they were reduced to fourteen men after Jim Power was sent off. The second-half was another interesting tussle, however, Cork won by 4–15 to 4–10.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, due to uneven {{scheduling}} {{that left}} out new AAWU members Oregon and Oregon State, UCLA was 3–1 in conference games and 8-1 overall. The Bruins lost only one game, at Washington 16–3. USC was 5–0, but lost out of conference to Miami (Florida). It was widely {{assumed that the}} winner of the 1966 game between 8th ranked UCLA and 7th ranked USC would go to the 1967 Rose Bowl. UCLA star QB Gary Beban was out with a broken ankle, but backup Norman Dow, making his first and only start at QB, led UCLA to a 14–7 win. A vote the next Monday among the AAWU conference athletic directors put USC in the Rose Bowl. It was speculated that this was to make up for 1964 when Oregon State (8-2 overall, 4-1 in conference) was voted in ahead of USC (7-3 overall, 4-1 in conference) despite USC's 20-17 upset of #1 Notre Dame in the season's final game; the Oregon State coach at the time was Tommy Prothro, who became UCLA's coach in 1965. In addition, the directors believed Beban could not play for UCLA in the Rose Bowl due to the broken ankle, thereby giving the Big 10 representative (Purdue) a better chance to win. UCLA students protested by blocking the Northbound lanes of I-405 at Wilshire Boulevard. A week after the vote, USC made the voters look <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> as they lost to Notre Dame 51–0. This still stands as the worst defeat in USC Trojan football history. USC entered the Rose Bowl unranked and lost to Purdue, 14–13. Ironically, Beban's ankle had healed and he could have played. UCLA finished fifth in both polls.|$|E

Lohan admitted herself to the Wonderland Center rehabilitation facility for a 30-day stay, though she continued shooting the film, returning to the facility at night. Shortly thereafter, Lohan withdrew from a film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance, her publicist stating that Lohan needed to [...] "focus on getting better."

[...] He said, [...] "Patrick is the definition of stupid and his antics will have you laughing out loud." [...] In a review published in 2007, Peter Keepnews of The New York Times said, [...] "Patrick is a popular character, and the new episodes illustrate why: He is unfailingly enthusiastic, touchingly loyal and absolutely undeterred by his intellectual limitations.

In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: [...] "... there'll be some <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism."

500|$|According to Mulligan, {{a problem}} during the {{production}} {{was that her}} role required her to drive: {{at the time she}} {{did not know how to}} drive or have a driver's licence. She did a two-week intensive course to learn how to work a manual gear change so she could eventually film the driving scenes, but failed the driving test. [...] "I’m <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> at it", she explained. [...] " [...] no hand and eye coordination." [...] The production team ultimately had to shoot the scene on a private road, where she was allowed to get behind the wheel. The director had a hard time making Knightley look plain in the film. He tells in an interview: [...] "It was difficult. She was eager and happy to do it because the role called for it. But even at her worst, Keira still looks astonishing".|$|E

Raven wrote the song [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] about a guy who dumped her then wanted her back, and wrote the song [...] "Sometimes" [...] when she was having a <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> day and wanted to just [...] "get it out".|$|E
