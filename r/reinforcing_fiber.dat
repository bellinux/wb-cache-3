50|$|Transfer molding (BrE moulding) is a {{manufacturing}} process where casting material is {{forced into a}} mold. Transfer molding is different from compression molding in that the mold is enclosed Hayward rather than open to the fill plunger resulting in higher dimensional tolerances and less environmental impact. Compared to injection molding, transfer molding uses higher pressures to uniformly fill the mold cavity. This allows thicker <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fiber</b> matrices to be more completely saturated by resin. Furthermore, unlike injection molding the transfer mold casting material may start the process as a solid. This can reduce equipment costs and time dependency. The transfer process may have a slower fill rate than an equivalent injection molding processes.|$|E
