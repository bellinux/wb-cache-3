40|$|Background: Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{patients}} are often sedated, yet sedation assessment scales {{have not been}} thoroughly studied in this population. This project inquiry describes {{the use of the}} Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (<b>RASS)</b> in assessing sedation in TBI patients. Methods: A retrospective, descriptive analysis of 38 ventilated, sedated TBI patients was performed to describe 1) the characteristics of the study TBI population, 2) the use of the <b>RASS</b> to guide titration of sedation medication, and 3) the nursing perspective of a sedation titration protocol that includes the use of the <b>RASS.</b> Results: Prescribed <b>RASS</b> score for the study population was - 2; the actual <b>RASS</b> score was - 2. 04 +/- 1. 05. The days spent on mechanical ventilation were 3. 46 +/- 1. 95. The Injury Severity Score (ISS) correlated with sedation titration (r = - 0. 373; p<. 05). The ICD- 9 code also correlated with the <b>RASS</b> (r = - 0. 400; p< 0. 05). There was no correlation between <b>RASS</b> and sedation titration (r = - 0. 061; p = 0. 717). The majority of nurses perceived that when using the <b>RASS,</b> sedation level did not affect their feeling of accuracy of neurological assessment (56 %), and the patient's agitation level did not affect their feeling of accurate neurological assessment (58 %). Conclusion: While the degree of injury was associated with the ability of the TBI patient to maintain the prescribed <b>RASS</b> level, there was no association between the <b>RASS</b> score and sedation titration, indicating that in this small study, the <b>RASS</b> did not guide sedation titration in the TBI population. However, the time spent at the prescribed <b>RASS</b> level and days of mechanical ventilation, which was similar to reported norms, suggest that the <b>RASS</b> is an adequate tool for assessing sedation in the TBI population. From the nursing perspective, the use of the <b>RASS</b> was not a barrier in assessing sedation titration. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the use of <b>RASS</b> for assessment of sedation in TBI patients. Additional prospective studies are necessary to fully understand the ability of the <b>RASS</b> to guide sedation titration...|$|R

However, the <b>RASS</b> did not possess the organizational capacity to manage the volumes of food aid allocated to it, resulting in periodic misuse of donated food items.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1952 and 1975 <b>Rasser</b> also {{starred in}} one-man {{programs}} in southern Germany and Switzerland, among other things, as {{member of the}} Fauteuil ensemble in Basel. His son Roland founded the theater in 1957, where <b>Rasser</b> had his last great appearance in the revue [...] "Offenbach am Spalenberg" [...] in 1976.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, he premiered at the Stadttheater Basel, {{among others}} in Robert Cedric Sheriffs [...] "Die andere Seite" [...] and in Stravinsky's ballets [...] "Petrushka" [...] and [...] "Pulcinella". In the war year of 1940 <b>Rasser</b> also starred at the Corso-Theater {{at the present}} Bellevueplatz in Zürich in Gilberte de Courgenay. At the Bernhard-Theater Zürich, and at the Schauspielhaus Zürich <b>Rasser</b> {{appeared}} in comedies and classic dramas. <b>Rasser</b> played on numerous Swiss theaters, including {{the role of the}} frog in Johann Strauss' Die Fledermaus in Lausanne and at the Opéra du Rhin in Strasbourg in 1961, and in 1963 in Gogol's [...] "The Government Inspector". <b>Rasser</b> also appeared with Charles F.

5000|$|But above all, <b>Rasser</b> was {{a popular}} cabaret artist and comedian: In 1935 he joined the newly founded Cabaret Resslirytti Basel, for the first program of his later most popular role of Theophil Läppli. From 1935 to 1941 <b>Rasser</b> belonged with a short {{interruption}} to the ensemble of the Cabaret Cornichon in Zürich, where he stood out in particular through its parodies of Basel arrogance and independent line. In 1943 <b>Rasser</b> founded in Basel the satirical political Kabaret Kactus which became very successful. On 31 December 1945, written and produced by <b>Rasser</b> HD-Soldat Läppli premiered, a mixture of cabaret and folk theater, which was so successful that the production had {{to move into the}} larger Küchlin Theater. Jaroslav Hašek's The Good Soldier Švejk modeled the figure of the Swiss Army subsidiary soldier Theophil Läppli - militarism mocking, it became Rasser's trademark. This was followed by the comedy [...] "Demokrat Läppli" [...] (1947) and, with little success, by the musical [...] "Weltenbürger Läppli" [...] (1949). Besides, <b>Rasser</b> played with the Kabaret Kactus number cabaret and directed his Swiss German version of Mary Chase's Harvey starring himself in 1950. In 1958 Eynar Grabowsky organized a tour with the comedy [...] "Millionär Läppli", and in 1969 followed by the popular play [...] "Zivilverteidiger Läppli". <b>Rasser</b> participated in several Swiss films: [...] "HD-Soldat Läppli" [...] (1960) and [...] "Demokrat Läppli" [...] (1961) were filmed for the cinema.|$|E
50|$|<b>RASS</b> {{was set up}} by the SPLA-Nasir/United, almost {{immediately}} after the revolt inside the 1991 Sudan People's Liberation Army against the leadership of Dr. John Garang. <b>RASS</b> remained closely tied to the SPLA-Nasir military structure and only worked in areas under the control of Riek Machar's forces. <b>RASS</b> staff were generally former fighters and commanders of the movement. During its early phase, <b>RASS</b> was headed by Riek Gai Kok. Later, Timothy Tutlam took over as <b>RASS</b> director. He remained in this position until he died in the 1998 Sudan Air Force crash.|$|R
30|$|This {{study found}} a {{correlation}} between the <b>RASS</b> and also the FeSevo or MAC of sevoflurane.

50|$|The {{vertical}} resolution of <b>RASS</b> data {{is determined by}} the pulse length(s) used by the radar. <b>RASS</b> sampling is usually performed with a 60 to 100 meter pulse length. Because of atmospheric attenuation of the acoustic signals at the <b>RASS</b> frequencies used by boundary layer radar wind profilers, the altitude range that can be sampled is usually 0.1 to 1.5 km, depending on atmospheric conditions (e.g., high wind velocities tend to limit <b>RASS</b> altitude coverage to a few hundred meters because the acoustic signals are blown out of the radar beam).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (<b>RASS)</b> is {{a single}} tool that is intuitive, is easy to use, and {{includes}} both agitation and sedation. The <b>RASS</b> has never been formally validated for pediatric populations. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess inter-rater agreement and criterion validity of the <b>RASS</b> in critically ill children. Methods To evaluate validity, the <b>RASS</b> score was compared to both a visual analog scale (VAS) scored by the patient’s nurse, and the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS), performed by a researcher. The nurse completed the VAS by drawing a single line on a 10 -cm scale anchored by “unresponsive” and “combative. ” The UMSS was used to validate the sedation portion of the <b>RASS</b> only, as it does not include grades of agitation. For inter-rater agreement, one researcher and the patient’s nurse simultaneously but independently scored the <b>RASS.</b> Results One hundred patient encounters were obtained from 50 unique patients, ages 2  months to 21  years. Of these, 27 assessments were on children who were mechanically ventilated and 73 were on children who were spontaneously breathing. In validity testing, the <b>RASS</b> was highly correlated with the nurse’s VAS (Spearman correlation coefficient 0. 810, p[*]<[*]. 0001) and with the UMSS (weighted kappa 0. 902, p[*]<[*]. 0001). Inter-rater agreement between nurse- and researcher-assessed <b>RASS</b> was excellent, with weighted kappa of 0. 825 (p[*]<[*]. 0001). Conclusions The <b>RASS</b> is a valid responsiveness tool for use in critically ill children. It allows for accurate assessment of awareness in mechanically ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients, and may improve our ability to titrate sedatives and assess for delirium in pediatrics...|$|R
50|$|Alfred <b>Rasser</b> (29 May 1907 - 18 August 1977) was a Swiss comedian, radio personality, {{and stage}} and film actor {{starring}} usually in Swiss German language cinema and television and stage productions, {{but he also}} became as Theophil Läppli, a parody on the Swiss militarismn.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} Läppli films, Alfred <b>Rasser</b> starred in German {{language}} films, among others in Füsilier Wipf in 1938 and the Ueli {{films in the}} 1940s, but also Wilhelm Tell in 1960 and Die plötzliche Einsamkeit des Konrad Steiner (The Sudden Loneliness of Konrad Steiner) in 1976.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rasser</b> {{was part}} of a Swiss {{cultural}} delegation to China in 1954/55 and this led to his being branded a [...] "communist" [...] by Swiss nationalists.

40|$|A {{valid and}} {{reliable}} scale for assessing level of sedation would facilitate appropriate sedation management in a porcine intensive care unit (ICU) model. The Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale (<b>RASS)</b> is used often for human ICU patients. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate the content validity of the modified <b>RASS</b> for use in sedated, mechanically ventilated swine. The modified <b>RASS</b> includes descriptors specific for swine. A content validity assessment form was developed with 4 items and 5 response choices to assess the modified <b>RASS</b> for relevancy, sufficiency, clarity, and representativeness. The modified <b>RASS</b> and content validity assessment form were emailed to 23 veterinarians with experience in the care of swine or other large animals; participants judged the extent to which the modified <b>RASS</b> is valid for assessing sedation in mechanically ventilated critically ill swine. The criterion for acceptable validity evidence was a content validity index (CVI) of 0. 80 or greater. Eight (67 %) of 12 veterinarians who responded to the invitation to participate completed the assessment form. The item CVI varied from 0. 50 to 0. 88; scale CVI was 0. 66. Because these values did not meet the a priori criterion, we concluded that the modified <b>RASS</b> does not have sufficient evidence of content validity for use with swine. The reliability of the modified <b>RASS</b> will be tested in the porcine ICU model, and experience with its use in swine will inform refinement of the scale descriptors for repeat assessment of content validity...|$|R
