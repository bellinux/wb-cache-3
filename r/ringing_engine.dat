40|$|Thermal {{energy flow}} within the piston {{of an air}} cooled engine was {{investigated}} by measuring the heat flux in the engine cylinder liner {{in the region of}} travel of the piston <b>rings.</b> <b>Engine</b> sump oil temperature and oil viscosity were varied to change the piston ring heat flow by altering the oil film between the cylinder wall and piston <b>ring.</b> <b>Engine</b> load was varied to change heat flow into the piston. Also, the crankcase oil splash cooling of the piston was varied to change heat flow leaving the piston. When sump oil temperature was reduced, more heat flowed to the cooler sump. Changes in oil viscosity had little effect on the cylinder wall heat flow but increased cylinder wall temperature due to an increase in frictional heating with lower oil viscosity. It was thus determined that this change in heat flow was due to the change in sump oil temperature and was not due to a change in oil film characteristics. A decrease in engine load decreased the average temperature and heat flux in the cylinder wall. The largest decrease in heat flux was on the exhaust side of the engine where the largest fraction of cylinder heat is convected to the external airflow. It was found that the change in heat flux caused by the decrease in engine load was likely due to a change in the piston ring pack heat flow. For changes in the crankcase oil splash cooling of the piston, there were only small changes in average temperature and no changes in the heat flux. Although the piston was still believed to lose heat to the crankcase oil splash, its percentage of piston heat loss was too small to affect piston ring pack heat flow. Superposition was evaluated for sump oil temperature and engine load as well as sump oil temperature and oil viscosity. In both cases, significant error was found with the linear superposition assumption. Linear superposition was assumed not to hold for these complex heat flows...|$|R

Results show that seal working time of free-piston ring is longer than conventional engine's during a cycle time, but the leakage loss is lower. Besides, the oil film thickness of piston <b>ring</b> in free-piston <b>engine</b> is thinner than that of crankshaft engine just around TDC, but other position is thicker. Moreover friction forces and friction work of piston <b>ring</b> in two <b>engines</b> are almost equivalent, but the peak friction power of free-piston engine is larger than crankshaft engine...|$|R

40|$|Although the World Wide Web is popularly {{referred}} to as “cyberspace”, {{the extent to which}} it constitutes a space in the everyday sense of the word is questionable. While looking for information on the Web, regular users are quickly lost in the cyberspace. Hence, it is important that one be able to categorize, understand and present Web data efficiently to the users. The structure of the World Wide Web can be modeled as a graph: the nodes are HTML pages, and a hyperlink from one page to another is represented as a directed edge. However, trees have much simpler structures than graphs, which make it easier to display trees in an aesthetically pleasing manner. In this paper we present a novel Web browsing and visualization method with an innovative combination of features: (i) Web data is retrieved and displayed in real-time (i. e. Web data is not pre-recorded), (ii) browsing and visualization are synchronized together in the same interface, (iii) tree-based visualization engine, (iv) space-efficient display of visualization, and (v) the amount of resources needed from the host computer is limited. In addition, the tree-based <b>rings</b> <b>engine</b> used to create the visualization displays the information in a smaller area than previous systems, thus either taking smaller screen space or displaying more information to the user.

One conceivable working process was planed with a Gantt-table. A decision was made that the work of the Camcoil should be separated in several details. Earlier work on Camcoil was study to increase our understanding for the work. Some of the examined parts were shaft dimensions, bearings, head shape, tripod, support function and hydraulic cylinder for the capstan and support. Some of the calculations have been made in Ansys.
