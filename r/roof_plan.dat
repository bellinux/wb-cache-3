50|$|Construction resumed in 1871, {{with the}} upper floor and <b>roof</b> <b>plan</b> and {{sections}} substantially revised {{under the direction}} of the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Alfred B. Mullett (1834-1890), the designer of the Old Executive Office Building in Washington, DC, and many other federal buildings nationwide. Construction of the U.S. Custom House was completed in 1881.|$|E
50|$|Van Schaick House is a {{historic}} home located on Van Schaick Island at Cohoes in Albany County, New York. It was built about 1735 and is a -story, brick dwelling with a gambrel <b>roof.</b> <b>Plans</b> were made at the mansion for the Battle of Saratoga {{and the house was}} used by Governor Clinton as the New York State Capitol from August 22 to 25, 1777.|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} detail to which a roof system is {{engineered}} varies greatly among engineers. At a bare minimum, the <b>roof</b> framing <b>plans</b> should show the rafter layout, specify the size and spacing of the rafters, and specify the allowable span of the rafters. Some engineers today provide only this minimal amount of detail on the <b>roof</b> framing <b>plans</b> they generate. Other engineers provide a much higher degree of detail. In addition to the items mentioned above, they show the location of all roof supports (i.e. struts) and show all purlins with dimensions to tie down their location. Generally speaking, the more detailed the <b>roof</b> framing <b>plan,</b> the higher quality the roof frame engineering.|$|R
50|$|The Greeks Gate was {{restored}} between January and June 2003 by the Restoration Unit of the Ministry for Resources and Infrastructure.

50|$|Clifton is a {{historic}} mansion located at Roslyn Harbor in Nassau County, New York. The main house is a large, -story, Flemish Revival building constructed about 1863 and altered twice between 1876 and 1932. It features a complex <b>roof</b> <b>plan,</b> including numerous gables in the forms of cross gables, wall dormers and roof dormers, {{most of which are}} Flemish gables with bold molding. Also on the property are a contributing boathouse and rustic gazebo.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Virgil Cox House is a {{historic}} home located at Galax, Virginia. It was built about 1913, and is a large 2 1/2-story frame dwelling with Queen Anne and Colonial Revival style design elements. It has a complex exterior presentation, complex <b>roof</b> <b>plan,</b> and an equally complex floorplan. The house is sheathed in German siding and features irregular, front-gable projections on the facade and north side; a projection with a polygonal bay on the southwest corner, a gable-roof dormer on the facade; and a small, upper balcony on the facade with attenuated Tuscan columns and pilasters. Also on the property are a contributing boxwood garden and outbuilding.|$|E
50|$|The only Framing Square {{that has}} tables for unequal pitched roofs is the Chappell Universal Square, (patent #7,958,645). There {{is also a}} {{comprehensive}} rafter table for 6 & 8 sided polygon roofs (first time ever on a framing square).The traditional steel square's rafter table (patented April 23,1901) is limited in {{that it does not}} have tables that allow for work with unequal pitched roofs. Irregular hip/valley rafters are characterized by plan angles that are not equal or 45°. The top plates can be 90° at the outside corners or various other angles. There are numerous irregular h/v <b>roof</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{architect}} August Soller {{completed the}} original design in 1845. He planned a front facade with two towers, with Gothic elements, which he later abandoned. The plan envisioned the church would {{take the form of}} a [...] "Zentralbau", but he later extended it into a hall church. As a result of the abandonment of the double-tower facade, the church now lacked a clearly visible profile. This could not be provided by the heavy octagonal <b>roof</b> <b>planned</b> for the cupola, so Soller substituted a domed tower, in accordance with earlier architectural models and the wishes of Frederick William IV.|$|R

The property's garage, which is stylistically similar to the house, may be one of the oldest in the city.|$|E

5|$|By early 1997, {{after almost}} two decades of activity, the only repairs {{completed}} were phase one of the air ventilation system to dehumidify the hollow base, the drainage pipes and a new inner <b>roof.</b> <b>Plans</b> now included the erection of a temporary two-story metal building to protect all but the giant Father Time from the harsh winters and to facilitate year-round repair; the reinforcement of corroded steel interior portions; the replacement of inconsistent patches; the substitution of engineered spacing for natural cracks, and finally, hand-brushed concrete recoating. The temporary building was budgeted at $270,000; the city spent a total of $450,000 on repairs approved by the Park District that year.|$|R

40|$|Accessibility of safe {{drinking}} water is a serious constraint in Auchi and its environs. This region mainly depends on rainwater and groundwater exploration. Sensitivity simulation analysis using structured IWRM model shows {{that there is a}} strong relationship with the rainfall, rainwater capture and <b>roof</b> <b>plan</b> size (RPS). Average annual rainfall of 1430 mm and 1600 mm simulated with varying <b>roof</b> <b>plan</b> surfaces (RPS) of 100 m 2, 250 m 2; 500 m 2; 1000 m 2; and 2000 m 2 produced RWHI index of 0. 1, 0. 24, 0. 47, 0. 94 and 1. 89 respectively. Simulation output indicated that an average of 5, 300 m 3 /day of rainwater were harvestable and this value of water could only meet daily water demand of 40, 769 people. The output of statistics metrics shows a perfect match (RPS) and harvested rainwater as R 2 = 0. 78; 0. 77 and r. m. s of 0. 100 respectively. The overall result shows that if the potential of rainwater harvest is fully-harnessed, that will reduce the water stress and constrain in Auchi. ...|$|E
40|$|Shortage in {{supply of}} water for potable and non-potable {{applications}} and exponential world population increase is a strong constrain to Human Development Index and social-economic advancement in Nigeria. ClimGen (Version 4. 1. 05) was used to simulate and create large dataset of annual rainfall depth. Generated average annual rainfall from 1430 mm to 1600 mm was subjected to varying <b>roof</b> <b>plan</b> surfaces of 250 m 2; 500 m 2; 1000 m 2; and 2000 m 2 respectively. Simulation analysis showed that an average of 5, 300 m 3 of rainwater was harvestable and this value of water could only meet water demand of 170 people annually. The relationship of <b>roof</b> <b>plan</b> surface (RPS) and collected rainwater is very strong with R 2 = 0. 84 and 0. 95 respectively. Again, the volume of groundwater withdrawal increased from 12. 4 × 10 4 m 3 to 32. 7 × 10 4 m 3, this could only meet an annual water demand for 10, 480 people representing about 6. 2...|$|E

40|$|Natural hazards risk {{assessment}} requires {{data on the}} built environment. This paper reports an image analysis method that can extract building features, mainly <b>roof</b> <b>plan</b> areas, for potential vulnerability analysis. Both pixel- and object-based image processing methods are adopted. First, red/green/blue colour bands and image textures are incorporated in a supervised artificial neural network classifier to achieve good classification results of individual roofs. Second, within object-based methods a hybrid of region and edge segmentations using colours and shapes is employed to extract useful spatial information of salient ground objects. Finally, the extracted spatial information is used to refine the pre-classified image of building roofs. An AUSIMAGE™ digital aerial image with a spatial resolution of 0. 2 m is tested. The directly extracted data include roof locations, plan areas, and perimeters. Derived data can include distances from building centroids to street centre lines, and distances between adjacent buildings. Such extracted data can greatly assist detailed bushfire, hail, tornado, and flood {{risk assessment}}...|$|E

50|$|The {{ground floor}} of the {{courthouse}} provided offices for government departments. However, more floor space was needed and therefore {{the decision was made}} to erect a new Government Offices Building, in line with government policy for encouraging capital works in the 1930s to overcome the effect of the Great Depression. The Government Offices Building was designed by the Department of Public Works and two staff members seem to have been involved on the project. Two drawings of the proposed building were prepared. The first set was drawn by GR Beveridge and included elevations, ceiling and <b>roof</b> <b>plans</b> and general layouts of the site and the other, by RC Nowland is a detailed floor plan.|$|R
