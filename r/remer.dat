5|$|Führer Begleitbattalion ("Führer Escort Battalion"; FBB) was a {{military}} protection unit set up just before war began. It had the task of protecting Hitler's military headquarters and accompanying him when visiting battlefronts. It also was responsible for all luggage that travelled with Hitler and his staff. It was originally commanded by then infantry colonel Erwin Rommel. Otto Ernst <b>Remer</b> went on to command an expanded FBB, which {{played a key role}} in putting down the attempted military coup against Hitler of 20 July 1944 in Berlin.|$|E

5|$|As Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin, Olbricht {{refuses to}} {{mobilize}} the Reserve Army until he knows without a doubt that Hitler is dead (if Hitler isn't dead, Olbricht will be arrested for having the reserve army mobilized without Fromm's permission). Behind Olbricht's back, Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway. With Operation Valkyrie underway, Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup. As Army soldiers begin {{to take control of}} Berlin's government ministries, including SS headquarters, mid-level officers relaying the orders begin to wonder which side they should be fighting for. Rumors reach Berlin that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Meanwhile, Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive. The General refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. Major Otto Ernst <b>Remer</b> of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "Conceptually, 'Princess Monster Wife' isn't bad, but realized on screen, its gruesome execution is too unnerving to be funny or effective." ...|$|E
500|$|Ward {{explained}} that [...] "Princess Monster Wife" [...] was conceptualized {{to be both}} a sad and funny story at the same time. The episode featured a song, [...] "Something Special", written by McHale, that {{was inspired by the}} 1992 song [...] "A Whole New World", from the animated feature film Aladdin. According to a report by Nielsen, the episode ranked as the number one telecast among all boy demographic groups, and it also received mostly positive critical reviews; Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club and Dean Childers of TV Geek Army both appreciated the focus on the Ice King. However, Justin <b>Remer</b> of DVD Talk disliked the episode because he felt its story did not translate well onto the screen.|$|E

500|$|Kesselring {{died in a}} {{sanatorium}} in Bad Nauheim in West Germany, on 16 July 1960 {{at the age of}} 74, {{following a}} heart attack. He was given a quasi-military Stahlhelm funeral and buried in Bergfriedhof Cemetery in Bad Wiessee. Members of Stahlhelm acted as his pall bearers and fired a rifle volley over his grave. His former chief of staff, Siegfried Westphal, spoke for the veterans of North Africa and Italy, describing Kesselring as [...] "a man of admirable strength of character whose care was for soldiers of all ranks". Josef Kammhuber spoke on behalf of the Luftwaffe and Bundeswehr, expressing the hope that Kesselring would be remembered for his earlier accomplishments rather than for his later activities. Also present were the former SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer Sepp Dietrich, the ex-Chancellor Franz von Papen, Generalfeldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner, Grossadmiral and former Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz, Otto <b>Remer,</b> SS Standartenführer Joachim Peiper, and former Ambassador Rudolf Rahn.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{recognizing}} {{the voice on}} the other end, <b>Remer</b> realizes that the Reserve Army has been duped—rather than containing a coup, they have unwittingly supported it. SS officers are released and the plotters in turn are besieged inside the Bendlerblock. The headquarters staff flees, but the resistance leaders are arrested. In an ultimately vain effort to save himself, General Fromm convenes an impromptu court martial, places Beck under arrest, and sentences Von Quirnheim, Olbricht, Haeften, and Stauffenberg to death, contravening Hitler's orders that they be kept alive. Given a pistol by Fromm, Beck commits suicide. That night, the ringleaders are then executed by firing squad one by one. Some distance away, General Von Tresckow commits suicide with a grenade. When Stauffenberg is about to be shot, in a last gesture of loyalty and defiance, Haeften places himself {{in the path of the}} bullets meant for Stauffenberg. When his turn arrives, Colonel Stauffenberg's last act is to cry [...] "Long live sacred Germany!" ...|$|E
500|$|Kohn {{regarded}} its visuals as {{the pinnacle}} of the show. Sava wrote {{that the notion of}} time being a flat circle could have inspired the circular shape of the inner frame. He noted the use of color beyond the circle as a way to convey the many emotions evoked for the whole of the episode. Ignoring this device, Sava saw its use as humorous diversions while it contributed to the splendor. Nussbaum described the creatures appearing in the outer frame as annotative and a mute chorus, suggesting they live in a parallel universe of both connection and isolation. The episode was later released on DVD twice, first in the year of that broadcast, as part of the Princess Day box set, and later in 2015, as part of a box set for the complete fifth season. Home video critic Justin <b>Remer</b> called [...] "Bad Timing" [...] "surprisingly devastating" [...] in DVD Talk. Kohn summed up the episode's climax as the [...] of Adventure Time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{friend of}} Gene's mother {{was also an}} {{acquaintance}} of the alluring silent film star, Rubye De <b>Remer,</b> which gave Gene {{the opportunity to meet}} Rubye and make a marked impression on her as well. [...] On Gene's behalf, Rubye in turn piqued the interest of director Clarence Brown. [...] It was early 1945 when MGM and Clarence Brown first embarked on a nationwide casting search for some fresh talent for The Yearling [...] And now months later, Clarence believed that perhaps the role of Orry Baxter might be suited for Gene. [...] So Rubye contacted Gene the day after the Paramount offer was made and persuaded her to meet with Clarence at MGM that day. [...] Despite the fact that MGM newcomer, Jacqueline White, was actually selected and had filmed some scenes that summer, Clarence was still not convinced that she was the right choice. As a result, Gene was called back three times to test for the role and eagerly awaited to hear from the studio each time. This experience earned her a $250 a week, long-term MGM contract which she signed as herself, Gene Roberts. Ultimately, Gene's youthfulness was the deciding factor that prevented MGM from assigning her this lead role. [...] When production resumed in mid-September 1945, Clarence had chosen 28-year-old Jane Wyman, who was on loan from Warner Brothers, to portray a more mature-looking character with co-star Gregory Peck. [...] The Yearling was released in May 1947 and went on to win multiple Academy Awards and nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Jane Wyman.|$|E

40|$|Abstract For {{the first}} time, {{numerous}} sequences of Copia and Gypsy retrotransposons from the Cucumis melo genome {{have been obtained}} and analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of both types of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were carried out. The melon genome con-tains approximately 20, 000 Gypsy and 6, 800 Copia elements, comprising about 26 % of its total size. Starting from a retrotransposon fragment, we have cloned and char-acterized an entire melon retrotransposon, named <b>Reme</b> 1, which is 5, 149 bp long. <b>Reme</b> 1 belongs to the Superfamily Copia retrotransposons by its protein domain order and sequence similarity to other Copia elements of dicotyledons. The haploid genome of melon (var. ‘‘Piel de Sapo’’) contains about 120 copies of <b>Reme</b> 1. Several copies of <b>Reme</b> 1 are transcriptionally active, although at low levels, in melon leaves as analyzed by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing. However, the transcript pool is considerably increased when melon leaves are treated with UV light, as has been seen for various retroelements in many organisms. The cDNAs of <b>Reme</b> 1 transcripts showed less diversity than do <b>Reme</b> 1 genomic sequences, suggesting that a subfamily of these elements is differentially responsive to UV...|$|R

The woodcut above, Fig. XXVI., {{represents}} {{the door and}} two of the lateral windows of a house in the Corte del <b>Remer,</b> facing the Grand Canal, in the parish of the Apostoli. It is remarkable as having its great entrance on the first floor, attained by a bold flight of steps, sustained on pure pointed arches wrought in brick. I cannot tell if these arches are contemporary with the building, though it must always have had an access of the kind. The rest of its aspect is Byzantine, except only that the rich sculptures of its archivolt show in combats of animals, beneath the soffit, a beginning of the Gothic fire and energy. The moulding of its plinth is of a Gothic profile,[86] and the windows are pointed, not with a reversed curve, but in a pure straight gable, very curiously contrasted with the delicate bending of the pieces of marble armor cut for the shoulders of each arch. There is a two-lighted window, such as that seen in the vignette, {{on each side of the}} door, sustained in the centre by a basket-worked Byzantine capital: the mode of covering the brick archivolt with marble, both in the windows and doorway, is precisely like that of the true Byzantine palaces.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{architecture}} for high-speed and high-capacity regular expression matching (REM) on FPGA. The proposed REM architecture, based on nondeterministic finite automaton (RE-NFA), efficiently constructs regular expression matching engines (<b>REME)</b> of arbitrary regular patterns and character classes in a uniform structure, utilizing both logic slices and block memory (BRAM) available on modern FPGA devices. The resulting circuits take advantage of synthesis and routing optimizations to achieve high operating speed and area efficiency. The uniform structure of our RE-NFA design can be stacked in {{a simple way to}} produce multi-character input circuits to scale up throughput further. An n-state m-character input <b>REME</b> takes only O (n × log 2 m) time to construct and occupies no more than O (n × m) logic units. The <b>REMEs</b> can be staged and pipelined in large numbers to achieve high parallelism without sacrificing clock frequency. Using the proposed RE-NFA architecture, we are able to implement 3 copies of two-character input <b>REMEs,</b> each with 760 regular expressions, 18715 states and 371 character classes, onto a single Xilinx Virtex 4 LX- 100 - 12 device. Each copy processes 2 characters per clock cycle at 300 MHz, resulting in a concurrent throughput of 14. 4 Gbps for 760 <b>REMEs.</b> Compared with the automatic NFA-to-VHDL <b>REME</b> compilation [13], our approach achieves over 9 x throughput efficiency (Gbps*state/LUT). Compared with state-of-the-art <b>REMEs</b> on FPGA, our approach also indicates up to 70 % better throughput efficiency...|$|R
