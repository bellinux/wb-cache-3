5|$|In the Battle of Beersheba in October 1917, it {{was again}} Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the {{critical}} role. Chetwode believed that the EEF {{did not have the}} resources to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at Beersheba, in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line. The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over waterless desert and would have to capture the town with its wells intact or be forced to retreat. The Battle of Beersheba went <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> line, but the mission was accomplished, albeit not without a mounted infantry bayonet charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade– the last of history's great cavalry charges– to capture the town and its vital water supply. Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion. For this decisive victory, and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours List.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> regional level.|$|E

Will any [...] meeting ever be permitted to express an opinion adverse <b>to</b> <b>the</b> existing Administration, when one time-serving magistrate may dissolve it at his pleasure—the death blow is given to that right, which never can be exercised efficaciously or in my opinion constitutionally, but when exercised en masse.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to these specimens, loose moa feathers have been collected from caves and rockshelters in the southern South Island, and based on these remains, {{some idea of the}} moa plumage has been achieved.
