The bill received a hearing but was left in committee.|$|E
25|$|When readers {{process a}} local ambiguity, they settle {{on one of}} the {{possible}} interpretations immediately without waiting to hear or read more words that might help decide which interpretation is correct (the behaviour is called incremental processing). If readers are surprised by the turn the sentence <b>really</b> <b>takes,</b> processing is slowed and is visible for example in reading times. Locally-ambiguous sentences have, therefore, been used as test cases to investigate the influence of a number of different factors on human sentence processing. If a factor helps readers to avoid difficulty, {{it is clear that the}} factor plays a factor in sentence processing.|$|E
25|$|There {{is almost}} nothing {{occurring}} {{most of the}} time but unison melodies and very lengthy drone basses, which is all very Armenian. It is also very modern indeed in its elegant simplicity and adamant modal integrity, being, in effect, as tight and strong in its way as a twelve-tone work of the Austrian type. There is no harmony either, and the brilliance and excitement of parts of the piano concerto were due entirely to vigor of idea. It <b>really</b> <b>takes</b> a sound musicality to invent a succession of stimulating ideas within the bounds of an unaltered mode and without shifting the home-tone.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by the {{advances}} {{being made in}} the area of localized function within the brain, Paul Broca committed much of his study to the phenomena of how speech is understood and produced. Through his study, it was discovered and expanded upon that we articulate via the left hemisphere. Broca's observations and methods are widely considered to be where neuropsychology <b>really</b> <b>takes</b> form as a recognizable and respected discipline. Armed with the understanding that specific, independent areas of the brain are responsible for articulation and understanding of speech, the brains abilities were finally being acknowledged as the complex and highly intricate organ that it is. Broca was essentially the first to fully break away from the ideas of phrenology and delve deeper into a more scientific and psychological view of the brain.|$|E

500|$|So, {{this song}} is about faith, but it's also about finding faith in other places, in the beyond, and my {{experience}} with love being something that took me up a really long time to find. So it's really psychedelic and it <b>really</b> <b>takes</b> you on a journey [...] I kinda got this lot of different inspiration from this sort of futuristic disco meets late 70s and jazz and this really really kinda gooey deep groove [...] This song is really about sex, but it's about sex on the most mythological way.|$|E

He commented, [...] "I knew {{the importance of the}} game. And it's something where, because of last year, I learned what it <b>really</b> <b>takes</b> in trying to ... kind of mellow out, not to have that sort of excitement where you can't really control everything." [...] He was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the National League Championship Series, going 2–0 in the NLCS with a 1.93 ERA and winning the series clincher on October 15 in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|... "Desperate Souls" [...] partly {{deals with}} the {{aftermath}} of Sheriff Graham's death from the previous episode. Though her character is associated with evil, actress Lana Parrilla attempted to keep Regina as human as possible. She clarified, [...] "You will see how there is a genuine love and care for Graham…There was a physical connection to the character. He did become sort of a boy toy in both worlds. But, you know, {{at the end of}} the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect. Of the episode's plot, she explained, [...] "We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold. You’re going to see how threatening that is to Regina, and, as you know, she <b>really</b> <b>takes</b> on these challenges full force." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] on March 3, 1989, it {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, journalists and academics. Taraborrelli commented that the track [...] "deserved every bit of the curiosity it generated. While being devilishly danceable, the song also shows Madonna's uncanny ability to inspire strong, conflicting emotions {{during the course of}} a single song, leaving the listener scratching his head for answers—and craving for more." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times, while writing about Madonna's re-invention of her image, observed how her sound had changed from the [...] "simple blaring dance-pop to the rich, fully rounded pop of 'Like a Prayer". Lucy O'Brien felt that the most remarkable aspect of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] was Madonna's usage of liturgical words. [...] "There is the surface meaning, forging sexuality with pop lyrics that sound so sweet. But underlying that is a rigorous mediation on prayer. In shorter words, 'Like a Prayer' <b>really</b> <b>takes</b> you there," [...] she concluded. This view was shared by Mary Cross, who wrote in her biography of Madonna that [...] "the song is a mix of the sacred and the profane. There-in lies Madonna's triumph with 'Like a Prayer'. It still sounds catchy and danceable." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it <b>really</b> <b>takes</b> a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got here tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E

[...] Barresi had several roles in mainstream film and television projects, including Perfect, Spontaneous Combustion, JAG and Father Dowling Mysteries. Barresi told Entertainment Tonight of the difficulty crossing over into mainstream film: [...] "No one <b>really</b> <b>takes</b> a porn actor seriously... and no one really respects a porn actor." ...|$|E

[...] He referred {{to talk about his}} presidential prospects as silly, and also addressed the risk of being typecast, as another young African-American politician, Harold Ford, had given the keynote address in 2000.

2500|$|Glass Wings has {{received}} several primarily negative reviews from English-speaking audiences. Writing for IGN, A.E. Sparrow comments that the [...] "stunning artwork will captivate" [...] readers, {{but that the}} book suffers from [...] "muddled dialogue" [...] and sound-effect balloons that intrude on the book's flow. Julie Rosato of Mania praises the art of Glass Wings, though she notes that the [...] "crammed pages {{made it hard to}} enjoy the character detail and almost impossible to appreciate the various emotional dynamics." [...] She criticizes the Tsubaki plotline as [...] "disjointed" [...] and the conflicts as [...] "un-relatable" [...] because of the [...] "fantastical-horror angle". She states that [...] "too much about this book moves too fast, and with too little emotional impact", leaving the reader without concern for the characters, and therefore unaffected by the stories' tragic ends. School Library Journals John Leighton states that [...] "the artwork is overdone with each figure too stylized and each article of clothing bejeweled to the max." [...] He concludes that Glass Wings [...] "has promise but never <b>really</b> <b>takes</b> off." [...] Wilma Jandoc and Jason S. Yadao, writing for Honolulu Star-Bulletin, noted it [...] "offers such a visual overload that it's easy to lose track of what's happening" [...] and that it [...] "is difficult to discern the flow of action". Its bleak endings was cited as [...] "even more difficult to digest".|$|E
