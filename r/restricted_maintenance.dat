40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{provides}} some contributions for maintenance optimization of multicomponent {{system in the}} arising context of on-line monitoring and dynamic decision-making under specific constraints. The key point is, on one hand, to develop maintenance models taking into account economic dependence and some maintenance constraints. On the other hand, {{it is important to}} provide calculation and optimization tools in order find an optimal grouped maintenance planning and to update a it in presence of a “dynamic context” which may randomly occur on-line. The modeling framework that is chosen is mainly based on reliability theory and stochastic modeling. In that way, the chapter presents firstly several models for maintenance grouping based on the rolling horizon. These models are then developed taking in consideration of maintenance constraints such as limited maintenance teams and/or <b>restricted</b> <b>maintenance</b> duration which may significantly impact the maintenance planning. The proposed models can help not only to establish an optimal grouped maintenance planning but also to efficiently update it in dynamic context (occurrence of maintenance opportunities, changes of repairmen, availability level, etc.). To reduce the computing time, optimal algorithms such as MULTIFIT, generic algorithms are implemented. Several numerical examples are also introduced to show the use and the performance of the proposed models for maintenance grouping of multicomponent systems. The application area is very large and can encompass systems in the process, production, transportation industries as well as in critical infrastructures...|$|E

This dissertation provides a historical chronology and thematic synthesis of an American Military Government command committed to a military mission which included adult education in a cultural context. Relative to prolific American indoctrination and propaganda programs, adult education retained characteristics of social education and lifelong learning, assisting first the Okinawan and ultimately the reconstruction movement in postwar Okinawa. Although Military Government was repressive in many respects, it helped destitute Okinawan adults learn critical social and vocational skills, which enabled them to assume their respective place in a symbiotic relationship with the American military. Military Government's hierarchical disposition contradicted the democratic precepts it advocated. Despite this fact, responsibility for implementing postwar democracy in the Ryukyu Islands was inherent in Military Government policy and administration. Paradoxical from its inception, this democracy was inhibited and prostrated by the impendent authority of Military Government veto. Even as Okinawa's strategic, importance coalesced, American military objectives were an inherited priority of the United States Civil Administration in the Ryukyus (USCAR). Seven years of Military Government in the Ryukyus induced significant changes in the lives of many Okinawans. Deliberate postwar recruitment of new and necessary skills and the existing intrusion of an imposing Western culture, <b>restricted</b> <b>maintenance</b> and reinforcement of traditional Ryukyuan values. With the demise of Okinawa's agriculture economy, many Okinawan adults secured employment with the American military. The reality of a wage earning economy denoted an inevitable transition for those Okinawans whose farmland had been destroyed or expropriated for base expansions. Cultural inculcation was not a consequence of disruption in the transference of the indigenous culture, so much as it was a result of particular and definitive changes which produced this disruption. In the end, there was too much disparity in the democratic message and the reality which existed in post-war Okinawa. Defective in many ways, this democracy did coordinate a comprehensive rebuilding program with opportunity and prosperity. For many Okinawans, the absurdity of a democracy administered by a Military Government command was a paradox which generated resentment and a sense of distance and isolation, and impelled the demand for a renewed alliance with Japan...|$|E

We have shown here that the DC-derived chemokine CCL 17 is present in advanced human and mouse atherosclerosis and that CCL 17 + DCs accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions. In atherosclerosis-prone mice, Ccl 17 deficiency entailed a reduction of atherosclerosis, which was dependent on Tregs. Expression of CCL 17 by DCs limited the expansion of Tregs by <b>restricting</b> their <b>maintenance</b> and precipitated atherosclerosis in a mechanism conferred by T cells.

There is a need to spend and invest more in maintenance, which is considered by the majority of Swedish industries as a necessary expense. Although about 13 % of the maintenance department time is spent on planning maintenance tasks, nevertheless, about one third of the time is spent on unplanned tasks. There is a need for more adoption of maintenance concepts such as total productive maintenance (TPM) and reliability-centred maintenance (RCM). The lack or ineffectiveness of planning and scheduling can significantly <b>restrict</b> the <b>maintenance</b> department in achieving its objectives and can thus prevent the company from maximising business profits and offering competitive advantages.

This work aimed at questioning the effects of cisplatin initial treatment on the EGFR pathway in non-small cell lung cancer and the functional consequences in vitro and in in vivo animal models of Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX). We establish here that cisplatin pretreatment specifically sensitizes wild-type EGFR expressing cells to erlotinib, contrary to what happens in mutant-EGFR cells and with a blocking EGFR antibody, both in vitro and in vivo. The sensitization entails the activation of the kinase Src upstream of EGFR, thereafter transactivating EGFR through a ligand-independent activation. We propose a combination of markers which enable to discriminate between the tumors sensitized to erlotinib or not in PDX models, that should be worth testing in patients. These markers might be useful for the selection of patients who would benefit from erlotinib as a maintenance therapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background CTCF is a {{versatile}} zinc finger DNA-binding protein that {{functions as a}} highly conserved epigenetic transcriptional regulator. CTCF is known {{to act as a}} chromosomal insulator, bind promoter regions, and facilitate long-range chromatin interactions. In mammals, CTCF is active in the regulatory regions of some genes that exhibit genomic imprinting, acting as insulator on only one parental allele to facilitate parent-specific expression. In Drosophila, CTCF acts as a chromatin insulator and is thought to be actively involved in the global organization of the genome. Results To determine whether CTCF regulates imprinting in Drosophila, we generated CTCF mutant alleles and assayed gene expression from the imprinted Dp(1;f) LJ 9 mini-X chromosome in the presence of reduced CTCF expression. We observed disruption of the maternal imprint when CTCF levels were reduced, but no effect was observed on the paternal imprint. The effect was <b>restricted</b> to <b>maintenance</b> of the imprint and was specific for the Dp(1;f) LJ 9 mini-X chromosome. Conclusions CTCF in Drosophila functions in maintaining parent-specific expression from an imprinted domain as it does in mammals. We propose that Drosophila CTCF maintains an insulator boundary on the maternal X chromosome, shielding genes from the imprint-induced silencing that occurs on the paternally inherited X chromosome.

Although gynodioecy often occurs in self-compatible species, the effect of self-pollination, inbreeding depression, and pollen limitation acting differently on females and hermaphrodites remains poorly known {{in the case of}} nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy (NCG). In this study, we model NCG in an infinite population and we study the effect of selfing rate, inbreeding depression, and pollen limitation on the maintenance of gynodioecy and on sex ratios at equilibrium. We found that selfing and inbreeding depression have a strong impact, which depends on whether restorer cost acts on male or female fitness. When cost affects male fitness, the strength of cost has no effect, whereas selfing and inbreeding depression only impact gynodioecy by modifying the value of the female advantage. When cost affects female fitness, selfing facilitates NCG and reduces the role of strength of the cost, even when no inbreeding depression occurs, whereas inbreeding depression globally <b>restricts</b> the <b>maintenance</b> of the polymorphism.

40|$|With {{the growth}} of the Internet online support groups for {{patients}} have come into existence, and this development is expected to increase. Studies have demonstrated an empowering effect from participating in these groups, which emphasises its potential as a health promoting strategy at an individual level. However, empowerment is a multi-level concept which is inconsistently defined. Inspired by the concept of transformative empowerment this thesis explores online support groups in the light of social disparity. Based on the theoretical framework of Pierre Bourdieu this thesis investigates how patients’ life conditions determine their choice of mobilising an online support group, and how the relations between the patients affect the maintenance of the social capital within the group. The empirical data consists of five semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients from an online support group, who all suffer from the same heart disease. The findings demonstrate the fundamental role of economic capital, and how the patients, through participation in the group, seek to increase their social and cultural capital, dependent on their life conditions. Furthermore the findings emphasise how an online support group allow for an individual design of each patient, according to the feeling of obligation or non-obligation to the group, and how this individual design is crucial to the maintenance of the social capital. On the other hand, the findings suggest that the textual communication can <b>restrict</b> the <b>maintenance</b> of the social capital due to differences in cultural capital between the patients. The thesis discusses the possibilities of less privileged patients to engage in these groups, the involvement of health professionals, and the potential of transformative empowerment in an online support group for patients...|$|R

The animals ad libitum and restrict fed started the experimental period by pairs and they were both slaughtered when the first reached 25 kg body weight. The body composition was estimated through the prediction equations obtained by regression of the logarithm of the amount of calcium and phosphorus in the empty body on the logarithm of the empty body weight.

In addition, adult Leydig cell numbers decline by 75 % with the remaining cells concentrated around the rete and in the sub-capsular region. In the absence of Sertoli cells, peritubular myoid cell activity is reduced but the cells retain an ability to exclude immune cells from the seminiferous tubules.
