5|$|For {{the first}} two years of the club's existence, the players {{organised}} matches among themselves at Snaresbrook near Epping Forest, probably on a part of Epping Forest between the Infant Orphan Asylum and Forest Place. Forest's first match against another club took place on 15 March 1862, and resulted in a victory over Crystal Palace (not the modern club of the same name). Both this match, and a return fixture between the two teams the following month, involved fifteen players on each team. At the time, the rules of association football had not been codified, and many variants existed, differing in the number of players per team, whether players were permitted to play the ball with their hands, or the method of scoring goals. In 1863 the Forest club was among the founder members of The Football Association (the FA) and adopted the rules set down by that body, although they continued to play occasional matches under other sets of <b>rules</b> <b>against</b> clubs not affiliated to the FA.|$|E
5|$|Tranmere Rovers {{ended the}} {{previous}} season with John McMahon as caretaker manager after manager Ronnie Moore was suspended by {{the club in}} the middle of February 2014 for breaching FA <b>rules</b> <b>against</b> betting on competitions in which his club were involved. On 6 May, 42-year old Jamaican international Ian Goodison ended his ten-year stay at Prenton Park in which he made 410 appearances and won the Player of the Season accolade three times. Also, experienced forward Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro was released. On the same day, the club offered new contracts to five players, though finally only veteran Jason Koumas agreed to sign a new one-year deal, while goalkeeper Jason Mooney, defender Ash Taylor and midfielders James Wallace and Steve Jennings left the club. Eleven players, including first-choice goalkeeper Owain Fôn Williams and Player of the Season 2013–14 Ryan Lowe already had contracts for the upcoming season. Despite that, on 19 May Lowe, whose request to sign a longer contract was refused by the club, was transferred to division rivals Bury for an undisclosed fee.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Perpetuities {{is dying}} an ignoble death. To attract trust {{business}} and the lawyers 2 ̆ 7 fees and trustees 2 ̆ 7 commissions that come with it, twenty states have abolished the Rule as applied to interests in trust. But the <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Perpetuities {{is not the only}} rule of property law that bears on trust duration. Another is the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> accumulations of income, which limits the timeframe during which a settlor may direct the trustee to accumulate and retain income in trust. For 200 years, the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> accumulations of income has lurked in the shadow of its older and more distinguished cousin, the <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Perpetuities. But with the race to abolish the <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Perpetuities, the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> accumulations of income may have newfound relevance. Perpetual trusts are more likely than ordinary trusts to involve accumulations of income in trust. Accordingly, the task for this short essay is to examine the lurking <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> accumulations of income and its potential impact on the 100 billion perpetual trust industry...|$|R

A few hours later, when Stauskas woke up, {{he said he would}} look forward to such a contest. Soon Stauskas and Curry's representatives arranged to have a showdown televised on TSN, but the contest would have been in violation of NCAA <b>rules</b> <b>against</b> competition between amateur athletes and professional athletes.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{may have}} become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he {{registered}} at the one-year-old University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages. The university, in its infancy, was established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. It had strict <b>rules</b> <b>against</b> gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students {{to choose their own}} studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate. During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased. Poe gave up on the university after a year, but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer. At some point, he started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet.|$|E
5|$|The {{requirements}} for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, {{little is known about}} what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in the sacred space. They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be celibate, but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as <b>rules</b> <b>against</b> eating the meat of an animal that represented the god. The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the Third Intermediate Period. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and {{the most important of these}} consorts, the God's Wife of Amun, even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.|$|E
