5|$|As part of {{his efforts}} to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes built– among them the central keep of the Tower of London, the White Tower. These fortifications allowed Normans to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> safety when {{threatened}} with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside. The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures.|$|E
5|$|A Predator ship uncloaks {{and several}} Predators appear. They {{retrieve}} their fallen comrade and an elite Predator presents Alexa {{with one of}} their spear weapons in recognition of her skill as a warrior symbolized by the alien blood Scar burned on her cheek before he died. As the Predators <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> space, a chestburster with a hybrid form of an Alien and a Predator erupts from Scar's chest.|$|E
5|$|After the defeats at {{the battles}} at Ostrach and Stockach, and the Army of the Danube's <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the Black Forest, the French Directory had sacked Jean Baptiste Jourdan in April 1799 and given command {{of both the}} Army of Switzerland and the Army of the Danube to André Masséna. Protecting the {{northern}} access to Zürich, Masséna gathered {{some of the best}} commanders he had available; eventually, three of them would become Marshals of France, and Tharreau, a dependable General of Division.|$|E

5|$|Billy Tate was a 14-year-old Pony Express rider {{who rode}} the express trail in Nevada near Ruby Valley. During the Paiute {{uprising}} of 1860 he was chased by {{a band of}} Paiute Indians on horseback {{and was forced to}} <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the hills behind some big rocks where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.|$|E
5|$|Nabis {{also made}} his own preparations. Nabis had always been on good terms with Cretan leaders and he {{requested}} 1,000 of their best soldiers who were hand picked to assist him. As well as the Cretans, he hired 3,000 mercenaries and 10,000 citizens. The Romans and their allies then advanced upon Sellasia not far north of Sparta. The Romans were defeated in a small battle and they retreated. The Romans then won another battle against the Spartans and forced them to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the city.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{against the}} Japanese {{observation}} posts began in June. On the {{fifth of the}} month a patrol of American troops attacked the position at Awul, causing its garrison to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> {{the centre of the}} island. Other attacks by the AIB force followed, and by early September all of the Japanese observation posts west of Wide Bay had been destroyed. Japanese troops conducted small scale reprisals against the native population of the Wide Bay hinterland, and the AIB officers attempted to persuade the population of this area to move inland before more severe reprisals were conducted.|$|E

50|$|When the Japanese invaded Burma (in {{the first}} half of 1942), the Chinese Expeditionary Force in Burma, along with the other Allies forces, were forced to retreat back along their lines of communications. Most of the Chinese <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> China but two {{divisions}} (38th and 22nd, plus fragments of three others) <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> India where they were placed under the command of the American General Joseph Stilwell.|$|R
5|$|The S-II-a {{prototype}} and one LT vz. 35 tank {{were returning}} from {{testing in the}} Soviet Union when the fighting began. They detrained in Sevljus and participated in a counterattack at Fančíkovo, but the LT vz. 35 was damaged and captured by the Hungarians. The prototype was forced to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> Romania by 17 March, along {{with most of the}} other Czech troops in eastern Ruthenia. The Romanians returned the prototype to Škoda six months later.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was held}} by the Norman kings until the civil war of the Anarchy broke out in 1139. Castles {{played a key role}} in the {{conflict}} between the Empress Matilda and King Stephen, and in 1143 Geoffrey de Mandeville, a supporter of the Empress, attacked Cambridge; the town was raided and the castle temporarily captured. Stephen responded with a counter-attack, forcing Geoffrey to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the Fens and retaking the castle. Cambridge Castle remained exposed, however, and Stephen decided to build a supporting fortification at Burwell to provide additional protection. Geoffrey died attacking Burwell Castle the following year, leaving Cambridge Castle secure.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} defence-in-depth, according to Luttwak, was an acceptance that the Roman frontier provinces themselves {{would become the}} main combat-zone in operations against barbarian threats, rather than the barbarian lands across the border. Under this strategy, border-forces (limitanei) would not attempt to repel a large incursion. Instead, they would <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> fortified strongholds and wait for mobile forces (comitatenses) to arrive and intercept the invaders. Border-forces would be substantially weaker than under forward defence, but their reduction in numbers (and quality) would be compensated by the establishment of much stronger fortifications to protect themselves.|$|E

5|$|While {{the battle}} was {{underway}} at Yudam-ni, the PVA 59th Division blocked the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri by attacking the defending Charlie and Fox Companies of the 7th Marines. The successful assault forced Charlie Company to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> Yudam-ni which left Fox Company trapped in Toktong Pass, a vital pass that controlled the road. On 29 November, several efforts by the 7th Marines failed to rescue Fox Company despite inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. Aided by artillery from Hagaru-ri and Marine Corsair fighters, Fox Company managed to hold out for five days while enduring constant attacks by the PVA 59th Division.|$|E
5|$|Empress Matilda's {{invasion}} {{finally began}} {{at the end of}} the summer of 1139. Baldwin de Redvers crossed over from Normandy to Wareham in August in an initial attempt to capture a port to receive Matilda's invading army, but Stephen's forces forced him to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the south-west. The following month, the Empress was invited by her stepmother, Queen Adeliza, to land at Arundel instead, and on 30 September Robert of Gloucester and Matilda arrived in England with a force of 140 knights. Matilda stayed at Arundel Castle, while Robert marched north-west to Wallingford and Bristol, hoping to raise support for the rebellion and to link up with Miles of Gloucester, who took the opportunity to renounce his fealty to the King and declare for Matilda.|$|E
5|$|On 2 April 1627 Koniecpolski {{managed to}} {{recapture}} Puck. He took Czarne (Hamersztyn) on 18 April {{and forced the}} Swedish forces to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the city. A week later they surrendered, with many mercenaries and some Swedish abandoning their banners and insignia, and changing sides. As {{a result of the}} series of Swedish defeats in spring 1627, they lost all their strongholds on {{the west bank of the}} Vistula, and with those, their hopes for a quick and decisive victory. The situation also convinced the Elector of Brandenburg to declare his support for the Commonwealth, and afterwards the Lithuanian forces resumed their offensive in Livonia.|$|E

5|$|The Angevin {{invasion}} {{finally arrived}} in 1139. Baldwin de Redvers crossed over from Normandy to Wareham in August in an initial attempt {{to capture a}} port to receive the Empress Matilda's invading army, but Stephen's forces forced him to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the south-west. The following month, however, the Empress was invited by the Dowager Queen Adeliza to land at Arundel instead, and on 30 September Robert of Gloucester and the Empress arrived in England with 140 knights. The Empress stayed at Arundel Castle, whilst Robert marched north-west to Wallingford and Bristol, hoping to raise support for the rebellion and to link up with Miles of Gloucester, a capable military leader who {{took the opportunity to}} renounce his fealty to the King. Stephen promptly moved south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{flanking}} party {{consisted of}} Knowlton's Rangers, {{which had been}} reinforced by three companies of riflemen, in total about 200 men. As they approached, an officer accidentally misdirected the men, and the firing broke out on the British flank, not their rear. The British troops, realizing that they had almost been surrounded, retreated to a field, {{where there was a}} fence. The Americans soon pursued and, during the attack, Knowlton was killed. Despite this, the American troops pushed on; driving the British troops beyond the fence {{to the top of a}} hill. When they reached the hill, the British forces received reinforcements; including some artillery. For two hours, the British troops held their ground at the top of the hill until the Americans once again forced them to <b>retreat,</b> <b>into</b> a buckwheat field where Barnard College now stands.|$|E
5|$|The game {{starts with}} an opening crawl {{resembling}} the ones {{featured in the}} Star Wars films. Further story details are presented through the game's instruction manual, pre-mission briefings, characters' conversations during the game and in-game cut scenes. During the Trade Federation's initial invasion of Theed, Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes and Captain Kael are able to escape the capital and head into the surrounding farmland. The two attempt to protect civilian farmers, but Federation presence is too strong, and they <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the nearby swamps. There they learn of a smuggler hidden in the mountains who might aid them. With the help of farmer Ved Deviss, Sykes and Kael find Borvo the Hutt. Borvo agrees to assist the resistance movement against the Trade Federation after the group helps him escape Federation forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{geometric}} {{designs in}} Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, {{which may be}} overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including {{a wide variety of}} tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13thcentury, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Although Amanda gains {{access to}} a revolver, a shotgun, a bolt gun, and a {{flamethrower}} {{over the course of}} the game, Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. Fortunately, the player can also craft several items by collecting schematics and different kind of materials throughout the game. Items range from EMP mines to noisemakers, molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, among others. These items help the player deal with enemies and the alien. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in one particular direction. The alien is afraid of fire, so using the flamethrower or a molotov cocktail will force it to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the station's ventilation system. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Nevertheless, the player can restore lost health using medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} the Seljuks or their Arab allies lost al-Rahba, but in 1093 the Seljuk ruler of Damascus, Tutush {{captured}} it along with several other Upper Mesopotamian towns. Following his death, possession of al-Rahba reverted to the Uqaylids, but in 1096, Karbuqa of al-Hillah captured and looted the town. He held onto it until 1102 when Qaymaz, a former mamluk (slave soldier) of the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan, took control of it. Tutush's son Duqaq and the latter's deputy Tughtakin besieged the town, but failed to capture it. Qaymaz died in December 1102 and al-Rahba passed {{to one of his}} Turkish mamluks named Hasan, who dismissed many of Qaymaz's officers and arrested several of al-Rahba's notables due to suspicions of a coup against him. Duqaq renewed the siege, but this time was welcomed in by al-Rahba's townspeople, forcing Hasan to <b>retreat</b> <b>into</b> the citadel. Hasan surrendered after receiving guarantees of safe passage from Duqaq as well as an iqta (fief) elsewhere in Syria. According to the 12th-century chronicler Ibn al-Athir, al-Rahba's inhabitants were treated well by Duqaq, who reorganized the administration of the town, established a garrison there, and assigned to it a governor from the Banu Shayban tribe, Muhammad ibn Sabbak.|$|E
