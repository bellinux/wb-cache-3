500|$|The ε ring is the {{brightest}} and densest {{part of the}} Uranian ring system, and is responsible for {{about two-thirds of the}} light reflected by the rings. [...] While it is the most eccentric of the Uranian rings, it has negligible orbital inclination. The ring's eccentricity causes its brightness to vary over the course of its orbit. The radially integrated brightness of the ε ring is highest near apoapsis and lowest near periapsis. The maximum/minimum brightness ratio is about 2.5–3.0. These variations are connected with the variations of the <b>ring</b> <b>width,</b> which is 19.7km at the periapsis and 96.4km at the apoapsis. As the ring becomes wider, the amount of shadowing between particles decreases and more of them come into view, leading to higher integrated brightness. The width variations were measured directly from Voyager 2 images, as the ε ring was one of only two rings resolved by Voyager’s cameras. Such behavior indicates that the ring is not optically thin. Indeed, occultation observations conducted from the ground and the spacecraft showed that its normal optical depth varies between 0.5 and 2.5, being highest near the periapsis. The equivalent depth of the ε ring is around 47km and is invariant around the orbit.|$|E

For example, Fritts (1962) used stepwise multiple regression techniques to study the systematic relationship of <b>ring</b> <b>widths</b> to climatic parameters in the southwestern United States; Bryson and Dutton (1962) have utilized power and cross -power spectral analyses in analyzing tree-ring records for periodicities; Mitchell (1967) applied factorial analysis; and Julian and Fritts (1967) introduced digital filter techniques {{as a means of}} appraising the systematic relations of tree growth to climatic variables. None of these studies, however, has attempted to analyze the joint occurrence of specific <b>ring</b> <b>widths</b> with certain climatic types so that probability statements could be made about climate from <b>ring</b> <b>widths.</b> This present study analyzes the joint occurrence of climate and relative <b>width</b> of tree <b>rings</b> for the state of Arizona. Conditional probabilities of occurrence are used to establish quantitative relevance of state -wide tree -ring growth from 1900 through 1957 to recorded climate for 1899 through 1957.

The ring-width response function explained 66 % total variance, of which 34 % was explained by climate.

While WVA cedar growth levels during the MCA are broadly similar to the 20 th century mean, the most positive values during the MCA are associated with RCS-standardized chronologies, which pseudoproxy tests reveal are likely biased artificially positive, warranting further investigation. This cedar record is significantly correlated with the NAO, due to the tendency for warmer, wetter conditions to occur in the eastern-central USA during the NAO's positive phase.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we develop}} a new {{methodology}} to estimate past changes of growing season temperature at Fontainebleau (northern France). Northern France temper-ature fluctuations have been documented by homogenised instrumental temperature records (at most 140 year long) and by grape harvest dates (GHD) series, incorporated {{in some of the}} European-scale temperature reconstructions. We have produced here three new proxy records: δ 18 O and δ 13 C of latewood cellulose of living trees and timbers from Fontainebleau Forest and Castle, together with <b>ring</b> <b>widths</b> of the same samples. δ 13 C data appear to be influenced by tree and age effects; <b>ring</b> <b>widths</b> are not controlled by a single climate parameter. By contrast, δ 18 O and Burgundy GHD series exhibit strong links with Fontainebleau growing sea-son maximum temperature. Each of these records can also be influenced by other factors such as vine growing prac-tices, local insolation, or moisture availability. In order to reduce the influence of these potential biases, we have used a linear combination of the two records to reconstruct inter-annual fluctuations of Fontainebleau growing season temper-ature from 1596 to 2000. Over the instrumental period, the reconstruction is well correlated with the temperature dat...|$|R
