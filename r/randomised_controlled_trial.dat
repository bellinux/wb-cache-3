25|$|Helminthic {{therapy is}} the use of {{intestinal}} parasitic nematodes to treat ulcerative colitis, and is based on the premises of the hygiene hypothesis. Studies have shown that helminths ameliorate and are more effective than daily corticosteroids at blocking chemically induced colitis in mice, and a trial of intentional helminth infection of rhesus monkeys with idiopathic chronic diarrhea (a condition similar to ulcerative colitis in humans) resulted in remission of symptoms in 4 out of 5 of the animals treated. A <b>randomised</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>trial</b> of Trichuris suis ova in humans found the therapy to be safe and effective, and further human trials are ongoing.|$|E
25|$|One {{trial in}} {{adolescents}} who had orthodontic treatment comparing {{the removal of}} impacted mandibular wisdom teeth with retention was identified.

Another <b>randomised</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>trial</b> done in the UK has suggested that it is not reasonable to remove asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom tooth merely to prevent incisor crowding as there is not strong enough evidence to show this association.|$|E

[...] However, all of these treatment interventions (particularly the stimulation techniques) are relatively new and <b>randomised,</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>trial</b> evidence is still limited.

RESULTS: The primary interventions received by 26 / 40 (65 %; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 51 % to 79 %) of patients admitted during the period were based on randomised trials or systematic reviews. CONCLUSIONS: When patients were used as the denominator, most primary interventions given in acute general psychiatry were based on experimental evidence.

40|$|Despite {{the growth}} in {{literature}} {{on the merits of}} treatment, opinion remains divided about the lack of relevant evaluative research on the effectiveness of psychological treatments for sexual offenders. This study reports a systematic review of <b>randomised</b> <b>control</b> <b>trials</b> reporting the effectiveness of sexual offender treatment programmes. Electronic and hand searches were carried out for <b>randomised</b> <b>control</b> <b>trials</b> published between 1998 and 2003. Searches revealed nine <b>randomised</b> <b>control</b> <b>trials</b> (RCTs) and these contained data on the treatment of over 500 men, 231 of whom have been followed up for 10 years. Analysis of the nine trials showed that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in groups reduced re-offence at one year compared with standard care (n = 155) but increased re-arrest at 10 years.

PARTICIPANTS: The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Outcome measures Content of reports compared with the design features described in the protocols for all <b>randomised</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>trials.</b> RESULTS: The methodological quality of 56 <b>randomised</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>trials</b> was better than reported. Adequate allocation concealment was achieved in all trials but reported in only 42 % of papers. An intention to treat analysis was done in 83 % of trials but reported in only 69 % of papers. The sample size calculation was performed in 76 % of the studies, but reported in only 16 % of papers. End points were clearly defined and alpha and beta errors were prespecified in 76 % and 74 % of the trials, respectively, but only reported in 10 % of the papers.
