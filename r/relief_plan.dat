500|$|Several Johnson {{administration}} officials, {{in addition}} to Freeman, were skeptical of the reports of starvation in the Delta. Johnson had seen the {{news coverage of the}} event and on April 17 he ordered that his top domestic aide, Joseph Califano, give him a [...] "quick report." [...] Califano replied 20 minutes later, writing that Freeman was hesitant to make major changes to the administration's food stamp program until the original system was sanctioned by Congress. When his aides unanimously approved of an extensive <b>relief</b> <b>plan,</b> Johnson, already uneasy about the food stamp program, rejected the proposal. Kennedy made a direct appeal to Johnson involving increased subsidization of food stamps and the supplement of emergency food rations for 40,000–60,000 of the most impoverished Mississippians. Johnson ignored it, a decision an editorial in The Nation claimed was {{due to the fact that}} he was [...] "incapable of rising above personal politics." ...|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} disasters, {{flooding}} requires a {{specific set of}} disaster response plans. Various levels of contingency planning should be established, from basic medical and selective evacuation provisions involving local emergency responders right the way up to full military disaster <b>relief</b> <b>plans</b> involving air-based evacuations, search and rescue teams and relocation provisions for entire urban populations. Clear lines of responsibility and chains of command must be laid out, and tiered priority response levels should be established to address the immediate needs of the most vulnerable citizens first. For post-flooding repair and reconstruction sufficient emergency funding should be set aside proactively.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} tri-level {{programming}} model for disaster preparedness planning. The top level addresses facility location and inventory pre-positioning decisions; {{the second level}} represents damage caused by the disaster, while the third level determines response and recovery decisions. We use an interdiction framework instead of a stochastic or chance-constrained model. This allows the extent of damage {{to be treated as}} a parameter to facilitate scenario exploration for decision-support. We develop an iterative dual-ascent solution approach. Computational results show that our approach is efficient, and we can also draw some insights on disaster <b>relief</b> <b>planning.</b> Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

After a typical hurricane hit the region, the plan would be for disaster relief forces to reach the city by overland routes. Since there was no New Orleans mass flooding and isolation by flooding plan, the plan that was pulled off the books was the hurricane <b>relief</b> <b>plan.</b> This plan failed because the relief personnel, most of whom were in trucks, could not get past nor through the areas that were under water. That there was no mass flooding <b>relief</b> <b>plan</b> to be executed was obvious by the lack of any heavy-lift helicopters such as Chinooks in relief forces that would have replaced the usual truck-born hurricane relief forces.

40|$|Abstract Considering the {{strategic}} relevance of inter-organizational aggregation, this paper aims to analyse how Italian {{small and medium-sized}} firms have used the ‘network contract’, a legislative tool recently introduced by the Italian government to sustain company competitiveness. Following aspects are analysed: strategic motives that underlie network formation, type of activities undertaken, characteristics of participant firms, modes of network organization and governance rules. These aspects all contribute to understand network efficacy in promoting small firms development in the long term. The empirical analysis is mainly qualitative in nature: it focuses on three case studies belonging to the mechanical sector. Results indicate that the network contract is a flexible instrument, used to achieve different strategies of growth and long-term objectives, while financial incentives and tax <b>reliefs</b> <b>planned</b> by the Italian government do not represent a sufficient driver for firms’ collaboration...|$|R
