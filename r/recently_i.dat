500|$|Jeremy Renner, {{who played}} the film's adult Hansel, has stated that his initial {{attraction}} came from a one sheet he was given even before seeing the script, showing Hansel and Gretel walking away and a witch burning at {{a stake in the}} background, which he found [...] "incredibly interesting" [...] (this scene was included in the finished film). He added, [...] "When I read the script, my first thought was, 'I can’t believe this hasn’t been done yet.' It’s such a great idea with so much potential. That dynamic was definitely a big thing, I loved that what Tommy [...] wrote left so much room for character." [...] Wirkola said he wanted Renner in the role after seeing him in The Hurt Locker. Wirkola, who described Hansel as the [...] "loose cannon" [...] of the duo, gave him an additional character flaw of diabetes, in addition to the psychological scars that Hansel shares with his sister (in the original idea for the short film, Gretel was also suffering from eating disorder). Renner said it was a great escape for him [...] "as this was a fairytale with no stress like the other action movies I'd done <b>recently.</b> <b>I</b> was having so much fun hanging on a wire like Peter Pan, hanging onto a broom and doing other crazy stuff." [...] He stated, [...] "That {{was one of the most}} fun jobs I’ve ever had because there’s something magical about that old world, fantasy thing." ...|$|E

Numan's wife later suggested he had Asperger syndrome; after reading about the syndrome and taking a series of online tests, he agreed, and identified himself as having AS, though he has not professionally been diagnosed with it. In a 2001 interview, he said, [...] "Polite conversation has never been one of my strong points. Just <b>recently</b> <b>I</b> actually found out that I'd got a mild form of Asperger's syndrome which basically means I have trouble interacting with people.

[...] I wish to play with human feeling, with its [...] "morbidity" [...] in a cold and ferocious manner. Only very <b>recently</b> <b>I</b> have become a sort of gravedigger of art (oddly enough, I am using the very terms of my enemies). Some of my latest works have been coffins and tombs. During the same time I succeeded in painting with fire, using particularly powerful and searing gas flames, some of them measuring three to four meters high.

2500|$|The Chicago Sun-Times’ Roger Ebert {{responded to}} these criticisms by saying: Terrence Malick's [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] has been praised for its painterly images and evocative score, but criticized for its muted emotions: Although passions erupt in a deadly love triangle, all the {{feelings}} are somehow held at arm's length. This observation is true enough, {{if you think}} only about {{the actions of the}} adults in the story. But watching this 1978 film again <b>recently,</b> <b>I</b> was struck more than ever with the conviction that {{this is the story of}} a teenage girl, told by her, and its subject is the way that hope and cheer have been beaten down in her heart. We do not feel the full passion of the adults because it is not her passion: It is seen at a distance, as a phenomenon, like the weather, or the plague of grasshoppers that signals the beginning of the end.|$|E
