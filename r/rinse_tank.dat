40|$|A novel {{electrodialysis}} {{recovery unit}} is described. In a test case, nickel salts from rinsewater were recycled {{directly into a}} nickel electroplating tank. Experimental perfonnance, including recovery rates, control and operational stability, and electrical energy requirements are presented. The industrial application of this recovery unit can eilminate several problems and capital equipment requirements associated with conventlonal electrodialysis units. T he recovery of materials normally wasted during manufacturing operations is becoming increasingly important. For wastewater, one potentially useful technique for materials recovery is electrodialysis, which employs perm-selective membranes and an electric current to achieve a useful, selective transfer of materials in solution. Electrodialysis for servicing an electroplating process is shown schematically in Fig. 1. During many plating operations, {{a substantial amount of}} solution adheres to plated workpieces as they leave the plating tank.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in the manufacturing of micro and nano devices is the cleaning, rinsing, and drying of very small structures. Without a technology for in situ and real-time monitoring and controlling, the rinse processes that account for a significant {{fraction of the total}} processing steps use a large amount of water and energy perhaps unnecessarily. This "blind" processing approach leads to waste that can have significant economic and environmental impacts. An electrochemical residue sensor (ECRS) has been developed and is aimed at in situ and real-time measurement of residual contamination inside the micro and nano structures. Using this technology, the mechanisms and bottlenecks of cleaning, rinsing, and drying can be investigated and the processes can be monitored and controlled. An equivalent circuit model was developed to assist the design of the sensor; its validity was proved by the first prototype. The simulation results and the experimental data predicted a good sensitivity {{in a wide range of}} operational frequency. To use the sensor in a practical <b>rinse</b> <b>tank</b> setup, the sensor-on-wafer prototype was designed and fabricated. Both the fab-scale and the lab-scale tests were performed and results illustrated many successes. The sensor is the first and the only available technology that provides the in situ and real-time cleanness information in the microstructures during the rinse processes. The sensor results distinguished four different types of rinse processes and showed high sensitivity to the ionic concentration change in the microstructures. The impacts of cleaning and rinsing parameters such as flow rate, temperature, cleaning solution concentrations, and process time on the sulfuric acid rinsing efficiency were investigated by using the sensor. The investigation discovered that sulfuric acid rinsing is a two-stage process: a flow-control stage and a desorption-control stage. 	 A comprehensive rinse model was developed to correlate the transport process and the trench impedance that is the sensor's signal. This model combined with the experimental data proved that increasing flow rate in the overflow rinse has a low efficiency for the rinse processes controlled by the surface reactions. The model, for the first time, shows the dynamics of the charging of the silicon dioxide surface and the dynamics of the potential build-up in the solution. It also discovered that the cation rinsing is a challenge if the cation adsorbs on or reacts with the surface...|$|E

40|$|The {{electroplating}} {{industry has}} faced tremendous challenges in maintaining its economic competitiveness {{as well as}} improving its environmental performance in the global economy. In electroplating systems, waste generation from manufacturing lines has been always a serious concern, as waste emitted in different forms contains various hazardous and toxic chemicals. It is recognized {{that much of the}} generated waste is avoidable, and reduction of such avoidable waste could significantly reduce the consumption of chemicals, energy, and water. Proactive source reduction can improve not only environmental quality, but also economic performance. This type of source reduction, which could be called Proactive Pollution Prevention, can be achieved through applying advanced sustainability-bearing process systems engineering techniques, i. e., the fundamental system modeling and simulation techniques. In this thesis, the process models developed for electroplating systems are reviewed and selectively adopted. These models are embedded in a computer aided simulation tool, which is MATLAB based platform. The tool has been used to conduct comprehensive simulation of electroplating systems. It can characterize the dynamic operations of cleaning and rinsing operations, where chemicals, energy and water are consumed.

40|$|<b>Rinsing</b> <b>tanks</b> of crop {{sprayers}} produce significant {{volumes of}} Cu-rich Bordeaux mixture effluents (BME) {{that can be}} treated by rhizofiltration in constructed wetlands (CWs). A pilot-scale CW (6 × 600 L) was developed to jointly rhizofiltrate such BME, produce Cu-rich root mat for ecocatalysis and provide usable shoot biomass with low Cu concentration. Three CW units were unplanted control (Ctrl) while three others were planted with Arundo donax L. (Ad) in floating racks. The rhizofiltration was carried out during 30 days in the early growing season. Total Cu concentration in the BME was 4. 4 mg Cu L− 1. Copper removal peaked within the 48 first hours after Bordeaux mixture addition in the Ad and Ctrl units (i. e. 92 and 81 % respectively). The BME Cu concentration met the requirement for indirect discharge of chemical industry effluents (i. e. 0. 5 mg Cu L− 1) at T 48 h (0. 4 ± 0. 2) and T 21 days (0. 4 ± 0. 1) for the Ad and Ctrl units, respectively. At day 30, in the Ad units, Cu concentration remaining {{in the water and}} distributed between A. donax roots, shoots was respectively 3. 5, 33 and 0. 5 % of the initial Cu input. In the Ctrl units, Cu remaining in water was low (7 %) and Cu removal (93 %) could be partly explained by its immobilization in the Cu-rich biofilm (i. e. 207210 ± 18516 mg Cu kg− 1) coating the vat wall. Foliar chlorophyll (i. e. a, b and total) and carotenoid contents decreased at day 30 but root and shoot dry weight (DW) yields increased by 23 % and 47 % per Ad unit, respectively. The shoot Cu concentration remained in the common range (i. e. 3 – 20 mg Cu kg− 1) while the root Cu concentration reached 623 ± 140 mg kg− 1 allowing 786 mg Cu removal by the root mat. Higher Cu concentration in BME or subsequent repetitions of treatment cycle must be tested to achieve at least 1000 mg Cu kg− 1 DW in roots (threshold value for Cu-ecocatalyst) whereas the biofilm role must deserve more attention...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{the project}} were twofold. The initial {{objective}} of the study, based on previous results, was to develop an economically viable methodology for immobilizing yeast cells {{for the treatment of}} heavy metal-laden waste water. The non-viable yeast cross-linked by 13 % (w/v) formaldehyde/ 1 N HNO₃ exhibited satisfactory mechanical strength and rigidity in a continuous-flow column operation. No apparent disruption of the biomass after repeated use was observed. The cost of immobilizing 1 kg dry yeast pellets was estimated at less than US$I. Zn uptake capacity of FA-cross-linked pellets, on batch trials, remained similar to that of raw yeast, reflecting that the immobilizing procedure did not hinder its metal removing capacity. In column studies, cation metals were effectively removed by the yeast pellets from aqueous solution at natural pHs, and then recovered completely by washing the pellets in situ with O. 1 M HCl. The recovered metals were concentrated in such small volumes that recycling or precipitation of them was facilitated. The metal uptake capacity of the regenerated biomass remained constant in comparison with cycle 1, indicating that reuse of the yeast would be possible. In the case of Cr⁶⁺, a gradual breakthrough curve of Cr in the column profile was noted, with a simultaneous reduction of Cr⁶⁺ to Cr³⁺. However, Cr⁶⁺ in the effluent can be markedly minimised either by accumulation onto the biomass or reduction to its trivalent form. Desorption of bound Cr⁶⁺ with either alkali or salt could not accomplish the regeneration of the biomass. A combination of reduction and desorption with FA/HNO₃ appeared promising in regeneration of the saturated biomass at 4 °C. The metal sorption capacities of the yeast pellets, on a batch or a fixed-bed system are relatively lower than that of documented sorbents. Apparently more of the yeast pellets would be required for treating a certain volume of waste effluent, than with other sorbents. Therefore Azolla filiculoides was examined as a suitable sorbent for this purpose. This constitutes {{the second part of the}} project. Azolla filiculoides, a naturally-abundant water fern, was screened for its metal sorption and recovering capacities, mechanical stability, flow-permeability and reusability. The azolla biomass appeared to have fulfilled the required mechanical criteria during the repeated sorption-desorption column operations. It is water-insoluble and appears flexible under pressure when rinsed with water. These characters are of crucial importance in a continuous-flow system since a column can be operated at high flow rates without apparent compact of the biomass and pressure loss. Therefore, immobilization of the biomass can be avoided. The sorption isotherm data, obtained from batch removal of Cr⁶⁺, showed that the sorption process was effective, endothermic and highly pH dependent. Considerable amounts of Cr⁶⁺ were accumulated at the optimum pHs of 2 - 2. 5. Column sorption of Cr⁶⁺ at a low flow rate and pH of 2. 5 showed optimum performance with a total Cr uptake of 50. 4 mg/g at 60 % saturation of the biomass. Removal of Cr⁶⁺ from an electroplating effluent using an azolla column was deemed reasonably satisfactory, although the uptake declined slightly. Desorption of bound Cr⁶⁺ with various desorbents was incomplete, which resulted in a low regeneration efficiency of about 50 %. However, removal and recovery of Cr³⁺ using the azolla column was than that of Cr⁶⁺. Desorption of Cr³⁺ from the spent biomass column was accomplished with the recovery of 80 % using O. 5 N H₂SO₄, The regeneration efficiencies for Cr³⁺ removal were up to 90 % and demonstrated that the biomass is reusable. Cation metal uptake capacities of azolla, obtained either from batch or column experiments, are reasonably high in comparison with other sorbents. The uptake of Ni or Zn ions from solution is pH dependent showing the optimum pH of around 6 to 6. 5, under the current experimental conditions. The sorption kinetics for cation metals was rapid with about 80 % of the bound Ni ions being taken up in the first 10 min. The character of rapid binding is extremely important in a column sorption process, especially on a large scale since it favours an optimum uptake of metals at high flow rates. The Ni or Zn uptakes in column sorption were not markedly affected when the flow rates were increased from 80 mllh up to 800 ml/h for the 5 g biomass used. The cation heavy metals removed from waste effluents were recovered in a concentrated solution of small volume. The desorption of bound Ni and Zn ions from the saturated biomass was accomplished with either O. 2 N HCl or H₂SO₄ that resulted in recoveries of more than 95 %. The metals recovered, in the case of Ni and Zn, are identical to that of plating agents ego nickel sulphate or chloride, so that recycling of the metals is possible. An effluent-free, closed loop of Ni or Zn treatment system was proposed, whereby the Ni or Zn ions can be recycled to the plating bath whilst the purified water is fed back to the <b>rinse</b> <b>tanks.</b> Ca and Mg ions, commonly present in the electroplating effluents, appeared to affect sorption of heavy metals by azolla when metal concentrations were relatively low, presumedly through its competitive binding for the shared sites on surfaces of azolla. The data obtained from column sorption of Ni and Zn follows the BDST model well, enabling the application of the model to predicting design parameters for scale-up of the biosorption column system. It is interesting that the values of metal uptake, expressed in molar quantities, obtained on respective single-metal solutions and the multiple metal system, are similar, implying that the mechanisms involved in the sorption of all metal cations are similar and that the binding sites on surfaces of azolla are probably shared by all cation metals. The surface of the biomass provides sites for metal binding estimated in the range of 0. 45 - 0. 57 mmol/g, based on the current experiments. The biomass has a surface area of 429 m²/g and water retention of 14. 3 ml/g. The functional groups on the surface of azolla were partially identified using chemical modification and metal binding comparison. Among the functional groups examined, carboxyl groups, provided by amino acids and polysaccharides, appeared to play an important role in metal cation binding. The infrared spectra of the samples support this conclusion. ...|$|R
