A catalytic chemical reaction {{is used to}} reveal and titrate <b>reactive</b> <b>hydrogen</b> species present in the solid.

When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly <b>reactive</b> <b>hydrogen</b> radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|R

When in a cellular system, the superoxide radicals react with unsaturated lipids, which contain a <b>reactive</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> and produce lipid hydroperoxides. These lipid hydroperoxides then decompose into lipid free radicals, and causes a chain reaction of lipid peroxidation, damaging the cellular macromolecules and eventually causing cell death.
