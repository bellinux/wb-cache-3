25|$|The {{magnitude}} of an earthquake, as indicated on a seismic scale, is roughly {{proportional to the}} length of the rupture, while the ground motion in the region surrounding the fault is highly dependent upon the local soil conditions, somewhat upon the distance and relationship to the progression of the fault rupture, and (as recently recognized in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake) <b>reflected</b> <b>energy</b> from deep discontinuities in the Earth's structure. The area affected by an earthquake is also dependent upon the density and uniformity of the soils surrounding the fault.|$|E
25|$|The despun section's {{instruments}} {{included the}} camera system; the near infrared mapping spectrometer to make multi-spectral images for atmospheric and moon surface chemical analysis; the ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases; and the photopolarimeter-radiometer to measure radiant and <b>reflected</b> <b>energy.</b> The camera system {{was designed to}} obtain images of Jupiter's satellites at resolutions 20 to 1,000 times better than Voyager best, because Galileo flew closer to the planet and its inner moons, and because the more modern CCD sensor in Galileo camera was more sensitive and had a broader color detection band than the vidicons of Voyager.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} factor in {{the sound of a}} loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's hands in a typical empty room, without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due both to a lack of absorption and to reverberation (that is, repeated echoes) from flat reflective walls, floor, and ceiling. The addition of hard surfaced furniture, wall hangings, shelving and even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes the echoes, primarily because of diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes and surfaces having sizes on the order of the sound wavelengths. This somewhat breaks up the simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces, and spreads the <b>reflected</b> <b>energy</b> of an incident wave over a larger angle on reflection.|$|E

2500|$|Ultrasonic sensors {{make use}} of the {{principles}} of medical ultrasonography in order to create visual images of the fingerprint. [...] Unlike optical imaging, ultrasonic sensors use very high frequency sound waves to penetrate the epidermal layer of skin. [...] The sound waves are generated using piezoelectric transducers and <b>reflected</b> <b>energy</b> is also measured using piezoelectric materials. [...] Since the dermal skin layer exhibits the same characteristic pattern of the fingerprint, the reflected wave measurements can be used to form an image of the fingerprint. [...] This eliminates the need for clean, undamaged epidermal skin and a clean sensing surface. LeEco became the first company to introduce this in Smartphone.|$|E
2500|$|MASINT {{collection}} {{technologies in}} this area use radar, lasers, staring arrays in the infrared and visual, to point sensors at the information of interest. As opposed to IMINT, MASINT electro-optical sensors do not create pictures. Instead, they would indicate the coordinates, intensity, and spectral characteristics of a light source, such as a rocket engine, or a missile reentry vehicle. Electro-optical MASINT involves obtaining information from emitted or <b>reflected</b> <b>energy,</b> across the wavelengths of infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Electro-optical techniques [...] include measurement of the radiant intensities, dynamic motion, and the materials composition of a target. These measurements put the target in spectral and spatial contexts. Sensors used in electro-optical MASINT include radiometers, spectrometers, non-literal imaging systems, lasers, or laser radar (LIDAR).|$|E

50|$|With purpose shaping, {{the shape}} of the target’s {{reflecting}} surfaces is designed such that they <b>reflect</b> <b>energy</b> away from the source. The aim is usually to create a “cone-of-silence” about the target’s direction of motion. Due to the energy reflection, this method is defeated by using Passive (multistatic) radars.|$|R
5000|$|Vision {{and hearing}} {{are closely related}} in that they can process {{reflected}} waves of energy. Vision processes light waves as they travel from their source, bounce off surfaces throughout the environment and enter the eyes. Similarly, the auditory system processes sound waves as they travel from their source, bounce off surfaces and enter the ears. Both systems can extract {{a great deal of}} information about the environment by interpreting the complex patterns of <b>reflected</b> <b>energy</b> that they receive. In the case of sound, these waves of <b>reflected</b> <b>energy</b> are called [...] "echoes".|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "passive radar" [...] is {{sometimes}} used incorrectly to describe those passive sensors that detect and track aircraft by their RF emissions (such as radar, communications, or transponder emissions). However, these systems do not exploit <b>reflected</b> <b>energy</b> and hence are more accurately described as ESM systems. Well known {{examples include the}} Czech TAMARA and VERA systems and the Ukrainian Kolchuga system.|$|E

Millimeter wave scanners themselves come in two varieties: active and passive. Active scanners direct millimeter wave energy at the subject and then interpret the <b>reflected</b> <b>energy.</b> Passive systems create images using only ambient radiation and radiation emitted from the human body or objects.|$|E

50|$|A radar {{scatterometer}} operates by transmitting a pulse of microwave energy towards the Earth's surface and measuring the <b>reflected</b> <b>energy.</b> A separate {{measurement of the}} noise-only power is made and subtracted from the signal+noise measurement to determine the backscatter signal power. Sigma-0 is computed from the signal power measurement using the distributed target radar equation. Scatterometer instruments are very precisely calibrated {{in order to make}} accurate backscatter measurements.|$|E
50|$|The {{backing plate}} {{reflects}} the impact energy {{back to the}} ceramic tile in a wider cone. This dissipates the energy, limiting the cracking of the ceramic, but also means a more extended area is damaged. Spalling caused by the <b>reflected</b> <b>energy</b> can be partially prevented by a malleable thin graphite layer {{on the face of}} the ceramic absorbing the energy without making it strongly rebound again as a metal face plate would.|$|E
50|$|As a {{countermeasure}} {{against an}} NLJD, professional covert listening devices (bugs) of the Central Intelligence Agency were equipped from 1968 onwards with a so-called isolator. An isolator {{is in fact}} a 3-port circulator of which the return ports is terminated with a resistor. Any energy injected into the bug by an NLJD, will be absorbed by the resistor, resulting in no (or very little) <b>reflected</b> <b>energy.</b> An example of such a bug is the CIA's SRT-107.|$|E

5000|$|... 1. Extending the EVI back in time, {{using the}} AVHRR record. The AVHRR sensors lacks a blue band, hence using a three-band EVI version is not possible. This could {{potentially}} {{lead to a}} 30-year EVI record that complements the NDVI record. 2. The blue band has always been problematic, and its Signal to Noise ratio (S/N) quite poor. This is mainly {{due to the nature}} of the <b>reflected</b> <b>energy</b> in this part of the spectrum over land, which is extremely low.|$|E
50|$|For comparison, in the {{parabolic}} type of antenna a feedhorn {{at the end}} of a waveguide directs a conical beam {{of output}} energy toward the reflector, whence it is focused into a narrow collimated beam. <b>Reflected</b> <b>energy</b> from the environment follows the reverse path and is focused by the reflector onto the feed horn where it travels back to the receiver. The reflector must be built to a precision determined by the wavelength used. For a one centimeter wavelength, a reflector precision of one or two millimeters would be adequate.|$|E
50|$|Resonant but {{somewhat}} 'lossy' {{materials are}} applied to the reflecting surfaces of the target. The thickness of the material corresponds to one-quarter wavelength of the expected illuminating radar-wave (a Salisbury screen). The incident radar energy is reflected from the outside and inside surfaces of the RAM to create a destructive wave interference pattern. This results in the cancellation of the <b>reflected</b> <b>energy.</b> Deviation from the expected frequency will cause losses in radar absorption, so this type of RAM is only useful against radar with a single, common, and unchanging frequency.|$|E
