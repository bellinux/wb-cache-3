5|$|The book {{is divided}} into 12 chapters, with a prologue, an epilogue, {{acknowledgments}} and sources. Chapters deal with various topics, including {{an overview of the}} biggest oil producing countries, an account of the controversy over Talisman Energy's involvement in Sudan, a critical analysis of some ethical funds, a case about inconsistencies in Greenpeace activism, a rebuke of the cancer controversy in Fort Chipewyan, the implication of Middle-Eastern <b>regimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anti-Oil sands movement, and a critical analysis of the green jobs arguments.|$|E
5|$|He {{was honored}} {{with a state}} funeral on 11 February 2015 at Berlin Cathedral. Eulogies were given by {{incumbent}} president Joachim Gauck, foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD), finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) and former {{vice president of the}} Bundestag Antje Vollmer (Green Party). Steinmeier praised Weizsäcker's role in foreign relations, where he had worked towards reconciliation with France and Poland and supported a dialogue with the communist <b>regimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East, often against his own party. The funeral was attended by many serving high-ranking politicians in Germany, including chancellor Angela Merkel. Also in attendance were former presidents Roman Herzog, Horst Köhler, and Christian Wulff, as well as former chancellors Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schröder. Princess Beatrix, former Queen of the Netherlands, was also present, as was former Polish president Lech Wałęsa. After the ceremony, soldiers stood to attention as Weizsäcker's coffin was brought to its resting place at Waldfriedhof Dahlem. In the subsequent days, many Berliners visited Weizsäcker's grave to pay tribute and lay down flowers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate <b>regimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E

Dollars flowed out through various U.S. aid programs: the Truman Doctrine entailing aid to the pro-U.S. Greek and Turkish regimes, which were struggling to suppress communist revolution, aid to various pro-U.S. <b>regimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Third World, and most important, the Marshall Plan.

Labor unions and strikes had been legalized during the regime of Napoleon III. The first labor union congress in Paris took place in October 1876, and the socialist party recruited many members among the Paris workers. On May 1, 1890, the socialists organized the first celebration of May Day, the international day of labor. Since it was an unauthorized celebration, it led to confrontations between police and demonstrators.|$|E

25|$|Always a confrontational {{critic of}} antisemitism, Zissu found himself marginalized by fascist <b>regimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s {{and for most}} of World War II. During the Holocaust era, he risked his {{personal}} freedom to defend the interests of his community, and was especially vocal as a critic of the collaborationist Central Jewish Office. He eventually reached a compromise with the Ion Antonescu regime when the latter curbed its deportations of Jews to Transnistria, and, after 1943, helped initiate the Aliyah Bet exodus of Romanian and Hungarian Jews to Mandatory Palestine. His contribution {{is at the center of}} an enduring controversy, focusing on his alleged favoritism of Zionist Jews and his cantankerousness.|$|E
25|$|On 86th Street, in {{the central}} portion of Yorkville, there were many German shops, {{restaurants}} and bakeries. Yorkville became the melting pot of populations arriving from various regions of the Prussian-dominated German Empire and its colonies, where many cultures spoke German. In the 1930s, the neighborhood was the home base of Fritz Julius Kuhn's German American Bund, the most notorious pro-Nazi group in 1930s America, which led to spontaneous protests by other residents. Yorkville was a haven for refugees from fascist Germany in the 1940s, and from refugees from communist <b>regimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and 1960s.

25|$|Communist <b>regimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Bloc viewed {{marginal}} {{groups of}} opposition intellectuals {{as a potential}} threat because of the bases underlying Communist power therein. The suppression of dissidence and opposition was considered a central prerequisite to retain power, though the enormous expense at which the population in certain countries were kept under secret surveillance {{may not have been}} rational. Following a totalitarian initial phase, a post-totalitarian period followed the death of Stalin in which the primary method of Communist rule shifted from mass terror to selective repression, along with ideological and sociopolitical strategies of legitimation and the securing of loyalty. Juries were replaced by a tribunal of a professional judges and two lay assessors that were dependable party actors.|$|E
