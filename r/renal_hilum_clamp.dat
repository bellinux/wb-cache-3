40|$|Objective:					During partial nephrectomy, renal {{hypothermia}} {{has been}} shown to decrease ischemia induced renal damage which occurs from renal hilar clamping. In this study we investigate the infusion rate required to safely cool the entire renal unit in a porcine model using retrograde irrigation of iced saline via dual-lumen ureteral catheter. 													Materials and Methods:					Renal cortical, renal medullary, bowel and rectal temperatures during retrograde cooling in a laparoscopic porcine model were monitored in six renal units. Iced normal saline was infused at 300 cc/hour, 600 cc/hour, 1000 cc/hour and gravity (800 cc/hour) for 600 seconds with and without hilar clamping. 													Results:					Retrograde cooling with hilar clamping provided rapid medullary renal cooling and significant hypothermia of the medulla and cortex at infusion rates &# 8805; 600 cc/hour. With hilar clamping, cortical temperatures decreased at - 0. 9 &# 176; C/min. reaching a threshold temperature of 26. 9 &# 176; C, and medullary temperatures decreased at - 0. 90 C/min. reaching a temperature of 26. 1 &# 176; C over 600 seconds on average for combined data at infusion rates &# 8805; 600 cc/hour. The lowest renal temperatures were achieved with gravity infusion. Without <b>renal</b> <b>hilum</b> <b>clamping,</b> retrograde cooling was minimal at all infusion rates. 													Conclusions:					Significant renal cooling by gravity infusion of iced cold saline via a duel lumen catheter with a <b>clamped</b> <b>renal</b> <b>hilum</b> was achieved in a porcine model. Continuous retrograde irrigation with iced saline via a two way ureteral catheter may be an effective method to induce renal hypothermia in patients undergoing robotic assisted and/or laparoscopic partial nephrectomy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Laparoscopic partial {{nephrectomy}} is {{a treatment}} option for small renal masses. However, such time-consuming {{techniques such as}} tumor excision, hemostasis and intracoporeal suturing are still challenging pro-cedures even for experienced laparoscopists. Incorporation of a robotic system would facilitate tumor excision, hemostasis and intracoporeal suturing. Herein, we review our technique and the short term outcomes for robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RLPN). Materials and Methods: Eleven patients underwent RLPN for small renal masses. RLPN were performed with the da Vinci Ⓡ robot system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, USA) with three robot arms. In 7 cases, the <b>renal</b> <b>hilum</b> was <b>clamped.</b> Tumor excision and intracorporeal suturing were performed entirely with the robotic system.

40|$|Introduction. Renal {{cancer is}} one of the leading urological cancers due to {{annually}} increasing morbidity and mortality rates. Objective:  to prove the efficiency of preventive hemostatic sutures during partial nephrectomy for maximal preservation of functional renal parenchyma in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Materials and methods.  We developed and implemented a new technique of partial nephrectomy with preventive hemostatic suture, that allows not to clamp the renal pedicle, even in case of central tumor location. Main benefit of this technique is minimization of kidney function loss after the operation, which is the major aim of nephron sparing surgery. Study included 150 patients with pT 1 a–pT 2 bN 0 M 0 kidney cancers.  Central tumor location was in 64 patients, 45 patients had upper segment tumors and 41 lower segment tumors. 74 patients had T 1 a tumor stage, T 1 b and T 2 a stage observed in 53 and 4 patients respectively. Nineteen patients were diagnosed with cystic carcinoma. To evaluate renal function, dynamic nephroscintigraphy was carried out and volume indices were calculated by computed tomography data. Results.  All patients underwent nephron sparing surgery using preventive hemostatic sutures. Mean operative time was 180 ± 40 minutes, mean anesthesia time was 190. 5 ± 15. 0 minutes. Mean blood loss was 250 ± 70 ml. We didn’t used arteria clamping and warm ischemia and there was no conversions to nephrectomy during all partial nephrectomies. Perfusion index of the kidney before the surgery was 54. 13 ± 2. 00 %, after the surgery 46. 23 ± 3. 00 %, renal index was 53. 24 ± 4. 00 % and 46. 82 ± 2. 39 %, respectfully. In our opinion decreasing of renal indexes in early postoperative period is associated with loss of kidney parenchyma due to the surgery. Mean kidney volume was 140 ± 30 cm 3  with 120 ± 20 см 3 functional parenchyma volume and mean tumor volume 40 ± 20 сm 3. Functional parenchyma volume after surgery insignificantly decreased to 115 ± 20 сm 3. Conclusion.  Preventive hemostatic sutures during partial nephrectomy allows to remove the tumor in almost any part of the kidney.

40|$|Purpose:Demonstrate two {{alternatives}} that permit a warm ischemia time reduction during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. Materials and Methods:In this video, two cases of intermediate complexity renal tumors {{according to the}} RENAL nephrometry renal scoring system illustrating the techniques and our preliminary experience: a 65 year {{old man with a}} 4 cm right, posterior renal tumor. This patient underwent an early unclamping and parenchymal suturing using a greek bar continuous suture with hem-o-lock clips attached to the respective extremities of the suture; The second patient is a 49 year old man with a 3 cm renal tumor. The technique utilized was no clamping resection following the ABC Medical School technique: dissection of <b>renal</b> <b>hilum</b> for eventual <b>clamping</b> if necessary, a frontal 360 degrees visualization of tumor limits, pneumoperitoneum pressure elevated to 25 mmHg during tumor resection, spiral excavation of normal parenchyma around the tumor and resection with negative margins. Results:We previously performed 15 cases utilizing the early unclamping technique. The mean clamp time was 15 minutes with a mean blood loss of 285 mL. Only 1 patient had focal positive surgical margins, without recurrence demonstrated at 30 months. Fifteen partial nephrectomies were previously performed with on demand clamping. In 3 cases, clamping was necessary with a mean ischemia time of 11 minutes. The mean blood loss was 390 mL and 2 cases required a perioperative blood transfusion. One case presented with a positive focal margin without recurrence demonstrated at 24 months of follow-up. Renal function was preserved in all cases regardless of the technique applied. Conclusion:Warm ischemia time can be reduced and kidney function can be preserved during laparoscopic nephrectomy if either early unclamping or on demand clamping are selectively applied...|$|R

METHODS: From February 2000 to March 2003, 34 patients (14 men and 20 women) underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic total nephrectomy at the Hospital das Clinicas - FMRP-USP: 28 (82. 3 %) patients had benign diseases and 6 (17. 7 %) malignant neoplasias. Benign diseases were represented by: urinary stones (N- 9, 32. 1 %), chronic pyelonephritis (N- 8, 28. 6 %), vesicoureteral reflux (N- 4, 14. 3 %), ureteropelvic obstruction (N- 3, 10. 7 %), multicystic kidney (N- 2, 7. 1 %) and pyonephrosis (N- 2, 7. 1 %).
