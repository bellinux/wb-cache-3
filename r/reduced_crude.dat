One of the important process is distillation, i.e., separation of heavy crude oil into lighter groups (called fractions) of hydrocarbons. There are two processes of distillation: CDU process and VDU process. The objective of the CDU process is to distill and separate valuable distillates(naphtha, kerosene, diesel) and atmospheric gas oil (AGO) from the crude feedstock. The technique used {{to carry out the}} above process is called complex distillation. On the other hand, the objective of the VDU process is to recover valuable gas oils from <b>reduced</b> <b>crude</b> via vacuum distillation. Two of the fractions of distillation are fuel oil and naphtha, which are familiar to consumers. Fuel oil, is used for heating for diesel fuel in automotive applications.

The Hydrotreater Unit (HDT) enables the Refinery to produce High Speed Diesel of very low sulphur and cetane number conforming to BIS specifications. The HDT also produces ATF, Superior Kerosene Oil with high smoke point and low sulphur.

50|$|The vapors {{from the}} top of the column are a mixture of {{hydrocarbon}} gases and naphtha, at a temperature of 120 °C-130 °C. The vapor stream associated with steam used at bottom of the column is condensed by the water cooler and the liquid collected in a vessel is known as reflux drum which is present at the top of the column. Some part of the liquid is returned to the top plate of the column as overhead reflux, and the remaining liquid is sent to a stabilizer column which separates gases from liquid naphtha. A few plates below the top plate, the kerosene is obtained as product at a temperature of 190 °C-200 °C. Part of this fraction is returned to the column after it is cooled by a heat exchanger. This cooled liquid is known as circulating reflux, and it is important to control the heat load in the column. The remaining crude oil is passed through a side stripper which uses steam to separate kerosene. The kerosene obtained is cooled and collected in a storage tank as raw kerosene, known as straight run kerosene that boils at a range of 140 °C-270 °C. A few plates below the kerosene draw plate, the diesel fraction is obtained at a temperature of 280 °C-300 °C. The diesel fraction is then cooled and stored. The top product from the atmospheric distillation column is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, and naphtha vapors. Residual oil present at the bottom of the column is known as <b>reduced</b> <b>crude</b> oil (RCO). The temperature of the stream at the bottom is 340 °C-350 °C, which is below the cracking temperature of oil.|$|E

The research presented in this dissertation focuses on improving nutrient utilization of protein sources with protein liberating enzymes currently available commercially. The research also conducted addresses the addition of crystalline amino acids valine and isoleucine and their effect on improving efficiency of broilers. The first research project compared the efficacy of two commercially available protease enzymes; Ronozyme ProAct (DSM, Parsippany, NJ) and Cibenza DP- 100 (Novus International, St. Charles, MO). Both are broad spectrum proteases that claim to improve protein digestibility. The protein source in the broiler diet is one of the most expensive ingredients.

50|$|During the {{significant}} oil price rise through 2007, a theme among several industry observers {{was that the}} price rise was only partially due to a limit in crude oil availability (peak oil).

Indeed, if the refineries were unable to process available crude oil then there should be a crude oil glut that would <b>reduce</b> <b>crude</b> prices on international crude oil markets.

Because even {{a small fraction of}} bond splitting can lead to a significant improvement of the flow properties of heavy oil, the cleavage of some C–R (R=S, N, and O) bonds favors <b>reducing</b> <b>crude</b> oil viscosity eventually with the quality slightly upgraded after oxidation.

The changes of elemental contents after catalytic oxidation over the catalyst Cu(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 are more obvious than that over the catalyst Mn(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2, which means that the catalyst Cu(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 is superior to the catalyst Mn(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 for splitting heavy oil molecules.|$|R
