40|$|According to the {{frequent}} fractures of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> in high ground pressure roadways of deep mines, this paper analyzes {{the mechanism of}} fractures and concludes that high ground pressure and material de-fects are main reasons for the fracture of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b> The basic idea of fracture control of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> in high ground pressure roadways of deep mines {{is to increase the}} yield load and the limit load of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> materials and reduce the actual load of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b> There are four ways of controlling <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> fracture: increasing the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> diameter, strengthening bolt materials, weakening support rigidity and the implementation of double supporting. With the roadway support of the 2302 working face of a coal mine as the project background, this paper carries out a study on the effect of two schemes, increasing the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> diameter and the double supporting technique through methods of theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and so on. It determines the most reasonable diam-eter of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> and the best delay distance of secondary support. Practices indicate that <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> fracture can be effectively controlled through the double supporting technique, which strengthens the roof and two sides through the first supporting technique and strengthens side angles through the secondary supporting technique...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{model of the}} grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> in soft <b>rock.</b> The behavior of both the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> system and the single <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> are discussed respectively. The coupling mechanism of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and <b>rock</b> mass is discussed {{from the viewpoint of}} displacement. A simple method is suggested for the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> design in tunneling. According to the analysis, displacement of rock mass controls the initial force in rock mass. Case simulations confirm the previous findings that a bolt in-situ has a pick-up length, an anchor length and at least one neutral point. The theoretical prediction of single <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> agrees with the measured data. The position of the neutral point is not only related to the length of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and the internal radius of the tunnel, but is also strongly influenced by the properties of rock mass.

5000|$|A note on tunnel support {{guidelines}}: The tunnel support guidelines {{based on}} RMR were provided originally {{in the form}} of a table giving support recommendations for a tunnel span/diameter of 10 meters. In view of the improving technology for <b>rock</b> <b>bolting,</b> shotcrete and steel ribs, it was left to tunnel designers to modify these guidelines for other tunnel sizes, which served its purpose well. Today, after 40 years of use, it has become apparent that it would be convenient for practical tunnel designers to have charts for the selection of rock support as a function of both tunnel size and rock mass quality. This is depicted in the chart below (see Lawson 2013).|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{rockfall}} {{events are}} mitigated {{in one of}} two ways: either by passive mitigation or active mitigation. Passive mitigation is where only the effects of the rockfall event are mitigated and are generally employed in the deposition or run-out zones, such as through the use of drape nets, rockfall catchment fences, diversion dams, etc. The rockfall still takes place but an attempt is made to control the outcome. In contrast, active mitigation is carried out in the initiation zone and prevents the rockfall event from ever occurring. Some examples of these measures are <b>rock</b> <b>bolting,</b> slope retention systems, shotcrete, etc. Other active measures might be by changing the geographic or climatic characteristics in the initiation zone, e.g. altering slope geometry, dewatering the slope, revegetation, etc.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>bolts</b> ensure {{structural}} stability for tunnels {{and many other}} underground structures. The pre-load on a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> {{plays an important role}} in the structural reinforcement and it is vital to monitor the pre-load status of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b> In this paper, a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-load monitoring method based on the piezoceramic enabled time reversal method is proposed. A lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch transducer, which works as an actuator to generate stress waves, is bonded onto the anchor plate of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> A smart washer, which is fabricated by sandwiching a PZT patch between two metal rings, is installed between the hex nut and the anchor plate along the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> The smart washer functions as a sensor to detect the stress wave.

With the help of time reversal technique, experimental results reveal that the magnitude of focused signal clearly increases with the increase of the pre-load on a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> before the saturation which happens beyond a relatively high value of the pre-load. The proposed method provides an innovative and real time means to monitor the pre-load level of a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> By employing this method, the pre-load degradation process on a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> can be clearly monitored.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{engineering}} accidents have demonstrated that the failures of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> are mainly induced by the corrosion of reinforcing steel bars. This study aims to investigate the effect of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> corrosion on the system reliability of anchored rock slopes. A uniform corrosion model for <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> and its applicable environmental conditions are first examined based on systematical analysis of the existing corrosion models for reinforcing steel bars and the experiment data for <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> corrosion. Two failure modes related to <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> corrosion are determined. They are the yield failure mode of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> at free section and the bond failure mode at the bolt-grout interface, respectively. Then, the failure models of anchored rock slope corresponding to those of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> are established. A method for estimating the time-variant system reliability of rock slopes based on Monte Carlo simulation is presented.

The results indicate that the corrosion model proposed by K. A. T. Vu and M. G.

In recent years, Madenga and Zou studied the influence of excitation frequency on <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> length and anchoring defect level based on theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiments. The wave amplitude ratio was used to analyze the corresponding relationship of the excitation frequency and waveform character of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> with free length and grouted length [18 – 20]. Li et al. used the hammer impact method to study the length of the fully grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and grout ratio, establishing the relationship between the grout ratio and waveform character [21]. Zhang et al. used the acoustic wave non-destructive detecting method. Specifically, statistics and regression analysis were adopted to study the grout ratio and waveform character [22].
