40|$|A {{method of}} {{preparing}} a tip for lithography, includes forming a mold having {{at least one}} recess; disposing a first polymer in the recess to form an apex of the tip,; curing the first polymer in the recess; and disposing a second polymer in the recess to form a base of the tip. The Young's Modulus of the second polymer {{is lower than the}} Young's Modulus of the first polymer. The tip structure for lithography includes a substrate, and a layered structure including a tip having an apex of a first polymer and a base of a second polymer. The first polymer is less <b>resiliently</b> <b>deformable</b> than the second polymer.
