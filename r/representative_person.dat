40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Order 458. 1 {{states that}} the {{compliance}} with the DOE annual dose limit of 1 mSv (100 mrem) {{to a member of}} the public may be demonstrated by calculating dose to the maximally exposed individual (MEI) or to a <b>representative</b> <b>person.</b> Historically, the MEI concept was used for dose compliance at the Savannah River Site (SRS) using adult dose coefficients and adult male usage parameters. In the future, SRS plans to use the <b>representative</b> <b>person</b> concept for dose compliance to members of the public. The <b>representative</b> <b>person</b> dose will be based on the reference person dose coefficients from the DOE Derived Concentration Technical Standard (DOE-STD- 1196 - 2011) and on usage parameters (at the 95 th percentile of national and regional data) specific to SRS for the reference person. Usage parameters in the 50 th percentile will be used in calculating dose to the "typical" person for determining collective doses. Usage parameters were determined for the following pathways: inhalation, ingestion of water, meat, produce, grains, freshwater fish, saltwater invertebrates, and dairy. External exposures from submersion in air and water and from ground shine also are included in the respective dose coefficients. The reference intake for air, water, meat, dairy, freshwater fish, saltwater invertebrates, produce (fruits and vegetables), and grains for the 95 th percentile are 17. 4 m³ /day, 2. 19 L/day, 220. 6 g/day, 674 cm³/day, 66. 4 g/day, 23. 0 g/day, 633. 4 g/day (448. 5 g/day and 631. 7 g/day) and 251. 3 g/day respectively. For the 50 th percentile: 13. 4 m³/day, 0. 809 L/day, 86. 4 g/day, 187 cm³/day, 8. 97 g/day, 3. 04 g/day, 169. 5 g/day (45. 9 g/day and 145. 6 g/day), 101. 3 g/day respectively. The parameters for the <b>representative</b> <b>person</b> also were used to calculate and tabulate SRS-specific derived concentration standards (DCSs) for the pathways not included in DOE-STD- 1196 - 2011. DCSs are concentrations of a radionuclide in a given medium that, if consumed, inhaled or externally exposed to {{over the course of a}} year, results in a dose of 1 mSv (100 mrem) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is twofold. The first {{is to develop a}} set of {{behavioral}} parameters for a reference person specific for the Savannah River Site (SRS) such that the parameters can be used to determine dose to members of the public in compliance with Department of Energy (DOE) Order 458. 1 “Radiation Protection of the Public and the Environment. ” A reference person is a hypothetical, gender and age aggregation of human physical and physiological characteristics arrived at by international consensus for the purpose of standardizing radiation dose calculations. DOE O 458. 1 states that compliance with the annual dose limit of 100 mrem (1 mSv) to a member of the public may be demonstrated by calculating the dose to the maximally exposed individual (MEI) or to a <b>representative</b> <b>person.</b> Historically, for dose compliance, SRS has used the MEI concept, which uses adult dose coefficients and adult male usage parameters. Beginning with the 2012 annual site environmental report, SRS will be using the <b>representative</b> <b>person</b> concept for dose compliance. The dose to a <b>representative</b> <b>person</b> will be based on 1) the SRS-specific reference person usage parameters at the 95 th percentile of appropriate national or regional data, which are documented in this report, 2) the reference person (gender and age averaged) ingestion and inhalation dose coefficients provided in DOE Derived Concentration Technical Standard (DOE-STD- 1196 - 2011), and 3) the external dose coefficients provided in the DC_PAK 3 toolbox. The second {{purpose of this}} report is to develop SRS-specific derived concentration standards (DCSs) for all applicable food ingestion pathways, ground shine, and water submersion. The DCS is the concentration of a particular radionuclide in water, in air, or on the ground that results in a member of the public receiving 100 mrem (1 mSv) effective dose following continuous exposure for one year. In DOE-STD- 1196 - 2011, DCSs were developed for the ingestion of water, inhalation of air and submersion in air pathways, only. These DCSs are required by DOE O 458. 1 to be used at all DOE sites in the design and conduct of radiological environmental protection programs. In this report, DCSs for the following additional pathways were considered and documented: ingestion of meat, dairy, grains, produce (fruits and vegetables), seafood, submersion in water and ground shine. These additional DCSs were developed using the same methods as in DOE-STD- 1196 - 2011 and will be used at SRS, where appropriate, as screening and reference values...|$|E

Tax compliance has been studied in economics by analysing the individual decision of a <b>representative</b> <b>person</b> between paying taxes and evading taxes. In the research of tax compliance have been done many empirical studies that emphasized the impact of a wide variety of potential determinants of voluntary compliance with individual income/profit tax filing and reporting obligations.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of the discharges of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant ("Dukovany NPP") and the assessment of impacts on the population and the vicinity of the power plant. The thesis summarizes the issues of tritium 3 H discharges into waterways and partially {{deals with the}} 14 C discharges. Attention is paid especially to the radioisotope of hydrogen 3 H, due to its chemical and physical form and its presence in the cooling medium (light water) used by that type of nuclear power reactor. The thesis also contains a description of {{the current state of the}} Dukovany NPP, especially the existing discharges of the radioactive substances to the surroundings of the nuclear power plant, both to the air and into the waterway. Also was discussed the issue of the new planned blocks of the Dukovany NPP and impacts of the projected discharges on the population during the simultaneous operation of the existing blocks and the planned blocks, again in relation to the 3 H discharged into the waterway. The application ESTE AI was used for the determination of individual groups of inhabitants who are most exposed to the radioactive discharges (also called <b>representative</b> <b>person).</b> Based on the current discharges of the Dukovany NPP and the planned blocks discharges were determined the annual effective doses for a <b>representative</b> <b>person.</b> The doses were compared with the legislation on the conditions for the peaceful use of nuclear energy requirements and then with the water management legislation. In order to avoid exceeding these limits were set up recommendations how to dispose of radioactive substances optimally.
