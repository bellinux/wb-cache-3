5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) {{is a joint}} {{disorder}} in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.

5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the film}} was not a major success, former Research Fellow at Australia's National Film & Sound Archive Robert Cettl, in his 2009 book Terrorism in American cinema: an {{analytical}} filmography, 1960–2008 argues that the film <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> alarmingly realist insight into US-Middle Eastern politics and terrorism since the 2000s, dealing with an al-Qaeda-esque terrorist organization and the conspiracy theories that some believe the US government is using the Middle East as a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Guillaume {{revolves}} around the common theme of the , a young man who, because of a wager (in the case of Guillaume, because of jealousy) needs to find a young woman's favor. He fails in his enterprise but pretends publicly to have succeeded, causing the ruin of a husband (if the gageure had claimed to have succeeded with another man's wife) or, in this case, the despair of a brother. Usually the young man's story is believed at first because he <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> intimate detail about a young woman, who then has to prove her innocence.|$|E

25|$|In part two, Unger {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} one becomes capable of passion. He charts out a path by which the individual first has desire, which is then augmented with imagination.

With this recognition, then, the contingency of the self is revealed.

25|$|However, {{the archaeological}} record {{indicates}} a gradual evolution of a neolithic culture that varied in pace and extent according to local resources and conditions.

The archaeological record <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> increased frequency of fortified pā, although debate continues about the amount of conflict. Various systems arose which aimed to conserve resources; most of these, such as tapu and rāhui, used religious or supernatural threats to discourage people from taking species at particular seasons or from specified areas.|$|E

Self-esteem is shown to be one of Naomi's biggest virtues and vices early on. When she is assigned to work with new student Annie Wilson (Shenae Grimes), she initially appears snobbish and withdrawn. Afterward, she unveils a more pleasant demeanor as the two spend time together, but also <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> opportunistic side by attempting to plagiarize one of Annie's papers. Upon being caught, however, she becomes offended when others express doubts about her ability, and seeks to prove that she can complete the work herself.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{difficult}} to determine which teachers had most influence on Rabbi Dessler, it is apparent that he is a child of the yeshiva world of the early 20th century, which was then influenced heavily by the ethical Mussar movement, but has similarly gained proficiency in Kabbalah and works of Hasidic Judaism and Jewish philosophy. His method in interpreting tenets of Jewish philosophy <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> adherence to the principles of the Maharal (Rabbi Loeb of Prague, 16th century). Another major influence appears to have been the 19th century Hasidic work, Tanya. Rabbi Dessler did, however, maintain that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship.|$|E

A close study of these banknotes <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> interesting array of subsets which were printed by two banknote printing companies (Bradbury Wilkinson and Thomas de La Rue). The notes were also designed at different time periods as {{there are very few}} identical and consistent design features appearing on all the denominations. Varying banknote numbering systems, different types of security threads, variations in the design and size of the Mauritian Coat of Arms, different ultraviolet light latent printing, inconsistent variations in the size incrementation between the denominations and multiple different typesets {{are just a few of}} the differences. This issue lasted up to 1998.|$|E
25|$|Subsection 3 <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> {{abandonment}} of the cleared areas, the decline of Olea, {{and the spread of}} Pistacia, Pinus brutia and Quercus coccifera (instead of deciduous oak) on formerly cleared land and in the maquis. As {{this is the time of}} the rise of Ionia, the palynological scenario suggests a movement of population from the land to the newly settled or expanded big cities of the Ionian League. Subsection 4 and Baf S6 go on to catalogue the return of the fruit trees, re-clearing the land for pasture, planting of rye and other cereals, ultimate destabilization of the soil through over-use, denudation and acceleration of sedimentation. After the sealing off of the bay to form the lake, population and land use declined to their current low levels around Latmus, but the river valley is cultivated.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year marked a watershed {{in the history}} for the Kingdom of the Isles with the successive deaths of David and Óláfr. The latter was slain by three Dublin-based sons of his exiled brother, after which these menthe Haraldsonnarpartitioned Mann amongst themselves. Once in control, the chronicle reveals that the Haraldsonnar fortified themselves against forces loyal to the kingdom's legitimate heir by launching a pre-emptive strike against Fergus. Although the invasion of Galloway was repulsed with heavy casualties, once the Haraldsonnar returned to Mann the chronicle records that they slaughtered and expelled all resident Gallovidians that they could find. This ruthless reaction evidently <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> attempt to uproot local factions adhering to Affraic and her son. Whatever the case, within months of his father's assassination, Guðrøðr executed his vengeance. Enstrengthened with Norwegian military support, Guðrøðr overcame his three kin-slaying cousins, and successfully secured the kingship for himself.|$|E
