And the powders contained some amount of precursors that had complex composition and can decompose with the forming of metal and oxide at further heating to 350 °C to 400 °C. Because of this fact, element powder composition such as Ni, O, C, H, and N content do not permit estimating the completeness of complex decomposition and Ni and NiO yield at different synthesis conditions.

40|$|Purpose: Basic {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} studied tool composites and microstructure of diamond- titanium diboride composite, and diamond-titanium diboride-titanium nitride composite with participation of nanopowders have been presented. Design/methodology/approach: Composites were prepared on the basis diamond powders of 3 - 6 µm (MDA 36, Element Six) and the TiB 2 /TiN nanopowders of below 45 nm (Neomat Co. Lithuania firm) and nanopowder of TiB 2 with size of crystallite below of 100 nm (American Elements firm). Different amount of a bonding phase changing in range from 10 to 30 wt% was used. Compacts {{in the shape of}} disc with dimension Ø 15 x 5 mm were sintered at pressure 8. 0 ± 0. 2 GPa and temperature of 2235 K using the Bridgman type apparatus. Microstructure studies using scanning microscope, X-ray and electron diffraction phase analysis were used. Findings: The influence of the bonding phase amount on the tested properties was observed. Vicker’s hardness HV 1 was changed in the range from 20. 0 to 50. 0 GPa, Young’s modulus (E) from 360 to 600 GPa and density (ρ) from 3. 30 to 3. 63 g/cm 3.

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} progress {{towards a}} step-change in {{the economics of}} titanium. Titanium's properties make it desirable to designers, but it is frequently overlooked due to high costs; making research into reducing costs of considerable interest. Examining the literature shows cost reduction possibilities in two main areas; extraction and downstream processing. Lower-cost extraction has previously received much attention, but in isolation will not produce the required <b>reductions.</b> <b>Powder</b> metallurgy techniques allow near net shape (NNS) production with limited material wastage and processing steps; also allowing utilisation of powders/particulates produced by many developing extraction methods. Combining products from alternative extraction with novel solid-state downstream processing has potential to produce truly cost-effective titanium alloy components. Chapter 4 establishes field assisted sintering technology (FAST) as a rapid and effective method to fully consolidate commercial and developing titanium alloy powders, {{with a wide variety}} of chemistries, morphologies, and sizes, including material from the Metalysis FFC process. FAST scalability was successfully tested by producing a 5. 5 kg, 250 mm diameter, specimen. Chapter 5 shows that titanium alloy preforms produced via FAST behave equivalently to conventionally processed melt, multi-step forged, products. The shapes and microstructures produced were not those typically required for components. Consequently, chapter 6 investigates the proposed cost-effective processing route of producing wrought microstructures in two steps from powder, which has been termed FAST-forge. A fully dense, microstructurally homogeneous, shaped preform billet formed via FAST was finished with a precision one-step forging operation that refined the microstructure, verifying the FAST-forge concept at laboratory-scale. It is anticipated with further development, and by utilising finite element modelling, that it will be possible to produce semi-complex NNS components with competitive mechanical properties in just two steps. Therefore, FAST-forge has potential to be disruptive technology that could enable the desired step-change in the economics of titanium. ...|$|R

The influence of Fe/Er ratio in the vanadate {{as well as}} the effect of aging conditions on their activity in ammonia SCR reaction was investigated. SCR activity at medium/low temperature was found to correlate directly with the Fe loading of the catalyst, with supported FeVO 4 resulting the most active material.

Supported FeVO 4 suffers a strong deactivation following thermal aging due to rutile formation in TiO 2 -based support and consequent collapse of surface area.
