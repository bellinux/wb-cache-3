25|$|In Spinoza's view, since God's {{power of}} {{activity}} is infinite, any affection {{which increases the}} organism's power of activity leads to greater perfection. Affects are transitional states or modes {{in that they are}} vital forces by which the organism strives to act against other forces which act on it and continually <b>resist</b> <b>it</b> or hold it in check.|$|E
25|$|The {{declaration}} {{was also}} {{signed by the}} heads of the local Greek Orthodox metropolitan bishoprics: Vasileios of Dryinoupolis, Spyridon of Vela and Konitsa and Germanos of Korytsa. On the day of the declaration, Zografos notified the International Control Commission of his appointment as president of the provisional government and announced that the Epirotes would regard any attempt by the newly founded Albanian Gendarmerie to cross their border as an act of hostility and would <b>resist</b> <b>it.</b> The Autonomous Northern Epirus also included Himara, Delvino, Sarandë, and Përmet (Premeti).|$|E

25|$|Such {{collusion}} {{in other}} industries had been ruled to be restraint of trade {{in violation of}} the Sherman Antitrust Act. Players had two options to <b>resist</b> <b>it</b> and become free agents. They could ask to be released from their contracts (which they rarely were), or hold out and refuse to report until the year was up, forfeiting their pay in the process. While star players were able to exercise some leverage this way, most who held out were often traded to other teams and wound up making less money.|$|E
25|$|The Voice {{is useless}} against targets who cannot hear the speaker; both Baron Harkonnen in Dune and House Corrino in Children of Dune employ deaf people to guard Jessica, {{knowing that she}} cannot control them via the Voice. Being a {{manipulation}} of the target's subconscious mind, the Voice is of limited utility against an extremely disciplined mind, such as a Reverend Mother or a strong Mentat; if the target understands what the Voice is and how it works, and is aware that it is being used, he may <b>resist</b> <b>it.</b> One trained {{in the use of}} the Voice may easily detect its use by others, even subtly. In Dune Messiah, Paul trains some guards to resist the Voice so that he may imprison Bene Gesserit. By the time of Children of Dune, Gurney Halleck has also been trained by Jessica to resist the Voice completely.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{hydroxyl}} group makes the alcohol molecule polar. Those groups can form hydrogen bonds {{to one another}} and to other compounds (except in certain large molecules where the hydroxyl is protected by steric hindrance of adjacent groups). This hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as protic solvents. Two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and the tendency of the carbon chain to <b>resist</b> <b>it.</b> Thus, methanol, ethanol, and propanol are miscible in water because the {{hydroxyl group}} wins out over the short carbon chain. Butanol, with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends. Alcohols of five or more carbons such as pentanol and higher are effectively insoluble in water because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance. All simple alcohols are miscible in organic solvents.|$|E

25|$|These events {{reinforced}} Curzon's {{belief that}} the Dalai Lama intended to place Tibet firmly within a sphere of Russian influence and end its neutrality. In 1903, Lord Curzon sent a request to the governments of China and Tibet for negotiations, {{to be held at}} Khampa Dzong, a tiny Tibetan village north of Sikkim to establish trade agreements. The Chinese were willing, and ordered the thirteenth Dalai Lama to attend. However, the Dalai Lama refused, and also refused to provide transport to enable the amban, You Tai, to attend. Curzon concluded that China had no power or authority to compel the Tibetan government, and gained approval from London to send the Tibet Frontier Commission, led by Colonel Francis Younghusband with John Claude White and E.C. Wilson as Deputy Commissioners, to Khampa Dzong. However, it is not known whether the Balfour government was fully aware of the difficulty of the operation, or of the Tibetan intention to <b>resist</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Political {{pressure}} for the {{action against the}} [...] "no-go" [...] areas increased after the events of Bloody Friday in Belfast. [...] A British Army attack was considered inevitable, and the IRA took {{the decision not to}} <b>resist</b> <b>it.</b> [...] On 31 July 1972, Operation Motorman was launched when thousands of British troops, equipped with armoured cars and armoured bulldozers (AVREs), dismantled the barricades and occupied the area.|$|E
500|$|Finn, Jake, the Ice King, and Bubblegum {{follow the}} Lich into his lair. In the {{entanglement}} that follows, Billy's gauntlet is {{destroyed by the}} Lich and Finn breaks his jewel. The Lich attempts to exert mind-control on Finn, but Finn is able to <b>resist.</b> <b>It</b> is then revealed that the sweater Bubblegum gave to Finn {{has the power to}} repel the Lich due to it being imbued with [...] "liking someone a lot". Finn then takes the sweater and pushes it into the Lich's eye sockets and rips his face apart, seemingly killing him. However, the Ice King accidentally drops Bubblegum into the Lich's evil vat, to the horror of Finn and Jake.|$|E

500|$|The {{purpose of}} the sixth letter was to ensure that Midleton would stay true to his {{opposition}} of Wood's patent. Although {{the extent to which}} Midleton was influenced by the letter cannot be known, it is certain that Midleton believed that the patent would harm Ireland and that he would <b>resist</b> <b>it</b> at all costs. Regardless, Swift wrote the letter to express himself {{in a way that the}} Drapier could not: as the dean of a great, Irish cathedral. He asserts his status to verify that the Drapier's intentions must be good. In essence, the letter rehashes many of the previous letters' arguments to draw Midleton into openly supporting the Drapier's actions. Swift also admits to actively working against the patent, and mentions how his [...] "On Doing Good" [...] sermon is similar to the ideas expressed by the Drapier.|$|E
500|$|... "Bad" [...] was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} duet between Jackson and musician Prince. Other artists {{that were supposed to}} be featured on the album included Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and Barbra Streisand, but none of those collaborations ended up happening. The song was viewed as a revived [...] "Hit the Road, Jack" [...] progression with lyrics that pertain to 'boasting'. [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] was viewed by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as [...] "misogynistic" [...] and its lyrics, describing a sexual predator, do not aim for the [...] "darkness" [...] of [...] "Billie Jean", instead sounding equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge, while having the opportunity to accept or <b>resist</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was described as being a [...] "paranoid anthem". [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] was seen as Jackson going [...] "a step further" [...] and offering [...] "a straightforward homily of personal commitment", which {{can be seen in the}} lyrics, [...] "I'm starting with the man in the mirror/I'm asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been any clearer/If you wanna make the world a better place/Take a look at yourself and then make a change." [...] The lyrics to [...] "Speed Demon" [...] are about driving fast.|$|E

2500|$|Shivaji {{realised}} {{the importance}} of having a secure coastline and protecting the western Konkan coastline from the attacks of Siddi's fleet. His strategy was to build a strong navy to protect and bolster his kingdom. He was also concerned about the growing dominance of British Indian naval forces in regional waters and actively sought to <b>resist</b> <b>it.</b> For this reason he is also referred to as the [...] "Father of Indian Navy".|$|E
2500|$|The International {{divided into}} a revolutionary left and a reformist right, with a center group {{wavering}} between those poles. Lenin condemned {{much of the}} center as social-pacifists for several reasons, including their voting for war credits despite opposing the war. Lenin's term [...] "social-pacifist" [...] aimed in particular at Ramsay MacDonald, leader of the Independent Labour Party in Britain, who opposed the war on grounds of pacifism, but did not actively <b>resist</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The etchant removes copper on all {{surfaces}} {{exposed by}} the resist. [...] "Undercut" [...] occurs when etchant attacks the thin edge of copper under the resist; this can reduce conductor widths and cause open-circuits. Careful control of etch time {{is required to}} prevent undercut. [...] Where metallic plating {{is used as a}} <b>resist,</b> <b>it</b> can [...] "overhang" [...] which can cause short-circuits between adjacent traces when closely spaced. Overhang can be removed by wire-brushing the board after etching.|$|E

2500|$|Some saw {{the book}} in a more {{favorable}} light, however, noting that it [...] "has a vein of humour and pleasantry which, with all its occasional coarseness, one cannot <b>resist,</b> <b>it</b> is full of life, it has one or two capital descriptions, and it is read through before it is laid down." [...] Marryat's writing was notably enjoyed by many famous later writers, including Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and Ernest Hemingway. Critic Mark Spilka has suggested that Percival Keene might have served as inspiration for part of Hemingway's story The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.|$|E
2500|$|The International Workers' Association, an {{international}} group of anarcho-syndicalists, {{released a statement}} on behalf of its Russian section, that was also endorsed by other [...] "internationalists" [...] in Ukraine, Moldova, the United States and elsewhere, that condemned the crisis as a conflict between two [...] "imperialist cliques" [...] and concluded: [...] "We will not succumb to nationalist intoxication. To hell with their state and 'nations,' their flags and offices! This is not our war, {{and we should not}} go on it, paying with our blood their palaces, bank accounts and the pleasure to sit in soft chairs of authorities.

2500|$|The Army and Navy, both {{cognizant}} of the continuing movement within the Air Corps for independence, cooperated to <b>resist</b> <b>it.</b> On 11 September 1935, the Joint Board, {{at the behest of}} the Navy and with the concurrence of MacArthur, issued a new [...] "Joint Action Statement" [...] that once again asserted the limited role of the Air Corps as an auxiliary to the [...] "mobile Army" [...] in all its missions, including coastal defense. The edict was issued with the intent of again shoving an upstart Air Corps back into its place. However, the bomber advocates interpreted its language differently, concluding that the Air Corps could conduct long range reconnaissance, attack approaching fleets, reinforce distant bases, and attack enemy air bases, all in furtherance of its mission to prevent an air attack on America.|$|E
