5|$|Omphalotus nidiformis may be {{confused}} with the edible brown oyster mushroom (Pleurotus australis), which is brown and does not glow in the dark. Confusion with another edible lookalike, Pleurotus ostreatus, common in the Northern Hemisphere and cultivated commercially, has been the source for at least one case of poisoning <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b>|$|E
5|$|Panic {{reactions}} {{can occur}} after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions have been <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that {{almost a quarter of}} those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the past year had experienced a panic attack. Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (disconnection from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects have been <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E

5|$|The {{toxicity}} of certain Galerina species {{has been known}} for a century. In 1912, Charles Horton Peck reported a human poisoning case due to G.autumnalis. In 1954, a poisoning was caused by G.venenata. Between 1978 and 1995, ten cases caused by amatoxin-containing Galerinas were <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> Three European cases, two from Finland and one from France were attributed to G.marginata and G.unicolor, respectively. Seven North American exposures included two fatalities from Washington due to G.venenata, with five cases reacting positively to treatment; four poisonings were caused by G.autumnalis from Michigan and Kansas, in addition to poisoning caused by an unidentified Galerina species from Ohio. Several poisonings have been attributed to collectors consuming the mushrooms after mistaking them for the hallucinogenic Psilocybe stuntzii.|$|E

40|$|Background - Left {{ventricular}} noncompaction (LVNC) cardiomyopathy {{is a rare}} form of cardiomyopathy.

This is <b>the</b> first case <b>report</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> describing <b>the</b> fetal diagnosis of noncompaction cardiomyopathy and associated coarctation of the aorta; a rare combination.
