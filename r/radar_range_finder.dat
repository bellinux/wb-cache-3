40|$|Range {{is a very}} {{important}} and useful physical property. We can extract most of the physical features of an object from a 3 -D image. This thesis is about analysing range images taken from a low resolution laser radar system. The objective of this research is to locate and attempt to identify obstacles in the surroundings for an unmanned small tracked vehicle to find its way. A short range (less than 30 metres) laser <b>radar</b> <b>range</b> <b>finder,</b> provided by the Ministry of Defense, gathered range images around the vehicle. Trees, rocks and walls are classified as obstacles. Roads, grassland and bushes are classified as passable objects. In the cases where the objects cannot be identified, we use the steepness as a guideline to classify the object as obstacles or not. Simple image processing techniques are applied to analyse the range image and satisfactory results are obtained. Obstacles can be located in the range images. The images are first segmented by three methods. Firstly, the range gating method is applied which segments the images- according to the information in their range histograms. Secondly, the gradient thresholding method is applied which distinguishes the steep obstacles from the non-steep objects. Thirdly, the spatial isolation is applied which isolates each individual object. The only information contained in a range image is the three dimensions of the object, so we concentrated on the analysis of the physical properties. Besides the size and shape, the texture of an object can also be extracted. Texture reflects what type of objects we are looking at. Walls, plains and other flat objects have fine textures while trees and bushes have rough textures. We have investigated various textural properties derived from the co-occurrence matrix. Another important physical property is the gradient because high gradient always implies obstacles, and these are things which an un-manned vehicle must avoid. The classification method uses the distance function to classify objects. Finally, the algorithm is implemented on an array of transputers. Promising results were observed. By implementing the algorithm onto an array of transputers, the processing time was reduced, and the obstacles can be identified from the range images...|$|E

The measuring range of this system is 3 cm, range is 500 cm, and the accuracy of measurement can reach 1 mm. The work is stable in the measurement range 3 cm- 500 cm that can meet the general requirements for measurement. The example analysis shows that the proposed method is more accurate than the traditional method, more suitable for the application and embedded system.

The Tizard Mission, a delegation of British scientists and military experts, visiting North America to promote wartime allied scientific cooperation, met with NRC nuclear physicist George Laurence in Ottawa in 1940. As {{a result of this}} meeting, beginning in 1942, a Montreal-based British-Canadian project {{under the aegis of the}} National Research Council undertook the construction of a heavy-water atomic reactor. An experimental device with graphite control rods, ZEEP, (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) was built at Chalk River Ontario before the end of the war, and on 5 September 1945 achieved [...] "the first self-sustained nuclear reaction outside the United States". This momentous event was followed by the construction of a larger, full-sized reactor the NRX in 1947, also at Chalk River.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{theories}} of bird flight predict that horizontal flight speed will increase with increasing load whereas vertical Eight speed will decrease. Horizontal flight speed for birds minimizing overall time on migration {{is predicted to}} be higher than flight speed for birds minimizing energy expenditure. In this study we compare flight speeds of Brent Geese Branta b. bernicla recorded by tracking <b>radar</b> and optical <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> during spring and autumn migration in southernmost Sweden, testing the above-mentioned predictions. Geese passing Sweden in spring are substantially heavier than in autumn and there might also be a stronger element of time-selection in spring than in autumn. Recorded airspeeds were significantly higher in spring (mean 19. 0 m s(- 1)) than in autumn (mean 17. 3 m s(- 1)), the average difference bring slightly larger than predicted due to the mass difference alone. The effects on airspeed of wind, vertical speed, flock size and altitude were also analysed, but none of these factors could explain the seasonal difference in airspeed. Hence, the results support the hypothesis of mass-dependent flight speed adjustment. The difference between the two seasons was not large enough to corroborate the hypothesis of a stronger element of time-selection in spring, but this hypothesis cannot be rejected. Vertical flight speeds were lower in spring than in autumn, supporting a negative effect of load on birds' Right power margin...|$|R
