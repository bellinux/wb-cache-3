40|$|Distant talking scenarios, such as {{hands-free}} calling or teleconference meetings, {{are essential}} for natural and comfortable human-machine interaction and they are being increasingly used in multiple contexts. The acquired speech signal in such scenarios is reverberant and affected by additive noise. This signal distortion degrades the performance of speech recognition and diarization systems creating troublesome human-machine interactions. This thesis proposes a method to non-intrusively estimate <b>room</b> acoustic <b>parameters,</b> paying special attention to a <b>room</b> acoustic <b>parameter</b> highly correlated with speech recognition degradation: clarity index. In addition, a method to provide information regarding the estimation accuracy is proposed. An analysis of the phoneme recognition performance for multiple reverberant environments is presented, from which a confusability metric for each phoneme is derived. This confusability metric is then employed to improve reverberant speech recognition performance. Additionally, <b>room</b> acoustic <b>parameters</b> can as well be used in speech recognition to provide robustness against reverberation.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{for establishing}} <b>room</b> <b>parameters</b> from measured impulse responses is created and implemented in matlab. The script is defined for synthetic and measured impulse responses. The setup is optional placement of a microphone cluster and source in a room. The necessary input for the algorithm is the pairwise distances between the receivers, and the impulse response received for each microphone. The algorithm is tested with synthetic impulse responses {{as well as}} real data experiments. The method for finding the walls is performed by first locating image sources from specular reflections in impulse responses, and then computing the plane equations. The distances between the microphones were measured using three different methods. First, a laser scanner was used for measuring the microphone positions in the room. Knowing their x-, y-, and z-positions, the pairwise distances between all microphones could be calculated. Secondly a digital caliper was held by hand over the middle, {{on the top of}} the microphones. The third method was that of using impulse responses and time of arrival for the direct sound for pairwise microphones. The difference in the microphones distances between impulse response measurements and laser measurement gave an average mean of 7. 715 mm with a standard deviation of 7. 259. Between impulse response measurements and caliper measurements, the difference in positions had a mean of 1. 39 mm and a standard deviation of 1. 41 mm. Results of the implementation showed that the optimal number of microphone were five, and microphone distribution should be within a fictive cube with side length 0. 5 m. An increase in the distances between the microphones in a cluster, resulted in an increase in the computational time. Implementations of synthesized impulse responses in a shoebox room, gave an average error in image source location of 31. 1 mm while for the measured impulse responses the average error was 296. 9 mm. Despite the large error in image sources for measured impulse responses the results still provide a good approximation for location of the walls, but in relation to the measured source and image sources, not the theoretical. Generally, the algorithm shows good potential for establishing <b>room</b> <b>parameters</b> from measured impulse responses. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIncorporating prior {{knowledge}} about the sources and/or the mixture {{is a way to}} improve under-determined audio source separation performance. A great number of informed source separation techniques concentrate on taking priors on the sources into account, but fewer works have focused on constraining the mixing model. In this paper we address the problem of under-determined multichannel audio source separation in reverberant conditions. We target a semi-informed scenario where some <b>room</b> <b>parameters</b> are known. Two probabilistic priors on the frequency response of the mixing filters are proposed. Early reverberation is characterized by an autoregressive model while according to statistical room acoustics results, late reverberation is represented by an autoregressive moving average model. Both reverberation models are defined in the frequency domain. They aim to transcribe the temporal characteristics of the mixing filters into frequency-domain correlations. Our approach leads to a maximum a posteriori estimation of the mixing filters which is achieved thanks to an expectation-maximization algorithm. We experimentally show the superiority of this approach compared with a maximum likelihood estimation of the mixing filters...|$|E

For the first problem, {{the aim is to}} model and simulate a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioning system. The coefficient of performance (COP) for refrigeration or heat pump system is one of the critical parameters for designing an air conditioning system. The modeling of the system components for a VRF cycle under different cooling conditions using R- 134 a and R- 22 as refrigerants was carried out. Calculations were performed by varying different parameters such as condenser and evaporator temperatures, and refrigerant type. The R- 134 a refrigerant shows a better performance when multiple evaporators are present. Part load performance evaluation was also done for both refrigerants.

40|$|Background: Dexmedetomidine {{has gained}} its {{popularity}} in providing stable haemodynamics, with significant post operative analgesia and sedation in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries. Two different doses of dexmedetomidine boluses were used pre-operatively {{and studied the}} intra and postoperative effects. Aim & Objectives: To compare two doses (1. 0 µg/kg or 0. 7 µg/kg) of dexmedetomidine infusion administered pre-operatively with regards to their haemodynamic, sedative and analgesic effect in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries. To study the effect of intravenous dexmedetomidine on postoperative analgesia. Material and Methods: 84 patients were randomly {{divided into two groups}} of 42 each. Group A received injection dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg, while group B received 0. 7 µg/kg; as an intravenous bolus dose in 48 ml NS over 15 min in preanesthesia <b>room.</b> <b>Parameters</b> assessed were Heart Rate (HR), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MABP), Saturation of Oxygen (SpO), End Tidal 2 Carbon Dioxide (Et CO), Respiratory Rate (RR); 2 perioperatively, at regular intervals. In the postoperative period, intramuscular injection diclofenac 75 mg was used as a rescue analgesic. Postoperative pain and level of sedation were gauged with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score and Ramsay scale respectively. Observations and Results: The hemodynamic stability, level of sedation achieved were better with Group A. The duration of post extubation analgesia observed in group A was significantly (P= 0. 01) more. The adverse events noted in both the groups were very few. Conclusion: We hereby conclude that dexmedetomidine in a dose of 1 µg/kg as pre operative bolus dose in patients undergoing lapararoscopic surgeries gives better haemodynamic stability, post operative analgesia, sedation and reduction in the dose of inhalational anesthetic agent compared to 0. 7 µg/kg dose without increase in the incidence of adverse effects. ...|$|E
40|$|In a {{reverberation}} chamber {{the direct}} (unstirred) path between two antennas is the aggregation of the line-of-site path {{and a number}} of unstirred specular wall reflections. Ideally these latter reflections should be eliminated in order to control the direct path for multi-path radio simulation applications (Pirkl et al., 2011). This work describes an experimental programme undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that the contribution of the specular wall reflections to the unstirred energy in a reverberation chamber can be reduced by wave diffusers placed around the specular reflection points on the chamber walls. The wave diffusers will scatter the reflected energy over a wide angular spectrum and increase the energy that is stirred by the chamber’s stirrer. Periodic wave diffusers were used optimized for a frequency of 3 GHz. The method is based on a past research method for increasing the mode density in a reverberant screened room. That study found that the electromagnetic field was scattered in many directions by the use of binary pseudo-random phase reflection gratings {{on the wall of the}} screened room, while in the absence of the gratings the field was concentrated in particular directions (Clegg et al., 1996). The suggested approach in the present research is to create a grating formed by a binary sequence diffuser which causes diffuse reflection. Experiments were initially conducted in an anechoic and then in a reverberation chamber. The technique was tested while varying the antennas’ heights, polarization and elevation angles, and additionally the orientation of the grating. Furthermore, the power of the line-of-sight component was measured in the anechoic chamber by placing absorbers on the grating and was then subtracted from the total received signal, toleave the scattered components remaining. The power of the signal reflected from the grating could thus be calculated and compared at the receiving antenna with the power in specular reflection which is observed by using a plane reflector. In the reverberation chamber the research was based on the effect of the diffusers on the unstirred energy. For this reason the transmitting signal between two biconical antennas was measured, with and without the diffusers placed around the specular reflection points of the <b>room.</b> <b>Parameters</b> like the heights, the polarization and the distance of the antennas as well as the orientation of the diffusers were tested.
