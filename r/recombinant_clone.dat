40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} a synthetic primer to select a cDNA <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone</b> containing H 5 coding sequences. The strategy used was as follows: 1. Prepare oligo(dT) cellulose-bound mRNA from chicken reticulocytes and select 11 S- 18 S material from sucrose gradients. 2. Use this RNA fraction both to prepare a cDNA library and as a template for H 5 -specific cDNA synthesis using a synthetic primer. 3. Screen out most globin cDNA recombinants with oligo(dT) -primed globin cDNA. 4. Search for H 5 recombinants using H 5 specific cDNA and verify the identity by DNA sequencing. Our screening suggests an H 5 mRNA abundance of about two parts per thousand in chicken reticulocyte poly(A) -containing RNA.

40|$|The mechanism(s) used by Haemophilus influenzae {{to acquire}} the {{essential}} nutrient heme from its human host has not been elucidated. The heme carried by the high-affinity serum protein hemopexin is one potential source of this micronutrient in vivo. A colony-blot assay revealed that heme-human hemopexin-binding activity was shared among most capsular serotype b strains of H. influenzae but was uncommon among other strains. We have identified a <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone</b> binding heme-human hemopexin from a H. influenzae type b (Hib) genomic library expressed in Escherichia coli. Both the Hib strain and the heme-hemopexin-binding clone expressed a polypeptide of approximately 100 kDa that bound radiolabeled heme-hemopexin. Oligonucleotide linker insertion mutagenesis of the plasmid DNA from this <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone</b> was used to confirm that expression of the 100 -kDa protein correlated with the heme-hemopexin-binding activity.

40|$|The {{envelope}} (env) glycoprotein {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) determines several viral properties (e. g., coreceptor usage, cell tropism, and cytopathicity) and is a major target of antiviral immune responses. Most investigations on env have been conducted on subtype-B viral strains, prevalent in North America and Europe. Our study aimed to analyze env genes of subtype-E viral strains, prevalent in Asia and Africa, with a nonhuman primate model for lentivirus infection and AIDS. To this end, we constructed a simian immunodeficiency virus/HIV- 1 subtype-E (SHIV) <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone</b> by replacing the env ectodomain of the SHIV- 33 clone with the env ectodomain from the subtype-E strain HIV- 1 CAR 402, which was isolated from an individual in the Central African Republic. Virus from this <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone,</b> designated SHIV-E-CAR, replicated efficiently in macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Accordingly, juvenile macaques were inoculated with cell-free SHIV-E-CAR by the intravenous or intravaginal route; virus replicated in these animals but did not produce hematological abnormalities. In an attempt to elicit the pathogenic potential of the <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone,</b> we serially passaged this viral clone via transfusion of blood and bone marrow through juvenile macaques to produce SHIV-E-P 4 (fourth-passage virus). The serially passaged virus established productive infection and CD 4 + T-cell depletion in juvenile macaques inoculated by either the intravenous or the intravaginal route. Determination of the coreceptor usage of SHIV-E-CAR and serially passaged SHIV-E-P 4 indicated that both of these viruses utilized CXCR 4 as a coreceptor. In summary, the serially passaged SHIV subtype-E chimeric virus will be important for studies aimed at developing a nonhuman primate model for analyzing the functions of subtype-E env genes in viral transmission and pathogenesis and for vaccine challenge experiments with macaques immunized with HIV- 1 env antigens...|$|E

40|$|Ribosomal (r) {{proteins}} encoded by polyadenylated RNA were specifically precipitated {{in vitro}} from polysomes by using antibodies raised against characterized Drosophila melanogaster r proteins. The immuno-purified mRNA in the polysome complex {{was used to}} prepare cDNA with which to probe a D. melanogaster genomic library. Selected recombinant phages were used to hybrid select mRNAs, which were analyzed by in vitro translation. Three clones containing the genes for r proteins 7 / 8, S 18, and L 12 were positively identified by electrophoresis of the translation products in one-dimensional and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. Sequences encoding r proteins S 18 and L 12 {{were found to be}} present in the genome in single copies. In contrast, the polynucleotide containing the region encoding 7 / 8 may be repeated or may contain or be flanked by short repeated sequences. The sizes of mRNAs that hybridized to the <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone</b> containing 7 / 8 were significantly larger than would be expected from the molecular weight of protein 7 / 8, implying that there were unusually long 5 ' and 3 ' noncoding sequences. The mRNAs for r proteins S 18 and L 12 were however, only about 10 % larger. In situ hybridizations to salivary gland polytene chromosomes, using the recombinant phage, revealed that the <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone</b> containing the gene for r protein 7 / 8 hybridized to 5 D on the X chromosome; the <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone</b> containing the gene for S 18 hybridized to 15 B on the same chromosome, and the recombinant phage containing the gene for L 12 hybridized to 62 E on chromosome 3 L. It is of interest that the genomic locations of all three r protein clones were within the chromosomal intervals known to contain the Minute mutations [M(1) 0, M(1) 30, and M(3) LS 2]. Although each clone contained sequences specifying two to four proteins, none had more than one identifiable r protein gene, suggesting that different D. melanogaster r protein genes may not be closely linked...|$|E

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for genome analysis of phytoplasmas, bacterial plant pathogens that cannot be cultivated in vitro in cell-free media. The procedure includes a CsCl-bisbenzimide gradient buoyant centrifugation followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -mediated whole genome amplification. The latter step involves digestion of the DNA by a restriction enzyme with an A/T-rich recognition sequence. Due to the different A/T content in the DNA of the pathogen and its plant host, the fragments originating from phytoplasma are shorter and are preferentially amplified in the PCR reaction.
