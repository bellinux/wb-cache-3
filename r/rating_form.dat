2500|$|Some {{people with}} {{developmental}} disabilities exhibit challenging behavior, defined as [...] "culturally abnormal behaviour(s) of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour {{which is likely to}} seriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities". Common types of challenging behavior include self-injurious behavior (such as hitting, headbutting, biting), aggressive behavior (such as hitting others, screaming, spitting, kicking, swearing, hairpulling), inappropriate sexualized behavior (such as public masturbation or groping), behavior directed at property (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped behaviors (such as repetitive rocking, echolalia or elective incontinence). Such behaviors can be assessed to suggest areas of further improvement, using assessment tools such as the Nisonger Child Behavior <b>Rating</b> <b>Form</b> (NCBRF).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Optimum {{variable}} strain <b>rate</b> <b>forming</b> paths {{based on}} two multiscale deformation-based stability criteria are developed. The first criterion is based on Hart’s linear stability analysis while in the second criterion; we introduce a modified one dimensional nonlinear long wavelength analysis introduced by Hutchinson and Neale [7] based on the well known 2 -D Marciniak-Kuczynski criterion. The stability criteria are calibrated for the AZ 31 Mg alloy at 400 ºC yielding two different variable strain <b>rate</b> <b>forming</b> paths. These paths show that the nonlinear wavelength analysis is more sensitive to strain rate sensitivity and results in larger attainable uniform strains than Hart’s approach especially at low strain rates. This result is demonstrated through finite element simulations of a deep rectangular box using pressure profiles derived from the two variable strain <b>rate</b> <b>forming</b> paths. The FE results clearly illustrate that Hart’s approach underestimates the amount of uniform deformation and therefore prolongs the forming time to prevent failure compared to the nonlinear analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of System dynamics and Chaos theory in shipping using the example of freight <b>rate</b> <b>forming.</b> The development of new technologies, changes in structure and conditions, information accessibility, etc. are {{only some of the}} factors that intensify changes in freight <b>rate</b> <b>forming</b> in shipping. Therefore, shipping environment is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic. System dynamics seems to be a tool very suited for modelling of strategic and operational behaviour in shipping business. Due to the complex behaviour of these systems, chaos theory can also help in modelling of processes in shipping. The basic feature of chaotic systems is fine sensitivity in conditions at the beginning, when small change in input value may cause great changes in output values. By applying its concepts to the business process, as well as in freight <b>rate</b> <b>forming</b> in shipping, it prepares the business systems for quick response to the changes in the environment.

50|$|A slope {{rating is}} {{calculated}} from the difference in a bogey course rating and a scratch course rating, more {{commonly known as the}} course rating. This difference is multiplied by 5.381 to get a men's slope rating or 4.240 to get a women's slope rating. Course ratings (bogey and scratch) are determined by course raters, who measure and record more than 460 numbers on a course <b>rating</b> <b>form</b> for each set of tees.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the theory, Oldham and Hackman also created two instruments, the Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS) and the Job <b>Rating</b> <b>Form</b> (JRF), for assessing constructs of the theory. The JDS directly measures jobholders' perceptions of the five core job characteristics, their experienced psychological states, their Growth Need Strength, and outcomes. The JRF was designed to obtain the assessments from external observers, such as supervisors or researchers, of the core job characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Each {{form of the}} BRIEF parent- and teacher- <b>rating</b> <b>form</b> {{contains}} 86 {{items in}} eight non-overlapping clinical scales and two validity scales. These theoretically and statistically derived scales form two indexes: a) Behavioral Regulation (three scales) and b) Metacognition (five scales), {{as well as a}} Global Executive Composite score which takes into account all of the clinical scales and represents the child's overall executive function. There are also two validity scales to measure Negativity and Inconsistency of responses. Scores on the Negativity scale measures {{the extent to which the}} respondent answered selected items in an unusually negative manner whereas scores on the Inconsistency scale indicate the extent to which the respondent answered similar items in an inconsistent manner.|$|E
40|$|Two solution-based methods, metallo-organic decomposi-tion and sol–gel processes, {{were used}} to {{study the effects of}} {{precursor}} solution type on the microstructure evolution and texture development of oriented PZT films. Micro-structure development and perovskite content are strongly dependent on the heating rate. Fast heating <b>rate</b> <b>forms</b> a dense fine-grained microstructure with (111) orientation. Intermediate-temperature pyrolysis followed by a fast heat-ing <b>rate</b> <b>forms</b> clustered or island structures of submi-crometer grains with (100) orientation. Intermediate-temperature pyrolysis followed by a very slow heating <b>rate</b> <b>forms</b> larger spherical rosettes with random orientations. Pt 5 – 7 Pb is a (111) textured transient intermetallic phase that nucleates PZT(111) texture. PbO is a (001) textured layer compound that nucleates PZT(100) texture. The tex-ture selection of PZT films is independent of precursor systems but sensitive to the film thickness especially when sol–gel precursors and oxidizing atmosphere are used. Cor-relation and comparison of oriented sol–gel and MOD PZT films with electrical properties are also made. I...|$|R

40|$|Brief {{measures}} of the five-factor model (FFM) have been developed but none include an assessment of facets within each domain.

Five data collections were com-pleted to assess the reliability and the convergent and discriminant validity of the <b>rating</b> <b>form</b> with other {{measures of}} the FFM and to replicate correlations with measures of maladaptive personality functioning that have been obtained with more extensive measures. Results appeared to support the validity of the FFM <b>rating</b> <b>form</b> (FFMRF) because it obtained rela-tively good internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. In addition, self-descriptions of persons in terms of the FFMRF related to maladaptive personality traits in a manner that was consistent with theoretical expectations.
