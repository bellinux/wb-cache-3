The technique spread to the Middle East, and to North Africa, and the city of Carthage was built of <b>rammed</b> earth. From there the technology was brought to Europe by the Romans.|$|E

5|$|Timber was {{the chief}} {{building}} material in Han architecture. It was used for grand palace halls, multi-story towers, multi-story residential halls, and humble abodes. However, due to wood's rapid decay over time and susceptibility to fire, the oldest wooden buildings found in China (i.e. several temple halls of Mount Wutai) date no earlier than the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp describes the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, {{as well as the}} often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources used by historians for clues about non-existent Han architecture. What remains of Han-dynasty architecture are ruins of brick and <b>rammed</b> earth walls (including aboveground city walls and underground tomb walls), <b>rammed</b> earth platforms for terraced altars and halls, funerary stone or brick pillar-gates, and scattered ceramic roof tiles that once adorned timber halls. Sections of the Han-era <b>rammed</b> earth Great Wall still exist in Gansu province, along with the Han frontier ruins of thirty beacon towers and two fortified castles with crenellations. Han walls of frontier towns and forts in Inner Mongolia were typically constructed with stamped clay bricks instead of <b>rammed</b> earth.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} <b>ram</b> BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts.

Opposing <b>rams</b> (plungers) in the <b>ram</b> cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded <b>ram</b> shafts (piston rods) {{in the manner}} of a screw jack. Torque from turning the <b>ram</b> shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the <b>rams,</b> coupled to the inner ends of the <b>ram</b> shafts, opened and closed the well bore. Such screw jack type operation provided enough mechanical advantage for <b>rams</b> to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.|$|R

Smith reports that 11 men aboard U-16, including her commanding officer von Zopa, lost their lives in the sinking, and that two survivors were picked up.

Re di Portogallo was also <b>rammed,</b> but was not seriously damaged and she survived the action. The ship remained in service until 1871, when she became a training ship; this service did not last long, as the green wood used to build her hull had badly deteriorated by 1875, so she was sold and broken up for scrap that year.|$|E

Here we report that the function of <b>RAM</b> 1 and <b>RAM</b> 2 genes {{is required for the}} membrane localization of Ras proteins and a-factor. The <b>RAM</b> 2 gene was sequenced and can encode a 38 -kDa protein. We examined the functional interaction of <b>RAM</b> 2 and <b>RAM</b> 1 by expressing the genes in Escherichia coli. Extracts derived from an E. coli strain that coexpressed <b>RAM</b> 1 and <b>RAM</b> 2 efficiently farnesylated a-factor peptide and Ras protein substrates. In contrast, extracts derived from E. coli strains that expressed either <b>RAM</b> gene alone were devoid of activity; however, when the latter extracts were mixed, protein farnesyltransferase activity was reconstituted. These results indicate that the yeast farnesyl-protein transferase is comprised of <b>Ram</b> 1 and <b>Ram</b> 2 polypeptides. Although <b>Ram</b> 1 is a component of the enzyme, disruption of the <b>RAM</b> 1 gene in yeast was not lethal, indicating that the <b>Ram</b> 1 -Ram 2 farnesyltransferase is not essential for viability. In contrast, disruption of <b>RAM</b> 2 was lethal, suggesting that <b>Ram</b> 2 has an essential function in addition to its role with <b>Ram</b> 1 in protein farnesylation...|$|R
