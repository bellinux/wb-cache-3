In order to evaluate the validity and accuracy of the suggested calculation methodology, the calculation results regarding the required reducing energy have been compared with the experimental data collected at a SRM in operation on which the research has been performed {{as well as with}} the experimental data presented in the literature.

40|$|Earlier {{work has}} shown that {{capturing}} the CO 2 from flue gases in the recovery boiler at a pulp mill can be a cost effective way of <b>reducing</b> <b>mill</b> CO 2 emissions. However, the CO 2 capture cost is very dependent on the fuel price. In this paper, the potential for reducing the need for external fuel and thereby the possibility {{to reduce the cost}} for capturing the CO 2 is investigated. The reduction is achieved using thermal process integration. In alternative 1, the mill processes are integrated and a steam surplus made available for CO 2 capture, but still {{there is a need for}} external fuel. In alternative 2, the integration is taken one step further and the reboiler is fed with MP steam and the waste heat from the absorption unit is used for generation of LP steam needed at the mill. The avoidance costs are in both cases lower than before the process integration. The avoidance cost in alternative 1 varies between 25. 4 and 30. 7 EUR/tonne CO 2 depending on the energy market parameters. For alternative 2, the cost varies between 22. 5 and 27. 2 EUR/tonne CO 2. With tough CO 2 reduction targets and corresponding high CO 2 emission costs, the annual earnings can be substantial, 18. 6 MEUR with alternative 1 and 21. 2 MEUR with alternative 2...|$|E

The Spex mill was modified {{so that it could}} also operate at a <b>reduced</b> <b>milling</b> intensity, and we compared the alloys synthesized after long times with the normal and <b>reduced</b> <b>milling</b> intensities. X-ray diffractometry and Mössbauer spectrometry were used to measure the volume fractions of the bcc and fcc phases in the alloys, and to determine the chemical compositions of the individual phases. We found that the composition ranges of the bcc and fcc single phase regions were extended well beyond their equilibrium ranges. At the higher milling intensity, we found that the bcc phase was destabilized with respect to the fcc phase, and the two-phase region shifted to lower Ni concentrations. For those alloys with coexisting bcc and fcc phases, we present evidence that the chemical compositions of the two phases are nearly the same. We explain the destabilization of the bcc with milling intensity as originating with a higher defect density in the bcc alloys than in the fcc alloys. We argue that this defect density is not homogeneous throughout the alloy, however, and the distribution of defect enthalpies can explain the two-phase coexistence in the as-milled alloys...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} describes {{possible reasons}} why the flaking tendency during cold rolling can vary between different austenitic stainless steels. The flaking phenomenon was observed after a rolling process in Granlund Tools AB’s roll <b>reducing</b> <b>mill</b> “KOR- 8 ”. A literature review was conducted {{with the purpose of}} finding a connection between rolling process, austenitic stainless steels and flaking. The laboratory work aimed at revealing possible differences between the flaked material and materials that is known to be cold rolled with high surface finish in the particular machine. In order to come to a conclusion regarding the flaking appearance, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Vickers hardness test and light optical microscopy (LOM) were performed. The literature review along with the laboratory results made it possible to determine the two major factors affecting the flaking behavior. Two independent analyses revealed what came {{to be the most important}} discovery in this study. LOM showed the appearance of a thick oxide scale on the surface of the flaked steel which was further confirmed by SEM-Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy that indicated the existence of oxides on the steel’s surface. These observations along with the knowledge that oxide scales grow only during high-temperature processing led to the conclusion that the steel is not appropriate for the cold rolling process due to the earlier steel manufacturing...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the high}} cutting speeds and depths of modern milling {{machines}} vibrations are generated within the whole machine structure.

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{performed}} {{to determine the effects}} of blending eastern bituminous coals with western subbituminous coals on utility boiler operation. Relative to the baseline bituminous coal, the testing reported here indicated that there were significant impacts to boiler performance due to the blending of the eastern and western coals. Results indicated that fuel blending can be used to adequately control flue gas emissions of both SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} at the expense of <b>reduced</b> <b>milling</b> efficiency, increased sootblowing in the high-temperature and low-temperature regions of the boiler and, to a lesser extent, decreased collection efficiency for an electrostatic precipitator. The higher reactivity of the subbituminous coal increased the overall combustion efficiency, which may tend to decrease the impact of milling efficiency losses. The extent of these impacts was directly related to the percentage of subbituminous coal in the blends. At the lowest blend ratios of subbituminous coal, the impacts were greatly reduced...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} methods for <b>reducing</b> <b>milling</b> exit burrs is to prevent the tool from exiting the workpiece. Exit here refers the condition in which a cutting edge is moving out of the workpiece while removing material. Only entrance burrs can occur under this circumstance, which are usually considered burr-free. This study proposes a set of geometric algorithms for avoiding tool exits in planar milling. Two distinct approaches are developed for tool path planning of 2 -D polygons. The first approach generates exit-free tool paths by offsetting the workpiece edges with appropriate widths of cut. The second one adjusts tool positions locally on given tool paths. In addition, a two-stage algorithm is designed for 2 -D free-form contours. The cutter locations causing the tool to exit the workpiece are first detected; then a heuristic scheme is applied to generate new cutter locations with no tool exits. Experimental results show that edge quality is significantly improved using the proposed methods. This work provides a feasible way for suppressing burr formation in an automatic manner, and thus reduces the need for deburring...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Research on rice drying and {{tempering}} {{has shown}} that high drying temperatures (up to 60 C) and high moisture removal rates (up to 6 percentage points moisture content) can be used without <b>reducing</b> <b>milling</b> quality as long as sufficient tempering at a temperature above the glass transition temperature (Tg) is allowed between drying passes. Using drying air temperatures above the Tg of the rice significantly reduces drying and tempering durations since kernel moisture diffusivity is much higher above Tg.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of Tg on drying rates when using drying air temperatures above and below Tg. Both medium–grain and long–grain rice was harvested during 2000 and dried under various air conditions above and below the Tg of the rice.
