5000|$|Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{is thought}} to be a key event in the development of atherosclerosis and has been reported to predate clinically obvious vascular pathology by many years. [...] However, the problem with this assertion in terms of the flow-mediated <b>response</b> <b>indicator</b> of endothelial dysfunction is that a morphological characteristic of atherosclerosis (baseline artery size) is inherent in the calculation of percentage flow-mediated dilation. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with reduced anticoagulant properties as well as increased adhesion molecule expression, chemokine and other cytokine release, as well as reactive oxygen species production from the endothelium. This leads to inflammation and myofibroblast migration and proliferation inside the vessel all of which play important roles in the development of atherosclerosis.|$|E
50|$|Sequencing and epitope {{prediction}} algorithms identified neoantigens in mouse tumors that {{functioned as}} tumor-specific T cell targets. Neoantigens were recognized by T cells in melanoma patients and were likely the {{major contributor to}} positive clinical effects of adoptive cell transfer. Mouse models established that neoantigens were the targets of T cells activated by checkpoint blockade therapy and that synthetic long peptides comprising these neoantigens were effective when administered as vaccines with CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 mAbs. Cancers with higher mutation burdens, and an associated likelihood of expressing neoantigens, appear most likely to respond to checkpoint therapy. In melanoma and certain other cancers, the numbers of mutations and neoantigens correlate with patient response. Increased PD ligand 2 (PD-L2) transcript expression and an immune “cytolytic” gene signature also correlated with neoantigen load and tumor response. CTLA-4 expression was a <b>response</b> <b>indicator,</b> which along with PD-L2 were likely expressed in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. An inflamed TME prior to treatment is also associated with response.|$|E

30|$|BSI has {{recently}} been presented as a <b>response</b> <b>indicator</b> in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer who have received chemotherapy [4]. The patients had bone scans at baseline and at 3 -month and 6 -month follow-up, and BSI changes post-treatment were a significant prognostic factor for survival. A doubling of BSI post-treatment resulted in a 1.9 -fold increase {{in the risk of}} death. These results showed the feasibility of capturing bone scintigraphy data as a single quantitative measure and thereby allowing bone scans to be explored as imaging biomarkers. Furthermore, changes in BSI post-treatment were significantly associated with survival, but post-treatment changes in PSA were not, while adjusting for changes in BSI.|$|E

In this study, the PCWG 2 criterion of two or more new lesions was not prognostic. The number of new lesions was, however, significantly associated with survival, indicating that a criterion other than two new lesions might be valuable. It might even be a combination of the number of new lesions and the percentage change in BSI that proves to contain the most prognostic information.|$|E

40|$|Indicators {{are needed}} to support the {{implementation}} of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), by providing information {{on the state of}} the ecosystem, the extent and intensity of effort or mortality and the progress of management in relation to objectives. Here, I review recent work on the development, selection and application of indicators and consider how indicators might support an EAF. Indicators should guide the management of fishing activities that have led to, or are most likely to lead to, unsustainable impacts on ecosystem components or attributes. The numbers and types of indicators used to support an EAF will vary among management regions, depending on resources available for monitoring and enforcement, and actual and potential fishing impacts. State indicators provide feedback on the state of ecosystem components or attributes and the extent to which management objectives, which usually relate to state, are met. State can only be managed if the relationships with fishing (pressure) and management (response) are known. Predicting such relationships is fundamental to developing a management system that supports the achievement of objectives. In a management framework supported by pressure, state and <b>response</b> <b>indicators,</b> the relationship between the value of an indicator and a target or limit reference point, reference trajectory or direction provides guidance on the management action to take. Values of pressure, state and <b>response</b> <b>indicators</b> may be affected by measurement, process, model and estimation error and thus different indicators, and the same indicators measured at different scales and in different ways, will detect true trends on different timescales. Managers can use several methods to estimate the effects of error on the probability of detecting true trends and/or to account for error when setting reference points, trajectories and directions. Given the high noise to signal ratio in many state <b>indicators,</b> pressure and <b>response</b> <b>indicators</b> would often guide short-term management decision making more effectively, with state indicators providing longer-term policy-focused feedback on the effects of management action...|$|R

It does this by employing the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) and its component variables and indicators as promoted by the World Economic Forum and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) created by Transparency International (TI). Both the CPI and ESI were shown to be statistically significantly related to income (proxied as GDP/capita) such that environmental sustainability declined with decreasing income while corruption worsened. The ESI for 2002 was also divided into indicators representing pressure, state, impact and response (i. e., the PSIR framework), and each of these were regressed onto a &# 8216;residual CPI&# 8217; (CPI of 2002 with the influence of income removed).
