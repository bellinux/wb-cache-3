5000|$|During April 2013, Francis lobbied against {{government}} subsidies for the abortion drug <b>RU486</b> saying, [...] "Women facing unsupported pregnancies {{should be offered}} real support - not a chemical which is harmful to both them and their unborn child." ...|$|E
50|$|The Abortion Pill is a 1997 {{documentary}} {{that examines}} {{the pros and}} cons of a Mifepristone (<b>RU486),</b> a drug that can end pregnancy without surgery. The film was produced and directed by Marion Lipschutz and Rose Rosenblatt of Incite Pictures.|$|E
50|$|He was {{socially}} conservative, reflecting his Catholic values. He opposed abortion, {{embryonic stem}} cell research, same-sex marriage, and pornography. He secured a ministerial veto on importation of the abortifacient <b>RU486</b> and a prohibition on Australian overseas aid financing family planning that included abortion advice.|$|E
5000|$|Nettle {{supports}} gender equality, {{as well as}} a women's reproductive rights. During {{a debate}} on the abortion drug <b>RU486</b> in February 2006, she wore a T-shirt into parliament bearing the slogan [...] "Mr Abbott get your rosaries off my ovaries", in reference to the Catholic faith of Health Minister Tony Abbott.|$|E

50|$|In a {{study on}} mated male mice, there is {{evidence}} shown that when progesterone receptors are tampered with, using an antagonist, infanticide behavior is declined, while caregiving is increased. Males were observed with their mate to evaluate parental behavior, and then were administered implants by capsules filled with sesame oil, or progesterone plus sesame oil, along with <b>RU486</b> pellets as the antagonist. Aggressive behavior was measured by response toward litters, and progesterone was measured by blood samples. Results indicated that PRKO mice (the knock-out mice) did not commit infanticide, but showed more paternal behavior, {{in comparison to the}} C57BL/6 strain mice that committed infanticide. Thus, this indicates that aggression and paternal behavior in mated male mice is linked to progesterone receptors; that is, when progesterone receptors are blocked by <b>RU486</b> antagonist, males are less aggressive, and more paternal toward offspring.|$|E
5000|$|Described as {{a radical}} feminist and {{supporter}} of women's {{right to access}} abortion, she was strongly critical of the Therapeutic Goods Act (TGA) approval process {{in relation to the}} abortion drug <b>RU486</b> which she regards as dangerous. [...] She has also spoken out strongly against commercial surrogacy and the dangers of the contraceptive Depo Provera and the Gardasil vaccine.|$|E

5000|$|The Abortion Pill (1997) is {{a one-hour}} special that {{followed}} the long and controversial journey of the abortion pill (<b>RU486)</b> to the U.S. market. Tracking its use from France to England, India, Brazil and finally to the U.S., the program shows how a potent mix of business, politics and ethics made the pill a symbolic linchpin in the so-called abortion wars. Aired nationally.|$|E
50|$|Raised Presbyterian, Turnbull {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in 2002. However, {{he has found}} himself {{at odds with the}} church's teaching on abortion, stem cell research and same-sex marriage. Turnbull supported legislation relaxing restrictions on abortion pill <b>RU486</b> and he also voted for the legalisation of somatic cell nuclear transfer. He did so despite the vocal public opposition to both proposals by Cardinal George Pell, the then-Archbishop of Sydney.|$|E
50|$|In April 2013, the Australian {{government}} commenced {{an evaluation}} process {{to decide whether}} to list mifepristone (<b>RU486)</b> and misoprostol on the country's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). If the listing is approved by the Health Minister Tanya Plibersek and the federal government, the drugs will become more accessible due to a dramatic reduction in retail priceâ€”the cost would be reduced from between AU$300 and AU$800, to AU$12 (subsidised rate for concession card holders) or AU$35.|$|E
5000|$|From 1992-2007, the San Francisco Mime Troupe, {{political}} {{theater in}} the parks, toured [...] "Knocked Up" [...] which she co-wrote with Tina Tree Murch. The play, a musical, was a commedia dell'arte: when a young villager becomes pregnant and is refused the morning-after pill, a mysterious comet causes all the males in the village to become pregnant. By play's end, they've come around to approving the <b>RU486,</b> as the morning after pill was called.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Abbott {{controversially}} opposed {{access to}} the abortion drug <b>RU486,</b> and the Parliament voted to strip Health Ministers of the power to regulate this area of policy. During this time, Abbott likened the act of having an abortion to committing a murder, saying [...] "... we have a bizarre double standard, a bizarre double standard in this country where someone who kills a pregnant woman's baby is guilty of murder but a woman who aborts an unborn baby is simply exercising choice".|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, {{he was a}} {{contributor}} to the debate on a bill to lift the ban on the [...] "abortion pill" [...] <b>RU486.</b> He said that while undergoing post-graduate training in obstetrics and gynaecology in London, he was required to perform late-term abortions which he found [...] "harrowing". He introduced an amendment to the bill, which would give Parliament a right of veto over the quasi-autonomous government drug regulator - the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). He failed to win support for the amendment and ultimately supported the bill.|$|E

50|$|Before {{arriving}} in Westminster {{to take his}} seat, Carr had made contact with Conservative MP Ken Hargreaves, who represented a neighbouring constituency and who was an organiser of the anti-abortion campaign in Parliament, to offer his help. In December 1991 he presented a petition from Roman Catholic churches in his constituency opposing the use of abortifacient drug <b>RU486.</b> He was called at Prime Minister's Questions on 4 February 1992, and asked about a constituent who was told to wait 14 months for a hip replacement but offered the chance to pay to have the operation done privately without delay.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, Cardinal Edward Bede Clancy {{wrote to}} the then prime minister, John Howard, urging him to send an armed {{peacekeeping}} force to East Timor to end the violence engulfing that country. In 2006, an Australian Greens senator, Kerry Nettle, called on the health minister, Tony Abbott, to refrain from debating the abortion drug <b>RU486</b> because he was Catholic. Cardinal George Pell has concerned himself publicly with traditional issues of Christian doctrine, such as supporting marriage and opposing abortion, but also raised questions about government policies such as the Work Choices industrial relations reforms and the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.|$|E
50|$|On 5 December 2006, Allison {{introduced}} into the Senate a bill titled the Cluster Munitions (Prohibition) Bill 2006, which, if enacted, would prevent Australia from using, possessing and manufacturing cluster munitions. Two months earlier, she had travelled to Lebanon to survey {{the damage caused by}} cluster munition use in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War. Allison, a leading feminist in the Australian parliament, was among a cross-party group of female parliamentarians who introduced legislation into parliament in 2006 which effectively legalised the supply of the abortion pill <b>RU486.</b> She advocated for federal government funding for public schools and nuclear disarmament.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{think the}} point I made was that while I would prefer {{there to be a}} {{parliamentary}} framework for the <b>RU486,</b> I think it was, debate, if the actual issue was before Parliament I would probably vote for the distribution of the pill. People often say, oh no Steve's a conservative Catholic, but they won't ever find on my voting record something that backs that up. I voted against the Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation. I voted for some of the cloning debate. So I voted in, I like to consider the issues on their merits and I voted what some would characterise as conservatively and some would characterise as progressively on a number of issues." ...|$|E

He also {{completed his}} specialty training in {{obstetrics and gynecology}} and subspecialty training in reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of Southern California, where he remained a full-time faculty member until 2007. His 25-year affiliation with the university included a decade as a tenured professor {{of obstetrics and gynecology}} at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine. During his residency, Jain conducted the first research and published his findings on the use of <b>RU486.</b> Much of his early career was focused on contraceptive medicine and the use of pharmacologic agents to induce abortions. In 1987, Jain was part of the team of fertility physicians at USC that reported the first triplet pregnancy after frozen embryo transfer.|$|E
5000|$|Baulieu is {{worldwide}} {{known for}} his work on <b>RU486</b> (Mifepristone) and has been termed the [...] "Father" [...] of the abortion pill. Baulieu who had identified the progesterone receptor suggested to Roussel-Uclaf to modify the progesterone molecule to create an anti-progesterone. Georges Teutsch then synthesized an agent that became initially known as RU468 in 1980. Baulieu investigated the actions of this agent as an anti-progesterone steroid that proved to be able to induce early abortion and became more effective in conjunction with misoprostol. As a proponent of a nonsugical approach to abortion Baulieu became an advocat RU468 even when the company withdrew from the product and propelled him into the limelight of the abortion debate. As an anti-progesterone RU468 also has other potential such as in the treatment of certain conditions (breast cancer, brain cancer, endometriosis, diabetes, hypertension), and the anti-cortison activity he discovered may be useful to manage depression or Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
