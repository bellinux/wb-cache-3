40|$|ABSTRACT The Nile Basin Countries are abundantly {{endowed with}} natural water {{resources}} {{which have been}} the cause of both conflict and cooperation among the <b>riparian</b> <b>countries.</b> There are ten 1 <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> in the Basin with different contributions to the over all flow of the water. It {{is possible to say}} that this transboundary river is indestructible natural bind for countries in the Basin whose catchments area 2 is over 3 million km 2. The Nile river, if equitably distributed among the <b>riparian</b> <b>countries,</b> wouldn't have triggered tension in relations between its riparians. On the basis of historical facts on how the river has been utilized and the slow pace to shift from confrontation to cooperation, this study attempts to reveal the hindrances not to share this vast water resource equitably between riparians for ages. It is believed that the unprecedented demands of the upper <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> to utilize the water equitably is an indication that it is a right time {{to come up with an}} agreement on the utilization of the resource by all riparians. The expansion of the Sahara Desert towards South, the recurrent drought and the trend of population growth in the region are considered to be the legitimate causes for these countries to demand equitable distribution of this water resource. In view of this, an attempt will be made to identify the key elements needed to ensure equitable utilization of the water, not only to alleviate the riparians growing economic problems and political conflicts, but also as an instrument of political harmonization and long range integration of the basin. 1 The <b>Riparian</b> <b>countries</b> are: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda, Brundi, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, Sudan and Egypt 2 Transboundary River/Lake Basin Water Development in Africa: Prospects, problem, and achievements, Dec. 2000 P. 19...|$|R

Upstream countries then decided at another Ministerial meeting in Kinshasa in May 2009 to sign the agreement without having all countries sign at the same time. However, the signing was delayed and at the next Council of Minister meeting in April 2010 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt again asked to defer the signing. The article on water security (Article 14b) has particularly drawn objections from Egypt and Sudan. The article says that member countries would work together to ensure [...] "not to significantly affect the water security of any other Nile Basin State." [...] Egypt and Sudan want the article to read [...] "Not to adversely affect the water security and current uses and rights of any other Nile Basin States" [...] without the qualification [...] "significantly". A former Egyptian minister of water resources and irrigation, Mahmoud Abu-Zeid, sees the framework agreement as a positive beginning, saying that [...] "everybody agreed to more than 95 percent of the articles". An article on the protection and conservation of the basin and its ecosystem - such as the Sudd in Sudan - and an article requiring [...] "prior informed consent" [...] before building new dams had also been controversial during earlier negotiations. Representatives of upstream countries said they were [...] "tired of first getting permission from Egypt before using river Nile water for any development project like irrigation", as required by a treaty signed during the colonial era between Egypt and Britain in 1929. The agreement does not include fixed water shares for each <b>riparian</b> <b>country.</b> The agreement, once effective, will transform the NBI into a permanent Nile River Basin Commission.|$|E

The criterion that considers all (blue and green) water resources and that uses the basin population as the main allocation variable yields the most equitable water allocation. Two important variables are identified over which the riparian countries should reach consensus: 1. The value of green water relative to blue water. 2. The fraction of reserved water, which is defined as the basic entitlement of each <b>riparian</b> <b>country.</b> These findings are based on approximate data and have therefore a limited validity.

40|$|Phosphorus {{being one}} of the {{essential}} elements for all forms of life is also a finite resource. The extensive use of Phosphorus in anthropogenic activities has lead to high nutrient load in surface waters causing eutrophication. The Baltic Sea being a semi enclosed water body and a good example of eutrophication has been chosen as model basis. To determine the magnitude of phosphorus use in Riparian States and the total loads to the sea is investigated using a systems analysis approach. In this thesis the phosphorous flows were examined using substance flow analysis of two types of systems: anthropogenic system and a sub basin system. The anthropogenic system presents the flows and stocks of phosphorus within processes with phosphorus utilization within each <b>Riparian</b> <b>country</b> and the total load of phosphorus to the Baltic Sea. The sub basin system models individual sub basins to determine the total input of phosphorus and the resident stocks of phosphorus in sea water and biomass. Based on the sub basin a hypothesis is formulated to determine the fate of phosphorus in the sea and the identify sinks of phosphorus. Hypothesis: The inflow of phosphorus into the Baltic Sea is not coupled with an increase in phosphorus stock but result in a high sedimentation rate. The sub basins represent phosphorus exporters to other neighboring basins. Within the anthropogenic system, agriculture and food market posses the largest flows and stocks of phosphorus. While the largest loads from the anthropogenic systems are from agricultural run off and waste water discharge. Poland is found to have major share in this contribution of phosphorus flows to the Baltic Sea. The sub basin Baltic Proper contains the largest stock of phosphorus among all the other sub basins. The test of the hypothesis hold true and sediments of the Baltic Sea have been recognized as major sinks of phosphorus. </p...|$|E

There are two components of the project. Its first component aims to link 14 Himalayan rivers in Northern India and the second component would connect 16 peninsular rivers in Southern India. The first component involves the establishment of connection with the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, which is of special interest to Bangladesh. India seeks to complete this ambitious project by 2016. The Supreme Court of India, in response to a writ petition has directed the government of India to complete the construction of the river linking project by 2012. This proposed scheme for interlinking rivers in India has become a grave cause of concern in Bangladesh and created new tensions with India. Bangladesh expressed its concerns over the potential impact of India’s project on interlinking of trans-boundary rivers on the economy and environment of Bangladesh. Water diversions by India are likely to have a serious impact on Bangladesh's access to and use of fresh water as a lower <b>riparian</b> <b>country.</b> The outcome of the project {{has the potential to be}} an unprecedented man made disaster for natural ecosystems and human health in Bangladesh. Many including the civil societies in both India and Bangladesh are now apprehensive of its viability and detrimental effects. The controversy surrounding the project is steadily outgrowing the national arena of Bangladesh and India and making the project an international concern. This paper examines the impact of this project on downstream ecology and economy of Bangladesh. It analyses the relevant international law, international environmental law and policies in determining the rights and obligations of the riparian states in sharing and utilising their common water of international rivers. It outlines the responsibility and liability of riparian states, such as India, for their action in diverting the waters of international rivers causing serious detriment to the use and rightful share of co-riparian states, such as Bangladesh. 1 page(s...|$|E

The Ugandan Ministry of Water and Environment provided the external supports including data. Climate is indubitably a key driver of change determining different characteristics and distributions of natural and managed systems. Change in climate is hypothesized to be a result of mainly increase in greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere and has been widely documented in literatures as involving increase in global temperature. Human activities, primarily burning of fossil fuels andclearing of forests are also widely documented to have greatly intensified thenatural greenhouse effect resulting into an enhancement of global warming. Dueto global warming, several of the constituents of the components of the climatesystem, including hydrological cycle, will be severely perturbed. Scientistsaround the globe are using climate models such as Global Climate Models (GCMs) to facilitate the understanding of the changes in the climate system withoptimistic attempts to project future climate based on, for example,socioeconomic scenarios. Corroborated studies have conspicuously shown thatchange in climate is a real threat to a global society and its environment. Thethreat is mainly extremes of climate such as severe droughts and prolonged orintense wet spells resulting into floods, among others, which have very strongnegative impacts on both natural and managed systems. Change inclimate may potentially alter the frequency, quantity, location and duration ofhydrological regimes. Changed hydrological extremes will have significantimplications on the planning and design of hydraulic structures and generalcharacteristics of water resources such as quantities and qualities. Thechanges could aggravate periodic and cyclic shortfalls of water supply inaddition to other factors such as landuse malpractices. Increasingaccumulation and availability of climate related information such as scientificpublications and more especially the data for future possible climate statesobtained through application of GCMs and past climate are rapidly driving theclimate change impacts studies to the next level. The demand for hydrologicalimplications of climate change is one big area of concern because of thesignificant role hydrology plays in the sustainability of human and ecologicallives. The main objective of this study was thus to investigate the possibleimpacts of climate change on the hydrological extremes and water resources inthe upper Nile basin, Lake Victoria catchments, with a yawning focus on thehydrological consequences for the River Katonga and River Ruizi catchmentresponses. Investigation oftrends in the historical hydrometeorological records formed the first objectiveof this study. Trend analysis results do not only provide information on thegeneral direction of observed change but also unravel significant changes thathave occurred over and above the expected natural climate variability and may linkthem to past consequences. Sincethe effects of climate change are unleashedmore through the occurrence of extremes, the presence of a significant lineartrend in a long term climate record of extremes may provide evidence of asignificant shift from the natural trend to that which is enhanced by, forexample, anthropogenic forcing. Analysis of long term records of extremes forrainfall, temperature and streamflows from selected stations within the studyarea were considered in this study. The findings indicated that these extremesare generally experiencing a positive trend. Albeit positive trend wasgenerally demonstrated in the extremes for the selected variables, the presenceof significant linear trend was only manifested in the extremes of the data forthe stations located in the northern and eastern parts of the Lake Victoriabasin. This may suggest that the monotony in the linear trend is probably anindicator of the sensitivity of the regions extremes to climate change due topossible external enhancement of the natural climate agitation. The latter hasimplications for flood risks if the trend is maintained. Furthermore, thehigher significant anomalies for the 1990 s as compared to that of the 1960 s maysuggest a more intense enhancement of the change in the natural variability inthe recent climate. Correlation between change in the extremes of rainfall andthat of the minimum temperature was demonstrated to be stronger compared toother variables. This may suggest that in the absence of extreme rainfall data,minimum temperature may be a good indicator of the rainfall extremes. The credibilityof the GCMs in representing the current and past climate needs to be assessedbefore the GCM data are employed to aid assessment of hydrological impacts ofclimate change. Thus, the second objective {{of this study was to}} test thereliability of the GCMs based on their simulation runs for the 20 th century(present day climate). The present day simulations were evaluated against theobserved hydrometeorological records using mainly statistical metrics. Thefindings showed that several GCMs are quite implausible with respect tosimulation of the climate of the Lake Victoria basin and more tasks still lieahead for the climate modelers. However, the evaluation results for some of theGCMs provided motivation for their employment in the impact assessment for theregion. Change inhydrological regimes due to projected change in climate necessitates comparingthe future hydrological time series with that of the current or observedclimate. GCMs directly provide future hydrological time series such as rainfalland temperature based on Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Nevertheless, the scales in theGCM experimental runs still need to be similar with the one needed for thestudy of local hydrology if a meaningful comparison is being sought. Conventionapproach to match the scales in GCMs with that of the hydrology at catchmentlevel is through what is termed downscaling. The third objective of the studywas to formulate a methodology for the improvement of the perturbation approachfor downscaling rainfall. The innovated technique ensures the extraction ofclimate change signals at larger scale and transferring them to local scale iscarried out while accounting for the climate change signals of the wet spellsin the time series. The results demonstrated the plausibility of the technique. The downscaledhydrometeorological variables enabled the investigation of climate changeimpacts on rainfall in the study area. The fourth objective was to analyzechange in rainfall extremes because of their apparent manifestation in the faceof climate change. Extremes from selected stations across the study area wereconsidered and comparison was done based mainly on extreme value analysis. Thefindings showed that the magnitude of rainfall extremes are projected to bealtered significantly with the extremes for the eastern part of the LakeVictoria basin increasing higher than those for the western part. The rainfallextremes for the south and the southwestern parts of the basin are projected todecrease. Analysis of the possible change in rainfallIntensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships was also carried out usingextreme value technique. The results showed that change in the IDF would havesignificant implications for hydraulic design practices and other relatedengineering applications. The otherobjective was to carry out a rigorous analysis of the possible hydrologicalresponses of the River Katonga and Ruizi catchments, given possible futureclimate states, based on rainfall-runoff model simulations. The rainfall-runoffmodel was driven by the downscaled variables from a suit of selected GCM runsunder three different SRES scenarios code-named A 1, A 1 B and B 1 of the IPCC andfor two different future periods, 2050 s and 2090 s. Since the focus of the studywas centered on high flows, considerable efforts were devoted to ensure thatthe development of the rainfall-runoff model take into account good fits withthe high flow peaks during calibration and validation stages. Impacts ofclimate change on the streamflows from the two catchments were executed bycomparing the future streamflows with that of the present day (control) streamflows. The results showed that the hydrological response of therespective catchment is likely to underscore the integrity of the water balanceof the catchments. The water balance of each of the two catchments is projectedto experience a significant deficit and may severely affect the hydrologicdemands from the two catchments in addition to other constraints. Furthermore,the flood frequency is projected to be affected and this has implications onthe engineering practices and other water resources planning involving floodfrequency estimations. In conclusive remarks, assessment of the possibleimpacts of climate change on the hydrological extremes and water resources ofthe upper Nile basin was carried out based on a suit of GCM runs, which werealso used for AR 4 IPCC. This should set the stage for the subsequent relevantresearch tasks that seek to address hydrological impacts of climate change forthe region. Water managers in the catchments are advised to take a step thatmay lead to the revision of the current relevant hydraulic design guidelines inorder to take into account the future hydrologic risks imposed by change inclimate. In addition, a collaborative effort is needed across relevant researchdisciplines and the responsible water agencies in the region for a moreholistic and integrated research syntheses that can, unanimously, translateinto a regional strategy and policy for adaptation to climate change. It shouldbe noted also that a number of uncertainty sources are known and constitute oneof the most setbacks in climate change impacts assessment, which cannot beshirked.

40|$|Environmental {{challenges}} are often transnational and affect {{the daily lives}} of people as well as broader national interests. This research paper focuses on the challenge of finding a balance between economic development and environmental degradation in the Mekong subregion and assesses the role of regional institutions in dealing with this issue. Finding a balance is important, because more than 70 million people live on the river banks and the subregion is crucial for the economic development of its six <b>riparian</b> <b>countries.</b> Concentrating on two organizations - the Mekong River Commission (MRC) and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) - this article argues that regional attempts to find a balance have so far largely failed. Reasons for this lack of success include the MRC's failure to include all <b>riparian</b> <b>countries,</b> {{and the fact that the}} GMS has only recently widened its focus from economic development to also include environmental and social issues.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the current}} status of Brahmaputra water resources and identifies the perspectives of <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> regarding the development of the Brahmaputra basin. Water is strongly linked with the overall development framework of the Brahmaputra basin. However, the absence of integrated management of Brahmaputra water resources and lack of coordination among the riparian states constitutes an ongoing threat to future development plans within the basin. Brahmaputra’s abundant hydropower potential can help give <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> a safer energy future that is the key driving force behind the prospect of potential cooperation. This paper identifies the opportunities for cooperation and regional development through integrated water development and management of the Brahmaputra basin. It is essential to develop an integrated water resources management approach involving all riparians intended to foster regional development and overcome the prospect of sever water conflict along the Brahmaputra basin. Key words: Brahmaputra basin; integrated water resources management; water cooperation; regional development. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a linear programming model that allocates {{the waters of}} the Euphrates and Tigris rivers to irrigation, urban consumption, and on-stream hydroelectricity production in the three <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> (Turkey, Syria, and Iraq), by maximizing the aggregate net benefits from water uses while accounting for water-conveyance costs. The model represents, in network form, the system made of the two rivers and their various consumption, supply, and transshipment nodes, and accounts for evaporation and return flows. The constraints include water-conservation balances and maximum and minimum water consumption. The model is used to assess the economic consequences of various cooperation and noncooperation strategies that may be adopted by the <b>riparian</b> <b>countries.</b> Cooperative game-theory concepts (core and Shapley value) are used to identify stable water allocations, under which all three countries find it beneficial to cooperate. The results suggest that an allocation of the total benefits exists, under various scenarios of future energy prices and agricultural productivities, that makes this global cooperation attractive to all countries. Various research extensions are outlined. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} the constraints and prospects of the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) concept {{for the development of}} the Ganges basin. IWRM has been chosen as a focus of this study as all contemporary international conferences, summits, and declarations promote IWRM concept for effective and efficient management of water resources. This thesis has three parts. The first part critically reviews the evolution of the concept of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) at international conferences over the past three decades and analyses the prospects of IWRM in resolving the current water crisis. It also identifies seven crucial challenges to implement IWRM in the practical level. The second part highlights the various dimensions of water conflict among the <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> of the Ganges basin and the views of <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> in integrated management of the basin. It also identifies the constraints and potential benefits of integrated water management along the basin.

40|$|The <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> of the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) are {{endowed with}} a {{richness}} {{of natural resources}} such as forests, water, agricultural land, mineral resources, and biodiversity. These resources provide a wealth of different environmental services to stakeholders from the local to the international level. However, their heterogeneous spatial distribution indicates that this service provision is uneven throughout the LMB, and that recent and current processes reinforce trends towards unsustainable development. These processes comprise general macro-economic dynamics among the <b>riparian</b> <b>countries,</b> resulting in socio-economic disparities that impact on natural resource management, as well as socio-economic and political dependencies that lead to inequitable configurations of decision-making governing environmental service provision in different sub-regions. In light of these general trends {{it is argued that}} environmental services provided by forests and upland agriculture must be considered as key for future development policies in the LMB: on the one hand, the weaker parts of the region are facing an increasing pressure {{to catch up with the}} high pace of economic growth. Whatever the engine of this growth will be in the long term, development will inevitably pass through agricultural transformation and intensification in the short term. On the other hand, it mus...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of Lake Victoria {{is a high}} priority to the <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> that benefit directly from its resources. Management regulations have been formulated and implemented {{with the aim of}} maintaining the lake's ecological quality as well as sustaining fisheries exploitation for economic gain. Results indicate, however, that the regulations have not been successful in maintaining the state of the lake's ecosystem nor the fisheries. There has been a continuing decline in fish catches as well as declining biodiversity. Currently, the <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> are considering the introduction of a co-management regime as an alternative managerial strategy to address the lake's problems. In this paper it is argued that the failure of the former management regulations was because ownership of the lake was not clearly defined. It is further argued that even if co-management were to be successfully instituted, it will yield very minimal results if the problem of ownership is not properly addressed. This paper explores the ownership status of the lake based on data collected in Tanzania, and examines the relationship between, and significance of, ownership and co-management. The research makes recommendations for how these concepts can contribute to an integrated {{management of}} the lak...|$|R

40|$|Water is {{the core}} of all {{developing}} activities. Given the introduction of the "sustainable development" concept, water is being perceived as the centrality of all economic and social activities. Limited fresh water resources, the increasing rate of population growth and the hypothetical present and future impacts of climate change have led the concerned national authorities to rethink their previous conventional approaches to water resources. In this regard, new guidelines have been introduced within the Integrated Water Resources Management framework. These principles persuade the water sector planners and decision makers to be involved in an alternative ongoing management process along with considering the different involved components from natural and human systems interacting with each other. On the other hand, water has a naturally erratic behaviour. It may cross the political borders; so two or more countries would share one common water resource. In these situations countries struggle {{to take advantage of the}} available water as much as they can, even by ignoring the rights of other stakeholders outside of the borders. New concerns such as "national security" arise and conflicts may happen between the <b>riparian</b> <b>countries.</b> However, sharing one common resource can be an opportunity to bring the <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> to the negotiation tables and make them involve in cooperative processes. Hydropolitic, studies the conflicts and cooperation processes between the <b>riparian</b> <b>countries</b> in one international basin. Through this research the case of Hirmand/Helmand River Basin that includes parts of Iran and Afghanistan is studied. Initially, attempts are made to provide information from several secondary sources about the general features of the basin. Then complementary actions such as field visit and interviews are carried out and the process of social learning is triggered in order to be able to better understanding of the given data and draw new facts from what people reflect on the current complex situation. After analysing the problematic situation, recommendations are made in the final part particularly in association with the IWRM principles and the exiting opportunities to promote cooperation between two countries and achieve an improved situation...|$|R
