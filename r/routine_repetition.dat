Some American newspapers quoted it differently, [...] "Day by day, in every way, I'm getting better and better." [...] The Coué method centered on a <b>routine</b> <b>repetition</b> of this particular expression according to a specified ritual—preferably as much as twenty times a day, and especially {{at the beginning and}} at the end of each day.

[...] Unlike a commonly held belief that a strong conscious will constitutes the best path to success, Coué maintained that curing some of our troubles requires a change in our unconscious thought, which can be achieved only by using our imagination.|$|E

It tentatively began (c.1901) with very directive one-to-one hypnotic inter-ventions, based upon the approaches and techniques that Coué had acquiredfrom an American correspondence course.

40|$|I was {{a second}} year student of {{philosophy}} at the University of Latvia when I started working as an interviewer for the recently established National Oral History project. I realised that Latvia’s recent history {{is not merely a}} thing that one finds in history books, but the real experience of my fellow Latvians. Narratives about daily life as it was 50 or 70 years ago created a deeper understanding of changing social life and inspired me not to take norms, ideas and practices that are so common now for granted. After some years of studying biographical accounts from the perspective of social sciences, the very construction of the narrative came to the foreground of my interests and, consequently, my PhD research focused on the social and cultural construction of narratives (Bela-Krūmiņa 2004). This review article introduces the study of everyday life from the perspective of Latvian oral history research. First, the appearance of the everyday life history is discussed. Then, I will give a short overview of studies focusing on the aspects of daily life in the post-war Latvian countryside. EVERYDAY LIFE AS A FIELD OF HISTORICAL RESEARCH Practices of daily life have long been an important field of research in social an-thropology, ethnology and folklore studies as well as in biographical sociology. In the field of history, however, the situation is different. We usually associate daily life with <b>routines,</b> <b>repetitions,</b> chores – ordinary activities taking place in an individual’s life, such as laundering, cooking, or going to work every morning, whereas history is associated with politicised, significant single events that influence the lives of many people. Examples of these historical events include the founding of the Latvian stat...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{shows how}} {{ethnography}} specifically {{helps us to}} examine the relationship between discursive practices, conduct and identity-work, and the appearance and reappearance of stabilities. It explores how the creation and continuous rewriting of an ethnographic text draws upon many different registers of social life, including interactions over time and across many differently situated occasions. Using examples from the domain of medicine, the paper shows how by examining the conduct of nurses, doctors and patients as they occur across a variety of 'differently situated occasions', we can examine the multiplicity of discourses available for members to ground their moves. The paper illuminate a process of analysis and writing that helps elucidate how members, through enrolling what is available, become enrolled and align themselves within networks of interest. What we find is not just <b>routines</b> and <b>repetitions,</b> or even deviations from norms and infractions, the foundations of structural relations of power; nor do we find fluidity, an idea that anything goes. Rather what we find through a particular approach to ethnographic writing is ‘motility’: the ways in which participants switch discursive domains and move the world. By pressing attention to motility the different moves members make can be shown to help re-accomplish socio-cultural relations of power. The approach described thus could be called post-structural rather than post-modern ethnography...|$|R

Data were derived from three sources: 80 hours of videotape of four children (aged 1, 0 - 1, 8 years at the outset) and their families, 20 ethnographic interviews of mothers, and participant observation notes. Themes emerged about the specific accommodations that Inuit caregivers made in their communication with young children. Child-centered accommodations included: (a) two special registers of affectionate talk, (b) specialized vocabulary, (c) making language more understandable to children, and (d) excluding children from adult conversations. Situation-centered accommodations instructed children through teasing and <b>repetition</b> <b>routines.</b> Finally, silence {{played an important role}} in communicative interaction. Inuit children were socialized to learn by listening and to communicate without talk.

40|$|Pathological Demand Avoidance’ {{is a term}} {{increasingly}} used by practitioners in the United Kingdom. It was coined to describe a profile of obsessive resistance to everyday demands and requests, with a tendency to resort to ‘socially manipulative’ behaviour, including outrageous or embarrassing acts. Pathological demand avoidance is thought to share aspects of social impairment with autism spectrum disorders, but autism spectrum disorder–appropriate strategies, such as <b>routine</b> and <b>repetition,</b> are described as unhelpful. Outrageous acts and lack of concern for their effects draw parallels with conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits. However, reward-based techniques, effective with conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits, seem not to work in pathological demand avoidance. Despite increasing interest and controversy over the pathological demand avoidance label, {{there is only one}} published study to date. We present the first systematic comparison of the behavioural profile of children receiving the term pathological demand avoidance (N = 25) to children with autism spectrum disorders (N = 39) or conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits (N = 28), using parent-report indices of psychopathology. The pathological demand avoidance group displayed comparable levels of autistic traits and peer problems to the autism spectrum disorders group and anti-social traits approaching those seen in the conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits group. Emotional symptoms in pathological demand avoidance exceeded both comparison groups. Findings highlight the extreme behavioural impairment associated with pathological demand avoidance and the need to explore whether behavioural overlap reflects a similar neurocognitive basis to existing groups...|$|R
40|$|Wild {{carnivores}} in zoos, conservation breeding centres, {{and farms}} commonly live in relatively small, unstimulating enclosures. Under these captive conditions, {{in a range}} of species including giant pandas, black-footed ferrets, and European mink, male reproductive abilities are often poor. Such problems have long been hypothesized to be caused by these animals' housing conditions. We show {{for the first time that}} rearing under welfare-improving (i. e., highly valued and stress-reducing) environmental enrichments enhances male carnivores' copulatory performance: in mate choice competitions, enriched male American mink (Neovison vison) mated more often than non-enriched males. We screened for several potential mediators of this effect. First was physiological stress and its impact on reproductive physiology; second, stress-mediated changes in morphology and variables related to immunocompetence that could influence male attractiveness; and third, behavioural changes likely to affect social competence, particularly autistic-like excessive <b>routine</b> and <b>repetition</b> ('perseveration') as is reflected in the stereotypies common in captive animals. Consistent with physiological stress, excreted steroid metabolites revealed that non-enriched males had higher cortisol levels and lower androgen levels than enriched conspecifics. Their os penises (bacula) also tended to be less developed. Consistent with reduced attractiveness, non-enriched males were lighter, with comparatively small spleens and a trend to greater fluctuating asymmetry. Consistent with impaired social competence, non-enriched males performed more stereotypic behaviour (e. g., pacing) in their home cages. Of all these effects, the only significant predictor of copulation number was stereotypy (a trend suggesting that low bodyweights may also be influential) : highly stereotypic males gained the fewest copulations. The neurophysiological changes underlying stereotypy thus handicap males sexually. We hypothesise that such males are abnormally perseverative when interacting with females. Investigating similar problems in other taxa would be worthwhile, since many vertebrates, wild and domestic, live in conditions that cause stereotypic behaviour and/or impair neurological development...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the existing literature in fan and audience research, particularly within television studies. By focusing upon issues of identity, ontological security, and cultural value, this thesis proposes a conceptualisation of fandom which accounts for inherent dualisms such as the tension between community and hierarchy, and the internal importance of fandom to individuals {{and the impact of}} external social factors. Whist prior work has failed to adequately theorise such contradictions, this thesis draws on the work of sociologists Pierre Bourdieu and Anthony Giddens to propose that we view fandom as forms of 'pure relationship' which enable fans to negotiate their self-identities, gain trust and comfort, and accrue levels of fan power. These ideas are demonstrated via empirical data generated by a cross comparative multi fandom case study of three online fan communities devoted to the television programmes Big Brother UK 7, Neighbours, and The West Wing. This thesis demonstrates that fans across different fandoms make distinctions regarding the 'quality' of their chosen fan objects, those who create them, and the position of fellow fans. They also rely upon the <b>routines</b> and <b>repetitions</b> of television scheduling to provide them with ontological security and a sense of trust in the fan object. This thesis also examines the results when this trust is undermined by unwelcome narrative developments or the total cessation of the fan object, which this work uniquely theorises as 'post-object fandom'. Furthermore, fan practices are enacted within the specific arena of the broadcasting field, and this thesis situates the battles over fan objects between producers and fans within the context of this field. Thus, this thesis proposes a theoretical model which considers fandom as a community and a hierarchical site of struggles over power and capital, accounts for the internal impact of an individual's fandom on their sense of self, and treats fan/object and fan/fan relationships equally...|$|R

In this paper we will address these questions by understanding both, routines as well as decision making, as integrated elements of a higher entity: economic act. In {{the first section of}} the paper, we introduce our action framework. Following we outline, how routine can be acquired and applied in the course of repetition. As a result, we argue that – although of structurally different nature – both, routine and decision making, belong to the cognitive processes that link purpose and operations in act. Furthermore, we argue that with increasing <b>repetitions,</b> <b>routine</b> gains an increasing potential to substitute decision making. Finally we turn {{to the question of what}} opportunities actors have to influence routines by deliberate planning and decision making and how the acquired routine affects deliberate planning and decision making in return. We show that act indeed has to be understood as an interplay of routinezed repetition and deliberate planning and decision making...|$|R
30|$|In this article, I {{have tried}} to read James J. Gibson’s concept of {{affordances}} through a phenomenological lens. The benefit of this theoretical reinterpretation is threefold: First, by insisting that affordances actively invite certain actions, phenomenology dispels the awkward idea of ‘affordance-facts’ that has lead educational researchers to compile strangely detached lists of technical features. Secondly, phenomenology helps us analyze expressly multistable objects like digital technologies that have no canonical affordances (Costall, 2012). As Cutting (1982) argues, a sheet of paper, another quintessentially multistable artifact, affords an endless amount of action possibilities including writing, drawing, wadding up, cutting, photocopying, burning, and so on. “To be sure, it does not afford flying to Baghdad upon”, he continues, “but the exclusion of a large domain of behaviors does not diminish {{the fact that an}} infinity remain” (p. 216). But does that mean is it up to us to decide which of these affordances are utilized? By focusing on our habitualized use of technological artifacts, phenomenology helps us circumvent such potential voluntarism. Finally, granting analytical priority to habits belies phenomenology’s roots in the mundane aspects of everyday life. In the field of educational technology, this self-conscious immersion in <b>routine</b> and <b>repetition</b> guarantees a much-needed fidelity to the ‘state-of-the-actual’ (Selwyn, 2010), to what is actually going in the day-to-day realities of educational practice. In other words, while the laptop surely provides a wealth of technical ‘action possibilities’, decontextualized analyses that treat affordances as quasi-objectivist features of the world cannot tell us which of these affordances will be utilized in practice or how. To do so, we must understand affordances as magnetic and multistable. Ultimately, a phenomenological approach to affordances help us do so and thereby provides a critical and empirically based approach to educational technology, which counterbalances the currently reigning techno-optimism (“technologies will save our educational system”) without lapsing into technological instrumentalism (“technologies will be what we make of them”). This tactic not only suggests that we place less faith (and money) in the idea of ICT as some sort of educational panacea; it also urges us to discuss the downsides and drawbacks of our current technohabits.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{optimize}} the image acquisition parameters for improved steady-state (SS) contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) of the carotid arteries with gadobenate dimeglumine. Materials and Methods: An inversion recovery fast low-angle shot (IR-FLASH) sequence for ultrafast {{determination of the}} longitudinal relaxation rate R(1) was first optimized on phantoms and tested against a <b>routine</b> variable <b>repetition</b> time (TR) spin echo sequence used as reference standard. Different combinations of flip angle (FA, between 6 and 14 degrees) and inversion time (between 134 and 9000 milliseconds) were evaluated to achieve the best trade off between speed and accuracy. The optimized sequence was thereafter used in vivo in 5 subjects to determine the time evolution of blood R(1) at 1. 5 T after administration of gadobenate dimeglumine at 0. 1 mmol/kg bodyweight. An optimal FA for angiographic measurement was thereafter derived from the Ernst equation based on experimental values of R(1) previously determined in vivo. Finally, steady-state CE-MRA examinations were performed in 20 subjects to evaluate the improved contrast achieved after optimization of the FA for maximal blood signal enhancement. Results: An ultrafast IR-FLASH sequence with a flip angle of 8 degrees and a properly defined set of inversion time values was shown to give in vitro R(1) determinations that were in good agreement with those obtained using a routine, time consuming, variable-TR spin echo sequence. The use of this ultrafast IR-FLASH sequence in vivo allowed the blood signal behavior in the carotid arteries after gadobenate dimeglumine administration to be monitored. Using this sequence, the R(1) decreased from 8. 7 +/- 0. 96 s(- 1) at 30 seconds after injection to 3. 8 +/- 0. 24 s(- 1) at 10 minutes after injection. Based on these data for R(1), the optimal FA for SS CE-MRA was calculated to be 18 degrees for a gradient echo acquisition protocol with TR = 7. 5 milliseconds, when gadobenate dimeglumine is used. Significantly higher blood {{signal to noise ratio}} was achieved on SS images acquired using a three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo sequence with a FA of 18 degrees than on corresponding images acquired with a FA of 35 degrees as used typically for intravascular blood pool contrast agents (52. 5 +/- 8. 3 vs. 29. 5 +/- 6. 0; P < 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U test). Conclusion: Detailed experimental knowledge of the in vivo R(1) behavior of blood after gadobenate dimeglumine injection and appropriate modification of the acquisition parameters enables improved signal intensity enhancement on steady-state CE-MRA of the carotid arteries...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} selection criteria for prospective dentistry students at the University of Pretoria. A study of the relevant literature was undertaken, and experts at universities in South Africa and Britain were interviewed. Ajob analysis questionnaire was used to identify the relevant job requirements that could serve as selection criteria. Potential selection criteria that were identified include physical potential (e. g. visual-spatial and mechanical ability), cognitive potential (e. g. above-average intellectual potential, aptitude in the mathematical, science and technical fields), personality (e. g. patience with <b>routine</b> activities and <b>repetition)</b> and interpersonal potential (e. g. communication and leadership skills). These criteria were used as the point of departure for designing a draft selection programme. • To whom correspondence should be addressed: Recent changes in South African society have compelled tertiary institutions to think innovatively about their functioning and objectives, and whether they still prepare learners adequately for radically different circumstances. Specific career and socio-economic needs (including the need to train more professionals from previously disadvantaged groups) necessitate the facilitation of revised selection processes and the channelling of students at institutions, such as the University of Pretoria. This study aimed to address this challenge by trying to ascertain the potential dentistry student's configuration of qualities in relation to the unique configuration of requirements for the dentistry profession (Department of Manpower, (994). The first consideration is that a prospective dentistry student should possess the particular configuration of characteristics required to achieve academic and career success (Van Mollendorf, (990) and eventually experience job satisfaction. Therefore, it is important that from an early stage in their studies, prospective dentistry students be channelled into their career on the basis of the configuration of characteristics that correlate positively with the demands that characterise the dentistr...|$|R

However, there are currently no studies of Canadian parents’ perceived motivations for, and their experiences participating in, singing classes with their infants. Therefore, more information is needed on Canadian parents’ experiences, and motivations for, participating in singing classes with their infants in order to better understand and support healthy parenting behaviours and infant development [...] Specifically, the research questions guiding this preliminary inquiry, were: (1) 	What do parents identify as factors motivating them to participate in parent-infant singing classes? and (2) 	What do parents identify as the benefits of participating in parent-infant singing classes? Interviews were conducted with four mothers who were attending parent-infant singing classes. Two music instructors involved in the parent-infant singing classes were also interviewed {{to learn more about the}} content and functioning of the classes. Additionally, the Parenting Sense of Competency Scale (PSOCS) and the Key to Interactive Parenting Scale (KIPS) were administered to gain additional information related to parent participation in parent-child singing groups (i. e., parenting behaviours and parental sensitivity), and to triangulate data from parent interviews. Four themes emerged from the parents’ interview data: (1) mothers’ motivations, (2) enhanced parenting, (3) parents’ enhanced view of self, and (4) predictors of change. Parents described their development of music-based parenting tools they perceived to have helped them better regulate their infants’ emotions and behaviours, strengthen their parent-child relationship, and support their child’s language and musical development. In addition, parents described the positive development of their view of self as demonstrated by decreases in reported parenting guilt, normalization of parenting struggles, and an increased focus on success. Moreover, preliminary findings raised questions about additional variables that may enhance growth of parenting skills to foster language and musical development and parental self-efficacy, such as using <b>repetition,</b> <b>routines</b> and structure, and developing supportive relationships with classmates and instructors.

40|$|Ritual as {{prescribed}} by tradition {{has long been}} instrumental in defining the essence of ethnicity. It is governed by accepted rules, values and behavioral norms embedded in daily <b>routine</b> through <b>repetition.</b> Contemporary Malays have inherited rituals, dating since the 7 th century, known as ‘adat’. The advent of Malacca Sultanate in the 15 th century revolutionized the rituals to their highest mature state, defining the essence of ‘Malayness’ through its civilization; by strengthening the Islamic belief, Malay language and traditions. Nevertheless, modernization and cross-cultural influences have created multiple readings of rituals. Hence, contemporary Malays are paradoxical, both traditionalist and modern {{when it comes to}} the practice of rituals. This is due to the fact that Malay rituals are practiced in everyday life, rather than symbolically performed. This is also implies a strong correlation between traditional principles and contemporary lifestyles. Perhaps it means that their root remains essential to Malays, despite their inevitable evolution along different living conditions. The traditional Malay house is a living artifact of how rituals are framed in space. Through its layout the notion of rituals is projected in everyday routine, preserving Malay values and manners. In the past, the house allowed Malay to be ‘decent’, in terms of social life, domestic culture, ethics, and religion. Gender segregation and sitting rituals have been since then the most important rituals projected in its interior layout. This has remained almost the same for 400 years, while its exterior façade absorbing various influences. Therefore, rituals embedded into the daily life result in persistent spatial qualities, regardless of a house’s location or stylistic influences. The evolution from the traditional house to a modern high-rise apartment has triggered multiple critiques regarding the performance of rituals. One may think that a generic modern layout allows the practice of ‘zero’ rituals. Yet, it allows rituals to be transposed into ordinary domestic objects framing the life of its inhabitants. This phenomenon is explicit in analytical studies of modern Malay apartments, where furniture and everyday objects are re-appropriated to suit rituals. Hence, this project is a manifesto that intends to canonize ordinary objects as ritualistic artifacts, fully acknowledging Malaysia’s contemporary modern context. The modern Malay house -now in an urban setting- becomes a background platform that allows the individual to perform rituals through singular objects. Three scenarios based on the daily life of a modern Malay family are created as representations of specific rituals. The first scenario -‘Who Is Your Best Friends?’- is a depiction of ‘serambi’ or reception deck which emphasise rituals of gender segregations in a community. The second scenario -‘Secret Recipe’- portrays an island kitchen cabinet that highlights the essence of sitting rituals in Malay dining etiquette. Finally the third scenario -‘Hide & Seek’- intends to emphasise rituals related to different gender needs within a family. As such, the manifesto is a critical tool in order to rethink the position of rituals in the modern Malay house. The scenarios may be exaggerations of reality, however this allows Malays to realize that rituals are part of their daily routine, no matter where and when they are performed to sustain the agenda of ’decent’ Malay.

40|$|Experiencing Dialysis: A Descriptive Phenomenological Study of Nurses and Patients in Dialysis Satellite Units Dialysis {{satellite}} units (DSU) {{have been}} a method of treatment delivery in the UK since the 1980 s. Units were developed to expand dialysis provision and serve a number of patients from specific geographical areas. There is a dearth of research related to satellite unit dialysis. Most research related to haemodialysis usually incorporates satellite unit patients in their findings. Available research is related to measurable parameters of medical treatment. At {{the start of the}} research there was no research related to nursing experience on satellite units. Nursing experience was examined generally and specifically around aspects such as stress. Research relating to patient experience is based upon methodologically accepted approaches such as measuring stress, coping, compliance and quality of life. These methods frequently reduce experience into statistics that, while they have a range of application, often miss the depth of meaning related to experience. Patients express a great deal of satisfaction about their experiences of satellite units and are reluctant to return to a main unit for treatment. This expression of experience stimulated the research question ‘What is the experience of patients and nurses in dialysis satellite units?’ The research aims to examine the subjective experience of both nurses and patients. The research will aim to describe structures of experience to shed light upon expressions of satisfaction and reluctance. The means for examining subjective experience required the use of a qualitative research method. The descriptive phenomenology of Husserl was chosen for its distinct structure and theory free approach to studying phenomena of the Lifeworld. The method of data collection was provided by a novel phenomenological interview structure which incorporated the use of imaginative variation. Observation as a method of data collection was also used because it provided aspects of experience that would remain hidden through interview method alone. Spradley’s (1980) descriptive matrix was used to guide observations. A combination of both methods increases phenomenological adequacy. Three DSUs provided the field of study. A total of twenty five patients and twelve staff members were interviewed. Ethical approval was obtained for the research. 5 Data analysis was undertaken with a modified version of Giorgi’s (1985) phenomenological method of data reduction by meaning units and generalization. Imaginative variation was applied for structural clarity and structural coding was applied for adequacy. Four general structures of experience were synthesised to provide a constitution of phenomena. 1. Experiencing Illness. Illness is context structure that gives meaning to dialysis. Minimalization of illness is structured through the absence of doctors, not seeing illness and distancing illness by referral to the main unit. 2. Time Saved. Time is saved for the patient through fewer patients for dialysis, time distraction, and absence of illness. Staff save time through preparation and planning and making time available for patients. 3. Feeling Safe: <b>Repetition,</b> <b>routine,</b> familiarity, predictability, nearness and closeness, being known, knowing others and not thinking of illness all provide an experience structure of feeling safe. 4. Freedom to Practice: Making a difference. Feeling isolated and an awareness of responsibility leads to decision thoughtfulness. Thoughtfulness enhances decision making giving a sense of autonomy, confidence and freedom to practice. These facets of experience enable nurses to make a difference to patient care. The findings of the research identify the patient desire to avoid experiencing illness improves coping ability. Satellite unit nurses develop enhanced skills and expertise that enables quality patient care. The experience of nurses is congruent with other nurse-led units. Implications for practice are the development of autonomy and responsibility which would enhance service provision for patients. An innovative application of phenomenology involving observation and imaginative variation can produce accurate descriptions of structure of experience.
