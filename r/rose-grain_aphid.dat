40|$|The <b>rose-grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (RGA) is an {{introduced}} pest which attacks cereals and {{can cause}} considerable loss of yield. It is a pest of some economic concern in affected grain growing areas of New Zealand.

40|$|We have {{compared}} the basic {{organization of the}} primary olfactory centre, the antennal lobe (AL), in 4 hemipteran species representing the 2 major lineages in this order. The Homoptera were represented by the psyllid Trioza apicalis and its aphid relatives the grain aphid Sitobion avenae Fabricius and the <b>rose-grain</b> <b>aphid</b> Metopolophium dirhodum Walker, whereas the Heteroptera were represented by the pentatomid stink bug Euschistus heros Fabricius. The olfactory systems of psyllids and aphids are generally very small, with low numbers of afferents in comparison to other insect groups, and the smallest described so far belongs to T. apicalis, comprising less than 50 olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Originally, we tried to estimate numbers of olfactory glomeruli in the AL of T. apicalis, which in insects generally correspond closely {{to the number of}} different types of ORNs. Neither immunocytochemical staining nor anterograde staining of ORNs revealed any glomerular structures in the ALs of T. apicalis or the 2 aphids that were included for comparison. In contrast, the ALs of the pentatomid stink bug E. heros displayed numerous distinct and well-delineated glomeruli, showing that aglomerular ALs are not typical of all insects within the order Hemiptera. Glomeruli are hallmark features of olfactory lobes in many different phyla, and the absence of glomerular structures in psyllids and aphids appears to be unique in insects that depend on olfactory orientation...|$|E

Adult apterae that developed on Rapier wheat had their mean relative growth rate (MRGR) reduced by 6 and 9 % under uncrowded and crowded conditions, respectively, whereas the crowding treatment reduced MRGR by 3 %, but only in Rapier aphids. Rapier resistance also reduced adult dry weight by 13 and 14 % under crowded and uncrowded conditions, respectively, whereas crowding reduced it by 34 and 35 % in Rapier and Huntsman aphids, respectively. Development on Rapier substantially reduced the topical LC 50 of malathion by 37. 8 and 34. 8 % under crowded and uncrowded conditions, suggesting that plant antibiosis increased malathion susceptibility. By comparison, crowding only reduced the LC 50 by 29. 5 and 26. 0 % on Huntsman and Rapier. The LD 50 data showed that reductions on aphid body size on Rapier and through crowding did not fully explain the differences in LC 50. This was particularly in the values for crowded aphids that were actually 80 % higher than for uncrowded ones. Thi sapparent tolerance of crowded aphids, however, may partly be due to loss of insecticide from small aphids at dosing. Evidence of synergy between plant resistance and insecticide susceptibility raisest he possibility of using reduced concentrations of pesticides to control aphids on resistant crop cultivars, with diminished impacts on non-target and beneﬁcial species important in integrated pest management(IPM) progra...|$|E
40|$|Interactions between host {{plants and}} aphids under water stress {{conditions}} were examined. Two controlled environment room studies, a Veld experiment and phenological modelling analysis {{were used to}} investigate three different plant-aphid relationships. The aim of these studies {{was to determine the}} results of water shortage on plant and pest populations, which are likely to result under climate change scenarios. The central hypothesis was that mild drought stress would lead to greater aphid populations through a beneficial increase of small nitrogenous molecules in the phloem sap providing improved diet quality — the Plant Stress Hypothesis (White, 1969). Myzus persicae (the peach–potato aphid) is a broad-range feeder with a preference for senescent foliage. Contrary to expectations, on young cabbage plants, Brassica oleracea var capitata, it was found to increase faster and to a greater extent on well-watered hosts. Aphids were also found to prevent osmoregulation in droughted plants. Despite this, the aphid infestation led to a drought-like response in all plants irrespective of watering regime, causing significantly reduced growth. Metopolophium dirhodum (the <b>rose–grain</b> <b>aphid)</b> overwinters as eggs on Rosa spp. but most of its life-cycle is spent on grasses and cereal crops. As with M. persicae, aphid infestation caused drought-like symptoms even in well-watered plants. The mechanism of reduction in plant health is most likely through aphid damage to the efficiency of Photosystem a within 7 days of infestation. On young barley plants, Hordeum vulgare, the <b>rose–grain</b> <b>aphid</b> was found to increase faster and to greater extent on droughted hosts. In contrast to M. persicae, the study strongly supported the Plant Stress Hypothesis, Finding that even mild water stress of approximately − 0. 3 MPa could lead to conditions favourable to rapid aphid population increase. The difference in the response of different species of aphids may be associated more with the levels of soluble nitrogen in their diet than specifically host plant water status. Drepanosiphum platanoidis is an aphid specific to sycamore, Acer pseudoplatanus and spends its entire life-cycle on that species. In the Veld, the total number of aphids supported by a single tree was found to correlate most strongly with soluble leaf nitrogen. In addition, the number of aphids on individual leaves was found to correlate strongly and negatively with stomatal conductance and leaf water potential. Finally, analysis of historical aphid suction-trap data was carried out. UK Rothamsted suction-traps are 12. 2 m tall and sample air at 0. 75 m 3 s- 1, with daily aphid sampling between April and November. The traps are designed to catch the largest proportion of aphids in the total insect sample and to reduce the effect of surrounding land-use on the sample. The area represented by a trap may be as much as 700 km 2 (Harrington and Woiwod, 2007). The dataset is the longest and most geographically extensive for aphid populations, comprising 46 sites across Europe as of 2011. In this analysis, aphid and meteorological data from the Edinburgh East Craigs site were used. This also enabled comparison with D. platanoidis numbers collected in the Veld, which showed a strongly significant positive relationship between the two. Since the data collected in suction-traps are correlated with numbers in the Veld, aphid population analysis can be improved with use of these longer datasets, without reliance on shorter-term Veld surveys. The various population characteristics examined were found to be strongly correlated with each other, but were unconnected to data from previous years. The date of first catch was found to be significantly advancing over time, with strong influences from daily minimum temperatures and vapour pressure deficits of the air within the year. Higher temperatures with lower humidity tend to bring forward the date of first catch. Lower tends to depress the population in the summer. The overall hypothesis that mild drought would benefit aphid populations cannot be accepted, but in two cases of the experiment sections of the work there were strong relationships between aphid numbers and both leaf temperature and soil moisture. The meteorological data analysis indicates that climatic changes towards a hotter, drier climate could substantially alter population dynamics. Harrington, R. and Woiwod, I. (2007).

40|$|Insects {{have become}} {{increasingly}} resistant to chemical control methods, {{while at the same}} time public awareness of the harmful effects of synthetic pesticides has increased. The search for more environmentally 'friendly' means of pest suppression is gaining momentum and biological control (the use of natural enemies to reduce populations of noxious organisms) has become an increasingly sought-after option. Despite an increase in the establishment rate of insect natural enemies, classical biological control of arthropods is currently no more successful than it was one hundred years ago. Ecological theory relevant to population biology, food webs and diversity provides insight into how biological control agents can be made more effective, yet this theory has often been absent from the biological control literature. Examples of the use of ecological concepts (including intraguild predation, life-history omnivory and resource subsidies) in practical biological control are reviewed, and aspects of theory not yet considered in this context are discussed. Cereals are important as primary food crops, globally and within New Zealand. Possibly the greatest amount of damage sustained by cereal crops in New Zealand is caused by aphids and chemical control of these pests is very expensive relative to biological control. This thesis examines how biological control of the <b>rose-grain</b> <b>aphid</b> Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) (Hemiptera: Aphidiidae) by the koinobiont, synovigenic endoparasitoid Aphidius rhopalosiphi De Stefani-Perez (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) can be enhanced by floral resource subsidies. The mechanisms underlying this enhancement were determined in a series of laboratory experiments and then tested in laboratory microcosms and in the field. Sugar resources significantly increased longevity and egg load in A. rhopalosiphi and another species of aphidiid, Diaeretiella rapae McIntosh. Pollen had no significant effect on longevity or egg load in these species. These results are discussed in terms of the effects of resource subsidies on egg- versus time-limitation. Laboratory microcosm experiments tested whether the mechanisms of increased potential fecundity via enhanced egg load and longevity translate into increased rates of parasitism (i. e., realised fecundity). Only treatments receiving sugar showed increased reproductive success. The presence of flowering buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum Moench (c. v. Kitawase) (Polygonaceae) plants caused a slight, non-significant increase in rates of parasitism. Field surveys of natural aphid populations in a wheat Triticum aestivum (L.) (c. v. Otane) (Gramineae) field showed that proximity to floral buckwheat patches, distance to the nearest edge or the leeward end of the field were not significantly correlated with rates of parasitism. These variables were significantly correlated with aphid density in some surveys. Rates of parasitism were not correlated with aphid density. When aphid population density was controlled by experimental placement of aphids, proximity to floral resource patches significantly affected rates of parasitism. Parasitism rates were highest at the edges of buckwheat patches and declined exponentially with distance, eventually reaching zero beyond 14 m. Lower levels of parasitism were observed within the floral patches than at their edges. This phenomenon is compatible with the concept of spatio-temporal partitioning between parasitoid feeding and host-searching behaviours. Potential costs (increased predation risk, opportunity costs) and benefits (increased fecundity and longevity) associated with floral feeding by parasitoids, and temporal variation in these factors, are discussed. It is concluded that resource subsidies are not only effective in the practical enhancement of the efficacy of a specific biological control agent, but their use is based on a sound foundation in ecological theory that allows extension of these principles across taxa...|$|E
