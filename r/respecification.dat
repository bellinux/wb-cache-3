40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effects of}} oil price changes on U. S. inflation in a Phillips curve framework, allowing {{for some of the}} asymmetries, nonlinearities, and structural breaks that have been found in the literature on the real effects of oil price shocks. It finds that since around 1980, oil price changes seem to affect inflation only through their direct share in a price index, with little or no pass-through into core measures, while before 1980 oil shocks contributed substantially to core inflation. This structural-break characterization appears robust to a variety of <b>respecifications,</b> and to fit the data better than asymmetric and nonlinear oil price alternatives. Preliminary evidence suggests that a change in the reaction of monetary policy to oil shocks is part of the explanation. * The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board.

In embryos with Mitf mutations, the future RPE hyperproliferates and is respecified as retinal tissue but only in {{a small portion of the}} dorsal RPE. Using a series of genetic crosses, we show that this spatial restriction of RPE <b>respecification</b> is brought about by persistent expression of the anti-retinogenic ventral homeodomain gene Vax 2 in the dorso-proximal and both Vax 1 and Vax 2 in the ventral RPE. We further show that dorso-proximal RPE <b>respecification</b> in Vax 2 /Mitf double mutants and dorso-proximal and ventral RPE <b>respecification</b> in Vax 1 / 2 /Mitf triple mutants result from increased FGF/MAP kinase signaling. In none of the mutants, however, does the distal RPE show signs of hyperproliferation or <b>respecification,</b> likely due to local JAGGED 1 /NOTCH signaling. Expression studies and optic vesicle culture experiments also suggest a role for NOTCH signaling within the mutant dorsal RPE domains, where ectopic JAGGED 1 expression may partially counteract the effects of FGF/ERK 1 / 2 signaling on RPE <b>respecification.</b> The results indicate the presence of complex interplays between distinct transcription factors and signaling molecules during eye development and show how RPE phenotypes associated with mutations in one gene are modulated by expression changes in other genes...|$|E

We suppressed activity in single neurons in the embryonic spinal cord to determine whether glutamate-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) switching is cell autonomous.

Activation of TrkB receptors triggers a signaling cascade involving JNK-mediated activation of cJun that regulates tlx 3, a glutamate/GABA selector gene, accounting for calcium-spike BDNF-dependent transmitter switching.

The homeodomain transcription factor Lbx 1 is expressed in five such populations and loss of Lbx 1 leads to distinct <b>respecifications</b> in each of the five populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have purified normal and respecified pools of these five populations from embryos bearing one or two copies of the null Lbx 1 GFP allele, respectively.

40|$|Zebrafish {{possess a}} {{remarkable}} ability to regenerate complicated structures by {{formation of a}} mass of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells called blastema. To understand how the blastema retains the original structural form, we investigate cellular transitions and transcriptional characteristics of cell identity genes during all stages of regeneration of an amputated lower jaw. We find that mesenchymal blastema originates from multiple sources including nucleated blood cells, fibroblasts, damaged muscle cells and pigment cells. These cells are transformed into two populations of blastemal progenitors: foxi 1 -expression and isl 1 -expression, before giving rise to cartilage, bone, and muscle. Time point- based transcriptomal analysis of 45 annotated Hox genes reveal that five 3 '-end Hox genes and {{an equal number of}} 5 '-end Hox genes are activated largely at the stage of blastema reformation. RNA in situ hybridization shows that foxi 1 and pax 3 a are respectively expressed in the presumptive mandible skeletal region and regenerating muscle at 5 dpa. In contrast, hoxa 2 b and hoxa 11 b are widely expressed with different domain in chondrogenic blastema and blastema mesenchyme. Knockdown foxi 1 changes the expression patterns of sox 9 a and hoxa 2 b in chondrogenic blastema. From these results we propose that two origins of blastemal progenitors define blastema skeleton and muscle <b>respecifications</b> through distinct signaling pathways. Meanwhile, the positional identity of blastema reformation is implicated in mesenchymal segmentation and characteristic expression pattern of Hox genes...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{regenerating}} limb of urodele amphibians is {{an important}} system for evaluating the effects of retinoic acid (RA) on pattern formation. Regeneration proceeds by local formation of the blastema, a mesenchymal growth zone which normally only gives rise to structures distal to its level of origin. RA can respecify proximodistal identity in amphibian limb regeneration, and this activity of RA on the blastema is observed in two contexts. First, exposure to RA proximalizes a distal blastema resulting in duplication of structures proximal {{to the level of}} amputation. Second, after transplantation of a distal blastema to a proximal stump, the transplanted cells normally make only a minor contribution to the intercalary regenerate, but if transplanted cells are exposed to RA they occupy positions proximal to their level of origin and contribute to the regeneration of the intermediate tissue. Multiple isoforms of RA receptors (RARs) are expressed in the newt limb and are thought to mediate the <b>respecification</b> of positional identity. Results: To identify which receptor(s) mediates proximodistal <b>respecification,</b> we have used the biolistics (particle bombardment) technique to transfect the blastemal mesenchyme with plasmids encoding chimeric proteins containing partial amino-acid sequences of the various newt RAR isoforms fused to a partial sequence of the thyroid hormone (3, 5, 3 ′-triiodothyronine; T 3) receptor. We then used T 3 treatment to selectively activate individual RAR isoforms in vivo. By analyzing the distributions of transfected cells in regenerates derived from distal-to-proximal transplantation we find that activation of a single RAR isoform, δ 2, specifically mediates proximalization. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the ability of RA to respecify proximodistal identity is mediated by a specific RAR isoform, δ 2. Activation of the RA pathway in individual cells indicates that positional <b>respecification</b> can be cell-autonomous. RA can respecify axial identity in several contexts in vertebrate development, {{but this is the first}} case where the RAR mediating <b>respecification</b> has been identified...|$|E

Varying doses of activin A and BMP 4 to mimic cytokine gradient polarization in the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo led to differential activity ofWnt/β-catenin signaling and specified distinct anterior-like (high activin/ low BMP) and posterior-like (low activin/high BMP) mesodermal populations.

Embryos were extracted 1, 2, or 3 h after treatment and Western blotting (using antibodies antihyperacetylated histone H 4, antiacetylated lysine, or antitubulin) and immunohistochemistry (using the antibody antihyperacetylated histone H 4) were performed. Fetuses, ex-planted at term of gestation, were double stained for bone and cartilage to detect skeletal abnormalities. The studied HDACi were teratogenic. The specific axial skeletal malformations were fusions or homeotic <b>respecifications.</b> These molecules induced hyperacetylation restricted to somitic histones. The hyperacetyla-tion index of histone H 4 as well as immunohistochemical and skeletal analyses indicated BUT as the less active molecule.

The current study examined how voter perceptions of these areas may influence their willingness to support a stadium project. The city of San Diego, California and the 2016 NFL Chargers stadium proposal served as the case study. Ultimately, 182 participants completed the survey.
