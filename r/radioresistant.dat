25|$|The total dose is {{fractionated}} (spread {{out over}} time) for several important reasons. Fractionation allows normal cells time to recover, while tumor cells are generally less efficient in repair between fractions. Fractionation also allows tumor cells {{that were in}} a relatively radio-resistant phase of the cell cycle during one treatment to cycle into a sensitive phase of the cycle before the next fraction is given. Similarly, tumor cells that were chronically or acutely hypoxic (and therefore more <b>radioresistant)</b> may reoxygenate between fractions, improving the tumor cell kill.|$|E
25|$|The CNS {{consists}} of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that are generated from multipotent stem cells. NCRP Report No. 153 provides the following excellent and short {{introduction to the}} composition and cell types of interest for radiation studies of the CNS: “The CNS {{consists of}} neurons differing markedly in size and number per unit area. There are several nuclei or centers that consist of closely packed neuron cell bodies (e.g., the respiratory and cardiac centers in {{the floor of the}} fourth ventricle). In the cerebral cortex the large neuron cell bodies, such as Betz cells, are separated by a considerable distance. Of additional importance are the neuroglia which are the supporting cells and consist of astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and microglia. These cells permeate and support the nervous tissue of the CNS, binding it together like a scaffold that also supports the vasculature. The most numerous of the neuroglia are Type I astrocytes, which make up about half the brain, greatly outnumbering the neurons. Neuroglia retain the capability of cell division in contrast to neurons and, therefore, the responses to radiation differ between the cell types. A third type of tissue in the brain is the vasculature which exhibits a comparable vulnerability for radiation damage to that found elsewhere in the body. Radiation-induced damage to oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells of the vasculature accounts for major aspects of the pathogenesis of brain damage that can occur after high doses of low-LET radiation.” Based on studies with low-LET radiation, the CNS is considered a <b>radioresistant</b> tissue. For example: in radiotherapy, early brain complications in adults usually do not develop if daily fractions of 2 Gy or less are administered with a total dose of up to 50 Gy. The tolerance dose in the CNS, as with other tissues, depends on the volume and the specific anatomical location in the human brain that is irradiated.|$|E
500|$|Extremophiles are {{microorganisms}} {{that have}} adapted {{so that they}} can survive and even thrive in extreme environments that are normally fatal to most life-forms. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles thrive in high temperatures. Psychrophiles thrive in extremely low temperatures. – Temperatures as high as , as low as [...] Halophiles thrive in high salt conditions, up to saturation. Alkaliphiles thrive in an alkaline pH of about 8.5–11. Acidophiles can thrive in a pH of 2.0 or less. Piezophiles thrive at very high pressures: up to 1,000-2,000 atm, down to 0 atm as in a vacuum of space. A few extremophiles such as Deinococcus radiodurans are <b>radioresistant,</b> resisting radiation exposure of up to 5k Gy. Extremophiles are significant in different ways. They extend terrestrial life into much of the Earth's hydrosphere, crust and atmosphere, their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to their extreme environment can be exploited in biotechnology, and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for extraterrestrial life.|$|E

50|$|The {{response}} of a cancer to radiation {{is described by}} its radiosensitivity.Highly radiosensitive cancer cells are rapidly killed by modest doses of radiation. These include leukemias, most lymphomas and germ cell tumors.The majority of epithelial cancers are only moderately radiosensitive, and require a significantly higher dose of radiation (60-70 Gy) to achieve a radical cure.Some types of cancer are notably <b>radioresistant,</b> that is, much higher doses are required to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice.

50|$|Chordomas are {{relatively}} <b>radioresistant,</b> requiring {{high doses of}} radiation to be controlled. The proximity of chordomas to vital neurological structures such as the brain stem and nerves limits the dose of radiation that can safely be delivered.

50|$|Several fungi {{species have}} {{radioactive}} resistance values {{equal to or}} greater than more <b>radioresistant</b> bacteria; they perform mycoremediation processes. It was reported that some fungi had the ability of growing into, feeding, generating spores and decomposing pieces of graphite from destroyed reactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station, which is contaminated with high concentrations of cesium, plutonium and cobalt radionuclides. They were called radiotrophic fungi.|$|E

The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans (the most <b>radioresistant</b> organism known) has been modified to consume and digest toluene and ionic mercury from highly radioactive nuclear waste.Releasing genetically augmented organisms into the environment may be problematic as tracking them can be difficult; bioluminescence genes from other species may be inserted to make this easier.|$|E
50|$|In another pathway {{responding}} to ionizing radiation, FANCD2 {{is thought to}} be phosphorylated by protein complex ATM/ATR activated by double-strand DNA breaks, and takes part in S-phase checkpoint control. This pathway was proven by the presence of <b>radioresistant</b> DNA synthesis, the hallmark of a defect in the S phase checkpoint, in patients with FA-D1 or FA-D2. Such a defect readily leads to uncontrollable replication of cells and might also explain the increase frequency of AML in these patients.|$|E

The extreme thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus and other related Thermus species are also capable of genetic transformation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radioresistant</b> {{microbes}} {{are able}} to repair damage due to the equivalent of several hundred thousand years of Mars surface cosmic radiation {{within a few hours}} of revival from dormancy (they don't need to reproduce to do this, they repair their own DNA). For details: ionizing radiation resistance (radiodurans). This mechanism seems to be a byproduct of desiccation resistance, since the microbes have no need to tolerate high levels of cosmic radiation - shielded by the Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere. Martian microbes are likely to have similar mechanisms, this time evolved in the presence of ionizing radiation.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} classes of extremophiles that range {{all around the}} globe, each {{corresponding}} to the way its environmental niche differs from mesophilic conditions. These classifications are not exclusive. Many extremophiles fall under multiple categories and are classified as polyextremophiles. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth's surface are thermophilic and barophilic such as Thermococcus barophilus. A polyextremophile living at the summit of a mountain in the Atacama Desert might be a <b>radioresistant</b> xerophile, a psychrophile, and an oligotroph. Polyextremophiles are well known {{for their ability to}} tolerate both high and low pH levels.|$|E
5000|$|Ionizing-radiation-resistant organisms (IRRO) {{were defined}} as organisms for which the dose of acute {{ionizing}} radiation (IR) required to achieve 90% reduction (D10) is greater than 1000 gray (Gy) [...] Radioresistance is surprisingly high in many organisms, in contrast to previously held views. For example, the study of environment, animals and plants around the Chernobyl disaster area has revealed an unexpected survival of many species, despite the high radiation levels. A Brazilian study in a hill {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais which has high natural radiation levels from uranium deposits, has also shown many <b>radioresistant</b> insects, worms and plants.

TIGR followed these accomplishments with the genomes of the pathogenic bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi (which causes Lyme Disease) in 1997 and Treponema pallidum (which causes syphilis) in 1998. In 1999 TIGR published the sequence of the <b>radioresistant</b> polyextremophile Deinococcus radiodurans. TIGR eventually sequenced and analyzed more than 50 microbial genomes.

Fungal infections are particularly dangerous in immunocompromised individuals such as cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, making this work highly significant. With his collaborator Dr. Ekaterina (Kate) Dadachova, he pioneered the use of radioimmunotherapeutic strategies for the control of systemic fungal and other infections. During the course of his studies, he noted that certain fungi were <b>radioresistant</b> and worked to develop novel therapeutic strategies for a variety of human diseases including melanoma and infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis.

50|$|The seeding organisms need {{to survive}} and {{multiply}} in the target environments and establish a viable biosphere.

Genetic engineering may produce polyextremophile microorganisms with several tolerances. The target atmospheres will probably lack oxygen, so the colonizers should include anaerobic microorganisms. Colonizing anaerobic cyanobacteria may later establish atmospheric oxygen that is needed for higher evolution, as it happened on Earth. Aerobic organisms in the biological payload may be delivered to the planets later when the conditions are right, by comets that captured and preserved the capsules.|$|E
50|$|Molecular Signatures in {{the form}} of conserved {{signature}} indels (CSIs) and proteins (CSPs) have been found that are uniquely shared by all members belonging to the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum. These CSIs and CSPs are distinguishing characteristics that delineate the unique phylum from all other bacterial organisms, and their exclusive distribution is parallel with the observed differences in physiology. CSIs and CSPs have also been found that support order and family-level taxonomic rankings within the phylum. Some of the CSIs found to support order level distinctions are thought {{to play a role in}} the respective extremophilic characteristics. The CSIs found in DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta and DNA topoisomerase I in Thermales species may be involved in thermophilicity, while those found in Excinuclease ABC, DNA gyrase, and DNA repair protein RadA in Deinococcales species may be associated with radioresistance. Two CSPs that were found uniquely for all members belonging to the Deinococcus genus are well characterized and are thought to play a role in their characteristic <b>radioresistant</b> phenotype. These CSPs include the DNA damage repair protein PprA the single-stranded DNA-binding protein DdrB.|$|E
50|$|The {{absorbed dose}} and dose {{equivalent}} from {{galactic cosmic rays}} and solar energetic particles on the Martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum was measured. These measurements are necessary for human missions {{to the surface of}} Mars, to provide microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, and to determine how long potential organic biosignatures can be preserved. This study estimates that a one-meter depth drill is necessary to access possible viable <b>radioresistant</b> microbe cells. The actual absorbed dose measured by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is 76 mGy/yr at the surface. Based on these measurements, for a round trip Mars surface mission with 180 days (each way) cruise, and 500 days on the Martian surface for this current solar cycle, an astronaut would be exposed to a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 sievert. Exposure to one sievert is associated with a five percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer. NASA's current lifetime limit for increased risk for its astronauts operating in low-Earth orbit is three percent. Maximum shielding from galactic cosmic rays can be obtained with about 3 meters of Martian soil.|$|E

X-ray irradiation significantly induced autophagic cells in parental cells, which was exiguous in CRR cells, suggesting that autophagic cell death is involved in cellular radiosensitivity. An autophagy inducer, rapamycin sensitized CRR cells to the level of parental cells and suppressed cell growth. An autophagy inhibitor, 3 -methyladenine induced radioresistance of parental cells. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of Beclin- 1 made parental cells <b>radioresistant</b> to acute radiation.

40|$|Abstract Background The relapse {{of cancer}} after {{radiotherapy}} is a clinical knotty problem. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that the elevation of several factors is likely in some way to lead to the development of treatment tolerance, so it is necessary to further explore the problem of re-proliferated <b>radioresistant</b> cells to chemotherapeutic agents. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the chemosensitivity of <b>radioresistant</b> cells originated from the multicellular spheroids of A 549 lung adenocarcinoma. Methods After irradiated with 25 Gy of 6 MV X-ray to A 549 multicellular spheroids, whose 10 th re-proliferated generations were employed as <b>radioresistant</b> cells, and the control groups were A 549 parental cells and MCF 7 /VCR resistant cells. The chemo-sensitivity test was made by six kinds of chemotherapeutic drugs which were DDP, VDS, 5 -Fu, HCP, MMC and ADM respectively, while verapamil (VPL) was used as the reversal agent. Then the treatment effect was evaluated by MTT assay, and the multidrug resistant gene expressions of mdr 1 and MRP were measured by RT-PCR. Results Both A 549 parental cells and A 549 derived <b>radioresistant</b> cells were resistant to DDP, but sensitive to VDS, 5 -Fu, HCP, MMC and ADM. The inhibitory rates of VPL to these two types of cell were 98 % and 25 % respectively (P Mdr 1 /β 2 -MG and MRP /β 2 -MG of all A 549 cells were about 0 and 0. 7 respectively, and those of MCF 7 /VCR cells were 35 and 4. 36. Conclusion The chemosensitivity of A 549 <b>radioresistant</b> cells had not changed markedly, and the decreased sensitivity to VPL could not be explained by the gene expression of mdr 1 and MRP. It is possible that the changes in the cell membrane and decreased proliferate ability might be attributed to the resistance. Unlike multidrug resistance induced by chemotherapy, VPL may be not an ideal reverser to <b>radioresistant</b> cells. Therefore, the new biological strategy needs to be developed to treat recurring <b>radioresistant</b> tumor in combination with chemotherapy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the study}} was to obtain stable <b>radioresistant</b> sub-lines from the human {{cervical}} cancer cell line HeLa by prolonged exposure to 252 Cf neutron and X-rays. Radioresistance mechanisms were investigated in the resulting cells using microarray analysis of DNA damage repair genes. Methods HeLa cells were treated with fractionated 252 Cf neutron and X-rays, with a cumulative dose of 75 Gy each, over 8 months, yielding the sub-lines HeLaNR and HeLaXR. <b>Radioresistant</b> characteristics were detected by clone formation assay, ultrastructural observations, cell doubling time, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis assay. Gene expression patterns of the <b>radioresistant</b> sub-lines were studied through microarray analysis and verified by Western blotting and real-time PCR. Results The <b>radioresistant</b> sub-lines HeLaNR and HeLaXR were more radioresisitant to 252 Cf neutron and X-rays than parental HeLa cells by detecting their <b>radioresistant</b> characteristics, respectively. Compared to HeLa cells, the expression of 24 genes was significantly altered by at least 2 -fold in HeLaNR cells. Of these, 19 genes were up-regulated and 5 down-regulated. In HeLaXR cells, 41 genes were significantly altered by at least 2 -fold; 38 genes were up-regulated and 3 down-regulated. Conclusions Chronic exposure of cells to ionizing radiation induces adaptive responses that enhance tolerance of ionizing radiation and allow investigations of cellular radioresistance mechanisms.

In this study, we aimed to investigate extensive radiation responses in <b>radioresistant</b> NSCLC cells and to identify radioresistance-associating factors. For the first time, using RNA-seq, a massive sequencing-based approach, we examined whole-transcriptome alteration in <b>radioresistant</b> NSCLC A 549 cells under irradiation, and verified significant radiation-altered genes and their chromosome distribution patterns. Also, bioinformatic approaches (GO analysis and IPA) were performed to characterize the radiation responses in <b>radioresistant</b> A 549 cells.
