50|$|M. minutus {{lives in}} {{tropical}} and subtropical regions and prefers habitats characterized by tall grasses. These would include high <b>meadows,</b> <b>reed</b> <b>grass</b> plots, bushland interspersed with grasses,and grain fields. In Italy and East Asia, {{they also make}} a home in rice fields. Population density may be very high in favorable environments. Originally, these mice lived in humid regions with high, long-lasting grasses growing near rivers, ponds, and lakes. With the advent of human encroachment, however, M. minutus {{has been forced to}} live along roadsides and in crop fields. When land is cleared or crops harvested, this mouse is left homeless. The problem is solved by the mouse either forming a shallow burrow in the soil, or finding shelter in the barn or silo. Not all mice are so lucky, however, and many mice die after being rendered homeless.|$|R

40|$|The {{vesicular-arbuscular}} mycorrhizal fungus Glomus monosporum was inoculated on grapevine (Vitis vinifera), {{red clover}} (Trifolium pratense), <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) and onion (Allium cepa) as hosts in two experiments {{carried out in}} different environments. Grapevine and clover showed the largest growth response and spore production. Mycorrhizal infection was lowest in <b>meadow</b> <b>grass.</b> Very poor correlations were observed, on an overall basis, between spore production and per cent root infection or infected root length. Spore production per unit infected root length for each host species was a comparatively stable parameter; it was largest for grapevine and smallest for <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> in both experiments. Sporulation {{was positively correlated with}} growth enhancement by mycorrhizal plants, and growth increments per unit infected root followed the same trend as spore numbers per unit infected root, i. e. largest for grapevine and lowest for meadow-grass. It is concluded that the ability of G. monosporum to produce spores and to enhance plant growth per unit infected root length depends on the host plant species...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{wastewater}} is consideredas effluents, {{which are}} formed {{on the surface}} of urbanized areas. Stormwater treatment is performed out using a variety of filters: sand, grass. Wastewater penetration into the deeper layers is called hydraulic conductivity. After evaluation of the hydraulic conductivity, it is possible to determine the ability of the investigated fillers to entrap the stormwater flow. The hydraulic conductivity tests can indicate which fillers of stormwater filters may influence the more effective stormwater cleaning. Four stormwater filters were tested: crushed autoclaved aerated concrete filter; crushed autoclaved aerated concrete with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer; silica sand filter with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer; silica sand filter. Under in-situ conditions hydraulic conductivity in filters is investigated using Constant-head method. Mathematical modeling program Hydrus- 1 D presentsthe changes of hydraulic conductivity in each filler layer of the filter. Assessed hydraulic conductivity in filters under in-situ conditions hasn‘t changed only in crushed autoclaved aerated concrete filter (30 000 mm/d). The smallest hydraulic conductivity in filters under in-situ conditions was estimated in silica sand filter with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer, here it was equal to 209. 3 mm/d. With mathematical modeling program Hydrus- 1 D {{it was found that the}} hydraulic conductivity in each filter decreases, depending on the depth of filler in the filter...|$|R
