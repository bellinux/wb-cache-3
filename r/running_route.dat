50|$|A hot {{route is}} a {{variation}} on the regular <b>running</b> <b>route</b> for a running back. It results usually from an audible called by a quarterback, and is based on a read of a blitzing defense. If the defense does not blitz, the running back runs the regular route. If the defense does blitz, the running back will, instead of blocking the blitzing defensive player, run a short route, such as a bubble screen, and catch the ball which the quarterback dumps off quickly.|$|E

50|$|The Big Lemon {{originally}} operated {{an express}} service numbered 42X which ran from Brighton station to Falmer station using elderly step entranced buses. However {{the service was}} dropped in December 2007. A relaunch of the service commenced in early 2008 numbered 42. In 2010 the company started two more services, 43 and 44. However just months after it began route 43 ended due to low passenger numbers. In 2011 The Big Lemon faced competition from Brighton & Hove Buses in that Brighton Buses lowered its fares to match fares charged by The Big Lemon. In January 2012 The Big Lemon stopped <b>running</b> <b>route</b> 42 and now continues to run route 44 only, split into two shuttles now numbered UB1 and UB2.|$|E
50|$|Summer Festivities: In August Blanca {{celebrates its}} summer festivities {{and again in}} honor of their patron Saint Roche. Here the decor changes, now they deal with the sweet bread (la mona) and the bulls. The running of the bulls has in Blanca the famous {{declaration}} of Regional Tourist Interest, and it is undoubtedly the most celebrated day for all residents in Blanca. The running of the bulls is a very old tradition that has been held for over three hundred fifty years, {{and it is a}} unique event in the Region of Murcia. During the morning the atmosphere that prevails throughout the entire <b>running</b> <b>route</b> of the bulls, is a limitless joy, in which dance and parade of bands encourage all who join the festivities, and where everyone is welcome. It is always held before August 15. The life and traditions of the city are well described by another chronicler of the village, Ángel Ríos Martínez (11-25).|$|E

5000|$|LVTS {{actually}} ran {{a frequent}} and efficient service {{for many years}} during the 1960s and 1970s when the city was small; their routes covered most of the city. At the time, they were considered a vast improvement over its predecessor, Vegas Transit Lines. In fact, they were praised as a self-sufficient bus system in the 1970s, as in an article written in Bus World Magazine in 1978. In about 1975, LVTS experimented with a [...] "grid" [...] route system replacing the former [...] "hub and spoke" [...] system. However, by all accounts, it was disastrous and ridership plummeted. They {{then went back to}} the old hub and spoke route system and enjoyed an increase in ridership, as detailed in the 1978 magazine article. In the late 1970s, the system consisted of 9 routes, 1-10, w/ Rte #2 missing. There were actually 3 24-hour routes: Route 3 Salt Lake Hwy, 4 Boulder Hwy, and 6 The Strip. Routes 3, 4, and 9 had 30-minute headways and #6 [...] "Strip" [...] had 15-minute headways. All routes at that time connected downtown for [...] "an easy" [...] transfer. Unfortunately, the routes were not synchronized to meet {{at the same time and}} sometimes, a rider may have to wait up to 45mins for transfer to the next bus. This situation occurred until the early 1980s, when the routes were all finally synchronized to arrive/depart at the same time, except for the frequently <b>running</b> <b>route</b> 6. As in later decades, the Strip route provided the money for the other money losing residential routes and allowed a profit for the small private transit company. It should be noted that being a successful private bus company is an exceptional feat, as by the 1960s, virtually all transit systems in the US had been taken over by municipal governments due to declining riderships and heavily subsidized by taxpayer dollars.|$|E

40|$|Research {{shows that}} people handle the {{complexity}} of environments by cognitively simplifying them using spatial schemas and heuristics. Such simplification strategies {{can be seen in}} route planning situations, such as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and tour planning. The present study extends this work by examining a situation where memory demands must be considered during route planning [...] planning a <b>running</b> <b>route</b> through an unfamiliar area. Results of routes planned on maps in grid-like and non-grid-like environments suggest that the planned routes reflect aspects of cognitive simplification to meet memory demands. This was evident in both global and local features of the routes. Globally, route trajectories tended towards simple shapes in accord with the affordances of the environment. Locally, changes of direction were preferably chosen at landmarks. More demanding (non-grid) environments led to an increase in simplification strategy use, such as relying on major roads, and avoiding complex decision points...|$|E
