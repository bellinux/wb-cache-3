5|$|Less {{than two}} weeks after Domoina caused severe {{flooding}} in South Africa, Tropical Storm Imboa produced additional rainfall and high seas in the country, killing four people. The final storm of the season was Cyclone Kamisy, which caused $250million in damage and 68deaths when it made landfalls in northern and northwestern Madagascar. The cities near landfall were largely destroyed, and about 100,000people were left homeless. The penultimate storm, Jaminy, was tied for the strongest storm in the basin after it crossed from the Australian <b>region,</b> <b>where</b> it was named Annette. Cyclone Fanja in January also crossed from the Australian <b>region,</b> <b>where</b> it was named Vivienne.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{struggle}} {{began in}} India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence. Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts. This led to tension, {{particularly in the}} Punjab <b>region,</b> <b>where</b> repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion. The subsequent Non-Co-Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.|$|E

5|$|A {{widespread}} misconception {{has arisen}} in Pakistan that polio vaccine contained Haram ingredients and could cause impotence and infertility in male children, leading some less-educated parents {{not to have}} their children vaccinated. This belief is most prevalent in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA <b>region,</b> <b>where</b> {{people are likely to}} be influenced by conservative teachings. There also have been attacks on polio vaccination teams. This is hampering international efforts to eradicate polio in Pakistan and globally since the virus can be carried by travelers.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core <b>region</b> <b>where</b> energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{verbally}} {{dismissed the}} French order expelling {{him and his}} family from Syria, Faisal departed Damascus on 27 July with only one of his cabinet members, al-Husri. He initially traveled south to Daraa in the Hauran <b>region</b> <b>where</b> he gained the allegiance of local tribal leaders. However, a French ultimatum to the tribal leaders to expel Faisal or face the bombardment of their encampments compelled Faisal to head west to Haifa in British-held Palestine on 1 August and avoid further bloodshed. Faisal's departure from Syria marked an end to his goal of establishing and leading an Arab state in Syria.|$|E

5|$|Although his {{original}} objective was solely {{to protect the}} Serb population against the Ustaše, Dangić quickly became {{an important factor in}} the conflict between the two groups in eastern Bosnia. The Germans sought to win Dangić over to collaboration in order to strengthen anti-Partisan operations in the <b>region,</b> <b>where</b> Dangić's Chetniks reportedly numbered about 10,000 men, but at this time neither Dangić nor any of Mihailović's other commanders had any arrangement with the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating a <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.|$|E
