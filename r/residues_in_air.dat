40|$|Pakistan {{occupies}} a significant global {{position in the}} growing of high quality cotton. The extensive application of pesticides on agricultural products leads to environmental risk due to toxic <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> <b>air,</b> water and soil. This study examined the chemodynamic effect of Deltamethrin on cotton fields. Samples were collected from the cotton fields of D. G. Khan, Pakistan and analyzed for heavy metal speciation patterns. Batch experiments were administered in order to study the adsorption of Deltamethrin in cotton fields. The effect of different factors including pH, adsorbate dose, and adsorbent mass on adsorption were studied. It was observed that in general, adsorption increased with increases in the mass of adsorbate, although the trends were irregular. Residual fractions of deltamethrin in the soil and water of cotton fields were analyzed to assess concentrations of xenobiotics bound to soil particles. Results indicated that such residues are significantly higher in soil samples due to high Koc in comparison to water, indicating the former is an efficient degradation agent. Results from the batch experiment resulted in 95 % removal with alkaline pH and an adsorbent-adsorbate ratio of 250 : 1. These results {{may be used to}} environment friendly resource management policies...|$|E

50|$|A {{pesticide}} poisoning {{occurs when}} chemicals intended {{to control a}} pest affect non-target organisms such as humans, wildlife, or bees. There are three types of pesticide poisoning. The first of the three is a single and short-term {{very high level of}} exposure which can be experienced by individuals who commit suicide, as well as pesticide formulators. The second type of poisoning is long-term high-level exposure, which can occur in pesticide formulators and manufacturers. The third type of poisoning is a long-term low-level exposure, which individuals are exposed to from sources such as pesticide <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> food as well as contact with pesticide <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> the <b>air,</b> water, soil, sediment, food materials, plants and animals.|$|R
50|$|When {{thinking}} of pesticide poisoning, {{one does not}} take into consideration the contribution that is made of their own household. The majority of households in Canada use pesticides while taking part in activities such as gardening. In Canada 96 percent of households report having a lawn or a garden. 56 percent of the households who have a lawn or a garden utilize fertilizer or pesticide. This form of pesticide use may contribute to the third type of poisoning, which is caused by long-term low-level exposure. As mentioned before, long-term low-level exposure affects individuals from sources such as pesticide <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> food as well as contact with pesticide <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> the <b>air,</b> water, soil, sediment, food materials, plants and animals.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of potato farming in Canada occurs in tightly clustered geographic locations and requires substantial chemical inputs. The possibility of pesticide drift, pesticide residues {{on food and}} the effect of pesticides on the environment, leads to interest in quantifying the different effects that pesticides may have on human health and the environment. This study focuses on the potential use of genetically modified potatoes, the associated issue of pesticide <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> the <b>air,</b> and the potential impact of this on the health of farmers, their families, and others in the context of Prince Edward Island. Reductions in costs of potato farming and reduced health costs that may be associated with lower pesticide applications in growing genetically engineered potatoes (NewLeaf, NewLeaf Plus and NewLeaf Pro potatoes, each genetically modified for particular traits), relative to conventional potato growing practices in Prince Edward Island are identified and quantified. It is concluded that the financial benefits from the use of fewer inputs with the modified potatoes are significant while the health benefits associated with reduced exposure to pesticides are relatively small.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the feasibility of}} reusing a glass fiber resulting from the thermolysis and gasification of waste composites to obtain glass-ceramic tiles. Polyester fiberglass (PFG) waste was treated at 550 ˚C for 3 h in a 9. 6 dm 3 thermolytic reactor. This process yielded an oil (≈ 24 wt%), a gas (≈ 8 wt%) and a solid residue (≈ 68 wt%).

50|$|However, {{in normal}} {{agricultural}} practice, {{it is rare}} to use only a single pesticide. During {{the production of a}} crop, several different materials may be used. Each of them has had determined a regulatory level at which they would be considered individually safe. In many cases, a commercial pesticide is itself a combination of several chemical agents, and thus the safe levels actually represent levels of the mixture. In contrast, a combination created by the end user, such as a farmer, has rarely been tested in that combination. The potential for synergy is then unknown or estimated from data on similar combinations. This lack of information also applies to many of the chemical combinations to which humans are exposed, including <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> food, indoor <b>air</b> contaminants, and occupational exposures to chemicals. Some groups think that the rising rates of cancer, asthma, and other health problems may be caused by these combination exposures; others have alternative explanations. This question will likely be answered only after years of exposure by the population in general and research on chemical toxicity, usually performed on animals. Examples of pesticide synergists include Piperonyl butoxide and MGK 264.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a study carried out with solid sorbents in order to {{establish}} the optimum procedure for sampling and determination of diphenylamine (DPA), the most widely used post-harvest chemical in apples, <b>in</b> the indoor <b>air</b> of apple storage buildings. Different sorbents (Amberlite XAD- 2, Amberlite XAD- 4, Supelpak 2, Florisil, and the octadecyl silica bonded sorbent, C- 18) were evaluated for their capacity to efficiently retain DPA under different air sampling and storage conditions, whereas a desorption study of all sorbents tested was also performed to optimise a simple extraction procedure using low volumes of organic solvents. In general all sorbents produced acceptable results for DPA air sampling whereas DPA was recovered easily by the use of low volumes of both ethyl acetate and acetone from all sorbents studied thus making DPA a suitable analyte to be used in methods of indoor air analysis for multi-organic pollutants. However, the best results (analytical features, recovery results, and stability results during storage) were obtained by the use of Supelpak 2 as a sorbent for DPA active sampling. Limits of Quantification (LOQs) for the GC-NPD system ranged from 1. 0 to 2. 0 mu g m(- 3) for 120 and 60 L air sampled, respectively. The developed air sampling procedure and analytical methodology was applied with success in the field to measure DPA <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> indoor <b>air</b> of two apple storage plants in Greece and results were further used to calculate the occupational inhalation exposure to DPA and consequently risk characterisation. Since DPA was detected <b>in</b> indoor <b>air</b> (at concentrations ranged from 1. 6 to 580 mu g m(- 3)), there is no zero occupational risk for workers. However, the inhalation exposure of workers to DPA estimated in this study is far below the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level recently reviewed by the European Union and far below the critical exposure level for haematotoxicity systemic effect observed in carcinogenicity studies in rats for long-term inhalation exposure to DPA...|$|R

40|$|Pesticides {{have been}} used in {{agriculture}} to avoid productivity losses caused by various organisms. However, the indiscriminate use of these chemicals has resulted in negative impacts on the environment, such as <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> soil, water, <b>air,</b> plants and animals. Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide widely used in agricultural management to control pests of sugar cane in Brazil, and it can be leached into aquatic ecosystems. The present study aimed to evaluate the environmental risk of toxic concentrations and dissipation of fipronil to Poecilia reticulata, based on the 96 -h median lethal concentration (LC 50) value estimated at 0. 08 ± 0. 01 mg/L without sediment and 0. 09 ± 0. 01 mg/L with sediment of fipronil in the aquatic environment. These values of fipronil were classified as extremely toxic to P. reticulata in both cases, which showed high environmental risk of poisoning to a shallow film of water of 1 ha and 0. 30 m deep, with and without sediment. On the other hand, in bodies of water 1 ha and 2. 0 m deep, it was of moderate toxicity. Dissipation of fipronil in the water was not affected by temperature, sediment or photoperiod. The minimum time to which fipronil caused 50 % acute mortality (0. 08 mg/L) after dilution of 0. 75 mg/L was 242 days; the withdrawal period, after which no mortality occurs (0. 025 mg/L), was 263 days...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Potential {{exposure}} to pesticide residues resulting from burning wood treated with phenoxy and pyridine herbicides was assessed. Wood samples from trees treated with 2, 4 -D [2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid], dicamba [3, 6 -dichloro-oanisic acid], dichlorprop [2 -(2, 4 -dichlorphenoxy) propionic acid], picloram [4 -amino- 3, 5,dtrichloropicolinic acid], and triclopyr (3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyri dinyl) oxy acetic acid contained variable amounts of parent compound residues at 4, 8, and 12 months after application. At {{the time of}} the latter sampling, residues of 2, 4 -D, dicamba, and picloram were ~ 2. 1 mg/kg on a fresh weight basis. Mean residue concentrations of triclopyr and dichlorprop were somewhat higher at 3. 5 and 13. 0 mg/kg, respectively. In a laboratory experiment, samples with known amounts of herbicide residue were subjected to either slow or rapidly burning conditions in a tube furnace. During slow combustion, relatively stable compounds such as 2, 4 -D, dicamba, and dichlorprop were released in significant amounts. Rapid combustion greatly enhanced decomposition of 2, 4 -D, dicamba, dichlorprop, picloram, and triclopyr. A well-developed fire in a wood stove or fireplace, with active flaming combustion, where temperatures commonly reach 800 - l,OOO”C, should result in greater than 95 % thermal decomposition of the herbicides examined in this study. Burning of herbicide-treated wood under smoldering conditions could result in very low levels of herbicide <b>residue</b> <b>in</b> ambient indoor <b>air.</b> However, the exposure levels are less tha...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{to predict}} {{interfacial}} <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> protein-RNA complexes have largely focused on predicting RNA-binding <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> proteins. Computational methods for predicting protein-binding <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> RNA sequences, however, {{are a problem}} that has received relatively little attention to date. Although the value of sequence motifs for classifying and annotating protein sequences is well established, sequence motifs have not been widely applied to predicting interfacial <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> macromolecular complexes. Here, we propose a novel sequence motif-based method for “partner-specific” interfacial residue prediction. Given a specific protein-RNA pair, {{the goal is to}} simultaneously predict RNA binding <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> the protein sequence and protein-binding <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> the RNA sequence. In 5 -fold cross validation experiments, our method, PS-PRIP, achieved 92 % Specificity and 61 % Sensitivity, with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0. 58 in predicting RNA-binding sites in proteins. The method achieved 69 % Specificity and 75 % Sensitivity, but with a low MCC of 0. 13 in predicting protein binding sites in RNAs. Similar performance results were obtained when PS-PRIP was tested on two independent “blind” datasets of experimentally validated protein- RNA interactions, suggesting the method should be widely applicable and valuable for identifying potential interfacial <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> protein-RNA complexes for which structural information is not available.
