We evaluated a fading procedure for maintaining high levels of compliance obtained with high-probability <b>requests.</b> Fading involved a systematic {{reduction in the number of}} high-probability <b>requests</b> and an increase in the latency between the high- and low-probability <b>requests.</b> High levels of compliance for both “do” and “don't” <b>requests</b> were maintained for 16 weeks in a 5 -year-old boy with developmental disabilities after the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence was faded. Similar maintenance was obtained for “do” <b>requests</b> in a 15 -year-old girl with developmental disabilities. For this subject, however, the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence was ineffective with “don't” <b>requests.</b> When “don't” <b>requests</b> were phrased as “do” <b>requests,</b> the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence produced high levels of compliance to the low-probability <b>request.</b> High levels of compliance to these “do” <b>requests</b> were maintained for 16 weeks after the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence was faded...|$|R

An enhanced DQRUMA/MC-CDMA protocol using minislots for <b>request</b> accesses is proposed to reduce <b>request</b> collisions. In the proposed protocol, <b>request</b> attempts are transmitted concurrently with data packets of other calls. A random scheme (Scheme I) and a preallocated scheme (Scheme II) are distinguished depending on the methods selecting a <b>request</b> code and a <b>request</b> minislot based on a lattice pool for <b>request</b> accesses (LPRA). Both schemes yield low <b>request</b> access delay due to few or no collisions during <b>request</b> accesses. In Scheme I one of <b>request</b> minislots is selected with a randomly chosen code, while in Scheme II the minislot and the code uniquely used in <b>request</b> attempts can resolve a code collision problem during <b>request</b> accesses. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated by simulation and its result shows that the proposed protocol outperforms the original DQRUMA/MC-CDMA protocol in terms of average total delay...|$|R
