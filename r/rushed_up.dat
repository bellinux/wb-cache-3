5|$|Arriving at the capitol, I {{sprang from}} my horse, first unbuckling {{the stars and}} stripes, a large flag I had {{on the front of}} my saddle. With Captain Langdon, chief of artillery, I <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> to the roof. Together we hoisted the first large flag over Richmond, and on the peak of the roof drank to its success.|$|E
5|$|Although {{supplies}} {{had been}} left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> the hill to meet him.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, {{the fleet}} {{transporting}} the two first brigades arrived in Navarino bay, where the joint Franco-Russo-British squadron was berthed. The Egyptian army was concentrated between Navarino and Methoni. Thus, the landing was risky. The fleet sailed toward the Gulf of Koroni {{protected by a}} fortress held by the Ottomans. The expeditionary corps began to disembark without meeting any opposition {{on the evening of}} August 29, finishing on the morning of August 30. A proclamation by governor Capodistria had informed the Greek population of the imminent arrival of a French expedition. The locals <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> before the troops as soon as they set foot on Greek soil and offered them food.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} captain came <b>rushing</b> <b>up</b> from below. I caught hold of him.|$|R
60|$|And <b>rushing</b> <b>up,</b> he {{collared}} the second-rate gymnast {{and hurled}} him {{halfway across the}} tent.|$|R
60|$|There was a <b>rush</b> <b>up</b> the stairs, and in {{an instant}} the terrible fight began.|$|R
5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 41-yard line and used the good field position to its advantage. After two short-gain plays, Rodgers completed a 16-yard pass and a 24-yard toss to drive the Bears inside the Virginia Tech 20-yard line. Echemandu rushed the ball twice for seven total yards, then Rodgers ran it himself the remaining nine yards for another California touchdown. The touchdown and extra point gave California a 42–28 lead, its largest in the game. Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball with 41seconds remaining in the quarter, and ran four quick plays. After Bryan Randall threw two incompletions, he connected with Ernest Wilford on a long 23-yard pass, and Kevin Jones <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> {{the middle of the}} field for another 12yards. As time expired in the quarter, Tech was inside California territory for the first time since the beginning of the quarter and had a first down. At the end of the third quarter, California held a 42–28 lead.|$|E
5|$|Indiana {{received}} the Virginia Tech kickoff {{in the end}} zone for a touchback and began the first drive of the game at their 20-yard line. On the first play of the game, Indiana <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> the middle for a six-yard gain. After Paci threw an incomplete pass, he attempted to scramble for the first down but was tackled one yard short. Indiana punted the ball, and after a block-in-the-back penalty against Virginia Tech, the Hokies began their first possession at their 15-yard line. After a five-yard false start penalty on Tech's first play, Hokie running back Dwayne Thomas rushed the ball for a 10-yard gain, making up twice the yardage lost to the penalty. Tech's second play was another rush by Thomas, who ran to the Tech 27-yard line for the game's first first down. Once there, DeShazo completed two consecutive passes, pushing Tech to their 45-yard line. Tech was able to continue the advance across midfield and into Indiana territory, but the Hoosiers' defense stiffened and denied Tech another first down. After a Hokie punt, Indiana began its second offensive drive at its 15-yard line.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak, {{infantry}} in the 8th Scottish Rifles, 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division) advanced {{with the}} 7th Light Horse and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments (2nd Light Horse Brigade), covered by infantry in the 7th Scottish Rifles, 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division on the left, {{who had brought}} 16 machine guns and Lewis guns into a position from which they could sweep the crest and reverse slopes of Wellington Ridge. The Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment, with the 7th Light Horse Regiment and supported on the left by Scottish Rifles' infantry posts, fixed bayonets and stormed Wellington Ridge. They encountered heavy rifle and machine gun fire, but <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> the sandy slope and quickly broke through the German and Ottoman front line. After clearing Wellington Ridge, the mounted riflemen, light horsemen and infantrymen pressed forward from ridge to ridge without pause. These troops swept down on a body of about 1,000 to 1,500 Ottoman soldiers, who became demoralised. As {{a result of this}} attack, a white flag was hoisted and by 05:00 the German and Ottoman soldiers who had stubbornly defended their positions on Wellington Ridge, dominating the camps at Romani, were captured. A total of 1,500 became prisoners in the neighbourhood of Wellington Ridge; 864 soldiers surrendered to infantry in the 8th Scottish Rifles alone, while others were captured by the light horse and mounted rifles regiments. By 05:30, the main German and Ottoman force was in a disorganised retreat towards Katia, with the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades and the Ayrshire and Leicestershire batteries not far behind. At 06:00, a further 119 men surrendered to the infantry in No. 3 Redoubt; while these prisoners were being dealt with, it became apparent that {{they were part of a}} rearguard and that a full retreat was under way. At 06:30, Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all troops and to initiate a vigorous general advance eastwards.|$|E

25|$|Texas Tech {{defeated}} the University of Texas at El Paso, 45–31. Texas Tech {{got on the}} scoreboard first when Kobey Lewis <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> the middle for a one-yard touchdown with Alex Trlica making the point after.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, Texas Tech made their third {{unanswered}} touchdown—a 20-yard pass to Crabtree—to bring the score to 56–17. The Owls scored their final touchdown {{of the game}} when C. J. Ugokwe <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> the middle for a seven-yard gain. Fangmeier made the point after.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day misfortune struck the Guards Patrol. Captain Timpson's jeep had <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> a razor-back sand-dune and capsized over the top, forcing the {{evacuation}} of Timpson and his driver, Guardsman Thomas Wann, by a Lockheed Hudson. Sergeant Jack Dennis assumed command of G1 Patrol.|$|E

25|$|After the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, Oklahoma State tied the score with a five-yard pass from Zac Robinson to Desmond Bryant, followed by a point after conversion by Jason Ricks. The Cowboys took the lead when Kendall Hunter <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> the middle for a 46-yard gain followed by a successful PAT.|$|E
25|$|Lebrun Constantine {{was given}} {{out in this}} match when a ball played by him lodged in his leg guard. The Liverpool wicket-keeper Arthur Kemble <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> and picked the ball out and Constantine was {{initially}} given out. However the decision was then reversed, the law having changed in 1899, and {{he was allowed to}} continue his innings.|$|E
25|$|Another Harrell to Crabtree pass {{followed}} by successful PAT by Alex Trlica again tied the score. However, Oklahoma State answered when quarterback Zac Robinson <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> the middle 48-yards for a TD and Ricks {{made the point}} after. The next two scores {{were made by the}} Red Raiders—a touchdown pass to Eric Morris and another to Michael Crabtree {{followed by}} PATs.|$|E

25|$|Texas Tech defense held UTEP {{scoreless}} in the game's final quarter {{while the}} offense added 14. Harrell passed to Grant Walker {{down the middle}} for an eight-yard touchdown. The successful PAT made it Texas Tech 38, UTEP 31. On the final score, running back Shannon Woods <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> the middle for a two-yard-touchdown. Texas Tech made the PAT to close the game out with a 45–31 lead.|$|E
25|$|The Red Raiders scored {{twice in}} the second quarter. A Harrell pass to Edward Britton {{resulted}} in a 67-yard touchdown. Alex Trlica made the PAT. Trlica kicked a 45-yard field goal later in the quarter. These {{would be the only}} times Tech scored during the game. Missouri scored a touchdown during the quarter when Jimmy Jackson <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> the middle for a one-yard gain, followed by Wolfert PAT. The score at the half stood at 17–10 in favor of the Tigers.|$|E
25|$|Quevedo {{could be}} impulsive. He {{was present at}} the church of San Martín in Madrid when a woman praying there was slapped on the cheek by another man who had <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> to her. Quevedo seized the man, {{dragging}} him outside the church. The two men drew swords, and Quevedo ran his opponent through. The man, who died of his wounds some time later, was someone of importance. Quevedo thus retired temporarily to the palace of his friend and patron, Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna.|$|E

60|$|She took up {{a little}} straw, and pushed {{away some of the}} bubbles {{from the side of the}} basin, and then gently moved them back again until they were pretty near, and {{observed}} that they would immediately <b>rush</b> <b>up</b> against the side again. She did not understand this phenomenon, especially as the water was raised a little along the edge by the side of the basin, so that the bubbles and the needle actually appeared to <b>rush</b> <b>up</b> hill.|$|R
25|$|Some goalkeepers {{have scored}} goals. Other than by {{accident}} when a long kicked clearance reaches {{the other end}} of the field and evades the opposing goalkeeper with the aid of strong winds and/or unexpected bounces, this most commonly occurs where a goalkeeper has <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> to the opposite end of the pitch to give his team a numerical advantage in attack, leaving his own goal undefended. As such, it is normally only done late in a game at set-pieces where the consequences of scoring far outweigh those of conceding a further goal, such as for a team trailing in a knock-out tournament.|$|E
25|$|As Younghusband's troops {{started to}} regroup, {{reinforcements}} {{for both sides}} began to arrive. Aylmer arrived with the 9th Infantry Brigade, 6th Cavalry Brigade, and the support troops. The Tigris Corps had an edge in number of artillery available, but most were either older types or lighter pieces. Furthermore, effective spotting for the artillery was still difficult as the Tigris Corps still had only an incomplete picture of exactly where the Ottoman defenses were. The balance of the 35th Division and 52nd Division were <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> to the Sheikh Sa'ad defenses. Additionally, a brigade of Ottoman cavalry was also moved up to support the defenses on the left bank. In all, both sides could field about 9000 men.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to colonel on 25 July 1810, Byng went to Spain in September 1811 {{to become}} Commander of a brigade serving under General Rowland Hill. Promoted to major-general on 4 June 1813, Byng {{commanded}} his brigade at the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813 {{and then at}} the Battle of Roncesvalles on 25 July 1813 when his brigade took the brunt of the French assault and held its position for three hours in the early morning before finally being forced back; meanwhile General Lowry Cole <b>rushed</b> <b>up</b> reinforcements in the early afternoon and then fended off the French until the evening when thick fog rolled in. Byng's stubborn resistance at Roncesvalles allowed the Marquess of Wellington to consolidate enough troops to defeat the French at the Battle of the Pyrenees over the next few days.|$|E
