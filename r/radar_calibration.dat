25|$|RAF Andover has {{a unique}} place in British history, as the first British {{military}} unit to be equipped with helicopters, the Helicopter Training School, was formed in January 1945 at RAF Andover {{under the command of}} Squadron Leader B.H. Arkell. This was also the first European helicopter flying-training school, however the first European military unit formed solely with helicopters was the Luftwaffe's Transportstaffel 40 in 1944. The Helicopter Training School was equipped with nine Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly I helicopters, and trained 100 British Army pilots for Air Observation Post duties, as well as pilots for the first RAF squadron to be equipped with helicopters, 529 Squadron, which carried our <b>radar</b> <b>calibration</b> duties. <b>Radar</b> <b>calibration</b> duties were later carried out by the Hawker Siddeley Andover and Air Observation Post duties are today carried out by the Army Air Corps.|$|E

In addition, some Canberras that had originally been manufactured for the high altitude bomber mission were reequipped for low altitude ground attack missions.|$|E
40|$|During the 1992 NASA {{airborne}} Doppler windshear <b>radar</b> flights, <b>radar</b> <b>calibrations</b> {{were performed}} prior to each flight {{in order to}} determine transmitter power, receiver gain, and receiver noise power. The calibration results show that the average transmitter power in radar mode 6 was 186 watts, {{with a standard deviation of}} 7 watts. The average high power amplifier gain was 9. 62 dB. At the wide IF bandwidth setting, the receiver gain was 123. 1 dB, while at the narrow IF bandwidth setting, the gain was 121. 8 dB. The receiver system noise as seen at the receiver input was - 107. 0 dBmw using the wide IF bandwidth and - 107. 9 dBmw using the narrow IF bandwidth. In radar mode 7, the receiver gain was the same as in mode 6. However, the receiver noise in mode 7 was about 2. 5 dB less using the wide IF bandwidth and 2. 0 dB less using the narrow IF bandwidth. The R/T unit flown in 1992 had also been flown the previous year when it produced comparable results. This technical memorandum was written as a follow-up to NASA TM- 107589 (June 1992), which describes similar <b>radar</b> <b>calibrations</b> performed during the 1991 windshear radar flight experiments...|$|R
40|$|Polarization {{properties}} of radar waves that are scattered from atmospheric objects are {{of great interest}} in meteorological studies. However, polarimetric radar measurements are often not sufficiently accurate for retrieving physical {{properties of}} targets. To compensate for errors, <b>radar</b> polarimetric <b>calibration</b> is applied. Typical calibrations are performed based on measurements of point targets with known scattering matrices located in the boresight of the antenna. Such calibration {{takes into account the}} polarization state of the antenna pattern only at one point. Since radar measurements of atmospheric phenomena involve distributed targets that fill the full antenna beam, point target <b>radar</b> <b>calibrations</b> are inadequate for meteorological studies. This paper explains in detail the effects of the complete antenna patterns on weather echoes. It is shown that the conventional polarimetric calibration can be significantly improved by incorporating light-rain (� 20 dBZ) zenith-pointing measurements into the calibration procedure. As a result, the sensitivity of cross-polar measurements can be improved by 7 dB on average. Also it is shown that the bias in co-cross-polar correlation coefficient can be reduced. 1...|$|R

25|$|In January 1942, {{trials of}} the Rotachute Mark I were {{conducted}} to assess the aerodynamic characteristics while mounted on the truck-mounted rig, with pilot control of the aircraft in forward motion. On 11 February 1942, the prototype Rotachute was first manually flown from a wheeled trolley while under tow behind a Humber car at Ringway, after starting the rotor by hand. The pilot was Flt Lt I.M. Little, who had experience flying Avro/Cierva C.30 Rota autogiros on <b>radar</b> <b>calibration</b> duties; he was later awarded the Air Force Cross (UK).

A tethered test beneath a barrage balloon and a longer test flight at RAF Snaith were both more successful.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{technique}} for correcting errors in radar estimates of rainfall due to attenuation {{which is based on}} the fact that any attenuating target will itself emit, and that this emission can be detected by the increased noise level in the radar receiver. The technique is being installed on the UK operational network, and for the first time, allows radome attenuation to be monitored using the increased noise at the higher beam elevations. This attenuation has a large azimuthal dependence but for an old radome can be up to 4 dB for rainfall rates of just 2 – 4 mm/h. This effect has been neglected in the past, but may be responsible for significant errors in rainfall estimates and in <b>radar</b> <b>calibrations</b> using gauges. The extra noise at low radar elevations provides an estimate of the total path integrated attenuation of nearby storms; this total attenuation can then be used as a constraint for gate-by-gate or polarimetric correction algorithms...|$|R

40|$|A multi-spectral {{rainfall}} estimation algorithm {{has been}} developed for the Sahel region of West Africa {{with the purpose of}} producing accumulated rainfall estimates for drought monitoring and food security. Radar data were used to calibrate multi-channel SEVIRI data from MSG, and a probability of rainfall at several different rain-rates was established for each combination of SEVIRI radiances. <b>Radar</b> <b>calibrations</b> from both Europe (the SatPrecip algorithm) and Niger (TAMORA algorithm) were used. 10 day estimates were accumulated from SatPrecip and TAMORA and compared with kriged gauge data and TAMSAT satellite rainfall estimates over West Africa. SatPrecip was found to produce large overestimates for the region, probably because of its non-local calibration. TAMORA was negatively biased for areas of West Africa with relatively high rainfall, but its skill was comparable to TAMSAT for the low-rainfall region climatologically similar to its calibration area around Niamey. These results confirm the high importance of local calibration for satellite-derived rainfall estimates. As TAMORA shows no improvement in skill over TAMSAT for dekadal estimates, the extra cloud-microphysical information provided by multi-spectral data may not be useful in determining rainfall accumulations at a ten day timescale. Work is ongoing to determine whether it shows improved accuracy at shorter timescales. ...|$|R
