He began crying and said [...] "This is my fault, {{because you have}} suspected me. I have not <b>really</b> <b>gone</b> {{to work for the}} last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad. But I am not against you. I was sad because I thought I was discredited with you. So Nguyễn Hữu Có profited from my absence to make trouble." [...] Đính claimed to know nothing of Có's activities and vowed to have his deputy killed. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to this end. Nhu ordered Đính and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime.|$|E

[...] One of the men forced me {{to look into the}} mirror. [...] There I saw − not the reflection of myself, but rather of some thin, ape-like man, gruesome and horrible looking, grinding his teeth. [...] I thought to myself, 'Maybe I've <b>really</b> <b>gone</b> mad!' It was a terrible moment, but I regained my bearings and spat upon the mirror. [...] You know I think they liked that....I thought a great deal:'Will I survive or will I really go mad?' That was not good. [...] I did not have faith in myself, see?..., of course, know their business, their science. [...] But they do not know the Caucasians. [...] Maybe every Caucasian is insane, as far as they are concerned. [...] Well, who will drive whom mad? [...] Nothing developed. [...] They stuck to their guns and I to mine. [...] In Tiflis, they didn't torture me. [...] Apparently they thought that the Germans can make no mistakes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Giddens' {{recent work}} has been {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} what is characteristic about social institutions in various points of history. Giddens agrees that there are very specific changes that mark our current era, but argues {{that it is not a}} [...] "post-modern era", but just a [...] "radicalised modernity era" [...] (similar to Zygmunt Bauman's concept of liquid modernity), produced by the extension of the same social forces that shaped the previous age. Giddens nonetheless differentiates between pre-modern, modern and late (high) modern societies and doesn't dispute that important changes have occurred but takes a neutral stance towards those changes, saying that it offers both unprecedented opportunities and unparalleled dangers. He also stresses that we haven't <b>really</b> <b>gone</b> beyond modernity. It's just a developed, detraditionalised, radicalised, 'late' modernity. Thus the phenomena that some have called 'postmodern' are to Giddens nothing more than the most extreme instances of a developed modernity. Along with Ulrich Beck and Scott Lash, he endorses the term reflexive modernisation as a more accurate description of the processes associated with the second modernity, since it opposes itself (in its earlier version) instead of opposing traditionalism, endangering the very institutions it created (such as the national state, the political parties or the nuclear family).|$|E
