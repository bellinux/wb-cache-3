40|$|ABSTRACT: 3 D-Strip Profile Rolling should {{enable the}} {{production}} of blanks with a defined thickness profile in latitudinal and longitudinal direction. The production chain of 3 D-Strip Profile Rolling will combine Flexible Rolling in a first production step with Strip Profile Rolling in a second step. The control system to adjust the roll gap during 3 D-Strip Profile Rolling is currently under development. Nevertheless, some first experiments have shown the general feasibility to produce 3 D-profiled blanks. In 3 D-Strip Profile Rolling the material will strain harden differently on different locations. This results in {{a variation of the}} material properties of the strip. Lateral spread, elastic roll stand deformation and local deformation will be influenced by this variation. To investigate these influences on the complete production process, the complete production chain needs to be modelled in the future with aid of finite element simulations. In this publication a first simulation model is used to study the influence of different grades of strain hardening in a Taylor <b>Rolled</b> <b>Blank</b> on the bulge formation that occurs during the rolling of a rill in this Tailor <b>Rolled</b> <b>Blank...</b>|$|E

As a new {{lightweight}} structural sheet metal, tailor <b>rolled</b> <b>blanks</b> {{has a good}} prospect in {{the future}} development of the automobile industry, and its formability is the current research focus.

The results show that, generally, in the punch and side wall corner, where thinning is more serious is a dangerous rupture area, while the inner edge of flange part is prone to wrinkle. When the BHF is 140 kN, the connection between the thin side and the transition zone where thinning is severe is also a dangerous area, and even more serious, likewise when the blank thickness ratio arrives at 1. 4 mm/ 0. 8 mm, or the blank size 260 mm* 260 mm, thinning is very serious at the connection between the thin side and the transition zone which is a dangerous rupture area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sophisticated {{materials}} {{like high}} strength steel or even multi phase steel as well as aluminum require more efforts within the manufacturing process than conventional steel sheets {{as they have been}} used in the body in white recently. The manufacturing process itself as well as engineering of the parts, material of the forming tools as well as cold and warm joining technologies must be regarded separately. For forming tools coated steel inserts or sometimes even cooling is essential in terms of high-volume car series production. In mixed material solutions using steel in combination with aluminum, the common used resistance spot welding process does not work any more. To maintain high process stability of cold joining technologies combined with adhesive bonding a new process must have been developed. Other items for weight and cost savings are tailored <b>rolled</b> <b>blanks</b> or sophisticated joining technologies. Regarding the manufacturing costs, a cost effective combination of the mentioned high-sophisticated alloys with conventional material should be achieved. Developing a design concept due to crash, stiffness and driving performance, basic requirements have to be considered. This aims to check the high potential of cost intensive materials wherever high functional benefit is necessary under commercial aspects...|$|R

An analytical method was firstly presented for proximately determining the critical friction coefficient of stable forming and then a method was proposed to determine the critical friction coefficient by combining analytical method with numerical simulation. And the influence of friction coefficient on the quality of end-plane and side spread of ring, rolling force, rolling moment and metal flow characteristic in the cold ring rolling process have been explored using the three dimensional (3 D) numerical simulation based on the elastic-plastic dynamic finite element method (FEM) under the ABAQUS software environment, and the results show that increasing the friction on the contact surfaces between <b>rolls</b> and ring <b>blank</b> is useful not only for improving the stability of cold ring rolling but also for improving the geometry and dimension precision of deformed ring.

40|$|The {{variable}} gauge rolling {{process is a}} new technology designed to produce flat products of different thicknesses such as longitudinal profile (LP) plates and tailor <b>rolled</b> <b>blanks</b> (TRB), which are used in bridge building, shipbuilding, and automobile manufacturing, etc., to decrease the weight and the welding times, etc. In this paper, a series of numerical studies on the wave motion of rolling force in {{variable gauge}} rolling (in three stages: down rolling, flat rolling, and upper rolling) were carried out using the finite element method to obtain the deformation of the work piece {{at different stages of}} rolling. The rolling force and its wave motion during rolling were analyzed under a variety of reduction ratios, including the coefficient of friction, initial thickness of the plates, and diameters of the rolls. The rolling force obviously increases as the reduction in the down rolling process increases, and then decreases during upper rolling. The rolling force consists of two abrupt wave motions in the transitional zones during the down to flat rolling stage, and the flat to upper rolling stage. These results are significant with regards to precisely controlling the deformation of workpiece in the transition zone during variable gauge rolling. The variable gauge rolling (VGR) process is a new technology designed to produce flat products of different thicknesses.

25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or <b>rolled</b> onto <b>blanks</b> with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} several factors influencing {{the cost of a}} particular raw material blank, the policy changes based on this study, and the cost reduction accomplished by means of these changes. This general approach may be employed to reduce the raw material cost of a variety of machined components. The operation in question was to purchase hot <b>rolled</b> metal <b>blanks</b> and from these to machine closely dimensioned plates. To allow for process variabilities and to assure sufficient material removal to yield a high quality finished surface, we bought blanks thicker, hence heavier, than the finished plates. The material was expensive and the machining chips were not recoverable, so this excess blank weight represented a substantial annual cost. To minimize this loss we considered reducing the process variabilities, sorting blanks to narrow the range released for machining and to divert the others to less critical applications, and reducing the minimum thickness of blanks selected for machining, tolerating some loss due to machining rejects with the expectation that this would be outweighed by the reduction in cost of the average blank machined. As a result of these studies we were able to reduce the blank weight 8 %, thus reducing our material cost for this single component more than $ 50, 000 per year.

40|$|With the {{findings}} of this study surface defect densification defects and shape devia-tions can be avoided. Furthermore, the time for development of the rolling process can be shortened. Through a process analysis, the relationship between process input and process output was determined. The test gear is representative for automotive applications as well as suitable for fur-ther fatigue tests. An analogy process with cylindrical tools and cylindrical roller blanks was developed. The cylindrical rollers reflect the material properties and the geometrical kinematic contact conditions on the pitch circle and generate results of the rolling forces and the compression. In addition, a simulation model was developed based on the finite element method. In the gear rolling simulation a material model, which describes both the deformation and the compaction of powder metallurgical material, was developed and implemented. The process input variables are the process parameters, the tool geometry and the rolling blank material. Process parameters that were investigated were the number of revolutions, the number of reverse points and the rolling speed. The mechanical characteristics of the powder metallurgical material were measured. The rolling forces increase with the infeed. The increase of the rolling force is com-posed of a linear and a degressive proportion. The linear increase is caused by the elastic deformation of the tool shafts, tools and rolling blank. The degressive in-crease results from work hardening and compaction. The maximum rolling force is reached at the maximum infeed of the rolling tools. The maximum rolling force is dependent on the infeed, the blank material, the process parameters and the contact geometry. Infeed has the greatest impact on the rolling force and is followed by the carbon content and density. The surface of rolled powder metallurgical gears has an average surface roughness of about RZ = 1. 0 – 1. 5 µm. In extreme cases, surface defects called overlaps occur in the tooth root area. The intensity of surface defects is influenced by the combination of the occuring stress in the rolling contact and the durability of the blank material. Due to the small contact radii in the tooth root area high stresses occur. The surface can be improved by increasing the carbon content. The density and the sintering temperature have only a small effect on the surface. In addition, the load and the number of rollings worsen the surface. Densification is a type of plastic deformation which is caused by hydrostatic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure of the rolling contact causes a collapse of the pores and the powder metallurgical material compacts. The hydrostatic stress component is caused primarily by the normal force. The density distribution is neither in tooth face direction nor in profile direction homgeneous. In tooth face direction, the compression drops due to the missing axial support from the faces. In profile direction, the densifictaion rises up to a maximum compression in the field of rolling pitch diameter. Beginning from that maximum the compression drops in the direction of the tooth tip and tooth root. By adapting the stock for densification a uniform compression in profile direction can be achieved. In general, the compression can be improved by adjusting the rolling blank properties. Higher densities of the blank increase the densification depth. The radius of the contact showed a minor influence on the compression depth. The carbon content, which has an influence on the hardness of the material, does not affect the compression depth. During rolling reproducible profile errors typically occur. These errors are character-ized by an overmeasure on the tip and an overmeasure in the tooth root. Elastic deformations of the <b>roll</b> <b>blank</b> and incorrectly oriented material flow during compression are the cause for the profile deviations. For compensation of the deviations a method was developed. The deviations could be improved significantly by the correction of the tool. The reached profile quality was Q 7, the profile line deviation Q 3, and pitch deviations and roundness were in the range of Q 1...|$|R
