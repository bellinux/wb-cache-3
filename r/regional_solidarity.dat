Based on ethnographic work, this paper looks at the social construction and negotiation of ‘the local’ within three specific case studies. First, we show what diverging geographical and moral definitions of ‘the local’ emerge from the development of these localised food networks. Then we look at how the various moralities of ‘the local’ in turn contribute to the transformation of the actor’s position within the broader food system. Finally, we argue that apparently narrow economic strategies of food might open new paths for more transformative developments based on alternative values such as <b>regional</b> development, <b>solidarity</b> and identity...|$|R

Firstly, we empirically examine our claim at an aggregate level using evidence from Catalonia and the Basque Country, to examine the evolution of sub-state identity and the rise of inter-territorial fiscal grievances - weakening intraregional economic solidarity. Secondly, we estimate how the combination of widening sub-national identity and regional redistribution strengthens support for vertical state downscaling. Findings suggest an expansion of spatial identities in both Catalonia and the Basque Country since the early 1980 ’s.

40|$|State {{rescaling}} {{may take}} a variety of shapes although scant research {{has been carried out}} into the mechanisms and economic incentives that underpin rescaling processes. Recent literature in economics, economic sociology and political economy has identified at least two broad rescaling mechanisms, namely the development of regional identity - operating at the cultural level and proxing preference heterogeneity-, and the heterogeneity in levels of economic development, which influence the extent of regional redistribution. This paper empirically examines the mechanisms of vertical state rescaling by drawing upon empirical evidence from Catalonia and the Basque Country, to explore the evolution of sub-state identity and the rise of inter-territorial fiscal grievances - weakening intraregional economic solidarity. Findings corroborate the idea that the combination of widening sub-national identity raises the costs of managing heterogeneous spatial identities and strengthens support for vertical state downscaling. Similarly, ending <b>regional</b> fiscal <b>solidarity</b> it is found to increase the average income of Catalonia by 37 % and even 17 % in the Basque Country. However, the effect of regional identity exceeds that of regional redistribution in explaining state rescaling support in the magnitude of one to seven. These findings speak to the debate on the formation of Europe, in that they reveal limits to regional redistribution and highlight the importance of a common spatial identity...|$|R
50|$|On Monday, January 26, {{a one-hour}} warning strike {{took place in}} {{selected}} enterprises of Bielsko-Biala and the region (Skoczów, Zywiec, Kęty, Andrychów, Sucha Beskidzka). On the same day, the Interfactory Founding Committee {{changed its name to}} Interfactory Strike Committee (MKS), with 107 members of 54 enterprises of the province. The MKS had its main office at the club-room of Cotton Plant Bewelana in Bielsko-Biała, which had previously been the location of weekly meetings of <b>regional</b> <b>Solidarity</b> leaders. In that club-room, some 400 people stayed for ten days. The strike started on Tuesday, January 27, and most enterprises of the Voivodeship took part in it. In Bielsko-Biała itself, the only businesses that did not participate in it were hospitals, railroads, delivery services, and telecommunications companies. In the course of the time, additional enterprises joined the protest, and activists of Rural Solidarity brought food to the workers, who occupied their factories. Crews of striking enterprises were very determined, and what they needed most were news updates. Every few hours, several times a day, strike bulletins were copied and distributed to thousands of people. Negotiations at Bewelana were broadcast live to most local factories, due to the efforts of Solidarity telecommunications experts, who created a network, which connected all radio stations of the enterprises. Local government was helpless, and the Interfactory Strike Committee became the center of power in the region, with 200,000 people actively participating in the protest. Negotiations, which took place in early February, failed, and soon afterwards, Solidarity leaders Lech Wałęsa, Andrzej Gwiazda and Stanisław Wądołowski came to Bielsko-Biała, together with their advisers Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Bronisław Geremek. Wałęsa and his people at first opposed the strike, for two reasons. Firstly, Bielsko-Biała's Solidarity activists organized it without consultation the union’s national leadership body. Secondly, at that time national negotiations were taking place in Warsaw, and local protests did not help Solidarity. Therefore, Wałęsa came to Bielsko-Biała to end the strike, but after finding out about the situation in the region, and seeing the determination of the people, he changed his mind and supported the protest. Furthermore, he warned the government that a national strike would take place, if force was used against workers in Bielsko-Biała. As time went by, the situation became dramatic. All talks were broken, and people talked among themselves that the authorities were considering the use of force.|$|E

40|$|How was France {{consolidated}} as {{an imperial}} state, {{and how was}} its imperial form challenged from the colonies? This is the question I address in this dissertation by turning to the works of Frantz Fanon. I argue that Fanon’s first published work Black Skin, White Masks offers a critique and diagnosis of how the French imperial state was consolidated through racialized relations of social solidarity. In this work, Fanon shows that race mediated how social solidarity was articulated and practiced such that colonial subject-citizens were simultaneously included into and excluded from republican citizenship. Caught in the double bind of inclusion and exclusion, the possibility of forging any substantial sense of social solidarity {{between black and white}} citizens in France and its colonies was forgone. In Fanon’s subsequent writings - A Dying Colonialism, Towards the African Revolution and The Wretched of the Earth – he demonstrates that the racialized social solidarity of imperial France and the international political community more broadly, were challenged by practices of <b>regional</b> political <b>solidarity</b> between the Third World masses in the post-war era. Specifically, I argue that his writings articulate two sets of political practices that the masses of the Third World engage in to transform the imperialist structure of France and international state system 1) the practice of vigilance in response to being vulnerable to undemocratic rule internally and being subject to imperial domination externally and 2) the practice of sacrifice as a way to share and distribute the burdens of waging armed resistance against powerful imperial states. These practices form the basis of Fanon’s distinctive account of Third World political solidarity as a form of intercontinental populism between formerly colonized nations that could obliterate the bonds of racialized fraternity that defined colonial relations, and continued to define core and periphery relations in the postcolonial era...|$|R
40|$|The {{contributions}} of Korean and Taiwanese authors {{to the many}} and varied formulations of interwar pan-Asianism have so far remained a relatively unexplored subject of scholarly research, despite an unbroken interest in the trajectory of state-based Japanese pan-Asianism. Focusing on Korean students and independence activists, this article discusses alternative configurations of <b>regional</b> unity and <b>solidarity</b> that emanated from the interactions among Korean, Taiwanese, and other Asian actors who resided in Tokyo during the 1910 s and 1920 s. When the ethnic-nationalist interpretations of the Wilsonian principle of self-determination failed to materialize, a portion of anti-colonial activists in Asia began to emphasize the need for solidarity by drawing on what they perceived as traditional and shared “Asian” values. While challenging the Western-dominated international order of nation-states that perpetuated imperialism, such notions of Asian solidarity {{at the same time}} served as an ideology of liberation from Japanese imperialism. Examining journals published by Korean students and activists, including The Asia Kunglun, this article adds another layer to the history of pan-Asianism from below, a perspective that has often been neglected within the larger context of scholarship on pan-Asianism and Japanese imperialism in Asia...|$|R
40|$|The 2007 - 2013 {{programming}} {{period of the}} EU focuses on economic and social cohesion via three fundamental objectives: convergence – competitiveness and employment – European territorial co-operation. The horizontal dimension of cohesion policy refers to diminishing the <b>regional</b> disparities and <b>solidarity</b> with the lagging regions’ population. Considering the big regional disparities in the New Member States (NMS) {{as well as the}} gap between their GDP per capita at national level and the EU average, these countries are the main beneficiary of the EU financial allocations, especially via convergence objective. However, two interrelated questions are entailed by this issue. One of them refers to the capacity of these countries to absorb effectively the EU funds. The other one concentrates on the impact of the absorbed EU funds, in other words to the qualitative aspects of the absorption capacity. Our paper discusses these aspects mainly from the viewpoint of regional disparities in the NMS, proposing a typology of their regions based on the main regional growth characteristics. The implications of the structural assistance on regional disparities are also addressed, taking into consideration economic and social criteria and requirements at EU, national, regional and local levels.

40|$|ABSTRACT—This paper compares and {{contrasts}} neoliberal discourses {{with the}} Cuban method of development, {{referred to as}} cubanalismo, {{in the areas of}} healthcare and education, economic and environmental policies, and explores free trade as opposed to needs-based trade.

The author concludes that the leftward movement in Latin America is in direct opposition to neoliberalism and asserts that winds of change are indeed on the horizon. All things considered, cubanalismo remains a workable alternative to neoliberalism based on its social and human emphasis, and the prioritization of eliminating poverty, marginalization, and underdevelopment as central policy mandates...|$|E

It is with great pleasure that I come here this morning to open the University of Zimbabwe Fourth Annual Conference on Food Security Research in Southern Africa. I am pleased to report again this year that the conference agenda has been prepared in dose cooperation with SADCC member states in cooperation with Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Agriculture [...] the coordinator of SADCC’s food security programme. SADCC member states have a critical role to play in food security planning and research because of the diversity and complexity of the agro-ecologies and the political priorities in our region. This diversity and complexity requires grass roots and national-level participation in food security debates. These national efforts should fulfill national goals as well as contribute to <b>regional</b> cooperation and <b>solidarity.</b> There is convincing evidence that there are multiple paths to achieving food security. In practice, this means we must move beyond simple slogans such as "food self-sufficiency" and "food self-reliance” and address the overall policy question: What is the most cost-effective mix of domestic food production, storage, trade, and/or food aid to meet national and regional food security objectives in both the short- and long-run?US Agency for International Development Bureau of Science and Technology...|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: There {{has been}} a recent outpouring of memoirs and biographies of the ‘great men’ of the {{southern}} African liberation movements. But the writing of critical reflective histories of these movements by non-partisan, independent scholars {{is still in its}} infancy. This collection of essays illustrates the intertwined histories of southern African liberation struggles and those of <b>regional</b> and international <b>solidarity</b> movements from the 1960 s to the establishment of a non-racial democracy in South Africa in 1994, reflecting the new directions currently taken by ‘indigenous’ southern–African based scholars, and those writing from abroad. Distinct from the polemical, hagiographic, justificatory or partisan accounts that have flowed since the inception of the liberation struggles, the essays probe beyond the heroic portrayals of armed struggles and nationalist resistance to examine the fissures and tensions that existed within them. The essays also provide insights into the more troubling and darker aspects of the movements’ histories: human rights abuses perpetrated by the ‘liberators’; the important, if ambiguous, roles played by other southern African states which hosted, and provided succour for, the ANC and its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) in exile; the support provided to the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) by the Lesotho government {{and the ways in which}} the fractious and personality-dominated politics of the organisation contributed to its weakness and ultimate eclipse by the ANC; the relationship between Muslims in Northern Mozambique and that country’s liberation movements. These essays also seek to present more nuanced accounts of the solidarity movements that flourished alongside the liberation and exile movements, such as the British-based Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM), which in the 1970 s found itself at odds both with international interest groups pursuing constructive engagement with the South African government and with elements in the country’s grassroots movements. Even this organisation, committed to the downfall of systemic racial domination in South Africa, was beset by its own tensions of race, and had a difficult relationship with Black Britons. The collection’s uniqueness lies in drawing together internal and external struggles in exile. And it provides new insights into the relationships that exiles and guerrillas developed with host societies and solidarity organisations, both within the southern African region, and in the United Kingdom...|$|R
