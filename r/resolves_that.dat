5|$|Under the Scotland Act 1998, {{ordinary}} {{general elections}} for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on). The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself <b>resolves</b> <b>that</b> it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held {{less than six months}} before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.).|$|E

25|$|The two central {{characters}} are the Americans Bremen and Gail. Both are telepaths, {{the only other}} telepaths that either has ever known. Inevitably, they fall in love. When Gail dies of illness, Bremen is devastated. He gives up his career in mathematics and becomes a drifter. At the commencement of the action, he has ended up at a facility for retarded and otherwise disabled minors. He becomes sort of fond of one named Robby, who had been blinded and mentally crippled before birth by his mother's drug abuse habits, and <b>resolves</b> <b>that</b> before he leaves the facility (for he feels he has been there too long), he will use his telepathic power to give Robby a gift of sorts: images and sounds of the outside world.|$|E
25|$|A select {{committee}} is a committee {{made up of}} a small number of MPs appointed to deal with particular areas or issues. Standing Select Committees (that is, permanently constituted committees) are either chaired by the Speaker of Parliament or an MP appointed to the position, and its members are usually up to seven MPs appointed by Parliament in a manner that ensures that, so far as is possible, the balance between the Government benches and the Opposition benches in Parliament is reflected in the Committee. Parliament may also appoint ad hoc Select Committees to deal with other matters, such as to study the details of bills that are before Parliament. In addition, if Parliament <b>resolves</b> <b>that</b> NMPs will be appointed during its term, a Special Select Committee on Nominations for Appointment as NMP is established to consider suggestions for nominees submitted by members of the public.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{production}} or cast of the film despite its surviving status. The only known credit cited by Q. David Bowers is that of Marie Eline cast in the role of Marie. The director, scenario writer and cameraman are also unknown. Thanhouser Company Film Preservation states that the dramatic theme of the film was [...] "family disharmony" [...] and it took the expected sentimental approach for the era. Marie who identifies with her grandmother <b>resolves</b> <b>that</b> she is also [...] "Only in the Way" [...] by virtue of being a cripple. The site states, [...] "Thanhouser scenarists seemed to have had a special sensitivity for the feelings of children which is reflected in this film." ...|$|E

500|$|Back in {{the fields}} of Thrace, Orfeo has a long soliloquy in which he laments his loss, praises Euridice's beauty and <b>resolves</b> <b>that</b> his heart will never again be pierced by Cupid's arrow. An off-stage echo repeats his final phrases. Suddenly, in a cloud, Apollo descends from the heavens and chastises him: [...] "Why dost thou give thyself up as prey to rage and grief?" [...] He invites Orfeo to leave the world and join him in the heavens, where he will {{recognise}} Euridice's likeness in the stars. Orfeo replies that it would be unworthy not to follow the counsel of such a wise father, and together they ascend. A shepherds' chorus concludes that [...] "he who sows in suffering shall reap the fruit of every grace", before the opera ends with a vigorous moresca.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{deals with}} the concept of realizing one's {{mortality}} and discovering that life is more precious because of it. [...] Learning that he is in fact not immortal as he once thought, Bender initially feels that living a life that is anything less than immortal is worthless. [...] He {{deals with the}} devastating news of his newfound mortality by trying to find the one person who he believes can answer his questions about the reason for his life and why he was allowed to [...] "be born" [...] only to die. [...] Though Bender cannot find the answers to his mortality, he ultimately ends up developing a new outlook on life, believing it to be more precious than it was before now that it is finite, and he <b>resolves</b> <b>that</b> life is worth living no matter how brief it is.|$|E

2500|$|Rebecca Sharp, called Becky, is Amelia's opposite, an {{intelligent}} {{young woman with}} a gift for satire. She is described as a short sandy haired girl who has green eyes {{and a great deal of}} wit. Fluent in both French and English, Becky has a beautiful singing voice, plays the piano, and shows great talent as an actress. Without a mother to guide her into marriage, Becky <b>resolves</b> <b>that</b> [...] "I must be my own Mamma". She thereafter appears to be completely amoral and without conscience and has been called the work's [...] "anti-heroine". She does not seem to have the ability to get attached to other people, and lies easily and intelligently to get her way. She is extremely manipulative and, after the first few chapters and her failure to attract Jos Sedley, is not shown as being particularly sincere. Never having known financial or social security even as a child, Becky desires it above all things. Nearly everything she does is with the intention of securing a stable position for herself, or herself and her husband after she and Rawdon are married. She advances Rawdon's interests tirelessly, flirting with men such as General Tufto and the Marquis of Steyne to get him promoted. She also uses her feminine wiles to distract men at card parties while Rawdon cheats them blind. Marrying Rawdon Crawley in secret was a mistake, as was running off instead of begging Miss Crawley's forgiveness. She also fails to manipulate Miss Crawley through Rawdon so as to obtain an inheritance. Although Becky manipulates men very easily, she does not even try to cultivate the friendship of most women. She is utterly hostile to Lady Bareacres and Lady Jane, the Dobbin sisters, and Lady Steyne see right through her. Amelia and (initially) Miss Crawley are exceptions to the rule.|$|E
