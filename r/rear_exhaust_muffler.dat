Energy Dispersive X-Ray fluorescence method was used to determine the chemical composition of the stainless steel materials and <b>exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> of the motor cycle. The stainless steel sheet was perforated and folded to frustum shape to achieve aero dynamic shape and used as protective cover on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> to protect the leg from burns. The burn protector produced was mounted on Jincheng AX 100 motor cycle and driving test carried out for 15 days using operational periods of 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 90 minutes to determine its effectiveness. Cole Palmer thermocouple digital meter was used to measure the surface temperatures of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> and burn protector {{at the end of each}} operation cycle and data generated was averaged. The experimental results show that the longer the driving period the higher the temperatures of both the <b>exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> and <b>exhaust</b> burn protector. At the maximum driving test period of 90 minutes, the temperature of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> rose from 0. 2 o C to 92 o C and that of the <b>Exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> burn protector rose from 0. 2 o C to 10 o C respectively. The difference in the temperatures is 82 o C, which is significant. The stainless steel material is therefore suitable for the production of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> burn protector.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are typically {{equipped with an}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> to suppress the acoustic pulse generated by the combustion process. A high intensity pressure wave generated by combustion in the engine cylinder propagates along the exhaust pipe and radiates from the exhaust pipe termination. <b>Exhaust</b> <b>mufflers</b> are designed to reduce sound levels at certain frequencies. New regulations and standards for noise emission increasingly compel the automotive firms to make some improvements about decreasing the engine noise. On the other hand, developments on automobile technology and increasing competition between manufacturers necessitates having being reduced weight, having capability of higher sound absorption and lower back pressure mufflers. Lightness could be possible if the thickness is decreased or the volume is reduced. However, this causes high back pressure. Therefore, the optimum design requires. Recently finite element methods are used to obtain flow characteristics and back pressure values of mufflers. Having used of this method, effect of different parameters can be examined without prototyping and best suitable muffler can be determined in the design process. Furthermore time and money can be saved. In this study, a reactive, perforated and cross-flow muffler which damped the noise of a spark ignition engine is investigated. Some geometrical dimensions of the muffler are decreased and new models are redesigned. Models are analyzed to obtained flow characteristic by using computational fluid dynamics. ...|$|R
