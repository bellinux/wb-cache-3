50|$|In {{commercial}} systems, cross-band repeaters {{are sometimes}} used in vehicular repeaters. For example, a 150 MHz hand held may communicate to a vehicle-mounted low-power transceiver.

In these systems, the hand-held works {{so long as it}} is within range of the low power mobile repeater. The mobile radio is usually on a different band than the hand-held to reduce the chances of the mobile radio transmitter interfering with the transmission from the hand-held to the vehicle.|$|R
