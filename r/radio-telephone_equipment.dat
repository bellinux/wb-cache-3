50|$|They {{maintain}} combat {{information center}} displays of strategic and tactical information, including various plotting boards and tables depicting position and movement of submarines, ships and aircraft {{as well as}} tote boards containing data relevant to the tactical picture. They operate surveillance, tracking and height-finding radars, {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF) equipment, HF, VHF and UHF radios, tactical data link (TADIL-A/Link 11, TADIL-J/Link 16, etc.) systems and displays, and computerized consoles and peripheral equipment that allows them interface with the Aegis combat system. The tactical data links exchange data between other units in the force; i.e., ships, aircraft and other military units such as deployed Army, Air Force, Marine and Coast Guard commands. They operate encrypted and non-encrypted long and short range <b>radio-telephone</b> <b>equipment</b> as well as intra-ship communication systems.|$|E
40|$|The {{explosive}} growth in microprocessor {{technology and the}} increasing use of computers to store information has increased the demand for data communication channels. Because of this, data communication to mobile vehicles is increasing rapidly. In addition, data communication is seen as a method of relieving the current congestion of mobile radio telephone bands in the U. K. Highly reliable data communication over mobile radio channels is particularly difficult to achieve, primarily due to fading caused by multipath interference. In this thesis a data communication system is described for use over radio channels impaired by multipath interference. The thesis first describes radio communication in general, and multipath interference In particular. The practical aspects of fading channels are stressed because of their importance {{in the development of the}} system. The current U. K. land mobile radio scene is then reviewed, with particular emphasis on the use of existing mobile radio equipment for data communication purposes. The development of the data communication system is then described. This system is microprocessor based and uses an advanced form of automatic request repeat (ARQ) operation. It can be configured to use either existing <b>radio-telephone</b> <b>equipment,</b> totally new equipment specifically designed for data communication, or any combination of the two. Due to its adaptability, the system can automatically optimise itself for use over any channel, even if the channel parameters are changing rapidly. Results obtained from a particular implementation of the system, which is described in full, are presented. These show how the operation of the system has to change to accomodate changes in the channel. Comparisons are made between the practical results and the theoretical limits of the system...|$|E

The Air Transport Auxiliary were {{responsible}} for dispersing tested machines to the Maintenance Units {{around the country for}} the fitting of <b>radio-telephones</b> and other <b>equipment.</b> As any build-up of machines on the airfield would be vulnerable to aerial attack, testing was carried out during daylight in almost any weather.CBAF produced all versions of the Spitfire from the Mk II onwards. This aircraft had the more powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin XII engine, providing , an increase of [...] over the Mk I, and could be used with either the de Havilland or Rotol propellers. The first Mk II flew on 24 September 1939.|$|R
