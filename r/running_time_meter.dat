50|$|We {{can further}} improve upon this algorithm, by iteratively merging the two {{shortest}} arrays. It {{is clear that}} this minimizes the <b>running</b> <b>time</b> and can therefore not be worse than the strategy described in the previous paragraph. The <b>running</b> <b>time</b> is therefore in O(n log k). Fortunately, in border cases the <b>running</b> <b>time</b> can be better. Consider for example the degenerate case, where all but one array contain only one element. The strategy explained in the previous paragraph needs Θ(n log k) <b>running</b> <b>time,</b> while the improved one only needs Θ(n) <b>running</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
40|$|We give {{improved}} algorithms {{for constructing}} minimum directed and undirected cycle bases in graphs. For general graphs, the new algorithms are Monte Carlo and have <b>running</b> <b>time</b> O(m ω), where ω is the exponent of matrix multiplication.

The previous best algorithm had <b>running</b> <b>time</b> O(n² logn).

We directly apply this result to the Minimum Knapsack Problem, for which the original framework yields an FPTAS with <b>running</b> <b>time</b> O(n^ 5 /ϵ), where ϵ is the required accuracy and n {{is the number of}} items, and obtain an FPTAS with <b>running</b> <b>time</b> O(n^ 3 /ϵ), thus improving the <b>running</b> <b>time</b> by a quadratic factor in the worst case...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aims of {{the study}} were to examine the (a) participation, (b) {{difference}} in <b>running</b> <b>times</b> between the sexes, and (c) age-related decline in the <b>running</b> <b>times</b> of ultramarathoner women and men competing in the Swiss Alpine Marathon from 1998 to 2011. Methods: The ultramarathoners competing in the Swiss Alpine Marathon were analyzed in terms of participation, difference in <b>running</b> <b>times</b> between the sexes, age of the fastest runners, and age-related decline in the fastest <b>running</b> <b>times.</b> The race covers a distance of 78 km, with a total altitude change of approximately 2260 m. A total of 12, 194 men and 1781 women finished the race between 1998 and 2011. Results: Women’s participation increased from approximately 10 % in 1998 to approximately 16 % in 2011 (r 2 = 0. 57; P = 0. 001), but participation remained unchanged in men (r 2 = 0. 17; P. 0. 05). Over the years, the top ten women showed no change in <b>running</b> <b>times</b> (r 2 = 0. 02; P. 0. 05), whereas the top ten men’s <b>running</b> <b>times</b> increased (r 2 = 0. 46; P, 0. 01). The age for peak <b>running</b> <b>times</b> increased over time both for the top ten women (r 2 = 0. 58; P, 0. 01) and for the top ten men (r 2 = 0. 40; P = 0. 01).
