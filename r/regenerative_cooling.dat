5|$|Hydrogen was {{liquefied}} for {{the first}} time by James Dewar in 1898 by using <b>regenerative</b> <b>cooling</b> and his invention, the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into <b>regenerative</b> <b>cooling</b> systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank {{pressurization}} system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E

The three-dimensional internal CFD platform for scramjet and the computational program of domestic aviation kerosene properties are incorporated together to develop three dimensional thermal evaluation code. Then the thermal evaluation results from the code can be introduced into the thermal-stress finite element program to complete quantitative structural analysis of engine structure. The results show the temperature and heat flux distribution of the scramjet structure is very uneven. Local plasticity occurs in some areas.

Liquid hydrogen (LH 2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) are transported from the fuel tanks to the combustion chamber by means of turbopumps, which themselves are driven by an expansion of warm and highly compressed gasous hydrogen in the turbines.

25|$|Rocketry in the Soviet Union {{also began}} with amateur societies, {{foremost}} was the Group for the Study of Reactive Propulsion (GIRD) headed by Friedrich Zander and Sergei Korolev. From 1931 to 1937 in the Soviet Union, extensive scientific work on rocket engine design {{occurred at the}} Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL) in Leningrad, which was merged with GIRD in 1933 bringing rocketry fully under government control. The well-funded and -staffed laboratory built over 100 experimental engines {{under the direction of}} Valentin Glushko. The work included <b>regenerative</b> <b>cooling,</b> hypergolic propellant ignition, and fuel injector designs that included swirling and bi-propellant mixing injectors. However, Glushko's arrest during Stalinist purges in 1938 curtailed the development.|$|E
2500|$|The {{combustion}} burner {{reached a}} temperature of [...] The alcohol-water fuel was pumped along the double wall of the main combustion burner. This <b>regenerative</b> <b>cooling</b> heated the fuel and cooled the combustion chamber. The fuel was then pumped into the main burner chamber through 1,224 nozzles, which assured the correct mixture of alcohol and oxygen at all times. Small holes also permitted some alcohol to escape directly into the combustion chamber, forming a cooled boundary layer that further protected {{the wall of the}} chamber, especially at the throat where the chamber was narrowest. The boundary layer alcohol ignited on contact with the atmosphere, accounting for the long, diffuse exhaust plume. By contrast, later, post-V-2 engine designs not employing this alcohol boundary layer cooling show a translucent plume with shock diamonds.|$|E

Peroxide used as an oxidizer gives a somewhat lower Isp than liquid oxygen, but is dense, storable, noncryogenic and can be more easily used to drive gas turbines to give high pressures using an efficient closed cycle. It {{can also be used}} for <b>regenerative</b> <b>cooling</b> of rocket engines. Peroxide was used very successfully as an oxidizer in World War II German rocket motors (e.g. T-Stoff, containing oxyquinoline stabilizer, for both the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe RATO externally podded monopropellant booster system, and for the Walter HWK 109-509 rocket motor series used for the Me 163B), most often used with C-Stoff in a self-igniting hypergolic combination, and for the low-cost British Black Knight and Black Arrow launchers.|$|E

50|$|The LR87 was {{developed}} in the late 1950s by Aerojet. It was the first production rocket engine capable (in its various models) of burning the three most common liquid rocket propellant combinations: liquid oxygen/RP-1, nitrogen tetroxide/Aerozine 50 (a 50/50 mixture by mass of hydrazine and UDMH), and liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen. The engine operated on an open gas-generator cycle and utilized a <b>regenerative</b> <b>cooled</b> nozzle and combustion chamber. Later versions had additional ablative-cooled flanges. The LR87 served as a template for the LR-91, which was used in the second stage of the Titan missile.|$|R

40|$|At {{temperatures}} below 10 K, regenerative cycle cryocoolers {{are limited}} by regeneration losses in the helium working fluid which result from the decreasing heat capacity of the regenerating material and the increasing density of helium. Experiments examining several approaches to improving the low-temperature regeneration in a four-stage <b>regenerative</b> cycle <b>cooler</b> constructed primarily of fiberglass materials are discussed. Using an interchangeable fourth stage, the experiments included configurations with multiple regeneration passages, and a static helium volume for increased heat capacity.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{determine}} the influence of different phenomena on the heat load of a hydrogen/oxygen rocket combustion chamber into the adjacent <b>regenerative</b> <b>cooled</b> wall. The heat transfer in turbulent flow is a result of turbulent vortices and the heat conductivity of the fluid. The turbulent effects were represented by the q-omega Low-Reynolds turbulence model, while the gas mixture and real gas effects werde considered in the gas conductivity. With these models, the heat load was simulated by a fluid/structure interaction simulation in which only the energy equation was solved for the solid domain. In this investigation, the influence of three oxidizer/fuel-ratios (O/F) and three chamber pressures was analized with special focus on boundary layer effects in the resulting heat loads...|$|R

The first Soviet engines to employ the technique were Fridrikh Tsander's OR-2 tested in March 1933 and the ORM-50, bench tested in November 1933 by Valentin Glushko. The first German engine of this type was also tested in March 1933 by Klaus Riedel in the VfR. The Austrian scientist Eugen Sänger was particularly famous for experiments with engine cooling starting in 1933; however, most of his experimental engines were water-cooled or cooled by an extra circuit of propellant.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIndirect {{evaporative}} cooling is a sustainable method for cooling of air.

In this paper, a method is presented to produce air at a sub-wet bulb temperature by indirect {{evaporative cooling}}, without using a vapour compression machine. The main idea consists of manipulating the air flow inside the cooler by branching the working air from the product air, which is indirectly pre-cooled, before it is finally cooled and delivered.

40|$|Rocket {{combustion}} chambers {{are subject to}} extremely high thermal loads. To protect the chamber walls from these loads, an efficient cooling is necessary. As a highly effective cooling mechanism, transpiration cooling promises advantages over conventional <b>regenerative</b> and active <b>cooling</b> techniques like film cooling. In combination with porous ceramic matrix composites (CMC), longer durability due to low coefficient of thermal expansion, lower manufacturing costs and possible weight reductions are possible, all while retaining the performance of <b>regenerative</b> <b>cooled</b> {{combustion chambers}}. One parameter determining {{the effectiveness of this}} cooling mechanism, is the exhalation characteristic of the coolant from the porous surface. Measurements of this characteristic are shown for a carbon fibre reinforced carbon (C/C) and single free jets. For C/C it is shown, that possible defects like blocked pores or delaminations can be detected by measuring the dynamic pressure of the outflow. Furthermore, it is shown, that the exhalation characteristic for C/C is dependent on the through flow direction. The derivation of mass flow through the sample from these measurements reveals an quantitative overestimation of the velocity distribution. By simulating the measurement, it is shown, that one important aspect is the spatial integration of the measured values over the sensor area. But it is also shown, that this effect is not enough to explain the overestimation and additional effects need to be considered...|$|R
