5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web.

The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E

5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition {{to many in}} the Air Force. Most pilots switching to the A-10 {{did not want to}} because fighter pilots traditionally favored speed and appearance. In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10. In the FAC <b>role,</b> <b>the</b> OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|E

Its main opponents through 1940–41 were therefore lone RAF reconnaissance aircraft, the anti-shipping aircraft of RAF Coastal Command and the medium bombers of RAF Bomber Command's 2 Group, although the group would see little action compared to other theaters during 1941. During this time, this sector was considered relatively safe compared to other theaters.|$|E
