5|$|Although {{generally}} Earth's {{field is}} approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly {{aligned with the}} rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic <b>reversals</b> {{can be found in}} basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies. <b>Reversals</b> occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between <b>reversals</b> ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).|$|E

50|$|An Ohio State University study {{evaluating}} robotic tubal <b>reversal</b> vs abdominal tubal <b>reversal</b> discovered {{similar findings}} but also evaluated pregnancy outcomes. Robotic tubal <b>reversal</b> surgery, {{when compared to}} abdominal tubal <b>reversal</b> surgery, had longer operative times (201 minutes vs 155 minutes), shorter hospital stays (4 hours compared to 34 hours), and quicker return to activities of daily living. Pregnancy outcomes of robotic tubal <b>reversal</b> surgery patients were also compared to pregnancy outcome of abdominal incision tubal <b>reversal</b> patients. Approximately 65% of the robotic tubal <b>reversal</b> surgery patients became pregnant compared with 50% of the abdominal incision patients. Of the pregnancies, 6 abnormal pregnancies were in the robotic tubal <b>reversal</b> patients (4 ectopic and 2 miscarriage) and 2 were in the abdominal incision patients (1 ectopic and 1 miscarriage). Both surgeries were expensive and were found to cost in excess of $92,000. Robotic tubal <b>reversal</b> surgery was slightly more costly than the abdominal incision tubal <b>reversal.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although Mars has no {{evidence}} of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity <b>reversals</b> of its dipole field have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.|$|E
5|$|Biden's {{father had}} been very well-off earlier in his life, but {{suffered}} several business <b>reversals</b> {{by the time his}} son was born. For several years, the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans.

5|$|Brachiopod fossils show great {{diversity}} in the morphology of the shells and lophophore, while the modern genera show less diversity but provide soft-bodied characteristics. Both fossils and extant species have limitations that {{make it difficult to}} produce a comprehensive classification of brachiopods based on morphology. The phylum also has experienced significant convergent evolution and <b>reversals</b> (in which a more recent group seems to have lost a characteristic that is seen in an intermediate group, reverting to a characteristic last seen in an older group). Hence some brachiopod taxonomists believe it is premature to define higher levels of classification such as order, and recommend instead a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Grant was {{unsuccessful}} in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination {{for a third}} term. Facing severe investment <b>reversals</b> and dying of throat cancer, he wrote his memoirs, which {{proved to be a}} major critical and financial success. His death in 1885 prompted an outpouring in support of national unity. Historical assessments of Grant's legacy have varied considerably over the years. His popular reputation focuses on his drinking, which historians agree did not adversely affect his military campaigns. Early historical evaluations were mostly negative about Grant's presidency. Scholars continue to rank his presidency below the average, but modern appreciation for his support for civil rights has helped improve his standing.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} for President in 2000, but he lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early <b>reversals,</b> but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365–173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.|$|E

40|$|In finite {{ferromagnetic}} wires, the demagnetizing effects {{along the}} wire axis {{have a substantial}} influence on the <b>reversal</b> processes. By considering infinite wires, these effects are annihilated and only the sample dimensions, cross-sectional geometry, and material properties determine the magnetization <b>reversal.</b> The magnetization <b>reversal</b> is now initiated by small thermal fluctuations. With decreasing cross-sectional dimensions, three different <b>reversal</b> modes can be distinguished: <b>reversal</b> with (i) domain formation; (ii) vortex formation; and (iii) precessional switching combined with buckling. For different cross-sectional dimensions and lattice axes orientations, the 3 -D magnetization dynamics and evolution of the different micromagnetic energy terms are investigated, resulting in {{a clear understanding of}} the <b>reversal</b> modes...|$|R

5|$|There {{were some}} <b>reversals.</b> The {{attempts}} of English merchants {{to break through}} the Hanseatic league directly into the Baltic markets failed in the domestic political chaos of the Wars of the Roses in the 1460s and 1470s. The wine trade with Gascony fell by half during the war with France, and the eventual loss of the province brought an end to the English domination of the business and temporary disruption to Bristol's prosperity until wines began to be imported through the city a few years later. Indeed, the disruption to both the Baltic and the Gascon trade contributed to a sharp reduction in the consumption of furs and wine by the English gentry and nobility during the 15th century.|$|E

30|$|These unusual {{experimental}} {{results in the}} angular dependence of HC and χnorm could be consistently described {{taking into account the}} magnetization <b>reversal</b> that does not occur by a single magnetization <b>reversal</b> mechanism but by two different magnetization <b>reversal</b> mechanisms depending on the incidence angle α of the external magnetic field. The peak positions of χnorm suggest that magnetization <b>reversal</b> mechanism I is predominant for α[*]=[*] 0 ° and becomes less dominant with increasing α, while the dominance of mechanism II increases with increasing α. Therefore, the maximum in HC for α[*]=[*] 60 ° and α[*]=[*] 75 ° could be understood as the result of an interplay between the two magnetization <b>reversal</b> modes. The exact type of these magnetization <b>reversal</b> mechanisms could not be identified by the conducted hysteresis loop measurements. Nevertheless, one might speculate that these <b>reversal</b> modes are most probably the transversal and vortex magnetization <b>reversal</b> mode as found by micromagnetic simulations for Ni nanowires by Han et al.
