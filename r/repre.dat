However, in 2016, during the build up to Slovakia's first appearance at the European Championship, SFZ introduced a new nickname for the team. National team was given the nickname Slovenskí sokoli (Slovak falcons). U15 through to U21 national teams were given the nickname Slovenskí sokolíci (Slovak little falcons). Despite lack of immediate identification with the nickname by the fans, it went into usage during the tournament and the subsequent qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and is now often used, especially in the media, along with <b>Repre,</b> which still remains to be preferred in an informal conversation.|$|E

Playing in Ireland in a six-point match, despite creating better chances, Slovakia earned a goalless draw which kept both teams two points behind Russia, and leading Armenia by three. Four days later, however, Slovakia had its most disastrous performance in years: after creating chances in a goalless first half, Slovakia conceded four goals to Armenia in what effectively destroyed the team's confidence in securing a tournament spot. In the final two group matches, Slovakia was beaten at home by Russia (1-0) and drew 1-1 in Macedonia, finishing in a mediocre fourth-place position and scoring only seven goals in the entire process. Also, {{for the first time}} since Euro 1996 qualifying, Slovakia finished a qualifying campaign with a negative goal differential. As a result of this outcome, Vladimír Weiss left his job after four full years, being replaced by his assistants Michal Hipp and Stanislav Griga, although both themselves were later replaced due to poor results. By late June, former Czechoslovakia national team footballer Ján Kozák became the head coach and followed-up the unsuccessful qualification campaign with a victory in Bosnia and Herzegovina following by two defeats against Bosnia and one against Greece.For Euro 2016 qualification, Slovakia was drawn against Spain, Ukraine, Belarus, Macedonia and Luxembourg. Slovakia began the qualifying campaign with a 1-0 victory against Ukraine in Kiev. On 9 October 2014, Slovakia beat Spain 2-1 in a shock victory and claimed the first place. Slovakia's 3-1 victory over Belarus confirmed their status as group leaders. Later on, they won 2-0 against Macedonia in the Philip II Arena, Luxembourg with a score of 3-0 in Žilina, and Macedonia again with a score of 2-1 on 14 June 2015, also in Žilina. Till that day, Slovakia had six-straight wins in qualification. They were followed by expected defeat in Spain 0-2, goalless match against Ukraine and shocking home defeat 0-1 against Belarus. <b>Repre</b> finished qualification by defeating Luxembourg 4-2 and kept second place in qualification group and qualified to their first European Championship.|$|E

To be more precise, one deals with certain "wellbehaved " {{representations of the}} relations. There is no canonical way to define these well-behaved representations for a given set of relations, {{but in many cases}} a reasonable candidate for such a definition is easy to guess. For instance, it is quite natural to define the well-behaved representations of the relation ab Γ ba = for self-adjoint operators a and b by the requirement that a and b fulfill the Weyl relation e ita e isb = e its e isb e ita, t; s 2 R.

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{transfer system}} {{in machine translation}} maps between language structures and an intermediate representation. Our connectionist transfer system maps from f-structures of one language to f-structures of another language. It encodes the intermediate representation implicitly in neural networks' activation patterns. The system is learnable, therefore it does not need any effort in handcrafting the representation and mapping rules. Experiments show the system has good scalability and generalizability performance. 1 Introduction Most of the current machine translation systems adopt an indirect strategy that maps between languages and an intermediate representation. The interlingua model (Nirenburg et al 1987) uses a language-independent intermediate representation. Design of the representation requires crosslinguistic expertise. The intermediate representation in a transfer model (White 1987) is language-dependent. Its design is relatively easier. However, multiple such <b>repres</b> [...] ...|$|R

Our primary motivation has been to try to establish Kaplansky's conjecture that if a finite dimensional cosemisimple Hopf algebra H over an algebraically closed field contains a simple subcoalgebra of dimension n 2, then n divides the dimension of H. As a more direct attack on the problem has not been successful, we have been studying the problem from a general point of view.

40|$|Megakaryocytes and erythroid {{cells are}} thought to derive from a common progeni-tor during hematopoietic differentiation. Although a number of {{transcriptional}} regulators are important for this process, they do not explain the bipotential result. We now show by gain- and loss-of-function studies that erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF), a transcription factor whose role in erythroid gene regulation is well established, plays an unexpected directive role in the megakaryocyte lin-eage. EKLF inhibits the formation of megakaryocytes {{while at the same}} time stimulating erythroid differentiation. Quantitative examination of expression during hematopoiesis shows that, unlike genes whose presence is re-quired for establishment of both lineages, EKLF is uniquely down-regulated in megakaryocytes after formation of the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor. Ex-pression profiling and molecular analy-ses support these observations and sug-gest that megakaryocytic inhibition is achieved, at least in part, by EKLF <b>repres...</b>|$|R
