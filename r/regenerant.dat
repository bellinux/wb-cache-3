Phenotypic deviations from the donors were detected in foliage color, flower size, and cladode and flower morphology. Ploidy changes were observed in 37. 8 % of the 37 <b>regenerants</b> studied. Meiotic alterations in 12 out of 21 <b>regenerants</b> included laggards, dicentric bridges, micronuclei, restitution nuclei and polyads. Of the 408 AFLP markers screened in 43 <b>regenerants</b> and the donors, 2. 94 % showed polymorphism. High pollen viability was observed in the 22 <b>regenerants</b> analyzed. All crosses between one pistillate plant and 35 <b>regenerants,</b> {{as well as the}} controls, produced fruits and seeds; however, no plump seeds resulted in 35. 3 % of the crosses with <b>regenerants,</b> and no seeds germinated in 12. 5 % of those with apparently normal seeds.

A total of 40 <b>regenerants</b> and 5 donors (T 6 - 28 - 0, T 3 - 23 - 0, T 5 - 9 - 0, T 2 - 15 - 0 and D 7 - 4 - 0) {{were subjected to}} AFLP analysis using eight primer pairs. The results indicated that a total of 3805 scorable fragments were observed, of which 301 (9. 40 %) were polymorphic among the tested <b>regenerants</b> and donors probed with eight primer pairs. The percentage of polymorphic fragments within five donor groups averaged from 1. 6 % to 20. 6 %. Jaccard's similarity coefficients among <b>regenerants</b> and donors averaged from 0. 9508 to 0. 9935.

40|$|Background: Genetic and {{epigenetic}} changes (DNA methylation) {{were examined}} in the tissue-culture propagated interspecific potato somatic hybrids between dihaploid Solanum tuberosum and S. pinnatisectum. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) were applied to detect the genetic and epigenetic changes, respectively in the somatic hybrids mother plants (1 st cycle) and their <b>regenerants</b> (30 th cycles sub-cultured). Results: To detect genetic changes, eight AFLP primer combinations yielded a total of 329 scorable bands of which 49 bands were polymorphic in both mother plants and <b>regenerants.</b> None of the scorable bands were observed in term of loss of original band of mother plant or gain of novel band in their <b>regenerants.</b> AFLP profiles and their cluster analysis based on the Jaccard&# 8217;s similarity coefficient revealed 100 % genetic similarity among the mother plant and their <b>regenerants.</b> On the other hand, to analyze epigenetic changes, eight MSAP primer pair combinations detected a few DNA methylation patterns in the mother plants (0 to 3. 4 %) and their <b>regenerants</b> (3. 2 to 8. 5 %). Out of total 2320 MSAP sites in the mother plants, 2287 (98. 6 %) unmethylated, 21 (0. 9 %) fully methylated and 12 (0. 5 %) hemi-methylated, and out of total 2494 MSAP sites in their <b>regenerants,</b> 2357 (94. 5 %) unmethylated, 79 (3. 1 %) fully methylated and 58 (2. 3 %) hemi-methylated sites were amplified.

ResultsTwenty tested ISSR primers provided a total of 7848 bands in 60 in vitro <b>regenerants</b> and control plant. The number of bands for each primer varied from 3 to 10, and an average of 6. 95 bands was obtained per ISSR primer. Eight primers were polymorphic and generated 10 polymorphic bands with 7. 19 % mean polymorphism. ISSR analysis revealed genetic variability in 6 plants under study.
