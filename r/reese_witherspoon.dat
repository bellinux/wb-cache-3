500|$|In 2004, {{actress and}} singer Kristin Chenoweth was {{originally}} {{cast as the}} voice of Rapunzel while the film was still titled Rapunzel Unbraided under Keane's direction. Chenoweth, who had already begun recording dialogue for the role, said of her character at the time, [...] "I am Rapunzel, but Rapunzel is a squirrel ... and I'm going to let down my tail." [...] At one point, Disney had cast actress <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon</b> as Rapunzel. Additionally, Witherspoon was also intended to serve as an executive producer on the film, but eventually exited the project for unknown reasons but has been suggested as creative differences. Following Witherspoon's resignation, Rapunzel remained uncast for quite some time, further jeopardizing the film's already troubled production, a period during which the character's voice was temporarily provided by [...] "friends around the studio" [...] in lieu of legitimate actresses.|$|E

[...] {{and that she would}} rather shave her head than have to wear {{it for the rest of}} her life.

500|$|Executive {{producer}} John Lasseter {{explained that}} [...] "The challenge {{is that you}} want to make Rapunzel feel like a smart, clever, educated, healthy, fun human being" [...] {{despite the fact that the}} character has not ventured outside of her tower in 18 years. To avoid creating a [...] "princessy and aloof" [...] heroine, the animators decided to base Rapunzel's personality on actresses <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon,</b> Natalie Portman, and Amy Poehler, which ultimately resulted in the character having a variety of [...] "quirky qualities" [...] that were used to [...] "shake up expectations of what a princess should be." [...] According to The New York Times, Rapunzel's personality made her a significant departure from traditional Disney heroines. Mandy Moore believes that Rapunzel is an atypical Disney princess because she is an independent character who [...] "can take care of herself", in addition to being largely oblivious to the fact that she is a princess.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{retained}} {{the names of}} the real-life protagonists, though several supporting characters were composites of people and types of people from the era. Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins; five actresses campaigned for the role, including <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon</b> and Hilary Swank. Howard and Grazer suggested Jolie; Eastwood agreed, believing that her face fit the period setting. Jolie joined the production in [...] She was initially reluctant because, as a mother, she found the subject matter distressing. She said she was persuaded by Eastwood's involvement, and the screenplay's depiction of Collins as someone who recovered from adversity and had the strength to fight the odds. Jolie found playing Collins very emotional. She said the most difficult part was relating to the character, because Collins was relatively passive. Jolie ultimately based her performance on her own mother, who died in 2007. For scenes at the telephone exchange, Jolie learned to roller skate in high heels, a documented practice of the period.|$|E
500|$|The initial script of Enchanted, {{written by}} Bill Kelly, {{was bought by}} Disney's Touchstone Pictures and Sonnenfeld/Josephson Productions for a {{reported}} sum of $450,000 in September 1997. However, it {{was thought to be}} unsuitable for Walt Disney Pictures because it was [...] "a racier R-rated movie". To the frustration of Kelly, the screenplay was rewritten several times, first by Rita Hsiao and then by Todd Alcott. The film was initially scheduled to be released in 2002 with Rob Marshall as director but he withdrew due to [...] "creative differences" [...] between the producers and him. In 2001, director Jon Turteltaub was set to direct the film but he left soon after, later working with Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer on the National Treasure franchise. Adam Shankman became the film's director in 2003, while Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle were hired by Disney to rewrite the script once again. At the time, Disney considered offering the role of Giselle to Kate Hudson or <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon.</b> However, the project did not take off.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Gyllenhaal {{starred in}} David Fincher's mystery thriller Zodiac, {{which was based}} on a true story. He played Robert Graysmith, a San Francisco Chronicle {{political}} cartoonist. In preparation for his role, Gyllenhaal met Graysmith, and videotaped him to study his mannerisms and behavior. Gyllenhaal starred opposite Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon</b> in the October 2007 release Rendition, a Gavin Hood-directed political thriller about the U.S. policy of extraordinary rendition. In 2009, he appeared with Tobey Maguire in Jim Sheridan's remake of Susanne Bier's 2004 Danish language film Brothers. In 2008, it was announced that Gyllenhaal would star in the comedy Nailed, which he filmed in South Carolina with Jessica Biel, as well as Doug Liman's as yet untitled film about the race for lunar colonization. The following year, Gyllenhaal played the lead role in the [...] of the video game , produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and released by Disney on May 28, 2010, and in the romantic comedy [...] Love & Other Drugs, released on November 24, 2010, for which he received a Golden Globe Award nomination.|$|E
500|$|Between 1998 and 2000, Sevigny {{moved back}} to Connecticut {{to live with her}} mother, and {{appeared}} as a lesbian in the Emmy Award-winning television movie If These Walls Could Talk 2 (2000), the sequel to the HBO television drama-film If These Walls Could Talk (1996). Sevigny reportedly took the role in the film in order to help pay her mother's mortgage payment, and has credited it as the only film she ever made for financial benefit. Following this appearance, Sevigny was approached for a supporting role in the 2001 comedy Legally Blonde alongside <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon</b> and offered $500,000; she declined and the role was given to Selma Blair. Instead, she starred in Olivier Assayas' French techno thriller Demonlover (2002) alongside Connie Nielsen, for which she was required to learn her lines in French. Sevigny described shooting the film as [...] "strange", in the sense that director Assayas hardly spoke to her during the filming, which she said was difficult {{because of the lack of}} [...] "input". After spending nearly three months in France to complete Demonlover, Sevigny returned to New York to film the Club Kids biopic, Party Monster (2003); coincidentally, Sevigny in fact knew several of the people depicted in the film (Michael Alig and James St. James included), whom she had met during her frequent trips to New York City's club scene as a teenager.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Witherspoon {{starred in}} Vanity Fair, {{adapted from the}} 19th-century classic novel Vanity Fair and {{directed}} by Mira Nair. Her character, Becky Sharp, is a poor woman with a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was carefully costumed to conceal that during the filming {{she was pregnant with}} her second child. This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work as Witherspoon believed the gestation had in fact helped her portrayal of Sharp's character: [...] "I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom—it gave me much more to play with", she said. The film and Witherspoon's portrayal of Sharp received mixed reviews, as The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Nair's cast is splendid. Witherspoon does justice to the juicy role by giving the part more buoyancy than naughtiness." [...] At the same time, The Charlotte Observer called her work [...] "an excellent performance that's soft around the edges" [...] and the Los Angeles Times concluded that Becky is [...] "a role <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon</b> was born to play". However, LA Weekly wrote [...] " [...] ends up conveying so little of what’s at once appalling and perversely attractive about the would-be mistress of Vanity Fair" [...] and states that it may have to do with Witherspoon's vanity, [...] "with an Oscar-less young star’s need to be loved more than anyone could conceivably love the “real” Becky Sharp.". Others have stated she was miscast.|$|E
500|$|Following that, {{he played}} Irish {{attorney}} Tom Lefroy and love-interest to Jane Austen in Becoming Jane, a 2007 historical movie {{inspired by the}} author's early life. Next up was Penelope, which premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival. Also starring co-producer <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon,</b> it generated polarised reviews. The breakthrough role in McAvoy's career came in Atonement, Joe Wright's 2007 adaption of Ian McEwan's novel of the same title. A romantic war film, it focuses on lovers Cecilia and Robbie's (Keira Knightley and McAvoy) lives being torn apart after her jealous younger sister, Briony (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses him of rape. Upon reading the script, McAvoy said he thought [...] "If I don't get the part I'm not reading the book because it'll be devastating. It's an amazing role and I really wanted it." [...] McAvoy has called the film [...] "incredibly sad" [...] but considers it an uplifting experience. He also shared that he hoped viewers will be left [...] "absolutely devastated and harrowed." [...] Screenings of Atonement were held at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, where {{it was one of}} the most acclaimed films present, and Venice Film Festival. Atonement was a big awards contender; it was nominated for fourteen BAFTAs and seven Academy Awards. Both McAvoy and Knightley were nominated for their performances at the 65th Golden Globe Awards, respectively. Additionally, the film was lauded by critics, with Metacritic reporting it to have an approval rating of 85. The Hollywood Reporter writer Ray Bennett said the duo gave [...] "compelling and charismatic performances".|$|E
500|$|His next film, {{entitled}} How Do You Know, {{was released}} December 17, 2010; Brooks produced, directed and wrote it. The film stars <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon</b> {{as a professional}} softball player involved in a love triangle. Brooks began work on the film in 2005, wishing to create a film about a young female athlete. While interviewing numerous women for hundreds of hours in his research for the film he also became interested in [...] "the dilemmas of contemporary business executives, who are sometimes held accountable by the law for corporate behavior of which they {{may not even be}} aware." [...] He created Paul Rudd and Jack Nicholson's characters for this concept. Filming finished in November 2009, although Brooks later reshot the film's opening and ending. The New York Times described it as [...] "perhaps the most closely guarded of Columbia's movies this year." [...] Brooks was paid $10 million for the project, which cost $100 million. The film was negatively received. Patrick Goldstein wrote in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "the characters were stick figures, the jokes were flat, the situations felt scarily insular." [...] He felt the film showed Brooks had [...] "finally lost his comic mojo" [...] concluding [...] "his films used to have a wonderfully restless, neurotic energy, but How Do You Know feels like it was phoned in from someone resting uncomfortably on his laurels." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge also felt the film showed Brooks had lost his [...] "spark". Richard Corliss of Time was more positive, writing [...] "without being great, it's still the flat-out finest romantic comedy of the year," [...] while [...] "Brooks hasn't lost his gift for dreaming up heroes and heroines who worry amusingly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{beginning}} of the episode shows the Simpsons being chased by Olympic employees. The scene was included because the staff knew that the episode would air during the 2002 Winter Olympics. In order to avoid a lawsuit from the International Olympic Committee, the animators slightly altered {{the design of the}} Olympic rings, which can be seen on Olympic employees' helicopters. At one point in the episode, the Simpsons visit the Springfield Preparatory School fair, where Lisa notices how much more developed the school is in comparison to Springfield Elementary School. Jealous, Springfield Elementary principal Skinner breaks in and steals some school equipment. Shocked, Lisa asks Skinner why he stole the equipment, to which he replies [...] "welcome to Dick Cheney's America". Originally, he would say [...] "welcome to George W. Bush's America", but because none of the series' regular cast members could do an impression of him, and because the staff found it to be in bad taste, they decided to change it. When Lisa scolds Bart for being oblivious to Greta's feelings, he replies [...] "Hey, I didn't lead her on. I always played it light and breezy." [...] The line was written by Frink and, according to Selman, it became very popular with the staff writers, having [...] "stayed with [...] for years". The song that plays while the Simpsons visit the Skydome in Toronto is [...] "Take Off" [...] by the fictional comedy duo Bob and Doug McKenzie, the chorus of which was sung by Geddy Lee, the lead vocalist and bassist of the Canadian rock band Rush. The episode features American actress <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon</b> as Rainier Wolfcastle's daughter, Greta. Jean stated that Witherspoon was [...] "brilliant", and noted that she was [...] "very young-looking". The episode also features Austrian-American celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck as himself.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV's Monique Steele, Kim Possible is [...] "all {{about how}} girls kick butt"; Kim {{constantly}} rescues Ron, saving him from peril {{on numerous occasions}} throughout the series. Writing for Wewomen.com, Carla Cain Walther observed that the series [...] "scoffed at the 'damsel in distress' trope used in action films" [...] by having Kim save Ron [...] "using her ingenuity and strength", reinforcing the idea that girls are capable of helping themselves. Identifying Kim as a postfeminist heroine because she is intelligent {{in addition to being}} [...] "shaped like Barbie" [...] and having a male assistant similar to female executives, The New York Times Julie Salamon joked that [...] "Kim's job seems to be making the world safe for cheerleaders again, following the path forged by <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon</b> in Legally Blonde on behalf of sorority girls." [...] Tor.com's Sarah Gailey observed that while Shego proudly spends much of her time lounging poolside and deciding what she does and does not want to do, Kim is forced [...] "to leap into action regardless of whether she's tired or sad or sick or, heaven forbid, too busy". Bustles Sarah Freymiller wrote that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype", citing cheerleading as an outlet the character chooses willingly. Kim is not a tomboy; Julia Pugachevsky of BuzzFeed credits the series with [...] "show that you could be traditionally feminine and strong at the same time." [...] Conversely, Geek Chic: Smart Women in Popular Culture author S. Inness argued that Kim Possible reinforces that [...] "girls can do anything they choose" [...] but must look a certain way in order to do so since its female character participate in consumerism and normative femininity that its male characters do not, such as shopping and spending much time on their appearance. Inness also felt that show's feminist potential is compromised by the fact that Kim mostly surrounds herself with male companions as opposed to female, [...] "contradict the messages of female solidarity".|$|E
500|$|In April 2008, Empire {{reported}} that the actor and Goldberg would write an episode for the animated television series The Simpsons. He also voiced a character in the episode, entitled [...] "Homer the Whopper", which opened the twenty-first season. Kevin Smith's romantic comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno rounded out 2008 for the actor. He and Elizabeth Banks portrayed the title roles: Pennsylvania roommates who try to make some extra cash by making an adult film together. After having difficulty trying to secure an R rating, Rogen commented to MTV, [...] "It's a really filthy movie," [...] but complained, [...] "It's really crazy to me that Hostel is fine, with people gouging their eyes out and shit like that... But you can't show two people having sex – that's too much". The picture was distributed on Halloween by The Weinstein Company and disappointed at the box office. Along with <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon,</b> he voiced a character in the animated science fiction Monsters vs Aliens (2009), which did well commercially, {{with a total of}} $381.5million. He then starred in the Jody Hill-directed mall cop comedy Observe and Report, in which he portrayed bipolar mall security guard Ronnie Barnhart. The film opened in theatres on April 10. Critics noted a departure in Rogen's acting style from playing laid-back roles to playing a more sadistic character; Wesley Morris from The Boston Globe opined that [...] "Often with Rogen, his vulnerability makes his coarseness safe...Ronnie is something altogether new for Rogen. Vulnerability never arrives. He's shameless." [...] Later in 2009, Rogen starred in Apatow's third directorial feature, Funny People, with Adam Sandler. Rogen played a young, inexperienced comic while Sandler played a mentor of sorts to his character; the film had more dramatic elements in it than Apatow's previous efforts. Funny People was a commercial failure, coming short of its $75million budget, but has a [...] "fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes.|$|E
500|$|Scream was {{a turning}} point in terms of casting for the horror genre, which {{normally}} involved relatively unknown actors. The genre was considered unsuitable for bigger names as the films had lower budgets and often attained negative critical response. Drew Barrymore read the script and was interested in being involved. She approached the production team herself to request a role. Barrymore, a member of the Barrymore family of actors and granddaughter of actor John Barrymore, had become a star in her own right following her appearance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). The producers were quick to take advantage of her unexpected interest, and signed her to play the lead role of Sidney Prescott. [...] Her involvement was believed to be instrumental in attracting other popular actors to the film in spite of its smaller budget, and in causing Craven to reconsider his decision to direct the film. [...] Before filming began, Barrymore was faced with unexpected commitments that meant she would no longer be available to play the demanding lead role. She instead played the smaller role of Casey Becker, which allowed her to remain involved and still gave the production the advantage of her stature. Killing off one of their biggest stars early in the film was considered a calculated risk, but it was believed that it would be so shocking and unexpected that the audience would then believe that any character could die. Actresses including Alicia Witt and Brittany Murphy auditioned for the lead role of Sidney; the producers also approached <b>Reese</b> <b>Witherspoon,</b> though she never auditioned. Craven had seen Neve Campbell in the TV show Party of Five and asked her to audition for the part. He believed she could portray a character who was [...] "innocent", but who could also realistically handle herself while dealing with the physical conflict and emotions required by the role. Campbell was initially reluctant to perform in another horror film so soon after her supporting role in The Craft. After a successful audition, Campbell accepted an offer to play the lead character. She accepted because Scream would be her first leading role, and because she adored the character, saying [...] "She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie." ...|$|E
