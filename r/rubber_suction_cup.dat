40|$|Porous cups {{are widely}} used to extract soil {{solution}} for monitoring solute transport; however, {{it is not always}} clear how soil heterogeneity influences solute breakthrough sampled by <b>suction</b> <b>cups.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of soil heterogeneity on the breakthrough of solute extracted by <b>suction</b> <b>cups.</b> We conducted numerical simulations using the HYDRUS- 2 D code. Local-scale heterogeneity in hydraulic properties was generated using Miller-Miller scaling theory. Results of the simulations show that effective transport parameters derived from the measured breakthrough curves in the <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> depended on the location of the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> in the heterogeneous flow field. Mean pore water velocities obtained from <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> measurements ranged by a factor of 1. 6 and dispersivities by a factor of 1. 5 for the different heterogeneous structures. As a consequence, the arrival time (first moment) of the tracer plume derived from <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> measurements was accelerated or delayed compared with the homogeneous case. Mass recoveries and <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> sampling areas were also influenced by the underlying structure. The applied <b>suction</b> in the <b>cup</b> as well as the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> sampling area were found to have important effects on the mean pore water velocity, dispersivity, and mass recovery. The effect of variation in applied suction was analyzed using reference point data taken from 10 locations in the undisturbed flow field. Contrary to the general assumption that solute spreading measured with <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> depends only on the mean pore water velocity, our results show that solute spreading is also influenced by (i) the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> sampling area and the deformation of streamlines to the cup, and (ii) the flow channels that are sampled. The numerical simulations indicate that the number of <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> required for calculating a mean breakthrough curve in the chosen heterogeneous flow field must to be > 20...|$|R

40|$|For safety reasons, to {{preserve}} a proper appearance and to ensure a long life cycle, facades have to be maintained regularly. Until now, this {{has been done by}} human workers. However, due to overhangs and structurally weak facades, work on outer facades can be a difficult and dangerous job. Thus there is a high potential for the deployment of autonomous or remote controlled facade climbing robots. But for a facility management provider such a robot only becomes interesting if it is usable across a large number of buildings. In this context free climbing robots are the most appropriate system for an all-purpose deployment. The majority of existing free climbing robots use <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> for attachment, which are actively provided with vacuum by an extra vacuum generator. In this context passively operated <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> have the advantage that the attaching force is generated simply by mechanically pressing the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> onto the surface. In the scope of this work it is shown that the weight and the complexity of the robot system can be reduced and thus the flexibility of deployment and the reliability of free climbing robots could be increased by using passively operated <b>suction</b> <b>cups.</b> The chosen system for a free climbing robot with passively operated <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> utilises the caterpillar principle for propulsion. In order to produce suitable pressure at the front <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> a specific attach system for <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> suspension has been developed in this work. To calculate the characteristic forces for this climbing system that affect the <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> the necessary mathematical process has been developed and design rules for the minimization of these forces has been derived. The sheer load has been identified as being the critical load to the <b>suction</b> <b>cups.</b> Thus the focus of this work was the development of a mathematical model for the determination of the elastic and failure behaviour of passively operated <b>suction</b> <b>cups.</b> These forces cause slippage and thus the elastic and failure behavior of the <b>suction</b> <b>cups.</b> The mathematical model for simulating the determination of the coherence between sheer forces and slippage drift {{as a function of the}} normal force has been worked out on the basis of the finite element method, and has been verified by tests. Therefore a two dimensional friction model has been developed and a new parameter to consider material expansion in the normal direction has been introduced. In an exemplary test series it has been verified that the model reproduces real conditions to an adequate accuracy. For practical use this basic system can be used for the dimensioning of passively operated <b>suctions</b> <b>cups</b> and thus for the dimensioning of climbing robots for glass facades. On the basis of this knowledge a prototype for a free climbing and autonomous robot for glass facades has been built and tested. The tests have been carried out on the functionality of the new climbing mechanism on the basis of a caterpillar with passively operated <b>suction</b> <b>cups,</b> and of the behaviour of the <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> with different loads and different patterns of <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> arrangements. The functionality of the climbing mechanism has been proven. Important knowledge for the optimisation of the climbing mechanism has been obtained from the interpretation of the behaviour of the <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> during the testing in comparison with the results of the mathematical model...|$|R

40|$|Both the {{bioavailability}} of a trace metal (TM) in a {{soil and}} the risk of leaching to the ground water are linked to the metals concentra-tion in the soil solution. Sampling soil solution by tension lysimetry with <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> is a simple and established technique that is increas-ingly used for monitoring dissolved TM in soils. Of major concern, however, is the sorption of TM by the walls of the samplers. Metal sorption by different materials used in <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> can vary widely, depending also on the chemistry of the soil solution. We compared the sorption of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb by different standard-size and micro <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> in the laboratory at two pH values (4. 5 and 7. 5 or 8. 0) in absence and presence of dissolved organic carbon (DOC).

40|$|Porous cups {{are widely}} used to extract soil water for {{monitoring}} solute transport. However, {{it is not yet}} clear how the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> influences the matric potential in the surrounding soil and which part of the soil is sampled. This research was designed to numerically evaluate the activity domain, the extraction domain, and sampling area of a <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> under constant infiltration. A finite- element model (HYDRUS- 2 D) was used to simulate the effect of various applied suctions at two infiltration rates on the water status in three soils (clay loam, sandy clay, and sand). Particle tracking was used to track the streamlines that define the sampling area and extraction of the <b>suction</b> <b>cup.</b> In general, the activity domain, the extracdomain, and sampling area of the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> depend primarily on the soil hydraulic parameters and the upper boundary, and secondarily on the applied suction. Results showed that the activity domain, the extraction domain, and the sampling area are largest for highest ambient hydraulic conductivities. The activity domain and the sampling area also decrease with increasing infiltration rates. Further, the activity domain of the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> depends strongly on the duration of water extraction. Soil heterogeneity seems to play a minor role with respect to the activity domain and sampling area of the cup...|$|R
