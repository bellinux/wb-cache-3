500|$|Sugar beet {{became a}} major source of sugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became available. It is a {{biennial}} plant, a cultivated variety of Beta vulgaris in the family Amaranthaceae, the tuberous root of which contains a high proportion of sucrose. It is cultivated as a root crop in temperate regions with adequate rainfall and requires a fertile soil. The crop is harvested mechanically in the autumn and the crown of leaves and excess soil removed. The roots do not deteriorate rapidly and may be left in a clamp in the field for some weeks before being transported to the processing plant. Here the crop is washed and sliced and the sugar extracted by diffusion. Milk of lime is added to the <b>raw</b> <b>juice</b> [...] and carbonatated in a number of stages in order to purify it. Water is evaporated by boiling the syrup under a vacuum. The syrup is then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals. The white sugar that crystallizes out can be separated in a centrifuge and dried.

5000|$|Diffusers {{are long}} vessels of many metres {{in which the}} beet slices go in one {{direction}} while hot water goes in the opposite direction. The movement may either {{be caused by a}} rotating screw or the whole rotating unit, and the water and cossettes move through internal chambers. The three common designs of diffuser are the horizontal rotating 'RT' (Raffinerie Tirlemontoise, manufacturer), inclined screw 'DDS' (De Danske Sukkerfabrikker), or vertical screw [...] "Tower". Modern tower extraction plants have a processing capacity of up to 17,000 t per day. A less-common design uses a moving belt of cossettes, with water pumped onto the top of the belt and poured through. In all cases, the flow rates of cossettes and water are in the ratio one to two. Typically, cossettes take about 90 minutes to pass through the diffuser, the water only 45 minutes. These countercurrent exchange methods extract more sugar from the cossettes using less water than if they merely sat in a hot water tank. The liquid exiting the diffuser is called <b>raw</b> <b>juice.</b> The colour of <b>raw</b> <b>juice</b> varies from black to a dark red depending on the amount of oxidation, which is itself dependent on diffuser design.|$|E

50|$|Carbonatation is a {{procedure}} which removes impurities from <b>raw</b> <b>juice</b> before it undergoes crystallization. First, the juice {{is mixed with}} hot milk of lime (a suspension of calcium hydroxide in water).

In addition, the alkaline conditions convert the simple sugars, glucose and fructose, along with the amino acid glutamine, to chemically stable carboxylic acids.

We performed a cohort study among Taiwanese with eosinophilic meningitis who drank <b>raw</b> vegetable <b>juice</b> within three months of the onset of the outbreak. Clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and outcomes were prospectively followed. Five native Taiwanese met the case definition of eosinophilic meningitis. Specific antibodies to A. cantonensis were detected in the serum of five of the patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of four of the patients. Central nervous system manifestations included headache (n 5 [100 %]), Brudzinskiâ€™s sign/stiff neck (n 5 [100 %]), hyperesthesia/ paresthesias (n 5 [100 %]), and cranial nerve palsy (n 1 [20 %]). Laboratory findings included peripheral (n 5 [100 %]) and CSF eosinophilia (n 4 [80 %]), transient increases in the white blood cell count (n 1 [20 %]), and in serum levels of creatine kinase (n 1 [20 %]). Meningeal enhancement, as well as high signal intensity, at the subcortical white matter on T 2 weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images were observed on magnetic resonance imaging in four patients.
