This paper proposes a method for evaluating how water is reallocated within the economy in response to changes in final demand and changes <b>in</b> the <b>technical</b> water needs of activities and consumers. The empirical application, which is for the Catalan economy, shows important asymmetries in the effects that exogenous inflows and changes <b>in</b> water <b>technical</b> <b>requirements</b> cause on water reallocation. In the process of water distribution, exogenous inflows mostly benefit agriculture and damage private consumers. On the other hand, increases <b>in</b> <b>technical</b> water <b>requirements</b> have negative effects on agriculture and positive effects on the other production activities. The results of the study suggest that agriculture is an important activity {{not only in terms of}} water distribution but also in terms of water reallocation due to changes in final demand and technical water needs.

The authors undertook a study to determine the technical, regulatory and jurisdictional considerations unique to the operation of toxic or hazardous waste facilities on Indian trust land. Technical considerations were researched through interviews and review of public law information provided by the EPA Region IX Office, and the School of Public Health at San Diego State University. Jurisdictional and regulatory issues were researched through EPA, the LEXIS and NEXIS data base systems of Mead Data Central and consultations with Indian law attorneys. Results indicate that the trust status of tribes may result in direct enforcement,of the Toxic Substance Control Act by the federal government through EPA in the stead of delegated enforcement through the State Dept. of Health Services.
