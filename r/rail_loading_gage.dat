5000|$|More than {{a decade}} after Kand√≥'s death two new, shaft-driven prototypes of his design were built by the Ganz company, to allow for 125 km/h {{traction}} speeds. The V44 electric locomotives [...] proved too heavy for general use, owing to their 22 metric ton per axle <b>rail</b> <b>load.</b> Both vehicles were eventually destroyed in USAAF bombing raids in 1944, running only 16,000 kilometers overall.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{physical}} {{freight and passenger}} <b>rail</b> <b>loading,</b> Brighton Park carries a heavy amount of traffic, approximately 3.5 trains every hour (as of the year 2009.)

40|$|Determination of the {{interaction}} forces between wheel and rail of railway vehicles is essential for assessment of the vehicle dynamic characteristics from {{point of view of}} running safety and <b>rail</b> <b>loading</b> as well as for approval the vehicle and alignment them to the Technical Specification for Interoperability. The direct measurement of transverse and vertical interaction forces using the existing full-disk wheel is practical impossible due to the impossibility of separating the two types of forces. To avoid this impediment it was realized a measuring wheelset fitted with 12 spokes achieved as force transducers for measurement of the vertical forces and 12 spokes achieved as force transducers for measurement of the transverse forces. The measuring wheelset was calibrated as a force transducer and was used to determine the wheel and rail interaction forces for LE-MA 6000 kW electric locomotive made by Softronic Craiova. The article presents the measuring wheelset, the calibration principle and the calibration characteristics as well as some time history of the main parameters which characterize the running safety and <b>rail</b> <b>loading,</b> determined in the on-track tests...|$|R

50|$|A rotary car dumper or wagon tippler (UK) is a {{mechanism}} used for unloading certain railroad cars such as hopper cars, gondolas or lorries (tipplers, UK). It holds the rail {{car to a}} section of track and rotates the track and car together to dump out the contents. Used with gondola cars, it is making open hopper cars obsolete. Because hopper cars require sloped chutes in order to direct the contents to the bottom dump doors (hatches) for unloading, gondola cars allow cars to be shorter, thus lowering their center of gravity, while carrying the same gross <b>rail</b> <b>load.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Surface cracks arising during rolling {{sliding contact}} of a wheel and a rail are investigated. A {{two-dimensional}} crack model is proposed which calculates the crack driving force using the configurational force concept. The numerical {{applicability of the}} configurational force concept for surface shear cracks under cyclic contact loading is discussed and compared to the J-integral concept. A single inclined crack in a <b>rail</b> <b>loaded</b> by an accelerated wheel is investigated. The material of the rail is described by a cyclic plastic kinematic hardening model. The evolution of the crack driving force during several cycles is investigated...|$|R

2500|$|In 1959, when 85ft flat cars {{capable of}} {{carrying}} two 40-foot highway trailers in trailer-on-flat-car (TOFC), or [...] "piggyback" [...] service were introduced, new automobiles began to be shipped by <b>rail</b> <b>loaded</b> on highway auto-carrier trailers. Eight to ten autos could be carried per flat car in this manner. By 1960 several U.S. railroads were handling new automobiles in this way, including the CB, C, CRIP, D, D, ERIE/EL, GN, KCS, L, MILW, MKT, MP/TP, NP, SL-SF, SP, SSW, WAB and UP. The New York Central, which used the Flexi-Van system of transporting only the highway trailer body without the wheel assembly, developed a Flexi-Van automobile carrier rack.|$|R
40|$|Techniques are {{developed}} {{for the design of}} discrete highly distributed sensor systems for use in intelligent structures. First the functional requirements for such a system are presented. Discrete spatially averaging strain sensors are then identified as satisfying the functional requirements. A variety of spatial weightings for spatially averaging sensors are examined, and their wave number characteristics are determined. Preferable spatial weightings are identified. Several numerical integration rules used to integrate such sensors {{in order to determine the}} global deflection of the structure are discussed. A numerical simulation is conducted using point and rectangular sensors mounted on a cantilevered beam under static <b>loading.</b> <b>Gage</b> factor and sensor position uncertainties are incorporated to assess the absolute error and standard deviation of the error in the estimated tip displacement found by numerically integrating the sensor outputs. An experiment is carried out using a statically loaded cantilevered beam with five point sensors. It is found that in most cases the actual experimental error is within one standard deviation of the absolute error as found in the numerical simulation...|$|R
50|$|In September 2008 it was {{announced}} that freight traffic would restart using the line, with operator El Zorro signing a multi-million deal with miner Iluka Resources to carry containerised mineral sands from Portland in the south-west to Melbourne, with Iluka saying rail transport was cheaper than road. The train continues to run today on an irregular basis. In March 2010 the State Government announced a $3.97 million grant {{for the construction of a}} <b>rail</b> <b>loading</b> facility alongside the Iluka Resources mineral sand separation plant (near Hamilton railway station) for the rail transport of heavy mineral concentrate extracted from the Iluka mine site at Ouyen via the standard gauge Murtoa - Hopetoun railway.|$|R
50|$|Several {{proposal}} {{have been}} made for the modernization of line, proposing alternately either switching the line to standard tram rolling stock and eventually integrating with the Warsaw Tramway system or rebuilding the line to standard <b>rail</b> <b>loading</b> gauge and converting to 3 kV electrification system in order to integrate it with the national rail network. Additionally plans have been prepared for moving the final station of the line in Warsaw to Rondo Dmowskiego at Marsza≈Çkowska Street {{in order to facilitate}} easier transfers to the Centrum station on the city's first metro line and to build the line between Komor√≥w and Nadarzyn, however as of 2011 no funds have been allocated towards any of those.|$|R
50|$|Seatrain Lines, the {{operating}} {{name for the}} Over-Seas Shipping Company, began intermodal container shipping by using entire <b>loaded</b> <b>rail</b> cars between ports in the United States and Havana, Cuba, with the first shipment in December 1928 aboard a specially designed ship, Seatrain.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{medium-term}} market equilibrium {{model of the}} North American crude oil sector via which we develop a scenario analysis to investigate strategies to mitigate the environmental and public-safety risks from crude-by-rail transportation across the United States. The model captures crude oil movements across rail- roads, pipelines and waterways, while distinguishing between light and heavy crude qualities. We find that restricting <b>rail</b> <b>loads</b> or increasing pipeline capacity from areas driving production will significantly reduce rail movements. However, lifting the United States crude oil export ban in isolation will only increase rail transportation volumes. We show that an integrated policy of targeted rail caps, pipeline investments and lifting the export ban sustainably addresses medium-term crude-by-rail risks in the United States...|$|R
50|$|The Transnet Freight <b>Rail</b> <b>loading</b> gauge {{specification}} {{which had}} been submitted during the tender phase when only the Euro Dual electro-diesel locomotive was being considered in {{the scope of the}} contract, was one which made special allowance for the pantographs on electric locomotives to exceed the actual maximum height of 3965 mm. The loading gauge specification for diesel-electric locomotives and other rail vehicles, specifying a maximum height of 3965 mm above the railhead, was submitted to the manufacturer in October 2013 after the locomotive design was completed. The two loading gauge versions are identical in respect of roof profile and height, and differ only in respect of the special provision for the pantographs on electric locomotives to exceed the prescribed maximum height.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the 1991 route was updated - Sloane Square {{was dropped}} and the Central line's Epping branch from Leytonstone was re-safeguarded. Due to {{objections}} from residents of Sloane Square, it was reinstated the following year. South West Trains' Wimbledon depot was safeguarded as a depot for the line. The safeguarding was enlarged from tube gauge to Network <b>Rail</b> <b>loading</b> gauge {{as it became}} clear that larger and longer trains would be needed. Of the three routes proposed for south-west London the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea initially favoured one going south via Imperial Wharf to Clapham Junction, but now supports the takeover of the District line's Wimbledon branch. Under these present plans, only one entirely new station would be constructed, at Chelsea.|$|R
25|$|Along the {{railroad}} tracks through Scales Mound are five properties, four of them historic in nature. There are two shed/pump houses, both dating from c. 1910‚Äì40. One is a gable roof building with a concrete foundation and the other has a flat roof and metal siding. A rectangular feed warehouse dating from c. 1915‚Äì20 is also located along the rail corridor. The one story, gable roof feed warehouse stands on a concrete pier foundation. A pyramidal roof garage/warehouse, built c. 1915‚Äì25, stands on concrete foundations near the tracks as well. Associated with the garage are bulk oil storage tanks and a pump shed constructed by Trachte Brothers Company of Madison, Wisconsin.

40|$|A new {{universal}} residual {{threshold for}} the detection of <b>load</b> and <b>gage</b> output residual outliers of wind tunnel strain{gage balance data was developed. The threshold works with both the Iterative and Non{Iterative Methods that are used in the aerospace testing community to analyze and process balance data. It also supports all known <b>load</b> and <b>gage</b> output formats that are traditionally used to describe balance data. The threshold's definition is based on an empirical electrical constant. First, the constant is used to construct a threshold for the assessment of gage output residuals. Then, the related threshold for the assessment of load residuals is obtained by multiplying the empirical electrical constant with the sum of the absolute values of all first partial derivatives of a given load component. The empirical constant equals 2. 5 microV/V for the assessment of balance calibration or check load data residuals. A value of 0. 5 microV/V is recommended for the evaluation of repeat point residuals because, by design, the calculation of these residuals removes errors that are associated with the regression analysis of the data itself. Data from a calibration of a six-component force balance is used to illustrate the application of the new threshold definitions to real{world balance calibration data...|$|R
