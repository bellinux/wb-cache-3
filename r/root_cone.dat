30|$|We ran GWASs on <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle in indica and japonica {{panels of}} {{intermediate}} size, which were genotyped with two large sets of markers. The <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle was assessed {{in a total}} population of 331 accessions and enabled the identification of accessions with exceptionally wide <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angles. This phenotype seems relatively frequent in O. sativa and distributed in different varietal groups. In our japonica panel, these accessions included all those belonging to the bulu ecotype, confirming the results obtained by Ueno and Sato (1989, 1992) and a few temperate japonica lines from South Asia {{that had not yet}} been identified as carrying such mutations. Ueno and Sato (1992) also found accessions with wide <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle among the aus and boro ecotypes from India and tjereh from Indonesia that belong to the indica subspecies. We did not find any such line in our indica panel, but these specific ecotypes were represented by very few accessions, probably too few to detect the mutation. Not considering mutants, the <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angles of the indica and japonica panels largely overlapped, while indica accessions are said to be generally shallow rooted and japonica accessions to be deep rooted (Lafitte et al. 2001). One could wonder whether this result is specific to our phenotyping system. However, Uga et al. (2009), using the 3 D basket system, also concluded that {{there was no significant difference}} in the distribution of an index based on <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle between the indica and japonica groups. On an accession basis, Clark et al. (2011), using a gellan gum culture system, did not find differences in root initiation angle between IR 64 and Azucena, our two controls in the present study that are nonetheless known to have contrasting root depths (Yadav et al. 1997). These results confirm those from Abe and Morita (1994) that the link between narrow <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle and increased root depth cannot be generalized in rice.|$|E
30|$|Plant root systems play a {{major role}} in {{anchoring}} and in water and nutrient uptake from the soil. The <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle is an important parameter of the root system architecture because, combined with root depth, it helps to determine the volume of soil explored by the plant.

30|$|To {{find other}} QTLs linked to <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle, a {{genome-wide}} association mapping {{study was conducted}} on two panels of 162 indica and 169 japonica rice accessions genotyped with two sets of SNP markers (genotyping-by-sequencing set with approximately 16, 000 markers and high-density-rice-array set with approximately 300, 000 markers). The <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle of all accessions was measured using a screen protractor on images taken after 1 month of plant growth in the Rhizoscope phenotyping system. The distribution of the <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle in the indica panel was Gaussian, but several accessions of the japonica panel (all the bulus from Indonesia and three temperate japonicas from Nepal or India) appeared as outliers with a very wide <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle. The data were submitted to association mapping using a mixed model with control of structure and kinship. A total of 15 QTLs for the indica panel and 40 QTLs for the japonica panel were detected. Genes underlying these QTLs (+/− 50  kb from the significant markers) were analyzed. We focused our analysis on auxin-related genes, kinases, and genes involved in root developmental processes and identified 8 particularly interesting genes.|$|E

40|$|Hormetic morphogens are morphogens such as {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} beta (TGF-β) in mammals and auxin in plants that induce hormetic responses. For example, in vitro, TGF-β stimulates and inhibits cell proliferation at {{low and high}} concentrations respectively. I developed a model of hormetic morphogen gradient control of the morphogenesis of the fusion of bilateral aortic precursors (Anlagen) that form the aorta during development; and validated the model with findings obtained by Daucus Carota fusion experiments. Theoretically, radial concentration gradients of a hormetic morphogen can form hollow (vessels) or solid (Carota) tubular structures. In arteries, blood flow and pressure can shape mural gradients and determine wall curvature and thereby vessel diameter. As Anlagen grow they form a temporary common wall that is subsequently removed, which results in fusion of the Anlagen lumina and an aorta with a lumen diameter that accommodates the combined {{blood flow to the}} iliac arteries. Carota seedlings grown close together exhibited proximally fused <b>root</b> <b>cones,</b> serial cross-sections of which exhibited coaxial fusion patterns that closely resembled the predicted vascular fusion patterns, thus validating a role for hormesis and hormetic morphogens in the morphogenesis of the aorta and possibly the morphogenesis of other human midline structures...|$|R

40|$|Arboreal palms have {{developed}} a variety of structural root modifications and systems {{to adapt to the}} harsh abiotic conditions of tropical rain forests. Stilt roots have been proposed to serve a number of functions including the facilitation of rapid vertical growth to the canopy and enhanced mechanical stability. To examine whether stilt roots provide these functions, we compared stilt root characteristics of the neotropical palm tree Socratea exorrhiza on sloped (> 20 °) and flat locations at two lowland neotropical sites. S. exorrhiza (n= 80 trees) did not demonstrate differences in number of roots, vertical stilt root height, <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> circumference, <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> volume, or location of roots as related to slope. However, we found positive relationships between allocation to vertical growth and stilt root architecture including <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> circumference, number of roots, and <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> volume. Accordingly, stilt roots may allow S. exorrhiza to increase height and maintain mechanical stability without having to concurrently invest in increased stem diameter and underground root structure. This strategy likely increases the species ability to rapidly exploit light gaps as compared to non-stilt root palms and may also enhance survival as mature trees approach the theoretical limits of their mechanical stability...|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{used the}} {{phenotypic}} data obtained by directly measuring the <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle for sub-samples of the indica and japonica Orytage panels.

30|$|To {{identify}} the loci {{responsible for the}} very wide <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle, assuming that this trait can be controlled by a major gene, we tested other approaches using only the GBS dataset since phenotypic and genotypic data were available for 10 of the extreme accessions compared with only 8 in the HDRA dataset. First, we looked at markers that were discriminant between the 10 accessions with an open <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle {{and the rest of}} the panel (157 accessions). Marker S 06 _ 21, 685, 315, corresponding to qj 06 _ 02 was found to be the one that discriminated the best the two phenotypic groups. The variant allele present in the 10 accessions with a wide <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle was present in only four accessions of the rest of the panel. However, these four accessions included Ketan Lumbu (bulu) and Padi Kasale (close to bulus), which had wide <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angles (close to 100 °), as well as NPE 253 and NPE 826 (temperate japonica) from Pakistan, which had narrow angles (approximately 50 °). In contrast, when the reference allele was present in the 10 accessions, no marker was found discriminant with at best a ratio of 7 accessions with the reference allele compared with 150 accessions with the variant allele in the rest of the panel.|$|E

30|$|Several genes or QTLs for <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle {{have been}} {{discovered}} {{in the last five}} years, but many remain to be found since the trait appears to be controlled by a combination of genes carrying alleles with major effects, such as the DRO 1 allele from Kinandang Patong, and alleles with smaller effects. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) in natural populations is an efficient tool in rice for localizing QTLs faster and with a much higher resolution than classical genetic approaches using mapping populations (Zhang et al. 2016). GWAS requires a high marker density that is now easily accessible due to GBS (genotyping by sequencing) as described by Elshire et al. (2011) or to the re-sequencing of the rice genome and the discovery of millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Alexandrov et al. 2015). GWAS allows for a precise localization of QTLs due to the rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the association panels. However, rice incurs a high risk of false-positive tests during GWAS because of the bipolar genetic structure of the species. This structural effect can be corrected by using panels specific to each subspecies and by using models that consider subpopulation structure and kinship. Several large panels of rice varieties genotyped with high marker density have been developed for GWAS (e.g., Huang et al. (2010), Zhao et al. (2011), McCouch et al. (2016)). A panel called Orytage composed of 170 japonica rice accessions and 204 indica rice accessions has been developed by Cirad (Courtois et al. 2013, Lafarge et al. 2017). This panel has been genotyped by GBS and approximately 16, 000 markers were detected (SNP and diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers) in the japonica panel (Courtois et al. 2013) and a similar number in the indica panel (Lafarge et al. 2017). The High-Density Rice Array (HDRA) developed by McCouch et al. (2016) is composed of more than 1500 inbred rice varieties of Oryza sativa genotyped with 700, 000 SNPs. A very large proportion of the accessions belonging to the Orytage panel are also included in the HDRA panel. The Orytage japonica panel has been used for GWASs on several root traits, including <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle (Courtois et al. 2013). However, in this early study, the range of variability in <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle was narrowed by trigonometrically deducing this angle from segment measurements and not directly measuring it. Other panels have been used for GWASs for root architectural traits in which root depth was analyzed but not the <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle itself (Lou et al. 2015; Phung et al. 2016).|$|E

30|$|We {{detected}} significant {{associations and}} tested the robustness of those associations using a resampling technique. Resampling enables {{the evaluation of}} the sensitivity of the tests to the specificities of the samples (Tian et al. 2011). Some of the QTLs were much better supported than others. While we did not encounter methodological difficulties in conducting GWAS in the indica panel, we did in the japonica panel. The <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle in the japonica panel is a clear example of a trait for which GWAS {{may not be the best}} way to quickly identify the underlying gene(s). Two problems surface. The first problem comes from the fact that one subpopulation, J 4, consisting of accessions from the bulu ecotype, is composed of only one-tail extremes. In such case, correcting population structure will remove the significant associations. The second problem is that, in subpopulation J 6, the number of extreme accessions is very low (only 3 accessions) and GWAS is not appropriate for analyzing situations with rare alleles (Gibson 2012; Zhang et al. 2016). In addition, as noted by Korte and Farlow (2013), rare alleles that are specific to such small sub-groups of individuals will be in complete LD, which is what we observed with markers with the same p-value on different chromosomes and drove us to eliminate many significant markers. Reverting to classical mapping populations such as RILs deriving from two divergent parents will solve these problems of the confounding effect of population structure and low frequency alleles. The poorer resolution, which is generally registered in classical mapping populations in comparison with GWAS panels, can easily be resolved by increasing the population size. Such a population was developed by Uga et al. (2012) who crossed a temperate japonica with a narrow <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle with a bulu with an open <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle. A mapping population involving one extreme parent of subpopulation J 4 and one from J 6 is another option if the objective is to determine whether the phenotypes observed in the various sub-populations are allelic.|$|E
30|$|Large genetic {{variability}} {{has been}} observed in rice (Oryza sativa L.) for different root traits such as root depth, root thickness and root-to-shoot ratio (O’Toole and Bland, 1987). This variability partly follows the genetic organization of the species, which is subdivided into two major components: the indica and japonica subspecies, which themselves are subdivided into varietal groups and ecotypes within varietal groups (Garris et al. 2005). An ecotype is often characterized by a specific combination of root characteristics that are generally related to its hydrological adaptation (Lafitte et al. 2001). Of course, the ecotype general trends can largely be modified by soil conditions (composition, pH, impedance), soil biology (presence of mycorrhizae or nematodes), water regimes (aerobic or anaerobic or alternating between the two conditions) and genotype x environment interactions. The <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angle has seldom been considered among the studied architectural root traits, except by Japanese teams who showed that most accessions of some ecotypes (aman, boro {{and some of the}} aus varieties within the indica subspecies; bulu within the japonica subspecies) had a high proportion of crown roots growing horizontally (Ueno and Sato 1992; Kato et al. 2006; Uga et al. 2009).

Each plate contained a grid of nails that helped maintain the root system in place during all operations. The rhizoboxes were set in tanks (48 rhizoboxes per tank) in which an aerated nutrient solution (modified Hoagland solution; pH  5.4) was circulated. The conditions in the growth chamber were 28  °C {{during the day and}} 25  °C at night with a 12 : 12 photoperiod. The radiation was 400 to 450  μmol photons per m 2 per s (PAR). The relative humidity was set to 55 %. One healthy pre-germinated seed was set on each rhizobox {{on the top of the}} beads and allowed to grow. After 28  days of growth, the experiment was stopped. The glass beads were removed from the rhizoboxes, and a high-definition image of the plate with the plant in position was taken. In comparison with the method used by Courtois et al. (2013), the imaging system was set in an aluminum frame enabling all images to be taken from the same distance and with the same magnification. The angle of the <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> to the vertical axis was measured in degrees using a screen protractor (Screen protractor v 4.0, iconico.com).

The distribution of maize <b>roots</b> was <b>cone</b> shaped and gradually extended from 20 cm to 40 cm below the surface during the elongation stage.

The maize significantly differed in the root weight density (P= 0. 026 < 0. 05) and the root surface area (P = 0. 005 < 0. 01) with different mulching measures. No-tillage with straw mulching on the ridge and furrow was the only mulching model in which the growth of the roots and leaves of maize was limited. However, the other maize growth measures were better than conventional tillage. In addition, no-tillage with straw mulching on the ridge and furrow had an advantage in terms of the growth of the surface roots, while stubble mulching and strip mulching had advantages in terms of the growth of deep roots and radial roots, respectively.

These last two accessions showed percentages of admixture that did not enable their classification into subpopulation J 6; however, for Jumali, this percentage (0.76 in subpopulation J 6) was very close to the 0.80 threshold, and for Lambayque 1, these percentages (0.60 in subpopulation J 6 and 0.33 in subpopulation J 4) showed that the accession was intermediate between subpopulation J 6 and bulu subpopulation J 4. Such markers carried by different chromosomes but in complete LD could not be used for GWAS. Once removed, 13 significant markers corresponding to 12 QTLs remained (Table 5; Additional file 9 : Figure S 6). Most markers had a low MAF.|$|E
30|$|We have {{generated}} a new loss-of-function mutation in the DOCS 1 gene (docs 1 – 2) using the CRISPR-Cas 9 technology. This new loss-of-function mutant and docs 1 – 1 present similar phenotypes suggesting the original docs 1 – 1 was a null allele. Besides the aluminum sensitivity phenotype, both docs 1 mutants shared also several root phenotypes described previously: less root hairs and mixed {{identities of the}} outer cell layers. Moreover, our new results suggest that DOCS 1 could {{also play a role}} in root cap development. We hypothesized these docs 1 root phenotypes may affect gravity responses. As expected, in seedlings, the early gravitropic response was delayed. Furthermore, at adult stage, the root gravitropic set angle of docs 1 mutants was also affected since docs 1 mutant plants displayed larger <b>root</b> <b>cone</b> angles.|$|E
30|$|Seedlings {{were grown}} under hydroponic {{conditions}} in 50  cm[*]×[*] 20  cm[*]×[*] 3  cm plexiglas plates (rhizoboxes) filled or not with 5  mm diameter glass beads in the rhizoscope platform {{as described in}} detail in (Bettembourg et al. 2017; Courtois et al. 2013). Each rhizobox contained a grid of nails, which held the root system in place after bead removal. After 28  days of growth, several parameters were measured (number of tillers, length of the longest leaf, maximum root length, depth reached by at least three crown roots and angle of the <b>root</b> <b>cone).</b> A first experiment has been conducted to compare docs 1 – 1 (> 20 plants) to their WT Koshihikari control (> 20 plants), and docs 1 – 2 (6 plants) to their Nipponbare control (6 plants). In a second experiment, rhizoboxes with and without beads were used. In this experiment, six docs 1 – 1 and six WT Koshihikari control plants were phenotyped for each treatment.|$|E
2500|$|The Black Tusk, a black {{pinnacle}} of volcanic rock on the northwestern shore of Garibaldi Lake, is the glacially eroded remnant {{of a much}} larger volcano that formed during two periods of volcanic activity. The first between 1.1and 1.3million years ago erupted hornblende andesite lava flows and tuffs. These volcanics compose mountain ridges southwest, southeast and northwest of the prime volcanic structure. Subsequent erosion demolished the newly formed volcano. This ultimately exposed the <b>roots</b> of the <b>cone,</b> which currently form the rugged edifice of The Black Tusk. After the cone was eroded, a series of hypersthene andesite lava flows were erupted between 0.17and 0.21million years ago. These end at adjacent ice-marginal lava flows that form [...] cliffs. This eruptive phase also produced a lava dome that comprises the current [...] high pinnacle. Consequently, the regional Late Pleistocene ice sheet carved a deep north-trending U-shaped valley into the eastern flank of the second-stage cone. Here, subsequent lava flows from Cinder Cone filled the valley.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Let (W,S) be an {{infinite}} Coxeter system. To each geometric rep-resentation of W is associated a root system. While a root system {{lives in the}} positive side of the isotropy cone of its associated bilinear form, an imaginary cone lives in the negative side of the isotropic cone. Precisely on the isotropic <b>cone,</b> between <b>root</b> systems and imaginary cones, lives the set E of limit points of the directions of roots. In this article we study the close relations of the imaginary cone with the set E, which leads to new fundamental results about the structure of geometric representations of infinite Coxeter groups. In partic-ular, we show that the W-action on E is minimal and faithful, and that E and the imaginary cone can be approximated arbitrarily well by sets of limit <b>roots</b> and imaginary <b>cones</b> of universal <b>root</b> subsystems of W, i. e., root systems for Coxeter groups without braid relations (the free object for Coxeter groups). 1...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to performan ex vivo {{analysis}} of apical deviation in curved <b>root</b> canals throughi-CAT <b>cone</b> beam computed tomography 3 D. Material and methods:Forty mesiovestibular roots of human maxillary molars with curvatureranging between 20 to 40 degrees were selected and randomly dividedinto four groups, according to manual, rotary, oscillatory and rotaryassociated with oscillatory instrumentation techniques. Tomographywas performed before and after instrumentation technique of the first 4 mm from the apical foramen in order to compare the apical deviation,which resulted in four perpendicular (axial) and interpolation (1 to 1 mmfrom the top) sections per root. Initial images were stored on a computerhard disc (HD) to later comparison with post-instrumentation images. Instrumentation technique was performed by a single operator for allroots, and canals were irrigated with 3 mL of 1 % sodium hypochloritebetween every instrument change. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallisstatistical test was used to compare apical deviation between therecommended techniques (α = 0. 05). Results: Additional Dunn test(p 0. 05). Conclusion: None of the techniques was ableto avoid the apical deviation during instrumentation technique...|$|R
