50|$|Stealths {{restraint}} system {{consists of a}} thick, rigid lap bar and two thin, flexible over-the-shoulder restraints. Because the over-the-shoulder portions of the restraint are not rigid, the hand grips are mounted to the lap bar.These restraints use a hydraulic locking system (rather than a <b>ratchet</b> <b>system)</b> which allows them to be pulled down to any position; when locked, they can move down to any position but not up. In contrast, a ratchet-based restraint only locks at each notch, and will often be too loose or uncomfortably tight. Stealths restraints are also held down by a belt in case the main locking system fails. In order to speed up loading, riders are asked to secure their own restraints if they are able to.This {{restraint system}} is identical to many Intamin Launch coasters, including Kingda Ka and Rita at Alton Towers.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, <b>ratchet</b> <b>systems</b> {{operating}} in the quantum regime are investigated. <b>Ratchet</b> <b>systems,</b> also known as Brownian motors, are periodic systems presenting an intrinsic asymmetry which can be exploited to extract work out of unbiased forces. As a model for <b>ratchet</b> <b>systems,</b> we consider the motion of a particle in a one-dimensional periodic and asymmetric potential, interacting with a thermal environment, and subject to an unbiased driving force. In quantum ratchets, intrinsic quantum fluctuations {{as well as the}} tunnel effect enrich the transport mechanisms. The investigation of quantum ratchets allows one to gain fundamental understanding on the dynamics of quantum dissipative systems. Starting from a continuous ratchet potential and applying a path integral formalism, we develop two approaches, beyond a semiclassical description, where the dynamics can be mapped onto that of an effective tight-binding model. In the first approach, a parameter regime is chosen such that only few low energy quantum states in each well of the periodic potential are involved in the dynamics of the particle. The second approach leads to a duality relation between the original system and a single-band tight-binding model. The two methods are valid in different regimes of parameters, the second one including the classical limit. We get an analytical expression for the stationary velocity of the particle, which shows reversals {{as a function of the}} driving force and of the temperature. The second method allows us to extract the explicit dependence of the velocity on the parameters of the potential, and thus to characterize the potentials which lead to the highest rectification efficiency. We also discuss the connection between this theoretical model and measurements of the dynamics of vortices in quasi one-dimensional Josephson junction arrays. Applied Science...|$|R

The regulator itself was of the balanced, conically-seated type which, in later years, became the standard for locomotives from the 2-8-2 X-class and onward. When new boilers were fitted to the class, the regulator was changed to the rotating shaft type, with a British-style double-ended lever. With their wheel 2-8-0 arrangement, the V class were Victoria’s first eight-coupled locomotives, pre-dating the much larger C class 2-8-0s by some 18 years. The 2 ft diameter leading wheels were arranged in a Bissel truck, the springs of which were compensated to the heading pair of driving wheels. The 4 ft driving wheels were coupled to two outside 22 in diameter and 26 in stroke low-pressure cylinders, with two 13 in diameter by 26 in stroke high-pressure cylinders.|$|E

The entry and exit station is an open, hipped-roof pavilion, and cars are stored in a nearby shed when not in use. The track's form has been altered very little since its original construction, with portions of the track - mostly wood - being replaced by steel in areas of exceptionally high wear, along with the conversion of the lift chain to steel. The lift mechanism includes a <b>ratchet</b> <b>system</b> to prevent cars from rolling backwards {{in the event of a}} chain failure. The ride cars resemble sleighs featuring four flanged wheels underneath and two unflanged wheels projecting to each side.

5000|$|In 1962, Paul Harrington {{introduced}} a metal spinal system of instrumentation that assisted with straightening the spine, {{as well as}} holding it rigid while fusion took place. The original (now obsolete) Harrington rod operated on a <b>ratchet</b> <b>system,</b> attached by hooks to the spine {{at the top and}} bottom of the curvature that when cranked would distract, or straighten, the curve. The Harrington rod represented a major advance in the field, as it obviated the need for prolonged casting, allowing patients greater mobility in the postoperative period and significantly reducing the quality of life burden of fusion surgery. Additionally, as the first system to apply instrumentation directly to the spine, the Harrington rod was the precursor to most modern spinal instrumentation systems. A major shortcoming of the Harrington method was it failed to produce a posture wherein the skull would be in proper alignment with the pelvis, and it did not address rotational deformity. As a result, unfused parts of the spine would try to compensate for this in the effort to stand up straight. As the person aged, there would be increased wear and tear, early-onset arthritis, disc degeneration, muscular stiffness, and pain with eventual reliance on painkillers, further surgery, inability to work full-time, and disability.

First, we present an introduction to a general concept of active Brownian particles which are capable to take up energy from the source and transform part of it in order to perform various activities. In the second part of our presentation we consider applications of ABM to <b>ratchet</b> <b>systems</b> with different forms of differentiable potentials. Both analytical and numerical evaluations are discussed for three cases of sinusoidal, staircase-like and Mateos ratchet potentials, also with the additional loads modeled by tilted potential structure. In addition, stochastic character of the kinetics is investigated by considering perturbation by Gaussian white noise which is shown to be responsible for driving the directionality of the asymptotic flux in the ratchet. This stochastically driven directionality effect is visualized as a strong nonmonotonic dependence of the statistics of the right versus left trajectories of motion leading to a net current of particles.

50|$|Outdoor cricket nets are the {{standard}} and {{most common form}} of practise nets. They take shape and form in many different guises, with some nets being homemade whilst others are professional manufactured and installed, and this is reflected throughout the world. Regardless of their design and construction, outdoor crickets all have the same purpose of allowing batting and bowling practise within an enclosed space where the ball is contained. The design and construction of outdoor cricket nets tends to be based around two factors; the frequency and age of those who will use it, and also the space which is available. In schools and cricket clubs where levels of use will be high the construction of the cricket cage will be tailored to suit these requirements. A further unfortunate consideration has to be made into the likelihood that the cricket nets will be subject to misuse or vandalism. Therefore, the frames of cricket cages are often constructed out of heavy duty galvanised steel with an overall diameter ranging from 34mm - 50mm, the steel tube is then joined by galvanised key-clamp brackets. This system requires ground sockets to be concreted into the ground, although these cannot be removed the actual frame of the cage can still be dismantled. There are variations in the design of outdoor nets such as a pulley and <b>ratchet</b> <b>system</b> where the net is mounted on a cable which spans posts located {{at either end of the}} practise net. Garden cricket nets are frequently DIY and quite often take the form of a professional design with locally sourced components. This occurs primarily due to cost implications, but also due to the fact cricket nets are fundamentally simple in design and purpose and thus greatly increase the feasibility of constructing a homemade cricket net. There are few rules of thumb to follow particularly with size. The width should be no less than 9 ft, with 12 ft being optimum. The height should be no less than 9 ft if the length of net is longer than 24 ft, this is increased to 10 ft up to a length of 36 ft and nets with roof lengths beyond 36 ft should have a net height of 12 ft - this is to prevent balls ending up on the roof of the cricket net after being bowled. The length of the net is flexible, however the longer the net the more ball containment and the safer the surround training area is. There is a further type of outdoor cricket nets, this is a mobile cricket net. A steel framed cricket cage can be adapted with wheels to allow them to be become completely portable.|$|E

50|$|Electric {{stirring}} explicitly breaks time-reversal symmetry. This property {{can be used}} {{to induce}} spin polarization in conventional semiconductors by purely electric means. Strictly speaking stirring is a non-linear effect, because in linear response theory (LRT) an AC driving induces an AC current with the same frequency. Still an adaptation of the LRT Kubo formalism allows the analysis of stirring. The quantum pumping problem (where we have an open geometry) can be regarded as a special limit of the quantum stirring problem (where we have a closed geometry). Optionally the latter can be analyzed within the framework of scattering theory. Pumping and Stirring devices are close relatives of <b>ratchet</b> <b>systems.</b> The latter are defined in this context as AC driven spatially periodic arrays, where DC current is induced.|$|R
