50|$|The Commission and its Secretariat {{is based}} in Strasbourg (France), in Le Palais du Rhin. It has 18 staff members who deal with general {{management}} of the 50 meetings annually, external representation, administering social security for ship crews on the Rhine and functioning as {{the seat of the}} <b>Rhine</b> <b>navigation</b> tribunal.|$|R
50|$|Legally, the Commission's {{authority}} {{comes from}} agreements {{made at the}} Congress of Vienna, held in 1815 {{in the aftermath of}} the Napoleonic Wars. The first meeting took place on 15 August 1816 in Mainz. In 1831, the Convention of Mainz was adopted, establishing a number of the first laws governing <b>Rhine</b> <b>navigation.</b> In 1861, the commission's seat was moved to Mannheim, and on 17 October 1868, the Convention of Mannheim was agreed to.|$|R
50|$|Koblenz is a {{principal}} seat of the Mosel and Rhenish wine trade, and also does a large business in the export of mineral waters. Its manufactures include automotive parts (braking systems - TRW Automotive, gas springs and hydraulic vibration dampers - Stabilus), aluminium coils (Aleris Aluminum), pianos, paper, cardboard, machinery, boats, and barges. Since the 17th century, it has been home to the KÃ¶nigsbacher brewery (the Old Brewery in Koblenz's city centre, and now a plant in Koblenz-Stolzenfels). It is an important transit centre for the Rhine railways and for the <b>Rhine</b> <b>navigation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Zeballos was Foreign Minister again between October 1891 and October 1892, {{during the}} {{presidency}} of Carlos Pellegrini, during which he rejected the claim from Britain for compensation for British nationals who had suffered damages during the revolution of 1890. He also faced claims from France over the expulsion of a ship of that flag from Argentine territorial waters. As a result, he signed a trade and <b>navigation</b> <b>agreement</b> with that country in 1892.|$|R
5000|$|The Shipping House (Scheepvaarthuis) is a {{building}} on the western tip of the Waalseiland near Amsterdam harbour {{that is one of}} the top 100 Dutch heritage sites and generally regarded as the first true example of the Amsterdam School, a style characterised by [...] "expressive dynamism, lavish ornamentation and colourful embellishments". It is situated on the Prins Hendrikkade and was erected on the spot where Cornelis Houtman's first trip to the East Indies had begun in 1595. The first part was built 1913 - 1916 (during World War I); the second part was built 1926 -1928. Originally, it was the headquarters of six leading Amsterdam shipping companies: the Netherlands Steamship Company (SMN), the Royal Packet Navigation Company (KPM), the Java-China-Japan Line (JCJL) and the Royal Dutch Steamboat Company (KNSM) with subsidiary New <b>Rhine</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company (NRM) and acquired in 1912 Royal West India Mail Service (KWIM).|$|R
50|$|During {{a lull in}} {{the siege}} and {{blockade}} of Buenos Aires, between 10 and 13 July 1853, Urquiza signed <b>navigation</b> <b>agreements</b> with agents of Great Britain, France and the United States which guaranteed the free navigation of Argentine inland rivers for foreign trade. In the opinion of James Scobie, his intention was to obtain a legal instrument to force these governments to protect freedom of navigation {{in the event that}} the province of Buenos Aires tried to cut the Confederate communications with the outside. The free navigation of the rivers was included in the Constitution of Argentina of 1853.|$|R
50|$|Latchford began {{attending}} international {{meetings of}} the CITEJA and led a number of U.S. delegations to the CITEJA himself. He {{served as chairman of}} U.S. delegations to CITEJA sessions held in the Hague, Netherlands in 1935; Paris, France in 1936; Bern, Switzerland in 1936; Bucharest, Romania in 1937; Paris in 1937; and Brussels, Belgium in 1938. In June 1937, he was detailed to Dublin, Ireland to complete a series of negotiations for an air <b>navigation</b> <b>agreement</b> between the United States and Ireland. He also served as a U.S. representative at the United States-Canada Aviation Conference held at Washington, D.C. in 1938 and again in Ottawa in 1939.|$|R
50|$|Under the Rheinschifffahrtsakte (<b>Rhine</b> <b>navigation</b> treaty) of 1831, Mainz {{lost its}} right to impose a stapelrecht (pile right, a medieval right {{apparently}} first granted by Charlemagne to some cities, including Mainz, to require river traders to unload goods in its marketplace for a specified number of days and offer them for sale or make payment in lieu) and thus its trading port and its high tariffs could be avoided. On 13 April 1840 the Taunus Railway between Frankfurt, Mainz-Kastel and Wiesbaden was opened and took transit traffic and tourism away from Mainz. On the other hand, Mainz was the largest city of the Grand Duchy of Hesse and was thus an attractive destination for the developing railway network. In Mainz, the local Hessian Ludwig Railway Company (Hessische Ludwigsbahn) obtained concessions to build railway lines from Mainz, beginning in 1845 with the Mainz-Ludwigshafen railway, on which construction began in 1847. The completion of the line was delayed due to the Revolutions of 1848 to 23 March 1853. The original Mainz station was built on land next to the Rhine outside the city wall between the Wood Tower, Fort Malakoff and today's Museum of Ancient Seafaring, and opened in August 1853.|$|R
50|$|Formerly {{known as}} the Welsh Canoeing Association, {{it was in the}} past {{responsible}} for the formal access agreements on the Conwy, Glaslyn, Llwyd, Ogwr, Severn, Tawe, Tryweryn, Twrch, Usk and Wye and informal agreements on rivers and managed stillwaters. However, following conflicts of interest, it has disavowed access agreements and begun to seek a legislative solution to access problems hoping for a parallel to the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. It is also responsible for the rights of <b>navigation</b> <b>agreements</b> on sections of the Lugg, Severn and Wye. Canoe Wales organises competition at national and international level in all the canoeing and kayaking disciplines in Wales: freestyle; slalom; wild water racing; marathon racing; sprint racing; surf kayaking; and canoe polo.|$|R
5000|$|Urquiza {{held two}} {{interviews}} with the British representative Robert Gore, {{and in the second}} one he expressed his [...] "plans to develop the resources of this great and rich country; the opening of the rivers to all nations, being the ships free to sail rivers and lift or drop cargo without having to stop previously in Buenos Aires." [...] The British focused their diplomatic efforts on obtaining a <b>navigation</b> <b>agreement</b> opening up the rivers for navigation. The Foreign office contacted France for this end, and both countries sent a diplomatic mission to Argentina in May 1852, led by Sir Charles Hotham and Michel de Saint-Georges, {{to put an end to}} the restrictions of the Arana-Southern Treaty and Arana-Lepredour Treaty. They had an interview with Urquiza in August, who agreed with their proposals.|$|R
50|$|Johann Gottfried Tulla (born 20 March 1770 in Karlsruhe; died 27 March 1828 in Paris) was a German {{engineer}} who accomplished the straightening of the <b>Rhine,</b> improving <b>navigation</b> and alleviating {{the effects of}} flooding. His measures gave the Upper Rhine a completely new appearance. The river was deepened and channelled between embankments, new sections were dug to straighten out its meandering course, and numerous small islands were removed. The effect was to reduce the river's length between Basel and Worms from 355 km to 275 km (220 to 170 miles). However, the straightening of the Upper Rhine may have increased the flood risk {{in the region of}} the Middle and Lower Rhine, partial floodplain restoration is performed in a joint program of Germany and France.|$|R
40|$|The {{opinions}} and interpretations expressed within {{are those of}} the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Mekong River Commission. The Mekong was always an international river, in the sense that foreigners were always interested in it. Since ancient t imes, people and goods have moved along this wide brown highway that preceded roads, railways and modern freight containers. As described in many historical accounts, it also provided access to the interior of the Mekong region to generations of conquerors, explorers and traders. The years of turmoil in the Mekong region account for much of the neglect of this major inland waterway {{in the latter part of}} the 20 th century. But in recent times there has been increased discussion of the Mekong as an inland waterway corridor linking the region, in part because of its opening to Chinese trade since the Upper Mekong <b>Navigation</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 2001 between China, Myanmar, Lao PDR and Thailand. At the time of writing, the Mekong River Commission has formulated a four-nation strategy and programme for the development of navigation on the Lower Mekong. The programme, endorsed by the MRC member states of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand an...|$|R
40|$|Air {{transportation}} {{is a global}} transportation, vehicles, terminals, and airways are main components of the air transportation sub-system. Vehicles, in this matter aircraft {{as a tool of}} transportation, have a global characteristic because of the high speed and wide range capability compare to vehicles of any other transportation mode. An airway is a flight lane in air space. Every aircraft, which pass the airways, has the right of air traffic services. The authority provision of giving the air traffic services Internationally is provided in Annex 11 to the Convention on Civil Aviation about Air Traffic Services. The authority mentioned above includes responsibility to provide air traffic services in air space above the territory, which the state has its jurisdiction and responsibility to the aerodrome where the air traffic services are given. A state, through an agreement, may delegate the responsibility of providing air traffic services to the other states or accept responsibility mentioned above from the other states. Air space above the high seas or air space above the area that is not under any sovereignty of certain states which is the air traffic services are needed is determined in a regional air <b>navigation</b> <b>agreement.</b> Usually, Regional Air Navigation Meeting is a forum to accomplish this purpose...|$|R
50|$|This new ESRO policy, {{negotiated}} in 1973, gave the organisation overall {{responsibility for the}} development of the European Ariane launcher. This task was entrusted to CNES. The second package deal enabled ESRO to enter into cooperation with NASA on the Spacelab project as well as manage the MAROTS maritime satellite <b>navigation</b> project. This <b>agreement</b> made funding easier and more flexible for the contributing nations which led to a doubling of the organisation's overall budget. ESRO also participated in the International Ultraviolet Explorer mission with NASA under these policy guidelines.|$|R
40|$|Rainfall, melted {{snow and}} {{evaporation}} affect the rivers water level and periods of drought may impair freight transport by inland navigation during {{a number of}} days. Indeed, water depth conditions the loading of vessels, hence their transport cost and their competitive position versus alternative modes, rail and trucking. The ECCONET research project funded by the European Commission endeavored to measure the potential effects of these phenomena on the <b>Rhine</b> and Danube <b>navigation</b> {{in the context of}} the observed weather variability and expected climate change scenarios. Many inter-disciplinary issues and methodologies are involved in such an analysis. These were tackled in several technical reports on statistical data, climate evolution prognoses, vessels specifications, adjustment strategies, etc. The present paper uses as inputs part of the wealth of information gathered during that project. The paper presents a long-term multimodal transport analysis over the period 2005 - 2050, which is based on two climate impact scenarios on the Rhine and Danube hydrology. The geographic multimodal transport model NODUS is calibrated with respect to transport costs on estimated 2005 and forecast 2050 matrixes of freight transport flows between origins and destinations within Continental Europe per mode and per type of commodities. The model is used to analyze the effects of climate induced changes in the distributions of water depth on transport costs and on the resulting modal splits between the three competing modes, rail, road and inland waterway transports. The model integrates the effects of planned future European investments in the networksâ infrastructure, and gives some insights on the cost savings that some improved vessels designs and operations could provide...|$|R
