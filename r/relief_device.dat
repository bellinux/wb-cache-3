30|$|It is {{frequently}} observed that overloading the foot can impair bone and soft tissue healing {{and can lead}} to harmful sequelae (i.e. ulcers, stress reactions) in context of pre-existing tissue disabilities. In terms of offloading, hindfoot <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> are commonly applied as a non-operative treatment as well as after various surgical procedures for hindfoot disorders.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{offloading}} the foot {{has been established}} as a treatment strategy after various surgical and non-operative procedures {{in the context of}} trauma, illnesses and disabilities of the foot and ankle (Bus et al., 2016; Bus & Valk, 2008; Baur et al., 2018). It is frequently observed that overloading the foot accompanied by elevated pressure pattern are thought to have important roles for the development of impairments of wound and softtissue healing or can cause delays in fracture healing (Claes & Heigele, 1999; Reike et al., 1997; Genc et al., 2016). Hindfoot <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> have commonly been used in the post-surgical rehabilitation process, following various procedures such as the repair of calcaneal fractures, ligament reconstructions, corrective osteotomies, and trauma surgery of the hindfoot (Carl et al., 2006; Hodge et al., 1999; Schepers et al., 2008; Bohl et al., 2017; Groot et al., 2013; Cavanagh & Bus, 2011; Kraus et al., 2014; Bus et al., 2009). In cases of tarsal bone marrow oedema, stress reactions or stress fractures, hindfoot <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> allow a mobilization under limited weight-bearing conditions that are encouraged to promote healing without overloading the tissue (Pauser et al., 2011). Additionally, hindfoot <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> are used to improve the healing process for plantar ulcers and wound healing disorders due to trauma, peripheral arterial disease, neuropathic disabilities and rheumatoid arthritis (Pauser et al., 2011; Götz et al., 2016; da Conceição et al., 2015). Offloading the hindfoot is mostly carried out by hindfoot relief shoes (HRSs) and hindfoot relief orthoses (HROs) (Hunt et al., 1987; Hahn et al., 2014). Nevertheless, commonly available devices display fundamentally different designs and concepts. Despite the common use of pressure <b>relief</b> <b>devices,</b> there is a paucity of data comparing their offloading effects related to biomechanical aspects.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the wide}} use of HRS and HRO in {{clinical}} practice, {{there is a}} paucity of data representing biomechanical changes of plantar pressure distribution using commonly applied offloading devices, and outcomes are even less often investigated. It is hypothesized that the clinical effects of hindfoot relief orthoses are based on offloading effects to the plantar tissue (Hahn et al., 2014). Nevertheless, to date, no study has compared such biomechanical tissue responses between HRO and HRS. Offloading effects of forefoot <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> are already benchmarked and well-studied and have helped to transfer biomechanical principles to clinical implications (Bus et al., 2016; Cavanagh & Bus, 2011; Bus et al., 2009). To our knowledge, {{the present study is}} the first to assess plantar pressure distributions via dynamic pedobarography in hindfoot <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> of various designs comparing data to conditions of full weight-bearing. Moreover, {{for the first time we}} demonstrated a hindfoot peak pressure reduction with an HRO.|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} the safety problems {{that result from}} using the same MICE absorber and small cooler for both liquid hydrogen and liquid helium operation [1].

40|$|Pressure <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> (PRDs) {{are viewed}} as {{essential}} safety measures for high-pressure gas storage and distribution systems.

As such, the intention of this report is to introduce the reader to the function of the common types of PRDs currently used in industry. Since high-pressure hydrogen gas storage systems are being developed to support the growing hydrogen energy infrastructure, several recent failure incidents, specifically involving hydrogen, will be examined to demonstrate the results and possible mechanisms of a device failure. The applicable codes and standards, developed to minimize the risk of failure for PRDs, will also be reviewed.

50|$|Part of the {{pressurizer}} {{system is}} an over-pressure relief system. In {{the event that}} pressurizer pressure exceeds a certain maximum, there is a relief valve called the pilot-operated relief valve (PORV) {{on top of the}} pressurizer which opens to allow steam from the steam bubble to leave the pressurizer {{in order to reduce the}} pressure in the pressurizer. This steam is routed to a large tank (or tanks) in the reactor containment building where it is cooled back into liquid (condensed) and stored for later disposition. There is a finite volume to these tanks and if events deteriorate to the point where the tanks fill up, a secondary pressure <b>relief</b> <b>device</b> on the tank(s), often a rupture disc, allows the condensed reactor coolant to spill out onto the floor of the reactor containment building where it pools in sumps for later disposition.|$|E
50|$|A rupture disc, {{also known}} as a burst disc, {{bursting}} disc, or burst diaphragm, is a onetime use, non-reclosing pressure <b>relief</b> <b>device</b> that, in most uses, protects a pressure vessel, equipment or system from over pressurization or potentially damaging vacuum conditions. A rupture disc is a sacrificial part because it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal, but nearly any material can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture discs provide instant response (within milliseconds) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disc has ruptured it will not reseal. Due to the one time usage of this disc it requires someone to replace the plate once it has ruptured. One time usage devices are initially cost effective, but can become time consuming and labor-intensive to repeatedly change out.|$|E

40|$|The CRISTA {{instrument}} (CRyogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere) {{is designed}} to analyse dynamical processes as waves and turbulence in the middle atmosphere using various trace gases as dynamical tracers. A two-stage cooling system was chosen for the CRISTA cryostat. The main He tank (No. I) contains 725 l of supercritical helium at a nominal pressure of 2, 9 bar and a temperature between 5 and 10 K. It cools the telescopes, spectrometers and the short wavelength detectors, {{as well as two}} radiation shields and part of the straylight baffles. A second He tank (No. II) contains 55 l liquid helium at a nominal vapor pressure between 0, 1 bar and 0, 6 bar corresponding to temperatures between 2, 5 and 3, 7 K.

40|$|Over {{time the}} harsh outdoor {{environment}} wears away at asphalt surfaces. Asphalt emulsion is sprayed {{onto the surface}} {{to act as a}} sacrificial barrier. To pump this asphalt emulsion for spray application an effective pressure <b>relief</b> <b>device</b> must be incorporated. High pressure is needed to achieve the desired spray pattern, but this same pressure can cause components to fail {{in the presence of a}} pressure spike. Hydraulically driven positive displacement pumps are used to pump the emulsion, so a pinched hoses or a clog in the system results in a severe pressure spike. Due to the emulsions viscosity and abrasive additives a direct <b>relief</b> <b>device</b> is not suitable for long term service. A remote activated pressure <b>relief</b> <b>device</b> is needed to allow adequate spray pressure and prevent system failure. The device is manufactured with off the shelf hydraulic and pneumatic parts bolted to a steel base plate.

40|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{regardless}} of plant or facility type, {{the most important}} pieces of equipment are the pressure relief devices. The most critical characteristics of a pressure <b>relief</b> <b>device</b> are its set pressure and the related relieving capacity. The Set Pressure of a pressure <b>relief</b> <b>device</b> is defined as that value of increasing inlet static pressure at which the discharge becomes continuous (ASME PTC 25 - 1994, Performance Test Codes). To preclude an unsafe overpressure situation, the set pressure of the pressure <b>relief</b> <b>device</b> must not exceed the {{maximum allowable working pressure}} of the equipment or system being protected. Because of testing facility limitations, size or pressure, pressure relief valves intended for elevated temperature service are often set using ambient temperature air. Adjustments are made to the ambient valve opening pressures to compensate for the temperature differences. The extent of the adjustments to the pressure relief valve set pressure is important to ensure the valve will provide the required overpressure protection at the elevated in-service temperature...|$|E

30|$|Although limited {{weight-bearing}} {{is often}} required by surgeons’ specifications, {{there have been}} no evidence-based rehabilitation guidelines that determine exact values of weight-bearing graduations in accordance with operative or non-operative interventions (Wild et al., 2016). In rehabilitation after lower limb surgery {{there is a lack of}} unified, evidence-based rehabilitation concepts (Pfeifer et al., 2015). However, if total offloading to the hindfoot is required, our results indicate that neither HROs nor HRSs are able to alleviate plantar pressure at all, as 50 % of the baseline must be considered. Furthermore, increased midfoot load must be cautiously considered. Our data indicated significant peak pressure increases at the midfoot region while using hindfoot <b>relief</b> <b>devices.</b> Similar pressure shifts have been described for forefoot <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> (Mueller et al., 2016; Cousins et al., 2013; Birtane & Tuna, 2004). Regarding the HRS (München shoe), Hahn et al. reported only a 5 % increase, whereas our study demonstrated a significant 32 % increase for the midfoot region. An increased midfoot vulnerability using orthotic devices was already reported for an ankle-foot orthosis (Vacoped®) by Pauser et al. (Pauser et al., 2012). Based on the existing investigations identifying increasing plantar pressure in the midfoot, as in our findings, the midfoot area appears to be a sensitive area for adapting increasing foot loads (Hotfiel et al., 2017). Regarding the localization of stress fractures, to which peak pressure is a commonly accepted risk factor, the midfoot area displayed the highest incidence in contrast to the tarsal bone, sesamoid or toe phalanx (Hotfiel et al., 2017). In particular, patients with accompanying midfoot injuries or neuropathic or diabetic diseases should undergo a regular clinical examination to avoid further damage.|$|R
5000|$|Rupture discs are {{commonly}} used in petrochemical, aerospace, aviation, defense, medical, railroad, nuclear, chemical, pharmaceutical, food processing and oil field applications. They {{can be used as}} single protection devices or as a backup device for a conventional safety valve; if the pressure increases and the safety valve fails to operate (or can't relieve enough pressure fast enough), the rupture disc will burst. Rupture discs are very often used in combination with safety relief valves, isolating the valves from the process, thereby saving on valve maintenance and creating a leak-tight pressure relief solution. It is sometimes possible, and preferable for highest reliability though at higher initial cost, to avoid the use of emergency pressure <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> by developing an intrinsically safe mechanical design that provides containment in all cases.|$|R

The consequence, {{in the case of}} a rupture of the envelopes, may be serious for personnel (injuries from deflagration, burns, and oxygen deficiency hazard) as well as for the equipment. Performing a thorough risk analysis is an essential step to identify and understand risk hazards that may cause a pressure increase and in order to assess consequences, define mitigation actions, and design adequate safety <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> to limit pressure accordingly.
