5|$|Berni's work {{gradually}} became more spiritual and <b>reflective.</b> In 1980 he completed the paintings Apocalipsis (Apocalypse) and La crucifixion (The Crucifixion) for the Chapel of San Luis Gonzaga in Las Heras, {{where they were}} installed the following year.|$|E
5|$|Green is {{a common}} color for sports teams. Well-known teams include A.S. Saint-Étienne of France, known as Les Verts (The Greens). A number of {{national}} soccer teams feature the color, with the color usually <b>reflective</b> of the teams' national flag.|$|E
5|$|Many birds show plumage {{patterns}} in ultraviolet that are {{invisible to the}} human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar {{to the naked eye}} are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet <b>reflective</b> patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet <b>reflective</b> crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV <b>reflective</b> urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish are}} covered with highly <b>reflective</b> scales, giving the {{appearance}} of silvered mirror glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those {{that live in the}} top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly <b>reflective.</b> At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by silvering.|$|E
5|$|Martha Lasley sees {{similarities}} {{with the}} Focused Conversation Method {{developed by the}} Institute of Cultural Affairs (ICA), with NVC's observations, feelings, needs, and requests components relating to FCM's objective, <b>reflective,</b> interpretive, and decisional stages.|$|E
5|$|The Lights at the End of the Tunnel by William Wainwright, a large <b>reflective</b> mobile in the station's mezzanine. It {{was removed}} in 1986 after a lead weight fell off.|$|E
5|$|The optical system, {{consisting}} {{of a combination of}} lenses and/or <b>reflective</b> elements, is simply described by the matrix resulting from the product of the components' matrices.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less <b>reflective</b> {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Love's later musical work is more lyrically introspective. Celebrity Skin and America's Sweetheart are lyrically {{centered}} on celebrity life, Hollywood, and drug addiction, while continuing Love's interest in vanity and body image. Nobody's Daughter was lyrically <b>reflective</b> of Love's past relationships and her struggle for sobriety, {{with the majority of}} its lyrics written while she was in rehab in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{threw the}} no-hitter despite {{being unable to}} feel the ball or see the batter or catcher clearly. Ellis said his catcher Jerry May wore <b>reflective</b> tape on his fingers which helped him to see May's signals. Ellis walked eight batters and struck out six, and he was aided by {{excellent}} fielding plays from second baseman Bill Mazeroski and center fielder Matty Alou.|$|E
5|$|For {{the film}} score, Mizoguchi relied on {{composer}} Fumio Hayasaka and the assistant directors, {{and was not}} involved in their creative process. Fumio Hayasaka was a strong proponent of using Japanese music in Japanese films. For Ugetsu, he employed geza music, common in Kabuki theatre. Additional, uncredited composers were Ichiro Saito and Tamekichi Mochizuki, whose music was blended with Hayasaka's, and could provide accurate music <b>reflective</b> of the period.|$|E
5|$|Mullsjö Municipality was {{newly created}} in 1952. The coat of arms, granted in 1977, was {{proposed}} by the municipality's recreation committee, to market the municipality as a center for winter sports. The snow crystal is a relatively modern charge, and the modern tree-top line, called kuusikoro in Finnish, is <b>reflective</b> of the Finnish influence on Swedish heraldry. Blazon: Azure, a snow crystal argent beneath a spruce-top chief of the same.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses use {{camouflage}} when hunting, and {{to avoid}} predators. To do this they use specialised skin cells which change {{the appearance of the}} skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or reflectivity. Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have three of these colours, while some have two or four. Other colour-changing cells are <b>reflective</b> iridophores and white leucophores. This colour-changing ability is also used to communicate with or warn other octopuses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reflective</b> of the {{documentary}} theme, Yamaguchi saw the album expressing {{the ups and downs}} of regular days, more so than previous albums. Despite the inspiration taken from the heavy events of the earthquake, Yamaguchi felt that because the album featured three singles that were tailored to be heard by a wide audience, which pushed the album into a brighter sound.|$|E
5|$|Services {{were held}} at the National Cathedral, and over 1,000 persons attended. Pursuant to Justice Black’s wishes, the coffin was “simple and cheap” and was {{displayed}} at the service {{to show that the}} costs of burial are not <b>reflective</b> of the worth of the human whose remains were present.|$|E
5|$|Spiral arms {{also have}} the ability to cause climatic changes on a planet. Passing through the dense {{molecular}} clouds of galactic spiral arms, stellar winds may be pushed back to the point that a <b>reflective</b> hydrogen layer accumulates in an orbiting planet's atmosphere, perhaps leading to a snowball Earth scenario.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} shows symmetry {{around the}} central chorale. Expansive chorale movements using the complete orchestra frame the work. Both parts contain besides the bible narration (rec.) a <b>reflective</b> accompagnato recitative (acc.) and an aria with obbligato instruments. In {{the following table}} of the movements, the scoring is taken the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The timpani always play with the trumpets and are not mentioned.|$|E
5|$|Triton's south {{polar region}} is covered by a highly <b>reflective</b> cap of frozen {{nitrogen}} and methane sprinkled by impact craters and openings of geysers. Little {{is known about the}} north pole because it was on the night side during the Voyager 2 encounter, but it is thought that Triton must also have a north polar ice cap.|$|E
5|$|Where {{transparency}} {{cannot be}} achieved, {{it can be}} imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly <b>reflective.</b> At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by silvering.|$|E
5|$|A <b>reflective</b> layer {{behind the}} tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, {{enhancing}} vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E
5|$|Enemies & Allies is a 2009 {{novel by}} American science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson. The book {{is set in}} the 1950s, {{in the midst of the}} Cold War, and follows Superman and Batman. Though {{suspicious}} of each other, they confront Lex Luthor who stages an international nuclear conflict and spreads fear of an alien invasion so that he can sell advanced weapons to governments. Themes used in the novel, <b>reflective</b> of the 1950s era, include alien invasion films, nuclear threats, and Cold War paranoia.|$|E
5|$|Meditation discussions {{start in}} the eighth chapter of the text, where 40 verses discuss how to start and develop meditative {{practices}} {{with the help of}} Om and resonating sounds, followed by 44 verses in the ninth chapter for advanced meditation that is <b>reflective</b> on one's mind, Vedana (feelings) and nature of one's Atman (self, soul). The text dedicates 23 verses in the tenth chapter on samadhi (concentration) to become aware of the equality of one's Atman and Brahman (Universal Ultimate Reality, God).|$|E
5|$|Since Svalbard {{is located}} {{north of the}} Arctic Circle it {{experiences}} midnight sun in summer and polar night in winter. At 74° north, the midnight sun lasts 99 days and polar night 84 days, while the respective figures at 81° are 141 and 128 days. In Longyearbyen, midnight sun lasts from 20 April until 23 August, and polar night lasts from 26 October to 15 February. In winter, the combination of full moon and <b>reflective</b> snow can give additional light.|$|E
5|$|The {{cloud cover}} {{is such that}} typical surface light levels are similar to a partly cloudy day on Earth, around 5000–10000 lux. The {{equivalent}} visibility is about three kilometers, but this will likely vary with the wind conditions. Little to no solar energy could conceivably be collected by solar panels on a surface probe. In fact, due to the thick, highly <b>reflective</b> cloud cover, the total solar energy received by {{the surface of the}} planet is less than that of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a <b>reflective</b> layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that {{improves}} low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|To {{develop a}} {{distinctive}} {{look for the}} various species of the Covenant, Bungie artists drew inspiration from reptilian, ursine, and avian characteristics. A Covenant design scheme of purples and <b>reflective</b> surfaces was made to separate the alien from human architecture. The Covenant were generally well received by critics who appreciated the challenge they provided to players; several critics lamented the change of the main enemies from Elites to Brutes in Halo 3 and conversely praised their return in the later Halo: Reach.|$|E

25|$|A {{thin layer}} of {{aluminium}} or, more rarely, gold {{is applied to the}} surface, making it <b>reflective.</b> The metal is protected by a film of lacquer normally spin coated directly on the <b>reflective</b> layer. The label is printed on the lacquer layer, usually by screen printing or offset printing.|$|E
25|$|At the South Pole, the {{location}} of a large zone of high reflectivity coincides with {{the location}} of the Chao Meng-Fu crater, and other small craters containing <b>reflective</b> areas have also been identified. At the North Pole, a number of craters smaller than Chao-Meng Fu have these <b>reflective</b> properties.|$|E
