50|$|This is {{the protagonist}} of the dance of the Maskarada from Zuberoa, which lasts {{from the start of}} the carnivals and end on Tuesday. They {{celebrate}} it doing a show. In this shoe there are two different groups: the black <b>ones</b> and the <b>red</b> <b>ones.</b> The <b>red</b> <b>ones</b> are the characters that are elegantly and cleanly dressed (we can find Zalmantzain in this group). And the black ones are dressed as poor people. During the procession along the village, the black ones tried to annoy the <b>red</b> <b>ones.</b> When they arrive to the main square the <b>red</b> <b>ones</b> dance typical basque dances.|$|R

5|$|Crosby's number 87 Pittsburgh Penguins jersey {{was the top}} seller on the NHL's website from September 2005 to February 2008. In January 2005, an Air Canada {{baggage handler}} in Montreal stole Crosby's red Canada jersey from the World Junior Hockey Championship. It was {{recovered}} later in a mailbox. His white jersey from the tournament was temporarily delisted from an auction while the <b>red</b> <b>one</b> was missing. It eventually sold for $22,100, which went to youth hockey charities and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake relief.|$|E
5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the <b>red</b> <b>one.</b> If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E
5|$|White-and-red flags {{were first}} waved during a {{patriotic}} demonstration on May 3, 1916 in Warsaw. The organizing committee advised participants about the correct {{alignment of the}} colors, that is with the white stripe above the <b>red</b> <b>one.</b> Still, many demonstrators brought flags with the red stripe on top. On August 1, 1919, almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918, the Sejm officially introduced a white-and-red bicolor as the Polish national flag. In order to avoid confusion with the white-and-red maritime signal flag used internationally by harbor pilots and tugboats, the same act of Sejm introduced {{a variant of the}} flag with the coat of arms in the white stripe for use as a civil ensign and by Polish diplomats and consuls abroad.|$|E
5000|$|The badge {{consists}} of a shield with a black rectangle in the upper section bearing the initials SPFC in white. Below the rectangle is a red, white and black triangle. The badge also has five stars, two gold and three <b>red</b> <b>ones.</b> The gold ones denote Adhemar Ferreira da Silva's world and Olympic records and the <b>red</b> <b>ones</b> represents the three world championships won by São Paulo.|$|R

25|$|Early amniotes {{had four}} opsins in the cones of their retinas {{to use for}} {{distinguishing}} colours: one sensitive to <b>red,</b> <b>one</b> to green, and two corresponding to different shades of blue. The green opsin was not inherited by any crown mammals, but all normal individuals did inherit the <b>red</b> <b>one.</b> Early crown mammals thus had three cone opsins, the <b>red</b> <b>one</b> and both of the blues. All their extant descendants have lost one of the blue-sensitive opsins but not always the same one: marsupials and placentals (except for cetaceans) retain one blue-sensitive opsin while monotremes retain the other. Some placentals and marsupials, including humans, subsequently evolved green-sensitive opsins; like early crown mammals, therefore, their vision is trichromatic.|$|E

5000|$|The {{words for}} the Canadian {{advertising}} jingle from the 1970s until the mid-1990s were [...] "When you eat your Smarties, do you eat the <b>red</b> <b>ones</b> last? Do you suck them very slowly, or crunch them very fast? Eat those candy-coated chocolates, but tell me when I ask, when you eat your Smarties, do you eat the <b>red</b> <b>ones</b> last?".

25|$|To form a {{color with}} RGB, three light beams (one <b>red,</b> <b>one</b> green, and one blue) must be {{superimposed}} (for example by emission {{from a black}} screen or by reflection from a white screen). Each of the three beams is called a component of that color, {{and each of them}} can have an arbitrary intensity, from fully off to fully on, in the mixture.|$|E
25|$|One symbol {{described}} in The Urantia Book {{consists of three}} concentric azure circles on a white background. The circles are said to symbolize God's triune nature of Father, Son, and Spirit. When the Creator Son Michael, later incarnated on Earth as Jesus, went to war with Lucifer 200,000 years ago, he used the concentric circles on his banner. Lucifer's emblem was a solid black circle {{in the center of}} a <b>red</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of the components may be dictated by the distance from transmitter to receiver, the wavelength and the Rayleigh criterion or diffraction limit, used in standard radio frequency antenna design, which also applies to lasers. Airy's diffraction limit is also frequently used to determine an approximate spot size at an arbitrary distance from the aperture. Electromagnetic radiation experiences less diffraction at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies); so, for example, a blue laser is diffracted less than a <b>red</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

Three limited-edition Nintendo 3DS XL bundles were designed for Xerneas and Yveltal, a blue and <b>red</b> <b>one</b> featuring both Pokémon and a gold one featuring Xerneas, Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie. Pre-orders of X and Y in Japan were bundled with miniature figurines of the two legendary Pokémon. In 2014, three limited edition Nintendo 3DS XL systems featuring Xerneas and Yveltal were distributed at football matches played by Yokohama F. Marinos, Urawa Red Diamonds, and FC Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|Ince won his 30th England cap in May 1997 as England beat Poland 2–0 in Chorzow {{to leave}} them with an {{opportunity}} to get through to the World Cup provided they could beat Moldova at Wembley and then not lose to Italy in Rome. Moldova were duly dispatched 4–0 and Ince, in an incident reminiscent of Terry Butcher against Sweden seven years earlier, started the Italy match with a white England shirt and ended it with a <b>red</b> <b>one</b> after his own blood soaked the shirt following a deep cut to his head. The game ended goalless and England had qualified.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} {{colors of}} blue, {{white and red}} {{have been used in}} national team uniforms throughout history. Most teams used a blue uniform as the dark-colored uniform, and a white uniform for light-colored uniform. Red was occasionally used as a tertiary color. In the 2002 Asian Games, the dark-colored uniform was a <b>red</b> <b>one.</b> The SBP has consistently used the blue and white uniform as dark and light uniforms, respectively. Nike has been the official outfitter of the national team ever since the SBP took over. In the 2013 Asian Championship, the color white has been used to identify the team with the fans.|$|E
