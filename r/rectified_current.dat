40|$|Even though quantum pumping {{is a very}} {{promising}} field, it has unfortunately not been unambiguously experimentally detected. The reason being that in the experiments the rectification effect overshadows the pumped current. One of the better known ways to detect it is by using the magnetic field symmetry properties of the <b>rectified</b> and pumped <b>currents.</b> The <b>rectified</b> <b>currents</b> are symmetric with respect to magnetic field reversal while the pumped currents do not possess any definite symmetry with respect to field reversal.

50|$|The key {{difference}} between an alternator and a generator is that the alternator delivers AC (alternating current) to the external circuit, while the generator delivers DC (direct current). In both machines alternating current is induced in the armature, but the type of current delivered to the external circuit depends {{on the way in}} which the induced current is collected. In an alternator, the current is collected brushes bearing against slip-rings; in a generator, a form of rotating switch called the commutator is placed between the armature and the external circuit. The commutator is designed to reverse the connections with the external circuit at the instant of each reversal of induced current in the armature, producing <b>rectified</b> <b>current</b> or direct current. This <b>rectified</b> <b>current</b> is not pure like the current of a voltaic cell but is instead a pulsating current that is constant in direction and varying in intensity.|$|E

Polyphase rectifiers also balanced the load on the supply system, which is desirable for reasons of system performance and economy.|$|E

5000|$|The crystal {{detector}} demodulates the radio frequency signal, extracting the modulation (the audio signal {{which represents the}} sound waves) from the radio frequency carrier wave. In early receivers, the detector was a cat's whisker detector consisting of a fine metal wire, the [...] "cat's whisker", on an adjustable arm that touched a pea-sized lump of semiconducting mineral. The point of contact between the wire and the crystal produced a diode effect. The cat's whisker detector was a crude Schottky diode that allowed current to flow better in one direction than in the opposite direction. Modern crystal sets use modern semiconductor diodes.

40|$|SummaryThe {{transient}} receptor potential (TRP) {{channels are}} implicated in various cellular processes, including sensory signal transduction and electrolyte homeostasis.

Both GON- 2 and GTL- 1 are necessary for intestinal uptake of nickel, but GTL- 1 is continuously active while GON- 2 is inactivated at higher Mg 2 + levels.

5000|$|Reactor {{power winding}} current is {{regulated}} according to proportional control mode, when control angle of <b>rectified</b> <b>current</b> source thyristors is changed according to proportional mode depending on mismatching between the prescribed voltage setting and the voltage {{at the point}} of reactor connection. In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 - 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system - 1 - 2% of the reactor rated capacity. [...] Depending upon desired requirements, MCSR is adjusted {{in such a way that}} would be possible to realize either voltage level stabilization, or consumed reactive power value, or consumed current magnitude. Controlled reactors, same as their non-controlled analogues, are subdivided into bus reactors and line reactors. Based on this principle, MCSR design would be completed with additional element which ensures pre-biasing of electromagnetic part and subsequent inertialess energizing of the reactor (with power increase time less than one cycle of power frequency). Similar to all transformer equipment, MCSR is able to withstand long-term overload up to 120 - 130% as well as should-term overload up to 200%. Moreover, considering the additional measures and the control algorithms, MCSR realizes all functions of uncontrolled shunt reactor including ability to operate within the interval of single-phase automatic reclosing.|$|E

40|$|The {{regulatory}} role of pith {{cells in}} the stem in Na recirculation in sweet pepper was investigated by evaluating the transport characteristics of the plasma membrane of this cell type and comparison with those of root cells. Ion conductivity and Na permeability of the plasma membranes of protoplasts of both cell types were studied with the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration, before and after addition of NaCl to the bath medium. Protoplasts of both pith and root cells showed outward <b>rectifying</b> <b>currents</b> with a reversal potential (Vr) near to the equilibrium potential of K (EK). Addition of NaCl to the bath medium caused a stronger shift of the reversal potential, Vr, in pith protoplasts than in root protoplasts, indicating that the outward <b>rectified</b> <b>currents</b> are permeable to Na, especially in the pith cells. After plant exposure to exogenous NaCl via the nutrient solution for 1 week, Vr in the root cells was closer to EK than in the control plants and hardly shifted upon addition of Na. This indicated that the net permeability of the OR channel complement in the plasma membrane to Na was lower following exposure to Na. Vr in the pith protoplasts, on the other hand, shifted significantly {{more than in the}} control plants, suggesting an increase of the permeability to Na. Moreover, the Na channel blocker amiloride blocked the currents in this cell type.
