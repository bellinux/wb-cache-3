40|$|Purpose: Human {{hands are}} {{excellent}} in performing sensory and motor function. We have hypothesized that blood {{flow of the}} hand is dynamically regulated by sympathetic outflow during concentrated finger perception. To identify this hypothesis, we measured radial blood flow (RBF), radial vascular conductance (RVC), heart rate (HR), and arterial blood pressure (AP) during Braille reading performed under the blind condition in nine healthy subjects. The subjects were instructed to read a flat plate with raised letters (Braille reading) for 30 s by the forefinger, and to touch a <b>blank</b> <b>plate</b> as control for the Braille discrimination procedure. Results: HR and AP slightly increased during Braille reading but remained unchanged during the touching of the <b>blank</b> <b>plate.</b> RBF and RVC were reduced during the Braille character discrimination task (decreased by - 46 % and - 49 %, respectively). Furthermore, the changes in RBF and RVC were much greater during the Braille character discrimination task than during the touching of the <b>blank</b> <b>plate</b> (decreased by - 20 % and - 20 %, respectively). Conclusions: These results {{have suggested that the}} distribution of blood flow to the hand is modulated via sympathetic nerve activity during concentrated finger perception...|$|R

50|$|Both {{were based}} {{around the same}} handmade, wooden case, {{containing}} the telephone circuit and bell, but unlike the bellset, shown with the Tele 150, below, the Tele 121 had the transmitter mouthpiece screwed onto {{the front of the}} box and the switch hook, holding the receiver, protruding from the left hand side. Below the mouthpiece was a dial-mount, which either contained a dial(L) or a <b>blanking</b> <b>plate</b> (CB).

2500|$|In 1994 a {{whole new}} FTO coupé concept was created. The only body style was a 2-door coupé, and all FTOs were front wheel drive.

Earlier (pre-facelift) auto models had a four-speed version, whilst most facelift [...] auto versions had a five-speed. The most recognizable exterior styling change during 1997 was, in simple terms, to the front bumper - which went from two air intakes to a single deeper intake, restyled front lip and indicator/fog lighting arrangement.

40|$|The use of {{projective}} assessments has a {{long history}} and tradition within psychological testing. However, there is a relative lack of research using these techniques with people with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Asperger Syndrome (AS). People with ASD have common features known as the ???triad of impairments???: (a) impairments in social interaction (b) qualitative impairments in communication and (c) restricted, repetitive or stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests or attitudes. Herbert Phillipson???s (1955) Object Relations Technique (ORT) is a well-established projective assessment that examines an individual???s ability to describe object relationships. A review of the literature has revealed no published papers using the ORT with this client group. The ORT is a story-based assessment in which the participants respond to a set of ambiguous pictures displaying one, two, three person, or group situations and one <b>blank</b> <b>plate.</b> The test seeks to show the different ways an individual experiences, or will avoid, the particular object relationships. The expectation is that the participants will display a consistency between the four dimensions assessed and how they conduct and view relationships, and this will be reflected in the stories. Five participants were assessed using the ORT. The results were compared to the normative data supplied by Phillipson (1955). The study found that all the participants had difficulties with meeting the full criteria for the stories. Stories lacked emotional connections and interactions between the characters, with a reliance on basic emotional states. Problems were encountered in story production for the <b>blank</b> <b>plate.</b> When compared to normative data the participants displayed a range of perceptual variations in relation to the figures in the pictures. Further analysis was also conducted using Labov???s (1972, 1982) structural analysis which revealed difficulties with including all the elements in the stories. Miles and Huberman???s (1994) thematic analysis was also undertaken. The themes that emerged highlighted that the participants??? stories reflected their adolescent stage of development, though these are not always clearly articulated. Overall, the study highlighted the difficulties with using the ORT with an ASD population, which affects its practicality and usefulness for assessment purposes. The possible reasons for these difficulties are discussed...|$|R
50|$|For {{simplicity}} and reliability, mechanical pumps are used, driven by mechanical geartrains from the crankshaft. Reducing pump speed is beneficial {{and so it}} is usual to drive the pump from the cam (if this is mounted in the cylinder block) or distributor shaft, which turns at half engine speed. Placing the oil pump low-down uses a near-vertical drive shaft, driven by helical skew gears from the camshaft. Some engines, such as the Fiat twin cam engine of 1964, began as OHV engines with an oil pump driven from a conventional camshaft in the cylinder block. When the twin overhead cam engine was developed, the previous oil pump arrangement was retained and the camshaft became a shortened stub shaft. Even when the distributor position was moved from the previous block-mount to being mounted on the cylinder head camshafts, the oil pump drive remained in the same position, the unused distributor position now covered by a <b>blanking</b> <b>plate.</b> Small engines, or scooters may have internal gear pumps mounted directly on their crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of swirl flaps are mainly associated with fouling by exhaust gas recirculation, which leaves tarry deposits on the flaps {{and the inside}} of the intake manifold. Over time the flaps can begin to stick in one position and the engine management system may report an error code if the correct flap position cannot be achieved within a few percent of the design specification. More seriously, the flaps or their mountings can fracture under the strain and parts can enter the cylinder. This almost always causes major engine damage due to the very small clearances inside a diesel engine. The BMW M47TU 2-litre engine manufactured between 2001 and 2004, and the similar 3-litre engine, is notorious for swirl flap failure, as the small screws used to secure the flaps to their spindle will fall into the intake ports if the spindle fractures; in 2004 the intake manifold was redesigned to eliminate these. Some owners choose to have the flaps removed as a precaution, with <b>blanking</b> <b>plates</b> fitted to maintain manifold sealing. In many cases the impact on driveability and fuel economy is negligible.|$|R
