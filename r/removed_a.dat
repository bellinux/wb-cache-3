It is situated in St Georges Square near the town centre. For some years, electricity provider Seeboard fitted an electricity substation inside the tank, but this has now been <b>removed.</b> <b>A</b> protective cover was built over the tank in 1988.|$|E

The departure of TF18 from the Guadalcanal area <b>removed</b> <b>a</b> significant potential threat to the Ke operation.|$|E
5|$|Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis {{wrote the}} scripts for Blackadder episodes {{separately}} using word processors and then swapped the disks containing the scripts {{for each other}} to add or remove jokes and dialogue.

5|$|Castle Rising {{continued}} to be owned by the Howard family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by Mary Howard, and her husband Fulke Greville Howard. Fulke began to undertake restoration work, excavating {{the basement of the}} keep in 1822 and repairing some of the stonework. The ground level of the inner bailey, which had built up over the years, was lowered by about : according to the contemporary archaeologist Henry Harrod, this process required thousands of loads of earth to be dug out and <b>removed.</b> <b>A</b> great deal of medieval archaeological evidence was destroyed in the process, but the work uncovered the old Norman chapel and Harrod excavated the building in 1851. Mary continued the excavation work on the castle site after Fulke's death, and restored the stonework of the chapel.|$|E

5|$|Crytek {{contracted}} Ruffian Games {{to develop}} a competitive multiplayer mode for Ryse, but the feature was later cut from the final game. Despite that, a co-operative multiplayer mode was introduced, and tasked players to fight against waves of increasingly difficult human enemies. The team originally hoped to add sea battles and animals to the game, but after internal testing, these features were <b>removed.</b> <b>A</b> Xbox SmartGlass feature called the Challenge Editor was set to be introduced to the game after its launch. It allowed players to create custom challenges for the game's co-operative multiplayer. However, Crytek announced {{that the development of}} this feature had been ceased in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Early {{passenger}} carriages were of similar design {{to those used}} on railways in England at the time, holding eighteen passengers on first class carriages, and thirty on second class. Third class carriages originally had seats, but on 15 April 1840 a board decision declared that all future third class carriages were to be made without seats. All existing third class carriages also had their seats <b>removed.</b> <b>A</b> later board decision on 3 July 1840 ordered that third class carriages would be situated closest to the engine, followed by second class, with first class at the rear.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{a statue}} of Sir Robert Peel erected in Cheapside in 1855 was {{declared}} an obstruction to traffic and <b>removed.</b> <b>A</b> proposal that it be installed {{in front of the}} Bank of England fell through, and in 1952 it was erected in Postman's Park. In 1971 the Metropolitan Police requested that the statue be moved to the new Peel Centre police training complex, and the Corporation of London agreed. In place of Peel's statue, a large bronze sculpture of the Minotaur by Michael Ayrton was unveiled in 1973. Dominating the small park, in 1997 the Minotaur sculpture was moved to a new position on the raised walkway above London Wall.|$|E

Surgeons <b>removed</b> <b>a</b> tumor {{the size of a}} football that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center on February3, 1988. A ruptured duodenal ulcer caused kidney failure, and he declined to undergo the dialysis that might have prolonged his life for a few months. Watched over by his wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin Frances Lewine, he died on February15, 1988.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff {{determined}} that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting {{would soon be}} beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore {{the surface of the}} painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was <b>removed.</b> <b>A</b> new double layer of canvas was added {{to the back of the}} painting, and the three layers were glued together.|$|E
5|$|In December 1987, the Conservancy {{performed}} one of {{its first}} breed rescues when it <b>removed</b> <b>a</b> viable population of Santa Cruz sheep from Santa Cruz Island. The sheep {{were in danger of}} being eradicated by The Nature Conservancy, which was working to save indigenous vegetation that the breed used as food. The first twelve lambs were removed from the island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, which kept it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to adverse conditions.|$|E

5|$|In Hong Kong {{in early}} 2014, Invader {{installed}} 48 works. However, the city's Highways Department <b>removed</b> <b>a</b> roadside mosaic in Fortress Hill. Local residents were disappointed, {{and saw the}} removal {{as an example of}} the government only paying lip-service to promoting the arts in the city. In early 2015, a replica of the life-sized Hong Kong Phooey (HK 58) that had been removed, reached HK$1.96 million ($250,000) at auction at Sotheby's. NY 145, featuring an invader and an old Apple Computer icon, sold for HK$562,500 ($72,000).|$|E

On November 6, against the Houston Rockets, Roy hit a game-winning 30-foot jumper in overtime with eight-tenths of a second left.|$|E
5|$|Kami, Perempuan premiered in 1943 in Jakarta. It {{received}} multiple {{performances that}} year, some in Jakarta, some {{in other parts}} of Java. In 1950 Pane included Kami, Perempuan in his book Djinak-Djinak Merpati dengan Tjerita2 Sandiwara Lain, a collection of his stage plays. For this publication Pane <b>removed</b> <b>a</b> scene in which two neighbours came to visit the family, which included further conversation. Pane considered this scene to be anti-climactic, whereas without it the play's title became more appropriate. Another, smaller, change to the play was the removal of the names of Japan's enemies during World War II.|$|E

The same picture was mistakenly used by other agencies; {{it was on the}} website of The Daily Telegraph, but was <b>removed</b> <b>a</b> day later. In an interview with Al Jazeera on 7 July, WUC leader Rebiya Kadeer used the same Shishou photograph to defend the Uyghurs in Ürümqi. A World Uyghur Congress representative later apologised, explaining that the photo was chosen out of hundreds for its image quality.|$|E
