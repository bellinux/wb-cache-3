40|$|Vapours of {{recently}} introduced alkylate-based petrol for power saws, lawn mowers and other petrol-fuelled machines {{were compared with}} vapours of conventional petrol varieties. The composition of C 4 -C 8 hydrocarbons was determined by adsorption sampling and gas chromatography on an aluminium oxide column. Results are given for 22 specific arenes, alkenes and alkanes. Major advantages of the <b>reformulated</b> <b>petrol</b> with respect to health and environment are the virtual absence of benzene and alkenes in the vapours. The proportions of methylbenzene, hexane and cycloalkanes are also very low...|$|E
30|$|The {{other reason}} is that, within the {{transport}} sector, PM and ozone {{are seen as}} the main pieces of ‘unfinished business’. Thanks to widespread introduction of tailpipe catalysts, hydrocarbons and CO emissions have been reduced massively, and SOx has been cut greatly by <b>reformulating</b> <b>petrol</b> and diesel. Now it is PM’s and ozone’s turns to be reduced. For ozone, that job is not straightforward, because it is mostly created indirectly, from other primary pollutants.|$|R
