5|$|The nuckelavee is {{the most}} malevolent of the demons {{in and around the}} Scottish islands, without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able to control it is the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee {{confined}} during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, {{with the possible exception of}} kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water, therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it with water from the loch he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas to <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} before radio, {{dispatching}} locomotives involved using whatever means of communication were available. The BR maintained a helper station at a siding between Dellwood and Lanes Mills, south of Brockwayville. The 700 series Mallets stationed here were required to assist coal trains up to McMinn Summit. When this was necessary, the dispatcher would call the crew to work by ringing a phone booth located next to the siding. A loud bell generally sufficed to wake up the engine crew. On those occasions when it did not, the dispatcher would call the McMinn farm nearby, {{and one of the}} McMinn children would <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the siding to awaken the engineer and fireman.|$|E
60|$|THE SECRETARY. I think I'd better <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the {{printers}} {{to hurry}} them up.|$|E
60|$|Leaving Sam to {{be watched}} by Jasper Grinder, Baxter <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> one of the sleds and {{procured}} a long rope.|$|R
5000|$|The Vordere Brandjochspitze is a peak, [...] high, in the Nordkette in the Karwendel {{range and}} is one of its highest and most {{striking}} peaks. In its immediate vicinity to the north-northwest is its sister summit, the Hintere Brandjochspitze, which is about 40 metres higher. To the south a prominent arête <b>runs</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Brandjochkreuz (...) and the Achselkopf (...) and down to the Innsbruck quarter of Hötting. To the east, the main ridge of the Nordkette <b>runs</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Frau Hitt.|$|R
60|$|Sam Rover worked rapidly, and {{was soon}} as free as ever. Then he <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> where Tom was tied up and liberated his brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{has been}} an {{accident}} to the machinery," [...] he said to Mr. Merrick. [...] "I'll <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the mill and see what has happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't intend to," [...] he rejoined. [...] "But let's <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Turner's Shipyard. I've {{something}} in my mind there that may be of use to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon we'll <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Pocomoke; we'll find oysters in that locality, {{such as they}} are, an' there's no need {{of running}} {{too far away from}} the market." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know Funchal," [...] {{said the}} lady carelessly. [...] "A {{couple of years}} ago I had a seven-ton cutter-rigged yacht, the Banshee, and we <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Madeira from Falmouth." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{interested}} Ozma, of course, but it didn't interest Dorothy very much, so {{the little}} girl <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a big table on which was lying open Glinda's Great Book of Records.|$|R
5000|$|After the game, the Ghanaian goalkeeper <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Chabala {{and asked}} him what his secret was and Chabala's bemba reply became legendary in Zambian {{football}} circles - [...] "Kuiposafye (You just have to throw yourself)." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{reckoned}} {{all that}} in with my figgerin'. If you start for the Patuxent river I shall <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Delaware shore an' pick up a boat somewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{certainly}} 'ave a <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Boulogne," [...] said Pierce, [...] "and {{look about}} a bit. I'm {{going to do}} that next Easter myself, anyhow--see if I don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{old woman}} thought she'd jest <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. McFadden's for a sociable call," [...] he explained, with jaunty indifference, {{as he took}} {{a seat at the}} board.|$|E
60|$|A {{while later}} I <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{announce}} to the amazed Tom Peters that I was {{actually going to}} Harvard with him. He stood in the half-lighted hallway, {{his hands in his}} pockets, blinking at me.|$|R
60|$|I <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Orchard Slope {{and asked}} Diana <b>to</b> come <b>over</b> {{and examine the}} trunk with me. I hadn't {{received}} any instructions about keeping its contents secret and I knew Miss Emily wouldn't mind Diana knowing about them, whatever they were.|$|R
60|$|Fidus Achates <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{me at the}} end of {{the first}} act to say that all things were going pretty well; though he confessed to the titter in the house upon Miss Pritchard's first appearance, dressed exactly like an Indian princess.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it, lad, an' if you <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Blacktown to-morrow an' ask Mr. Hunter he'll {{show that}} the money has been paid for your schooling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now is our chance," [...] Sam whispered. [...] "It won't take us {{more than}} ten minutes to <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> your house, {{and we can get}} back before Bill comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} forget your kindness, Jacques; and if I am still at Dover when peace is proclaimed I will <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Dunkirk {{by the very}} first vessel that sails." ...|$|E
60|$|As Tom <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his brother's side {{he could}} not help but give a glance at the flying machine, which was rising higher and higher in the air, with a noise from the engine that sounded like a battery of gattling guns in action.|$|R
25|$|As Mixon fled, some {{witnesses}} called 911, {{while others}} <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the stricken officers and started providing comfort and CPR until ambulances {{arrived at the}} scene.

60|$|The {{next morning}} Peter <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Smiling Pool to ask Grandfather Frog {{if he had}} any idea who could have such a voice as that. When he tried to tell Grandfather Frog what that voice was like, he couldn't. He just couldn't {{describe}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose {{we take a}} <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Spell farm?" [...] {{suggested}} Jack one day. [...] "I've {{been wondering}} whether they really went ahead {{or whether it was}} only a bluff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe I'll take a <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Paris," [...] he thought. [...] "I must be {{home again}} by Saturday, {{to meet the}} Demon, so I'll have to make every day count." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll just <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Smiling Pool and ask Grandfather Frog. He'll surely {{know what}} Mr. Toad does {{with his old}} suits," [...] said Peter Rabbit, and began to hop faster.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go now," [...] said she. [...] "I just <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> welcome you, Mrs. Scammel, {{and to ask}} you and Ingua to dine with us to-morrow night. Will you come? Josie O'Gorman is with us, you know, and I {{believe you}} are old friends." ...|$|R
60|$|Then the English drew back, sullen and dogged, bearing Bambro' with them, and the Bretons, {{breathing}} hard, gathered {{again in}} their own quarter. At the same instant the three prisoners picked up such weapons as were scattered upon the grass and <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> jo{{in their own}} party.|$|R
60|$|As {{she spoke}} the sun dipped, {{and the cold}} shadow {{suddenly}} fell on us. We all stood still for a while. Silvio jumped from my arms and <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his mistress, rearing himself up against her dress as if asking to be lifted. He took no notice whatever of the mummy now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose we just <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Norway," [...] {{said one}} of us; {{and then came the}} idea, what we should do if we got over there, seeing none of us {{understood}} Norse.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a mind to}} <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Rocca Marina and {{see what}} more they have heard there," [...] said Lord Rotherwood. [...] "I suppose your letter is {{from one of the}} girls there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, boy!" [...] said Mr. Henchy, [...] "will you <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> O'Farrell's {{and ask him}} to lend us a corkscrew--for Mr. Henchy, say. Tell him we won't keep it a minute. Leave {{the basket}} there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A draw! A draw!" [...] shrieked every one, and {{the crowd}} in an instant {{dispersed}} in every direction, the pedestrians running {{to get a good}} lead upon the London road, and the Corinthians in search of their horses and carriages. Harrison <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Wilson's corner and shook him by the hand.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, zombie Charity <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the cave, {{where she}} was confronted by the real Charity. Timmy also started to use the Demon's horn. Zombie Charity and real Charity got into a scuffle and Timmy got struck by zombie Charity gravely {{injuring}} him. The real Charity woke up and used the horn destroying zombie Charity.|$|R
50|$|Ryan assures Mike {{that they}} will find Lily and Joe and {{eventually}} live a normal life. The two return to Ryan's apartment {{and there is a}} knock at the door. Mike sees Claire and <b>runs</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Ryan, saying he can explain everything. The door opens and Ryan stares at Claire in complete shock.|$|R
