40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on the impact of EMU on trade, adding two new elements. First, we propose a theoretical model for explaining how the euro could have increased trade by the large amounts found in the empirical literature. Second, we propose a sectoral dataset to test the insights from the theory. Our theoretical model shows that in a monopolistic competition set-up, the effect of exchange rate uncertainty on trade has nonlinear features, suggesting that EMU and a standard measure for exchange rate uncertainty should be jointly significant. Our empirical results confirm this finding, with a trade creating effect between 108 and 140 % in a pooled regression, and between 54 to 88 % when sectors are estimated individually. Importantly, we find evidence for a trade creating effect also for trade with third countries.

40|$|Since Rose (2000), many {{scholars}} have found empirical evidence linking trade to {{exchange rate volatility}} and currency unions. Our paper takes {{a first step toward}} providing theoretical underpinnings for this “Rose effect”. In our Melitz-like trade model, reduced volatility boosts trade by inducing existing exporters to export more and by inducing more firms to begin exporting. Specifically, volatility is a greater hindrance to export for small firms, so reduced volatility especially promotes small firms’ exports. Because most firms are small, the extra exports induced by a marginal reduction in volatility may increase as the level of volatility falls – a result that can account for the convexity of the trade-volatility link implied by the <b>Rose</b> <b>effect.</b> We derive and test three new empirical hypothesis generated by our model. We find some support for two of them using data on Eurozone aggregate bilateral trade, but have insufficient data to test the third in a convincing manner. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of the spatial distribution of stellar wind velocities (Wind <b>Rose</b> <b>effect)</b> on the X-ray light curve of highly eccentric binaries is examined using the properties of spherical-symmetrical and Be disk-fed outflow. The effects of the wind geometry, velocities and densities in the stellar wind of the Be star and of the orbital motion of the neutron star on the expected X-ray luminosity are investigated. It is shown that {{the shapes of the}} X-ray light curves depend strongly on the outflow velocity of the gas ejected by the Be star at the orbital distance of the compact object. If vwind ≪ vorb then the X-ray luminosity is high and the X-ray light curves are determined by the orbital velocity of the neutron star. The effects of changes in the mass loss rate of the Be star and in the orbital separation on the expected X-ray light curves are studied.

The stainless steel exhibited a transition in surface from laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS), of the order of 1 µm, to grains via a LIPSS/mountainous double structure. The wettability of the stainless steel surface was characterized by measuring the contact angle and was observed to have changed from a hydrophilic surface (63. 6 °) to a superhydrophobic one (160. 0 °) due to the laser processing. This equated to an increase in contact angle of approximately 100. 0 °. This has been attributed to the creation of hierarchical surface structures that exhibit the <b>rose</b> petal <b>effect.</b> Additionally the contact angle hysteresis and the surface roughness have been measured and characterized. The use of a picosecond laser to generate such surfaces demonstrates a viable, low-cost alternative to using a femtosecond laser...|$|R

Bacteriophage presumed to have injected its deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) exhibited a dense, hollow, disc-shaped core. Within the cytoplasm of infected bacteria, the peripheral membrane of the viral heads was clearly visible. Aberrant forms containing the hollow core and believed to be devoid of DNA were encountered in studies of the normal course of development. Hydroxyurea, which is believed to interfere with the production of infective bacteriophage by inhibiting DNA synthesis, resulted in the appearance of viral particles with the hollow disc or with bizarre, distorted cores. However, a significant number of viral heads looked entirely normal and presumably contained a full complement of DNA. Hypotheses are presented to explain these observations...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a small Keynesian model {{of economic growth}} which is centered around two advanced types of Phillips curves, one for money wages and one for prices, both being augmented by perfect myopic foresight and supplemented by {{a measure of the}} medium-term inflationary climate updated in an adaptive fashion. The model contains two potentially destabilizing feedback chains, the so-called Mundell and Rose-effects. We estimate parsimonious and congruent Phillips curves for money wages and prices in the US over the past five decades. Using the parameters of the empirical Phillips curves, we show that the growth path of the private sector of the model economy is likely to be surrounded by centrifugal forces. Convergence to this growth path can be generated in two ways: a Blanchard-Katz-type error-correction mechanism in the money-wage Phillips curve or a modified Taylor rule that is augmented by a term, which transmits increases in the wage share (real unit labor costs) to increases in the nominal rate of interest. Thus the model is characterized by local instability of the wage-price spiral, which however can be tamed by appropriate wage or monetary policies. Our empirical analysis finds the error-correction mechanism being ineffective in both Phillips curves suggesting that the stability of the post-war US macroeconomy originates from the stabilizing role of monetary policy.

The {{aim is to}} investigate exchange rate volatility impact on foreign trade and to test {{for the presence of}} the so-called <b>Rose</b> <b>effect</b> in relation to the Euro currency area. I develop a novel complex approach to the estimation of the gravity equation when the assumption of homogeneous reaction within the group of studied countries is relaxed. New methodology, tests and implementation is proposed. I develop several heuristic methods that permit effective clustering of countries in a selection of subgroups. The clustering process is iterative: in each step, countries are redistributed in new subgroups and the process is terminated, when no subsequent superior redistribution is possible. Finally, the effective selection of subgroups of countries is chosen to minimize an appropriately defined objective function. Results of the proposed heuristic tests suggest that no dominant method exists. Therefore, an algorithm of chaining of alternative heuristic methods is proposed. After the solution is achieved with one method, an alternative method is imposed and the search for the optimal solution continues, until the objective function reaches its minimum. The proposed methodology is applied to estimate the gravity equation of foreign trade with the extension that permits to assign countries into optimally selected subgroups using the newly introduced algorithms...|$|E

The Mn nano-sculptured thin films were designed and fabricated by oblique angle deposition of Mn on glass substrates at room temperature. The obtained structure was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The wettability of thin films samples was investigated by water contact angle (WCA). The 4 -pointed helical star-shaped structure exhibits hydrophobicity with static WCAs of more than 133 ° for a 10 -mg distilled water droplet. This sample also shows the <b>rose</b> petal <b>effect</b> with the additional property of high adhesion. The Mn nano-sculptured thin films also act as a sticky surface which is confirmed by hysteresis of the contact angle obtained from advancing and receding contact angles measurements. Physicochemical property of liquid phase could effectively change the contact angle, and polar solvents in contact with hydrophobic solid surfaces do not necessarily show high contact angle value.|$|R

Effects of storage temperature and storage atmosphere on vase life parameters of morning and afternoon harvested roses were studied for imported cut <b>roses.</b> The <b>effect</b> of carbon dioxide as a postharvest treatment on the control of Botrytis cinerea was also investigated. Storage at uniform 2 °C for 10 days reduced the vase life of morning harvested roses compared to the afternoon harvest and the non stored controls. Storage at 2 °C caused chilling injury on the foliage of 'Cream Prophyta' with no effect on 'Duett' and 'Golden Gate' roses. When roses were stored at fluctuating temperature (2115 °C) this accelerated flowering opening in 'Golden Gate' roses and caused development of Botrytis in 'Duett' roses. Furthermore, fluctuating temperature caused bent neck in 'Golden Gate' and 'Cream Prophyta' roses. There was a varietal difference in the response to the levels of carbon dioxide used for modified atmosphere storage and Botrytis control. Storage of 'Cream Prophyta' roses in 15 % CO 2 did not improve vase life while it delayed development of Botrytis in 'Duett' with 'i_. •. • - an improvement in the vividness of the colour of the petals and vase life.
