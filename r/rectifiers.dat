5|$|In 1873, Willoughby Smith {{found that}} the {{electrical}} resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell {{was used in the}} photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium <b>rectifiers</b> began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide <b>rectifiers</b> because they were more efficient. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon <b>rectifiers.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the germanium transistor in 1948 {{opened the door to}} countless applications of solid state electronics. From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high-purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors, diodes, and <b>rectifiers.</b> For example, the company that became Fairchild Semiconductor was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors. Silicon has superior electrical properties, but it requires much greater purity that could not be commercially achieved {{in the early years of}} semiconductor electronics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rectifier</b> {{circuits}} {{are often}} classified {{by the number}} of current pulses that flow to the DC side of the <b>rectifier</b> per cycle of AC input voltage. A single-phase half-wave <b>rectifier</b> is a one-pulse circuit and a single-phase full-wave <b>rectifier</b> is a two-pulse circuit. A three-phase half-wave <b>rectifier</b> is a three-pulse circuit and a three-phase full-wave <b>rectifier</b> is a six-pulse circuit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} a new bidirectional hybrid three-phase <b>rectifier</b> suitable for high power applications. The <b>rectifier</b> employs a three-phase diode bridge <b>rectifier</b> and a Boost-type three-phase PWM <b>rectifier.</b> The proposed <b>rectifier</b> {{is capable of}} providing sinusoidal input currents with low harmonic distortion and DC output voltage regulation. The <b>rectifier</b> topology generation, the principle of operation, control scheme and simulation results are described in the paper...|$|R

5|$|When {{the order}} was placed, {{it was the first}} Norwegian {{electric}} locomotive with the mechanical components built in Germany. At the same time, NSB ordered five six-axle diesel-electric locomotives from Thyssen-Henschel (Mark Di 4), almost the same as the Danish Mark ME 1500. The Di 4/ME 1500 have many similarities to its electric counterpart El 17. The two were planned to have the same <b>rectifiers</b> and motors, but due to weight restrictions the El 17 received the same type as Class 120.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Oslo Sporveier again {{proposed}} {{closing the}} Ekeberg Line. This time {{the reason was}} {{the construction of the}} Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station, which would involve construction work around Jernbanetorget. This proposal also resulted in a public reactions, and the same arguments from the mid-1960s were repeated. Again the suggestion to link the Lilleaker Line to the Ekeberg Line were launched. Oslo Sporveier calculated it would cost NOK3.6 million for investments, including rebuilding 20 Gullfisk trams, new <b>rectifiers</b> and new tracks. This was less than the necessary 30 buses needed for conversion to bus services.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Flytoget {{announced}} that they had ordered a fourth car {{for each of the}} units. This increased the capacity of each unit by 40% to 244 seats, and allows the company to manage the annual 10% growth in passengers. The delivery of the fourth cars started in 2008 and were built by Bombardier Transportation, who has bought ADtranz, with the rebuilding scheduled to be completed during 2009. The rebuilding created several challenges for Bombardier, since most of the components used in the class were no longer available. Significant components such as the car body and <b>rectifiers</b> had to be built by Bombardier based on abandoned production lines, and many of the original manufacturers for the interior have become defunct.|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{optimization}} {{method for}} the <b>rectifier</b> circuit of a vibration energy harvesting system that uses macro-fiber composite (MFC) piezoelectric elements. MFC elements have previously been investigated intensively for piezoelectric energy harvesting. A bridge <b>rectifier</b> circuit composed of diodes and capacitors {{is often used}} as the <b>rectifier</b> circuit, which functions as an AC–DC converter. In contrast, a double-voltage <b>rectifier</b> circuit can generate twice the voltage of the bridge <b>rectifier.</b> In this study, both types of <b>rectifier</b> circuits are optimized by varying {{the values of the}} diode forward voltages and thecapacitance of the capacitors. In addition, the current–voltage characteristic and electric power efficiency of these <b>rectifier</b> circuits are evaluated and compared. The experimental results show that the electric power efficiency of the bridge <b>rectifier</b> circuit is higher than that of the double-voltage <b>rectifier</b> circuit at maximum electric power; however, the double-voltage <b>rectifier</b> circuit is suitable foruse in high voltage situations. In addition, the use of diodes with lower forward voltages leads to higher electric power efficiency, but the capacitance of the capacitors has no effect on electric power efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The drive towards high {{efficiency}} wind energy conversion systems {{has resulted in}} almost all the modern wind turbines {{to operate in the}} variable speed mode which inevitably requires back-to-back power electronic converters to decouple generator dynamics from the grid. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present an analysis on suitable topologies for the generator-side converter (<b>rectifier)</b> of the back-to-back converter arrangement. Performance of the two most popular <b>rectifier</b> systems, namely, the passive diode bridge <b>rectifier</b> and the active six-switch two-level <b>rectifier</b> are taken as two extremes to evaluate other topologies presented in this paper. The other <b>rectifier</b> systems considered in this study include combinations of a diode bridge <b>rectifier</b> and electronic reactance(s), a combination of a <b>rectifier</b> and a dc-dc converter and a half controlled <b>rectifier.</b> Diode-clamped and capacitor-clamped three-level active <b>rectifier</b> topologies and their possible switch reductions are also discussed in relation to the requirements of modern high power wind energy conversion systems (WECSs). Simulation results are presented to support conclusion derived from this analysis...|$|R

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such <b>rectifiers</b> are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium <b>rectifiers</b> have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E
5|$|Each boiler powered a turbo generator, made by Parsons, Newcastle upon Tyne. These were three-cylinder {{reaction}} type {{steam turbines}} operating at 3,000rpm, generating 60MW of electricity. The stations used {{them because of}} a Statutory Order of the Ministry of Supply in November 1947 that all turbo alternators made for the home market could only be of 60MW at advanced steam conditions. Stella South had a total generating capacity of 300MW and Stella North originally 240MW (later recorded as only 224MW). The stations {{were the first to}} use silica removal beds in their turbines, a development which became standard within the CEGB's power stations for some time. In 1967, one of the sets at Stella South became the world's first in commercial operation to use brushless excitation. The set was modified by Parsons to use A.C. exciters and silicon diode <b>rectifiers.</b> The stations' switchgear was manufactured by A. Reyrolle & Company.|$|E

5|$|Operation {{proved to}} give several major difficulties, and by March 2001, Oslo Sporveier was {{threatening}} to terminate the purchase agreement unless the manufacturer—who by then had merged to become AnsaldoBreda—fixed the problems. These included the noise being 15dB too loud, and trams being out of service during the January–February cold spell, when batteries and <b>rectifiers</b> would not operate. It was agreed that AnsaldoBreda would have to replace all 256 motors to satisfy the criteria in the contract. By 1 June, AnsaldoBreda had delivered one tram that met all the contract's criteria. Tram 155 was by then still undelivered, and was being used for testing by the manufacturer. At the same time, 149 was being used for tests in Oslo. The trams were taken out of service, and gradually put back as they were upgraded. In February 2002, tram 155 was equipped with new motors, and a new agreement was made where all motors would be replaced by December 2003, if Oslo Sporveier was satisfied with six months of trials with 155.|$|E
5|$|The first Norwegian-built tram was {{delivered}} on 16 February 1983 {{and put into}} service on 9 March. The last unit was put into service on 10 January 1984. The Strømmen trams were numbered 111 through 125. There were few problems in the start, although the pantographs had technical problems and there were occasional power failures in the overhead wires due to out-of-date <b>rectifiers</b> {{not being able to}} handle the increase power usage. Trams no. 101 through 113 were put into service on Line 9 on the Lilleaker Line and the Ekeberg Line, replacing the Class E. The remaining trams of the first series were put into service on Line 1, on the Sinsen Line and the Briskeby Line, as well as Line 7, on the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Sinsen Line. On Line 9, that included both the tramway's light rail sections, only SL79-trams were used, while lines 1 and 7 used a mix of SL79 and SM53-trams.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and <b>rectifiers.</b> Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E

50|$|A <b>rectifier</b> and {{a filter}} {{capacitor}} were connected directly to the mains. If the mains power was AC, the <b>rectifier</b> converted it to DC. If it was DC, the <b>rectifier</b> effectively acted as a conductor. When operating on DC, the voltage available was reduced by the voltage drop across the <b>rectifier.</b> Because an AC waveform has a voltage peak that {{is higher than the}} average value produced by the <b>rectifier,</b> the same set operating on the same root mean square AC supply voltage would have a higher effective voltage after the <b>rectifier</b> stage. In areas using 110-120 volt AC, a simple half-wave <b>rectifier</b> limited the maximum plate voltage that could be developed; this was adequate for relatively low-power audio equipment, but television receivers or higher-powered amplifiers required either a more complex voltage doubler <b>rectifier</b> or warranted the use of a power transformer with a conveniently high secondary voltage.

Additionally, the use of a transformer allowed multiple independent power supplies from separate transformer windings for different stages.|$|R
