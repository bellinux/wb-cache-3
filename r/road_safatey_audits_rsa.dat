40|$|A Road Safety <b>Audit</b> (<b>RSA)</b> is {{a formal}} review of an {{existing}} or proposed road segment or intersection by an independent, multi-disciplinary team. The purpose of an RSA is to identify safety concerns and suggest possible countermeasures to the project owner. There are several benefits to conducting RSAs, including increased awareness of safety {{and a reduction in}} the number of crashes. The RSA process includes 8 steps during which the RSA team develops a list of findings and presents them to the project owner for consideration. The RSA process for an existing facility includes a field review during which the RSA team takes into consideration various elements of the facility, including geometry, operations, and user characteristics and interactions. This presentation provides an overview of Road Safety <b>Audits</b> (<b>RSAs)</b> as a tool to enhance road safety. The presentation describes the purpose of an RSA, the benefits of performing RSAs, the steps to conducting an RSA, and some typical safety concerns identified during an RSA.

40|$|A {{road safety}} <b>audit</b> (<b>RSA)</b> and a road safety {{inspection}} (RSI) {{are used to}} test the safety level of the road infrastructure. The RSA tests the design of new roads or the reconstruction of existing roads, whereas the RSI is used for testing existing roads. An RSA, therefore, aims to 'improve' the road safety before the road is built or reconstructed. At present, not many RSAs are carried out in the Netherlands, but the few experiences gained predict positive effects on road safety. The RSA has also shown its road safety value in other countries. An RSI can also contribute to road safety. An RSI can be carried out periodically on an entire network, but also on road sections that have an above average number of crashes. Various assessment methods are used in RSIs, none of which have standardized procedures. For a more systematic use of RSIs such standardization is desirable. Little is known about the effects of an RSI...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on changes to the {{implementation}} of road safety inspections in Ireland following the requirement, under EU Directive 2008 / 96 /EC on Road Infrastructure Safety Management, for the establishment of periodic road safety inspections (RSI) of existing roads, along with safety impact assessments, high accident concentration ranking and road safety <b>audits</b> (<b>RSA).</b> Ireland, along with fellow EU member states, were required to adopt guidelines ensuring road safety inspections were carried out by a competent entity in order to safeguard adequate safety levels for road infrastructure. By using a case study, this paper will outline the transition Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has made by embracing new technology. This proactive approach to improving road safety contrasts with the reactive ‘black spot’ approach based on historical collision data. Incorporating RSI and the additional requirements (e. g.

40|$|The {{procedure}} of road safety <b>audit</b> (<b>RSA),</b> which originated in Great Britain {{and is now}} being spread in several countries around the world, can be incorporated {{in the framework of}} designing, constructing, and operating road infrastructure as a means for preventing accidents.

The present paper focuses on the possibilities for further enhancing the consideration of human factor-related issues in RSA guidelines. This can be achieved through the incorporation of quantitative checks on consistency or driver work load. Such tests can give more weight to the auditors' reasoning. Moreover, the scope is investigated for providing increased opportunities for road user involvement in the RSA process. Public involvement is examined from the aspect of a group's representation, appropriate RSA stages, effective procedures, and responsibility.

40|$|AbstractGlobally, the Road Safety <b>Audit</b> (<b>RSA)</b> {{concept has}} been {{recognized}} as an effective tool in examining the crash potential of in-service and future roadways in planning and design stages. As such, there is critical need for a practical tool {{that focuses on the}} safety of the existing, as-built, local road facilities. As requested by the World Bank, the RSA process has been developed for this purpose, giving specific recognition to the safety performance of roadside and median barriers for three existing, typical freeways in Jiangxi, China, and to the gathering of design experience for a new RGF project. On top of a routine road safety audit process, a total of 172 roadside crashes are collected, with 74 belonging to single vehicle Run-off-Road crashes, and crash records are analyzed to supplement the qualitative auditing suggestions. The structure and safety performance of the roadside and median barriers in the three freeways reviewed are evaluated and compared with their counterparts in the US barrier system. Several critical issues were identified and improvement suggestions were recommended, including less attention being paid to the roadside Clear Recovery Zone (CRZ), weak barrier structures, un-protected roadside obstacles (i. e. barrier ends, advertisement signs, drainage ditches, etc.), and poor connections or transitions of rails. Based on these observations, detailed pertinent countermeasures for each issue have been suggested in a roadside safety audit report for guiding roadside safety design in the RGF project...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe general {{objective}} of the ECOROADS project is to overcome the barrier established by the formal interpretation of the two Directives 2008 / 96 /EC (on road infrastructure safety management) and 2004 / 54 /EC (on tunnels), that in practice do not allow the same Road Safety Audits/Inspections to be performed inside tunnels. The main problem is that, while from the user (driver) point of view a road is a unique linear infrastructure generally in open terrain and sometimes in closed environment (tunnels), the strict application of the two Directives leads to a non-uniform approach to the infrastructure safety management outside and inside tunnels. To overcome this barrier, ECOROADS projects aims at {{the establishment of a}} common enhanced approach to road infrastructure and tunnel safety management by using the concepts and criteria of the Directive, 2008 / 96 /CE on road infrastructure safety management and the results of related European Commission (EC) funded projects. Such an objective will be achieved through the following specific activities:Workshops with the stakeholders (European tunnel and road managers); Analysis/review of national practices regarding Road Safety Inspections (RSI) and Road Safety <b>Audits</b> (<b>RSA),</b> starting from the results of the two studies recently launched by the EC's Directorate for Mobility and Transport {{to assess the impact of}} the two Directives 2008 / 96 /EC and 2004 / 54 /EC [...] Exchange of best practices and experiences between European tunnel experts and road safety professionals; [...] Pilot joint safety operations in five European road sections which feature both open roads and tunnels; [...] Recommendations and guidelines for the application of the RSA and RSI concepts within the tunnel safety operations;Thanks to the high transferability of the ECOROADS results, the present formal gap between the Directive, 2008 / 96 /EC and the Directive 2004 / 54 /EC will be bridged, thus leading to “faster, more sustainable and better planned interventions with maximum safety for the workers and other traffic participants”...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{tools and}} procedures established {{in different countries}} which apply Road Safety <b>Audits</b> (<b>RSA).</b> These RSAs are utilized to identify potential safety problems and they concentrate on safety measures to overcome these problems. This technique is used to detect possible safety hazards, in the various stages of a scheme, before a new road is open to traffic. The slogan ‘Prevention is better than cure’ is already well known to us, and Road Safety Auditing can establish an association with road safety. The application of this preventive technique can prevent accidents or reduce the severity of accidents. Except for minimizing trauma, and increasing the designer’s awareness of road safety, RSAs can also reduce the overall lifetime cost of a scheme, for it is less likely that remedial rebuilding of road sections will take place. Therefore this report deals with schemes subject to design and redesign of new roads, rather than existing roads. Strict application of design regulations does not always lead to a safe road for general rules don’t always apply to specific situations. When applying an RSA, it improves awareness of road safety, and highlights safety among other aspects of road design. The main objective of safety audits {{is to ensure that}} highway schemes operate as safely as possible, i. e. to minimise the number and severity of occurring accidents. This can be achieved by avoiding accident-producing elements and by providing suitable accident-reducing elements. The purpose of safety audits is to ensure that ‘mistakes’ are not built into new schemes. The items summarised below, concerning the Great Britain situation, give quite a general picture about specific aims of the Road Safety Audit. (i) to minimise accident risk on the network adjacent to new schemes; (ii) to lay emphasis on safe design practice and increase the awareness of everyone involved in planning, design, construction, and maintenance of roads; (iii) to highlight the importance of taking into consideration the needs of all types of users; and (iv) to reduce the whole-life cost of the schemes, by minimising the need of future corrections. The UK definition is as follows: A formal procedure for assessing accident potential and safety performance in the provision of new road schemes, and schemes for the improvement and maintenance of existing roads. (Guidelines for The Safety Audit Of Highways, IHT, 1996) In order for a safety audit to be successful, some certain factors should be taken into consideration. The key factors that contribute to the efficiency of the safety audit may refer to the organisation and the selection of the audit team. With respect to safety audit organisation, support and commitment of senior management is necessary. Safety audits should {{be an integral part of}} an agency’s overall program. Local authorities often use a Road Safety Plan as a framework in which the RSA is placed. By doing so, the RSA is part of the overall safety management strategy. The purpose of the checklists is to insure that nothing is overlooked. Practitioners should not rely solely on them and are encouraged to expand them. Over the past few years checklists were re-considered and the new checklists in the revised guidelines are meant to indicate ‘principal issues’ rather than provide detailed lists of the items to be examined. Different checklists are provided for each safety audit stage. Checklists appear to be not very important. The usage of checklists decreases as the knowledge of Road Safety Audits increases. When conducting an <b>RSA,</b> the <b>audit</b> team should not try to redesign the scheme, instead they should pay attention to road safety for all kind of different road users, and theirs suspected road user behaviour. The way this should not be done, is to compare the design with relevant standards and see if it matches, but the audit team should check if the design appropriately interacts with the design standards, for strict application of standards does not always lead towards a safe road. Some other findings about RSA are mentioned below. It is important that a site visit is carried out. Both in daylight and at night. Thus the visibility for different road users can be checked in the context of the road and its surroundings. When an RSA is carried out in an early stage of the design process it is less likely that ‘errors’ become embedded in the design and become harder to correct later on. A RSA should not seriously delay a design process, thus attention should be paid to the embedding of the RSA during the planning of the design process. Attention should be paid to monitoring and feed back to the audit team after opening of the road when accidents occur. The RSA process should be formally organised and its outcomes documented. Concerning the formalization and purity of an audit, it is to recommend that the audit results are documented before there is discussion (if any) with the client, and concessions could arise. Some say that a formalised RSA leads towards a more systematical approach and enlarges the chance on a consistent outcome. The ultimate level of formalisation is to make an RSA mandatory. Relevant plans and documents should be available to the audit team and should be mentioned in the report. It should be clear what should be audited, which tasks there are and who is responsible for those tasks. It can be beneficial to use the same names and numbers of stages for less misunderstandings and for comparison with other RSA documents. Probably the best way of introducing RSA is ‘top down’ (management and governmental) approval and ‘bottom up’ training. In this introduction stage the use of checklists could be useful. When introducing RSA, knowledge of accident investigation techniques or safety engineering audit team is necessary. Another crucial point in introducing RSA is to how to tell when a designer is wrong. The best answer dealing with this problem is probably an increase of accidents. On a European level, the procedure could perhaps be used in a highly aggregate level, using local knowledge of road safety when performing an RSA. A framework for the development of RSAs can be found in five points containing tasks for the different bodies responsible for different aspects of road safety: (i) National governments; they should develop RSA procedures and methods; (ii) National road authorities; they should perform pilot audits for all roads, including TERN; (iii) National organisations which are responsible for design guidelines & manuals; they should integrate RSA in tools for improving road safety; (iv) National road research institutes; they should evaluate RSA; and (v) European Commission; it should initiate pilot audits on TERN roads. These pilots should point out how the audits for TERN roads will be performed, with regard to procedures, the audit team, and responsibilities. Some European countries have developed a national RSA system. Many people involved in this development think of RSA as a promising way to improve road safety. RSA Pilot projects point out that design inaccuracies can be discovered in new road designs and RSA evaluations already carried out in some counties have been very positive; RSA seems to work. The introduction of an RSA system can either be done bottom up or top down. A bottom up approach can lead to a vast, enthusiastic participation whereas a top down approach can lead to a more explicit introduction. Although road safety comprising design solutions can be tracked using an RSA, the precise effects are yet still unknown. Quality is added to a national road system by using an RSA system. (A...|$|R
