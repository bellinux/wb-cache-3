5000|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "machine" [...] dates from early designs that used an {{electrical}} generator operated by winding a <b>rotary</b> <b>handle</b> or pushing down a T-handle. Modern blasting machines are battery-powered and operated by key switches and push-buttons, and do not resemble the older designs.|$|E
50|$|Mobile storage {{systems are}} usually {{constructed}} with a <b>rotary</b> <b>handle</b> {{on the exterior}} accessible face. When rotated, the handle operates the mechanism which winds the single, connected, filing unit either left or right, depending on a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the handle. In an office, for example, several stacks of moveable filing cabinets may be accommodated in a limited space.|$|E
40|$|The {{instrument}} has a {{work unit}} detachably coupled to a handle whose distal end {{is provided with}} a tool which is operable by the axial displacement of a rod running through the work unit. The work unit has a rotary connection to a <b>rotary</b> <b>handle</b> which can be turned by the work unit about the instrument's longitudinal axis and relative to a thumb handle, which can be adjusted together with a first operating element relative to the handle, so that the operating element acts on the longer arm of a double-arm lever system which is arranged in a fixed bearing relative to the handle. The shorter arm of the lever system engages in a second axially movable operating element connected to the rod {{in such a way}} that on adjusting the first operating element in a direction, the second operating element is adjusted by the rod in the opposite direction...|$|E
50|$|Only 75 µs is {{required}} to read 128 digital input pins and to write to 128 output pins. 16 <b>rotary</b> encoders are <b>handled</b> within 100 µs. Analog inputs are scanned in the background every 200 µs; changes larger than a definable minimum range trigger a user hook.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> pumps can <b>handle</b> solids (e.g., {{cherries}} and olives), slurries, pastes, and {{a variety}} of liquids. If wetted, they offer self-priming performance. A gentle pumping action minimizes product degradation. They also offer continuous and intermittent reversible flows and can operate dry for brief periods of time. Flow is relatively independent of changes in process pressure, too, so output is relatively constant and continuous.|$|R
40|$|Today, several {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} a visual display combined with a haptic <b>rotary</b> device for <b>handling</b> in-vehicle information system tasks while driving. This experimental study investigates whether a haptic addition to a visual interface interferes with or supports secondary task performance and whether haptic information could be used without taking eyes off road. Four interfaces were compared during simulated driving: visual only, partly corresponding visual-haptic, fully corresponding visual-haptic, and haptic only. Secondary task performance and subjective mental workload were measured. Additionally, the participants were interviewed. It was found that some haptic support improved performance. However, when more haptic information was used, the results diverged in terms of task completion time and interface comprehension. Some participants did not sense all haptics provided, some did not comprehend the correspondence between the haptic and visual interfaces, and some did. Interestingly, the participants managed to complete the tasks when using haptic-only information. Validerad; 2012; 20120302 (camgra) </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry, {{which employs}} {{a significant portion}} of working British Columbians, exposes workers to risk factors associated with the development of musculoskeletal disorders. Particularly problematic in the neck and shoulders are tasks requiring overhead work. Plumbers, electricians and sheet metal workers who frequently drill overhead to attach anchors for hanging pipes, ducts, conduit, and wiring trays are particularly at risk. Few intervention devices aimed at reducing these disorders have been developed for commercial use. This study used a participative approach involving workers, contractors and researchers to develop and evaluate an inverted drill press with different attachments to be used in construction. The intervention device supported a hammer drill {{at the top of a}} column and the column was advanced up during drilling using a <b>rotary</b> <b>handle</b> and linear gear. Four drilling methods were compared: the usual method where the worker uses a drill with the hands while standing on a ladder, the intervention device alone, the intervention device with a mirror system, and the intervention device with a camera and display system. Neck and shoulder angles, body fatigue, productivity and subjective ratings of usability were compared between methods. Our study revealed several important points: • Fatigue levels in the neck, shoulders, hands and forearms, lower back, and legs were less with all three intervention devices compared to the usual method...|$|E
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{test program}} for the MSL (Mars Science Laboratory) rotary percussive drill examined the e ect of various drill input parameters on the drill pene- tration rate. Some of the input parameters tested were drill angle with respect to gravity and percussive impact energy. The suite of rocks tested ranged from a high strength basalt to soft Kaolinite clay. We developed a hole start routine to reduce high sideloads from bit walk. The ongoing development test {{program for the}} IMSAH (Integrated Mars Sample Acquisition and <b>Handling)</b> <b>rotary</b> percussive corer uses {{many of the same}} rocks as the MSL suite. An additional performance parameter is core integrity. The MSL development test drill and the IMSAH test drill use similar hardware to provide rotation and percussion. However, the MSL test drill uses external stabilizers, while the IMSAH test drill does not have external stabilization. In addition the IMSAH drill is a core drill, while the MSL drill uses a solid powdering bit. Results from the testing of these two related drilling systems is examined...|$|R
40|$|Currently farmers {{that are}} {{starting}} to engage in organic crop production, mostly oriented to conventional technologies, making small changes, and use the available agricultural tools. However, agricultural plants environment in the organic field characterized by physical, chemical and biological properties which different from intensive farming options. These conditions should {{be reflected in the}} selection of appropriate technological operations, which in turn fit into certain limitations. Research on the adaptation of the basic crop cultivation technologies to the requirements of organic production is carried out in IAEP. For that purpose we developed a model of perspective technical and technological provision of organic farmers. The model considers a set of organic crop rotation, and for each crop of which the corresponding organic technology used. Technical means are selected from the general list contained in the model, {{depending on the size of}} the farm and the selected level of crop productivity. Economic and environment indicators are also calculated. Particular attention of the model is drawn to the following group operations: mechanical tillage, application of organic fertilizers, weed and pest control. Generally, organic farmers use ordinary technical means, but the model also considers promising. We use tillage system with different depths for organic crop rotation: cereal crops - at depth of 12 - 16 cm, for vegetable crops and potatoes at depth of 22 - 24 cm by mould board plough. In the presence of strongly marked "subsoil layer" or waterproof horizon the subsoil shattering is conducted to a depth of 45 cm by chisel cultivator. Fall tillage is an effective way to control weeds, diseases and pests. Promising is the use of technical means for the local application of solid manure in the furrow. A particularly important task in organic agriculture is weed control. In addition to crop rotation, the cultivation of root crops used ridge system and previously developed and then half-forgotten, <b>rotary</b> harrows to <b>handle</b> the ridge slopes during the growing season. Such rotary harrows were very effective for weed control in potatoes field experiment in 2016. Following operations: seeds cover by biological drugs; biological drugs application during seeding and on plants during vegetations, are including in technologies for organic control of deceases and pests. As a promising area is consider to use one of the physical methods for the precise removal of weeds. Also, the idea of precision agriculture can be used for imaging of a disease or pest on vegetation and accurate extermination on the small patch by biological drugs. The model of promising technical and technological provision of organic farm can be transformed into a software system that will be useful for agricultural producers engaged in organic crop production, as well as organizations providing their technical means...|$|R
