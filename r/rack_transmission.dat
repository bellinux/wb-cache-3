40|$|Abstract: This paper firstly {{established}} a three-dimensional modal of gear and <b>rack</b> <b>transmission</b> system. By using {{finite element analysis}} software the model is analyzed and the first six natural frequencies of the gear and <b>rack</b> <b>transmission</b> system are acquired. According to the natural frequencies, actual working speed can be adjusted to avoid resonance. In light of the modal analysis, the transient dynamic finite element model of the gear and <b>rack</b> <b>transmission</b> system is established for the transient dynamic analysis. According to the equivalent stress contour of the gear and rack in contact progress at various times and based on transient dynamic analysis, contact strength and bending strength of the gear are verified and the maximum equivalent stress position is found, providing a theoretical basis for the optimization of the gear and rack...|$|E
40|$|The {{misalignment}} of the gears {{is one of}} the main causes of premature failure in gear transmissions. This misalignment can be caused by different phenomena where the deformation of the elastic elements of the transmission usually has a major importance. In this paper, a pinion and <b>rack</b> <b>transmission</b> is used to investigate the {{misalignment of}} the pinion produced by the deflection of both shaft and bearings, focusing in the contribution of the bearings to this misalignment. For this task, a design space with 261 different cases of pinion and <b>rack</b> <b>transmission</b> has been explored. For each case, a realistic 3 D FEM model (including gears, shaft and roller bearings) has been created and the coupled structural and contact problem has been solved. From the results of the FEM models, the different parameters of misalignment of the pinion have been computed and analyzed through five studies. These studies revealed the high importance of the elasticity of the bearings in the misalignment of the pinion and, in general, the important error that can be assumed when the bearings are not included in the structural models of gear transmissions.

40|$|The {{considered}} {{method for}} assessing {{the quality of the}} repair work to restore the <b>rack</b> supports of <b>transmission</b> lines is based on the method of vibration diagnostics. Power transmission line supports with a symmetrical destruction of the protective layer of concrete in the ground in violation of the construction section were chosen as an object. Finite element modelling package Ansys was used in assessing the quality of repair work. The example of evaluating the quality of repair using the relative adhesion defective area design criteria in the analysis of natural vibration frequencies is given...|$|R
5000|$|The 1981 CT250S Silk Road was Honda's {{attempt at}} a [...] "trekking" [...] motorcycle, marketed between its {{mechanical}} siblings, the CB250RS road bike and the XL250 dirt bike. It has slightly more ground clearance than the CB250RS, and an upswept and close-fitted chrome exhaust that is kept clear of both debris and luggage. The Silk Road was offered with a single saddle followed by a chrome baggage rack. A removable pillion seat can be fitted to this <b>rack.</b> Its 6-speed <b>transmission</b> is geared as a regular 5-speed plus one extra-low gear.|$|R
50|$|The Taunus TC {{along with}} the Cortina Mk III and their successors have been {{produced}} in slightly updated forms in Europe, Argentina and widely across Asia by Ford or their local co-operators. Cortinas were also built in small numbers starting with the predecessor Cortina Mk II throughout the model series' European/east Asian lifespan under license by Korean automaker Hyundai. This led to the Cortina 80 {{at the end of}} its production life serving as a starting point for the first Hyundai Stellar which succeeded the Cortina line in South Korea, handing over some major technical components such as the steering <b>rack</b> and the <b>transmission</b> propelling shaft to the otherwise non-Ford successor.|$|R
5000|$|Production of the 4-door, 5-seat A8-16 series {{began in}} 1981. The design {{concept of the}} A8-16 was largely {{inspired}} by the SAAB and Volvo models including the ground breaking 1970s Volvo VESC safety concept car, with futuristic details such as the large headlamps, inclined nose and the high-positioned rear trunk - traits that were particularly associated with SAAB models. However, it also had details that appeared [...] "retro" [...] in 1981, such as the rear lights which originally belonged to Böcek, but didn't look good on the A8-16. The interior design and the materials used also did not please the traditional Anadol customers. Many of the design characteristics, especially the door windows and frames, were borrowed from older Anadol models such as the SV-1600 which was designed in 1973, and most potential customers saw this car as a hodge-podge of old Anadol spare parts, mixed with some new ideas. The new body still sat on a box-type perimeter frame with crossmembers, with independent coil sprung front suspension and a live, leafsprung rear axle. Steering is <b>rack</b> and pinion, <b>transmission</b> by {{the way of a}} four-speed manual.|$|R
40|$|The {{precision}} {{control of}} linear feed axes in machine tools is {{examined in this}} thesis. Al¬though high precision in machining has been {{a focal point for}} engineers for over 200 years, the traditional solutions have often been based on complex mechanical designs. In this thesis, two aspects of feed axis controller design are examined: i) the use of appropriate mathematical models and ii) the signiﬁcance of three of the most common performance limiting factors that have traditionally affected precision in linear feed axes. The three particular performance limiting factors considered are: i) dynamic stiffness, ii) torsional vibrations and iii) backlash. The most effective way of obtaining knowledge about a control system is through appro¬priate mathematical modelling. A new two-body model for a simple motor-transmission¬load system is presented in this thesis. This new model is shown to provide a more accurate representation of both the total inertia and lowest natural frequency of a system, when compared with the two-body model that is traditionally used by researchers and system designers. A new model to represent backlash in a two-body system is also pre¬sented. These new models are then extended to provide accurate mathematical models of four common linear feed axis drive conﬁgurations: i) a rotary motor driving a <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>transmission,</b> ii) a rotary motor directly driving a ballscrew transmission, iii) a rotary motor driving a ballscrew transmission via a synchronous belt, and iv) a linear motor directly driving the axis. Different control solutions to the problems of dynamic stiffness, torsional vibrations and backlash are examined in this thesis, with each controller implemented on specially con¬structed test-beds. An approach using Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is presented xxi for systems with inherently low dynamic stiffness. This QFT approach is shown to pro¬vide a transparent design process, which results in high dynamic stiffness. Different controllers for torsional vibrations are compared both theoretically and experimentally, with many previously published solutions shown to be theoretically equivalent. A new backlash controller is also presented, which is shown experimentally to provide dynamic stability and good tracking performance at both high and low velocities. The importance of treating these performance limiting factors simultaneously is also ad¬dressed in this thesis, with the control solutions developed to address some factors shown to also affect the other factors. The QFT approach is shown to provide a suitable inte¬grated design process, where the implications of any compromises, on the control of each factor, are clearly visible...|$|R
