50|$|Registered Cossacks {{formed an}} elite among the Cossacks, {{serving in the}} {{military}} under officers (starshyna), colonels (polkovnyk) and generals (hetman), under the Grand Crown Hetman (the highest Commonwealth military commander). A substantial minority of Cossacks formed skilled light cavalry units (choragiew), excellent skirmishers trained in mounted archery (and later using firearms), making lightning raids, harassing heavier, slower formations and <b>disengaging.</b> Those <b>units</b> were often used as support for heavy elite Commonwealth cavalry, the husaria, and were much cheaper to form than a hussar unit. The main Cossack units were the infantry, known for their tabor formation.|$|R
5000|$|Field Marshal Kesselring, {{despite being}} busy with {{avoiding}} {{the isolation of}} his forces and containing the Allied attacks launched in three different landing areas (Salerno, Apulia and Calabria), still managed to retain {{control of the situation}} and to carry out the tasks assigned within the [...] "Achse" [...] plan. He managed to quickly dissolve the Italian forces stationed in his area, to capture Rome and to <b>disengage</b> mobile <b>units</b> that were to be sent south against the Allies (the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division, after capturing Rome, reached Salerno on 12 September), but he had to restrict himself to summarily disarming the majority of the captured soldiers, then sending them back to their homes. Only 24,294 of the 102,340 Italian soldiers captured by Army Group C were held captive.|$|R
50|$|A {{clutch servo}} {{powered by the}} vacuum at the {{induction}} manifold operated the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operated a solenoid valve {{so that when the}} gear lever was moved the clutch was <b>disengaged.</b> A control <b>unit</b> made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.|$|R
5|$|During {{the day on}} September 3, Coulter and the KMAG {{advisers}} {{continued to}} clash with the ROK 3rd Division commander, who repeatedly attempted to withdraw his troops against their orders. That night, September 3/4, {{the remainder of the}} ROK I Corps front collapsed. Three North Korean T-34 tanks overran a battery of ROK artillery and then scattered two battalions of the newly arrived ROK 5th Regiment. Following a mortar preparation, the North Koreans entered An'gang-ni at 0220. An hour later the command post of the Capital Division withdrew from the town and fighting became increasingly confused. American <b>units</b> <b>disengaged</b> and withdrew and by nightfall, North Koreans held the town and began advancing southward along the railroad.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{battle for}} Hill 112 was fought {{at the end}} of Operation Epsom, when the tanks of 11th Armoured Division broke out from a {{bridgehead}} established by the 2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, part of 227th (Highland) Infantry Brigade 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, at Tourmauville. Hill 112 was an intermediate objective {{on the way to the}} River Orne crossings but such was the German reaction, that the 23rd Hussars were only able to capture and hold the hill with difficulty. Hill 112, {{at the end of}} a narrow salient, was held by the infantry of the 8th Battalion, Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own). Here they remained under shell and mortar fire until Ultra decryption of German radio traffic, showed that the II SS Panzer Corps was arriving. Before the German reinforcements could attack, General Bernard Montgomery ordered a withdrawal from the hilltop. Montgomery intended to hold the Panzer divisions (approximately seven), on the British-Canadian front, while the First US Army continued the Battle of Cherbourg and broke out from the beachhead. The American objective was feasible, because they had only the equivalent of [...] panzer divisions facing them, despite German attempts to <b>disengage</b> panzer <b>units</b> from the east end of the bridgehead.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis {{study investigated the}} airwake of an AOR Class model ship to provide basic flow pattern and velocity information to aid in solving the elusive problem of blade strikes experienced by H- 46 helicopters when they engage or <b>disengage</b> <b>rotors</b> aboard AOR ships. This investigation used the NPS flow visualization tunnel modified to simulate the atmospheric boundary layer. A detailed visualization was completed of the airflow near the flight deck area of a four-foot model in a stationary mode, utilizing helium bubbles, smoke, photographic and video equipment. The {{results show that the}} airwake is usually made up of two regions, one that is relatively smooth and one that is extremely turbulent. The dividing line is a shear layer that is created from the air flowing around the port face of the hangar. Another feature found both in the flow visualization, as well as the velocity measurements, was the presence of a significant upward component of flow over the port edge of the flight deck. It was found that this flow had nearly the same speed as the velocity measured at the ship's anemometer position but was inclined at an angle of between 15 and 25 degs. This upward flow, combined with the highly variable recirculations over the flight deck could be a significant contributing factor in the occurrence of blade strikes. In addition, some attempts were made to eliminate some of the more unruly flow patterns by using curved deflectors. These attempts had some success but will require further study.

50|$|On 21 January 1941, {{the orders}} were {{received}} {{to move to}} Albania. The Cagliari division completed its transfer to Berat on 31 January 1941, joining the Italian VIII Corps for the ongoing Greco-Italian War. First contact with the Greek forces was made on 8 February 1941 near Berat, with the clashes at Mali i Tërpanit and Paraspuar following soon. On 12 February 1941 the front had stabilised from Qafa e Bubësit to positions in valleys of Osum and Tomorrica rivers. On 11 March 1941, {{as part of the}} Italian Spring Offensive, after prolonged period of defence, the Cagliari division commenced attacks on Bubës, capturing it on 13 March 1941, only to fail miserably in the assaults on Monastery Hill (Height 731) a few kilometers south during 14-19 March 1941. As a result of Greek <b>units</b> <b>disengaging</b> after the start of the German invasion of Greece on 6 April 1941, the Cagliari division advanced to the ridge overlooking Këlcyrë Gorge from north on 15 April 1941, overcoming some Greek rearguard resistance. On 18 April 1941 it continued pursuit to Përmet, and reached the pre-war border stream of Perati on 20 April 1941, where some Greek rearguard once more tried to make a stand. After the end of active fighting, it was used as occupation force in Kalpaki. In June 1941, the division was transferred to the southern Peloponnese. Main garrisons were established in Tripoli, Kalamata and Sparta, performing mopping-up and anti-partisan duties. The division disintegrated following announcement of the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943.|$|R
