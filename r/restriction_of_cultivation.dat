Lining the main feeders {{into the lake}} and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultivation</b> {{in the bed of}} feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation {{to reduce the risk of}} death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake.|$|E

40|$|Since {{several years}} the {{adherent}} cell line E-FL (feline lung fibroblast) {{is used for}} production of mink enteritis virus (MEV) vaccine at commercial scale. Presently the industrial process is performed in roller bottles. For large-scale production this approach means high input of equipment and manpower connected with a comparatively high contamination risk. Additionally, monitoring and control <b>of</b> <b>cultivation</b> conditions is very limited compared to fully equipped bioreactors. Aim of our research project was {{the transfer of the}} existing production process from roller bottles into a microcarrier system (Cytodex 1) and the optimization with respect to virus yields. First experiments for characterization of growth and metabolism of E-FL on Cytodex 1 were carried out in spinner flask (250 mL-scale) using a minimal essential medium (MEM) with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and L-glutamine. Standard analytics included measurement of cell number, pH, pO 2 and extracellular metabolites (glucose, lactate, glutamine, glutamate, ammonia). As these first experiments were successful, the process was scaled up into a 5 L stirred-tank reactor using 1 g/L Cytodex 1 and a starting cell number of 0, 6 - 1105 cells/mL. After three days <b>of</b> <b>cultivation</b> confluence was reached with cell numbers of 7 - 9105 cells/mL. Using higher carrier concentrations and improved MEM the cell yield could even be increased to 1, 5 - 2106 cells/mL. Alternatively, <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> E-FL on Cytodex 1 in a novel wave bioreactor was established. Advantages of this system are low costs and its safety and simplicity in use under GMP <b>restrictions.</b> <b>Cultivations</b> <b>of</b> E-FL in the wave bioreactor were as successful as in stirred-tanks regarding cell numbers, morphology and metabolic activities. Optimal parameters for virus propagation were investigated by parallel cultivation in small scale fermenters (500 mL) using different MOI and starting cell numbers. Based on these results further experiments for virus propagation in stirred-tank-(5 L-scale) and wave bioreactor (1 L-scale) were carried out. Both culture vessels are compared with respect to cell growth and virus yields. We are able to show that both types of bioreactors are suitable for use in MEV vaccine production process. It is expected that slight advantages of stirred tank in cell number are more than balanced by low costs and simple GMP-conform handling of the wave bioreactor...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate the strains of fungi from Camembert type cheese, {{identify}} them and to test isolated strains of Penicillium camemberti for their ability to produce cyclopiazonic acid. The description of micro- and macromorphological features was used for identification of Penicillium camemberti strains. Strains were subsequently in vitro tested on their potential ability to produce mycotoxin cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). All of the 14 strains of Penicillium camemberti, which were obtained from 20 samples of Camembert type cheese, were cultivated 7, 14, 21, 27 and 30 days on CYA medium at 10 ± 1 °C, 15 ± 1 °C and 25 ± 1 °C in the dark. For determination of CPA production ability by P. camemberti isolates in vitro was TLC used.
