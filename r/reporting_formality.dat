In this sense, it is mentioned for example in the IMO Resolution A. 950 (23) “Maritime Assistance Service (MAS) ” adopted on 5 December 2003. It can also mean a service or institution on land that collects all information related to safety of navigation before sending them on ships, as defined in the IMO documents on e-navigation. Directive 2010 / 65 /EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 on <b>reporting</b> <b>formalities</b> for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States and repealing Directive 2002 / 6 /EC requires that vessels shall transmit reports mentioned in the IMO conventions and codes and European Union (EU) and national legislations only once through the national single window established in each EU member state not later than on 1 June 2015. The question is whether these different functions of above-mentioned contact points can be implemented by one shore based institution or service.

Rete Autostrade Mediterranee (RAM), lead partner of the project, has implemented apilot action focused on the analysis of technical and legislative characteristics of the Directive 2010 / 65 /EU on “Reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States”, its status of implementation in Italy, possible scenarios for integrating and upscaling existing Port Management Information System (PMIS) and National Single Window (NSW) prototyping in Italy, Cost-Benefit analysis (CBA) for re-engineering existing Port Community Systems (PCSs) in the port of Venice and Levante (Bari) to fulfil <b>reporting</b> <b>formalities</b> according with the EU Directive. In the analysis {{carried out in the}} two ports (the selected case studies), the CBA evidenced the huge amount of potential benefits for the logistic chain triggered by the decrease of dwell time for containers in ports, through reengineering of the existing PCSs within the envisage NSW framework. Dwell time is then crucial for the definition of scenarios of port competitiveness and benchmarking, since it may be largely reduced by the implementation of pre-clearing procedures. Pre-clearing (“anticipated electronic customs clearance”) is able to speeding up of formalities and the consequent relieving of port traffic congestion. The simplification of customs procedures may result in significant benefits for the door-to-door transport time and costs. This aspect has clearly emerged together with lack of top-down information by the two Port Authorities on dwell time. CBA indicators are very positive for both ports and demonstrate how the re-engineering of PCSs in Venice and Bari is expected to lead to abig amount of net benefits. Dwell time is astrategic Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for ports (both for public and private stakeholders), often very difficult to calculate due to confidentiality issues as well as being pre-clearing procedure just testing in some ports in Italy. Nevertheless, acustomized survey at the two ports among local stakeholders (e. g. customs forwarders, freight forwarders, etc.) is deemed necessary and recommended. Despite of the information and data gathering activities implemented at the two Port Authorities, the aforementioned integrative survey should enable to boost CBA results. Key recommendations for ensuring the Italy's NSW compliance with the Directive 2010 / 65 /EU: a) Setting enabling legal framework for the NSW development; b) Setting functional and technical specifications and testing for the NSW development; c) Identification of core business processes for the NSW development; d) National consultation and working groups activities with public and private stakeholders; e) Reengineering and upscaling of PCSs for their interoperability with the NSW; f) Setting high-level (medium-long timeframe) master plan for the NSW full deployment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWithin the MEDNET project “Mediterranean Network for Custom Procedures and Simplification of Clearance in Ports” {{funded by}} the MED {{programme}} (2007 – 2013), Taranto Port Authority (TPA) in Italy has designed and developed newly automatic system (prototype) for an effective and seamless management of port operators enrolment and access in the port area. Taranto Port Authority developed and tested an effective Information Technologies (IT) based on a multi-user management tool with a single interface for all port operators. The interface is based on functionalities coming from the integration and re-engineering of two different procedures managed by TPA: 1) enrolment in the TPA's Register foreseen in art. 68 of the Italian Navigation Law, mandatory for all private companies and individuals operating in the port; 2) the procedure of issuing of passes for vehicles and people to enter in the port area. The scope of this initiative was to re-engineer the two aforementioned procedures into a single IT based procedure with a single management interface. It enables to accelerate the process for passes release {{as well as to}} improve port accessibility by reducing the number of potential errors and transforming the nature of the procedure from “preventive” to “fact-finding”. In this way, the port community of Taranto will be able to provide relevant services in less time. The prototype is able to speed up the issuing of passes for persons and vehicles entering in the port area by reducing the time needed to check documents provided by companies as well as informing relevant authorities. The developed prototype enables to automatically manage different categories of passes for entering in the port of Taranto: annual passes, provisional passes as well as visitors passes. The combined effect of the new local regulation (TPA's Ordinance no. 04 / 14 of April 28 th 2014) and the prototype enables to issue passes in 7 – 8 days against the previous 60 days required to complete (annual) pass request procedure. The benefits in terms of time saving have been also achieved for the other categories of passes (provisional and visitors). The prototype leads to seamless procedures management as well as to simplification of checks in entering in the port area. Streamlining procedures enables not only a reduction in terms of needed time for regular control of requests, but also a real-time control of the handled requests in parallel with the traditional ways (paper protocols). Taranto Port Authority {{as well as the other}} competent bodies are now able to check each single person and vehicle accessing in the port of Taranto, improving actual procedure and related controls, through an efficient check-in/check-out <b>reporting.</b> Seamless administrative <b>formalities</b> related of both companies’ enrolment and passes requests enable to reach an overall improvement of port accessibility and transit of vehicles and goods in the area, positively affecting its competiveness as well as quality of provided added-value services. The prototype is able to significantly reduce relevant administrative and bureaucratic aspects. Simplification of the procedures is expected to positively influence the door-to-door transport time and costs for business accessing and circulating in the port area and beyond...|$|R
5000|$|The Chapel of St. Paul at Clumber Park was {{commissioned}} by Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle in 1864. It was designed by the architect Thomas Chambers Hine but not completed and {{became known as the}} pigeon coop. Henry Pelham-Clinton, 7th Duke of Newcastle, demolished it and commissioned a new chapel dedicated to St Mary the Virgin in 1886. It was designed by George Frederick Bodley and built by the contractor R. Franklin of Diddington, Oxfordshire. The stone used in the interior is Red Runcorn, and externally Steetly ashlar with Red Runcorn dressings. It was completed by 1889 at a cost of £30,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ) [...] It was opened by the Bishop of Southwell on 22 October 1889 but this ceremony caused alarm in the Protestant Alliance of the Church of England as reported in the Derby Daily Telegraph on 6 November 1889.The committee and members of the Protestant Alliance have forwarded a memorial to the Archbishop of Canterbury, inviting his Grave’s attention to the reports published in the Press regarding the services conducted at the benediction or dedication of the new church at Clumber on the 22nd of October - services “authorised and conducted” by the Bishop of Southwell, the bishop of the diocese, and described as “a function which far exceeded that of Cardiff in grandeur of ritual and dignity of ceremonial”. These reports, it is pointed out, state that the church at Clumber was decorated with a crucifix over the rood screen, with images of the Virgin and of St John, with a baldachino over the “high altar,” and a crucifix on the re-table with a tabernacle for the reserved sacrament, having a silver lamp suspended in front of it, and with other Popish emblems. The service of the Holy Communion was conducted, according to these <b>report,</b> with the <b>formalities</b> observed in the Roman Catholic service of the sacrifice of the mass - formalities condemned by the Courts of Law - and it is further reported that no person whatever communicated with the celebrant. The procession into the Church was headed by a crucifer, bearing a large crucifix, and a thurifer, bearing a censer containing incense. Two handsome banners were carried aloft, the first being that of the blessed sacrament and the second that of the Virgin Mary, on which were inscribed the remarkable words, “S. Maria Mater Dei”. It is further reported that about 50 “priests” took part in the procession; that the Bishop of Lincoln walked in this procession, dressed in a cope of cloth of gold; that he was followed by the Bishop of Southwell, wearing a gorgeous cope, on the back of which was depicted in brilliant colours a representation of the Madonna and Child - the Madonna crowned, the Child uncrowned. The memorialists urge that the use of the idolatrous rites and ceremonies of the Church of Rome tend to alienate the affections of people from the Church of England, and, if not checked and prevents, must eventually lead to an agitation for the disestablishment and disendowment of the National Church. An appeal is made to the Archbishop to use his influence to check and prevent the introduction and the use of such superstitious services and illegal practices.|$|R
