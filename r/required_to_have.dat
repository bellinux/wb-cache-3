5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the charging port, which is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, {{but to the}} ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The charging port does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for charging port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power {{as if there were}} a charging port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from the charging port transparently.|$|E

Usually, uniform tilings additionally are <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E

5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{caught off}} the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador are <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a minimal level of {{processing}} done in provincial fish plants.

These requirements have been an issue in province over the years for numerous reasons including; the cost of processing, labour availability and because some markets are interested in less processed fish. The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture can grant a company exemptions from minimum processing requirements.|$|E
