The version used by the Church includes flames, a pitchfork and the number 666, while the trapezoid of the Temple has a left-facing Egyptian sceptre, and the number 666 stylized in geometric shapes <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> clear numbers.|$|E

5|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{translations}} which aim to present the Gododdin as literature <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> a subject of scholarly study. Examples are the translation by Joseph P. Clancy in The earliest Welsh poetry (1970) and Steve Short's 1994 translation.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, onions may be bred {{and grown}} to mature at smaller sizes. Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which the onion is used, these may be {{referred}} to as pearl, boiler, or pickler onions, but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species. Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E

5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and {{the closure}} of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> a {{religious}} community. The church remained important {{in part because the}} parish was {{one of the largest in}} Wales (over 240 square miles). However, although the Abbot of Vale Royal was no longer rector, the church did not recover the tithes, nor the ownership of the lands that had once belonged to the church.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} that {{globular}} clusters contain {{some of the first}} stars to be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that globular clusters are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> a separate galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Amyloid imaging {{is likely}} to be used in {{conjunction}} with other markers <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> an alternative. Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.|$|E

5|$|An Lushan was a Tang {{general of}} mixed Turkic and Soghdian ancestry whose revolt between 755 and 763, the An Shi Rebellion, devastated the Tang Dynasty. Unlike the {{majority}} of Turkic military officers, An Lushan served the Tang as an official closely involved with {{the politics of the}} imperial court, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> a general in a garrison on the Tang frontier. The dynasty might have collapsed {{had it not been for}} their alliance with the Uyghur Turks. The rebellion diminished the Tang enthusiasm for cosmopolitanism that was a characteristic of the dynasty's earlier years.|$|E
5|$|Artists and {{craftsman}} operated as corporations (guilds) <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, {{basket and}} mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription {{refers to an}} assemblage {{of all the people}} of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} of the game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregator site Metacritic. The main problems reviewers had with the game was its repetitiveness and the tediousness of some parts.

She is classified as a 1.5 point player, but women get a 1.5 point bonus when playing on a mixed team, making her in effect a zero-point player. Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{believed}} that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she enjoyed {{the prospect of}} rebuilding a reputation <b>rather</b> <b>than,</b> <b>as</b> in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens {{as a champion of}} black people was a timely interest as the Civil Rights Movement increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by his physical deformity, a club foot.|$|E
5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E

Grand Central Publishing is the successor to Warner Books, which published America (The Book), written by The Daily Show staff. The book contains similar political satire, but was written primarily by Colbert himself <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> a collaboration with his Colbert Report writing staff.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> a carrier of biological information. This {{has led to the}} creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E

Filitti was among those who described the Council as a necessary branch of the legislature, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> an organ of the executive.|$|E
