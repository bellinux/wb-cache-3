The compressor assembly, which emitted {{a great deal of}} heat, was placed above the cabinet, and enclosed by a decorative ring. Over a million units were produced. As the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>medium,</b> these refrigerators used either sulfur dioxide, which is corrosive to the eyes and may cause loss of vision, painful skin burns and lesions, or methyl formate, which is highly flammable, harmful to the eyes, and toxic if inhaled or ingested. Many of these units are still functional today, after requiring little more service than a replacement start relay or thermostat if at all. These cooling systems cannot legally be recharged with the hazardous original refrigerants if they leak or break down.|$|E

The work is particularly aimed at preparing an instruction manual for integrated emmergency system and state authorities to upgrade their theoretical and practical knowledge and {{to be used as a}} supportive material when dealing with refrigerating system breakdown and consequent ammonia release. A technique used in the Bachelor´s work was a model breakdown demonstration of the ice rink in Jindřichův Hradec. Then all the data obtained were evaluated by the TerEx programme and finally relevant steps and measures were suggested. The findings revealed the fact that the attention is mostly paid to response recommendations in the breakdown centre while the surroundings are not involved sufficiently. The manual application together with upgrading material equipment may significantly reduce the negative effect of the breakdown on the ice rink surroundings and, especially, on civilians...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Active Magnetic Regenerative Refrigeration (AMRR) {{cycle is}} {{a special kind of}} {{regenerator}} for the magnetic refrigerator, in which the magnetic material matrix works both as a <b>refrigerating</b> <b>medium</b> and as a heat regenerating medium, while the fluid flowing in the porous matrix works as a heat transfer medium. The performance of an AMRR cycle depends strongly on the behaviour of the adiabatic magnetization temperature change as a function of material temperature in the flow direction of the regenerator. In the present paper, a practical model for predicting the performance and efficiency of an AMRR cycle has been developed. The model simulates both the ferromagnetic material and the entire cycle of an AMR operating in conformity with a Brayton regenerative cycle. The model simulates different kinds of layered regenerators operating at their optimal operation point. The program study the Gd-x Tb 1 -x alloys as constituent materials for the regenerator over the temperature range 275 – 295 K, and Gdx Dy 1 -x alloys in the temperature range 260 – 280 K. With this model, the refrigeration capacity, the power consumption and consequently the coefficient of performance can be predicted. The results show a greater COP for the refrigerator based on the magnetocaloric technology compared with the COP of a classical vapour compression plant working between the same thermal levels...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cryosorption pumps {{will provide}} the safe, quiet, clean and {{reasonably}} inexpensive method for evacuation of a vacuum vessel to a pressure of around mbar. Physical capture and retention of gaseous molecules on a <b>refrigerated</b> adsorption <b>medium</b> distinguish the new technique from traditional cryosorption-pumping methods {{which are based on}} cryogenic condensation alone. Commercially available cryosorption-pumps are used in for industrial application and operate in the temperature range of 20 - 25 K, since they do not require the pumping of lighter gas molecules like hydrogen, deuterium, argon and helium etc. The adsorption takes place at the porous surfaces. Hence, porous materials are of great importance towards this technology. The objective of this review paper is to present an overview of cryosorption pumps and compare different porous materials and select the comparatively better sorbtion materials in cryo-vacuum technology. This paper also concentrates on the type of cryosorption-pumps that has to be used with respect to the applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{condition}} of the technique of cultivation of tissues, the only possible way of studying leucocytic secretions was to grow colonies of leucocytes in a medium of known properties and to examine the modifications of these properties {{under the influence of}} the living cells. The method was far from perfect, because the secretions were mixed with serum and accumulated for 48 hours in a medium where they probably underwent partial destruction. But an approximate idea of certain of the qualities of the secretions, although not of their quantity, could be derived from the experiments. In the fluids extracted from the cultures, we attempted to detect the presence of the leucocytic secretions through their physiological effects on homologous and foreign cells. Two kinds of substances were sought, those which act on homologous cells, and those which destroy foreign erythrocytes. The secretion by leucocytes of substances necessary to the nutrition of other cells was considered as probable long ago. Renaut thought that the main function of the white blood corpuscles was to bring to the fixed cells of the tissues the food material which they need. While the existence of physiological relations between leucocytes and tissue cells could be considered as almost certain, their nature had remained practically unknown. It was probable, however, that the substances secreted by leucocytes were analogous to the growth-activating and unstable substances which are found in embryonic tissues, leucocytes, and certain adult tissues. When connective tissue was aseptically inflamed, or when an aseptic peritoneal exudate contained many leucocytes, aqueous extracts of both connective tissue and peritoneal exudate were found to have acquired the power of stimulating cell proliferation. These experiments showed that leucocytes could bring to the tissues some activating substances. But it remained to be ascertained whether leucocytes, while they are alive, could secrete similar substances either spontaneously or under the stimulus of a foreign factor. Leucocytes are supposed to be, as is well know, the origin of the substances which protect the organism against infection. Although the problem of the origin of alexin and antibodies has been investigated by many experimenters, it is not yet completely solved. It was of interest, therefore, to ascertain whether leucocytic secretions could increase the natural hemolytic effect of hen serum on sheep or rabbit erythrocytes, and whether these secretions would become more active under the influence of a foreign protein. The substances which destroy foreign cells are not necessarily different from those which act on homologous cells. The word substance is used for simplicity of description and may be taken as meaning only a given property of an unknown substrate. A comparison was made of certain properties of sera extracted after 48 hours incubation from media containing leucocytes and from media containing no leucocytes. The serum from the leucocytic cultures was always found to be more favorable to the growth of homologous fibroblasts than the serum from the culture media incubated without leucocytes. The natural hemolytic power of the serum on sheep erythrocytes was found to be increased in about SO per cent of the experiments. In other experiments, we found that when two culture media free of cells were placed, one in an incubator at + 38 °C. and the other in a refrigerator at + 5 °C. for 48 hours, the serum from the incubated medium partly lost its hemolytic action on sheep or rabbit erythrocytes, while that from the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>medium</b> remained normal; at the same time, the inhibiting action of the incubated medium on homologous fibroblasts had increased very much. This effect of incubation indicates that certain unstable constituents of serum are destroyed by heat. Then the changes found in the properties of the serum from cultures of leucocytes are due to the fraction of the activating substances which has not been destroyed by incubation at 38 °C. A quantitative study of the secretions is, therefore, impossible with the present technique, which can furnish only qualitative indications about the substances set free by the leucocytes. We have ascertained also whether a medium containing leucocytes and kept in the refrigerator undergoes any change {{under the influence of the}} cells while they are in a condition of latent life. Gabritschewski dishes with and without leucocytes were placed in a refrigerator at a temperature of about + 5 °C. After 48 hours, the hemolytic power on sheep erythrocytes of the serum from the leucocytic cultures had increased slightly and its inhibiting action on the growth of homologous fibroblasts had decreased. Then certain substances favorable to the growth of homologous cells and toxic for heterologous cells were diffused by the leucocytes into their medium. But the action of these substances was weaker than in the case of the cultures kept in the incubator. This experiment showed that leucocytes under certain conditions diffuse alexin or natural hemolysins which originate from them at the same time as the substances which activate homologous cells. In other experiments, although leucocytes were frozen at – 10 °C., treated with distilled water, or extracted with saline solution, they did not yield any hemolysin. To summarize: Leucocytes, cultivated in plasma, always secreted substances which increased the rate of growth of homologous cells. Less frequently, they set free substances which hemolyzed foreign erythrocytes. The growth-promoting substances are analogous to those contained in embryonic tissues, and probably represent some of the foodstuffs brought to fixed tissue cells by leucocytes. They may possess the function of rejuvenating cells which have ceased to multiply when the cicatrization of a wound or the repair of a fracture requires a resumption of tissue activity. According to this hypothesis, the leucocytes brought to the surface of a wound by the process of inflammation would not only oppose bacterial invasion, but also bring to the tissues the material necessary to cell multiplication. It seems that in some cases regeneration is started by substances brought to the tissues by other cells. Loeb thinks that in Tubularia, when endodermic cells gather at the end where a new polyp is about to be formed, the substances given off by these cells are responsible for polyp formation. 6 There may be an analogy between this phenomenon and the secretion by leucocytes of growth-activating substances at the surface of a wound. If we assume that leucocytes in vivo set free their secretions in the blood stream, certain variations of the growth-inhibiting action of normal serum can be better understood. The rate of proliferation of homologous fibroblasts is much slower in the serum of an old chicken than in that of a young one. When the serum is heated at 56 ° and 70 °C. for ½ hour, it becomes still more inhibiting. A substance favorable to cell activity has disappeared. It is therefore permissible to suppose that the growth-inhibiting power of serum and its variations are due to the antagonistic action of two substances, one growth-promoting and thermolabile, and the other growth-inhibiting and thermostable, the activating substance being always weaker in its effect than the inhibiting one. We know that activating substances can be extracted from embryonic tissue, from muscle and gland tissues, and from leucocytes of the adult animal, and that they are thermolabile and very unstable. Leucocytic secretions seem to have some of the properties of leucocytic extracts. It is probable that the activating substances which disappear from the heated serum are secreted by leucocytes and other cells. An increase of these secretions, then, would diminish the inhibiting action of serum on homologous fibroblasts. On the contrary, a decrease of the secretions in the serum would increase its inhibiting effect on homologous cells. The strong inhibiting action of serum in old age would be due partly to a reduction in the amount and activity of the substances secreted by leucocytes and tissue cells in the humors of the organism. Leucocytes also secreted in vitro substances which were toxic for foreign cells. Although the results were not constant, the serum appeared to become slightly more hemolytic for sheep or rabbit erythrocytes, under the influence of the leucocytes. The hemolysis of rabbit corpuscles by hen serum is due, according to Hyde, 9 to a complex sensitizer alexin, and not merely to alexin, as Bordet thought. When a foreign protein was added to the culture medium, the leucocytic secretions increased, as was shown by the action on homologous fibroblasts of sera taken from cultures of leucocytes with and without casein. The presence in the medium of the cultures of leucocytes of only 0. 1 per 1, 000 casein did not markedly modify the action of their serum on the proliferation of fibroblasts. When the concentration of casein in the leucocyte cultures reached 1 per 1, 000, the growth of chicken fibroblasts in the serum extracted from the Gabritschewski dishes became more rapid. But there was no parallel increase of the hemolytic action of the serum upon sheep erythrocytes. We found that chicken serum containing 0. 1 per 1, 000 casein was barely toxic for homologous fibroblasts, while it became markedly inhibiting when the casein concentration reached 1 per 1, 000. Probably, there is a relation between the toxicity of the medium, the increase of leucocytic secretions, and the time of the increase. The change brought about by casein in the equilibrium of the system composed of the cells and their medium determines the secretion by the leucocytes of substances which increase the activity of homologous cells and oppose the inhibiting effect of the foreign proteins. This reaction of the leucocytes is immediate, and may represent the first defense of the organism against a factor which disturbs its equilibrium. Possibly it differs from the specific cell reaction which leads to the production of antibodies. It is known that antibodies develop more slowly. Hemolysins were detected in cultures of bone marrow 4 days after the addition of antigen. The immunization of fibroblasts against foreign proteins has been shown by Fischer to begin after 4 days. If leucocytes behave in the organism as they do in vitro, we may assume that before the appearance of antibodies, they respond to the presence of an antigen by setting free growth-promoting substances and possibly alexin. This immediate reaction of the leucocytes against a disturbing factor, and the resulting production of substances which increase the activity of homologous cells, might be partly responsible for the results observed in the treatment of certain diseases by the injection of foreign proteins. It may be concluded that, under the conditions of the experiments: 1. The serum obtained from cultures of leucocytes is less inhibiting for homologous fibroblasts than the serum from media without leucocytes. In some experiments, its hemolytic action on sheep or rabbit erythrocytes is also increased. 2. The addition of casein to leucocytic cultures brings about a decrease in the inhibiting effect of the serum on homologous fibroblasts. 3. The increase in the activity of homologous fibroblasts in serum obtained from leucocytic cultures is probably due to growth-promoting substances secreted by the leucocytes. The presence of a foreign protein under certain conditions determines a more abundant leucocytic secretion...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of the different magnetic materials on the refrigeration capacity and on the efficiency of the AMR cycle, since that different materials for magnetic refrigeration applications at room temperature have been tested. To this hope, a practical 2 D model for predicting the refrigeration capacity and the efficiency of an AMR cycle in the room temperature range has been developed.

40|$|The use of {{artificial}} ground freezing (AGF) to form earth support systems has had applications worldwide. These cover {{a variety of}} construction problems, including the formation of frozen earth walls to support deep excavations, structural underpinning for foundation improvement and temporary control of ground water in construction processes. On one hand, the main advantage of AGF as a temporary support system in comparison to other support methods, such as those based on injections of chemical or cement grout into the soil, is the low impact on the surrounding environment as the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>medium</b> required to obtain AGF is circulated in pipes and exhausted in the atmosphere or re-circulated without contamination of the ground water. On the other hand, the available methods may vary significantly in their sustainability and complexity in terms of times and costs required for their installation and maintenance. The ability to predict the effects induced by AGF on granular materials is therefore crucial to assessing construction time and cost and to optimising the method. In this work, the thermo-hydro-mechanical processes induced by artificial freezing of a soil body are studied using a constitutive model that encompasses frozen and unfrozen behaviour within a unified effective-stress-based framework. It makes use {{of a combination of}} ice pressure, liquid water pressure and total stress as state variables.

The performance of an AMR system strongly depends on the magnetocaloric effect of the magnetic material used to build the regenerator.

Different magnetic materials have been considered as refrigerant: pure gadolinium, second order phase magnetic transition binary rare earth alloys (SOMT) and first order phase magnetic transition alloys (FOMT). The SOMT are GdxDy 1 !x and GdxTb 1 !x whereas the FOMT are Gd 5 (SixGe 1 !x) 4 and MnAs 1 !xSbx. The magnetocaloric behaviour of gadolinium can be correctly predicted by the Weiss molecular field theory. This approach can be generalized for binary alloys with a second order phase transition. The behaviour of the MnAs 1 !xSbx alloys is described by means of a model based on the phenomenological approach of Bean Rodbell. Interpolation of empirical data is utilized for the evaluation of the magnetocaloric effect of Gd 5 (SixGe 1 !x) 4 alloys. With this model, the refrigeration capacity, the power consumption and consequently the Coefficient of Performance of the cycle can be predicted.

40|$|Magnetic {{refrigeration}} is an emerging, environment-friendly technology {{based on}} a magnetic solid {{that acts as a}} refrigerant by magneto-caloric effect (MCE). In the case of ferromagnetic materials MCE is a warming as the magnetic moments of the atom are aligned by the application of a magnetic field, and the corresponding cooling upon removal of the magnetic field. There are two types of magnetic phase changes that may occur at the Curie point: first order magnetic transition (FOMT) and second order magnetic transition (SOMT). The reference cycle for magnetic refrigeration is AMR (Active Magnetic Regenerative cycle) where the magnetic material matrix works both as a <b>refrigerating</b> <b>medium</b> and as a heat regenerating medium, while the fluid flowing in the porous matrix works as a heat transfer medium. Regeneration can be accomplished by blowing a heat transfer fluid in a reciprocating fashion through the regenerator made of magnetocaloric material that is alternately magnetized and demagnetized. In this paper, attention is directed towards the near room-temperature range. We compare the energetic performance of a commercial R 134 a refrigeration plant to that of a magnetic refrigerator working with an AMR cycle. Attention is devoted to the evaluation of the environmental impact in terms of a greenhouse effect. The comparison is performed in term of TEWI index (Total Equivalent Warming Impact) that takes into account both direct and indirect contributions to global warming. In this paper the AMR cycle works with different magnetic refrigerants: pure gadolinium, second order phase magnetic transition (Pr 0. 45 Sr 0. 35 MnO 3) and first order phase magnetic transition alloys (Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2, LaFe 11. 384 Mn 0. 356 Si 1. 26 H 1. 52, LaFe 11. 05 Co 0. 94 Si 1. 10 and MnFeP 0. 45 As 0. 55).

Furthermore, the TEWI of the AMR cycle working with FOMT materials is always better than that of SOMT materials. Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2 is the best FOMT material...|$|E
40|$|The ILC (International Linear Collider) is a {{proposed}} new major particle accelerator. It {{consists of two}} 20 km long linear accelerators colliding electrons and positrons at an energy exceeding 500 GeV. Achieving this collision energy while keeping reasonable accelerator dimensions {{requires the use of}} high electric field superconducting cavities as the main acceleration element. These cavities are operated at 1. 3 GHz inside an appropriate container (He vessel) at temperatures as low as 1. 4 K using superfluid Helium as the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>medium.</b> The purpose of this thesis, {{in the context of the}} ILC R&D activities currently in progress at Fermilab (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory), is the mechanical study of an ILC superconducting cavity and Helium vessel prototype. The main goals of these studies are the determination of the limiting working conditions of the whole He vessel assembly, the simulation of the manufacturing process of the cavity end-caps and the assessment of the Helium vessel's efficiency. In addition this thesis studies the requirements to certify the compliance with the ASME Code of the whole cavity/vessel assembly. Several Finite Elements Analyses were performed by the candidate himself in order to perform the studies listed above and described in detail in Chapters 4 through 8. In particular the candidate has developed an improved procedure to obtain more accurate results with lower computational times. These procedures will be accurately described in the following chapters. After an introduction that briefly describes the Fermilab and in particular the Technical Division (where all the activities concerning with this thesis were developed), the first part of this thesis (Chapters 2 and 3) explains some of the main aspects of modern particle accelerators. Moreover it describes the most important particle accelerators working at the moment and the basic features of the ILC project. Chapter 4 describes all the activities that were done to certify the compliance of the Helium vessel and the cavity to the ASME code standard. After briefly recalling to the main contents of the the ASME Code (Sections II and VIII - Division II), the procedure used for finding all relevant stresses and comparing the obtained results with the maximum values allowed are explained. This part also includes the buckling verification of the cavity. In Chapter 5 the manufacturing process of the cavity end-caps, whose function is to link the Helium vessel with the cavity, is studied. The present configuration of the dies is described and the manufacturing process is simulated in order to explain the origin of some defects found on real parts. Finally a new design of the dies is proposed and the resulting deformed piece is compared with the design requirements. Chapter 6 describes a finite elements analysis to assess the efficiency and the stiffness of the Helium vessel. Furthermore the results of the optimization of the Helium vessel (in order to increase the value of the efficiency) are reported. The same stiffness analysis is used in Chapter 7 for the Blade-Tuner study. After a description of this tuner and of its function, the preliminary analyses done to confirm the results provided by the vendor are described and then its limiting load conditions are found. Chapter 8 shows a study of the resistance of all the welds present in between the cavity and the end-cap and between the end-caps and the He vessel for a smaller superconducting cavity operating at 3. 9 GHz. Finally Chapter 9 briefly describes some R&D activities in progress at INFN (Section of Pisa) and Fermilab that could produce significant cost reductions of the Helium vessel design. All the finite elements analyses contained and described in this thesis made possible the certification of the whole superconducting cavity-Helium vessel assembly at Fermilab. Furthermore they gave several useful indications to the Fermilab staff to improve the performance of the Helium vessel by modifying some design parameters or refining the manufacturing processes...|$|E
