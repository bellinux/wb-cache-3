Following his death in 1698, the estate was inherited by his son Sir Barnham <b>Rider,</b> MP for Maidstone from 1722 to 1727, and then his son, Thomas <b>Rider.</b> The second Thomas <b>Rider</b> left the house to his cousin Ingram <b>Rider</b> in 1786. In 1805, Ingram <b>Rider</b> left it to his son Thomas <b>Rider,</b> MP for Kent and West Kent from 1831 to 1835. The third Thomas <b>Rider</b> rebuilt parts of the house and extended and re-landscaped the park. On his death in 1847, he left the house to his nephew, also Thomas <b>Rider,</b> who let the house to a series of tenants. From 1903 to 1998, the house was occupied by the Winch family, firstly as leaseholders then, from 1960, as freeholders. The Winches sold the house in 1998; it remains in private ownership and belongs to the Kendrick family.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 Vuelta a España {{included}} four principal classifications. The {{first of}} these was the general classification, which was calculated by adding up each rider's times on each stage and applying the relevant time bonuses. These were 10 seconds for the stage winner, 6 seconds for the <b>rider</b> in second, and 4 seconds for the <b>rider</b> in third, and 3, 2 and 1 seconds {{for the first three}} riders at each intermediate sprint; no bonuses were awarded on the time trial stages. The <b>rider</b> with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta. The <b>rider</b> leading the classification wore a red jersey.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} classification, {{represented by}} a blue jersey, was calculated by summing up the points obtained by each <b>rider</b> in the other classifications; the leader was the <b>rider</b> with the lowest total of points.|$|E
5|$|The fourth jersey {{represented}} the young <b>rider</b> classification, {{marked by a}} white jersey. Only riders born after 1 January 1990 were eligible; the young <b>rider</b> best placed in the general classification {{was the leader of}} the young <b>rider</b> classification.|$|E

50|$|From {{the first}} round all (nine) <b>riders</b> with four penalty points, two <b>riders</b> with one time fault and seven faultless <b>riders</b> were {{qualified}} for the second round.

The Regulations allow up to 40 <b>riders,</b> but to increase the quality, the FIM want to try to keep MX1 with a maximum of 30 <b>riders.</b> The MX2 class will be for <b>riders</b> less than 23 years old.

5|$|The second {{classification}} was points classification. On {{each stage}} of the race, points were awarded to the top 10 riders. The winner won 15 points, with 12 for the second-placed <b>rider,</b> 9 for the third-placed <b>rider,</b> 7 for the sixth-placed <b>rider</b> and then one point fewer for each place down to tenth place. Points were also awarded to the top three riders at intermediate sprints, with five points for {{the winner of the}} sprint and three, and one points for the riders in second and third places respectively. The <b>rider</b> with the most points was the leader of the classification and was awarded a green jersey. There was also a mountains classification. Over the three stages, there were 13 categorised climbs. On each of these climbs, the first four riders to the summit were awarded points, with 5 for the first <b>rider,</b> 3 for the second, 2 for the third and 1 for the fourth. The <b>rider</b> with the most accumulated points was the leader of the classification and was awarded a dark pink jersey.|$|E

5|$|Two of the 8th century picture stones {{from the}} island of Gotland, Sweden depict eight-legged horses, which are thought by most {{scholars}} to depict Sleipnir: the Tjängvide image stone and the Ardre VIII image stone. Both stones feature a <b>rider</b> sitting atop an eight-legged horse, which some scholars view as Odin. Above the <b>rider</b> on the Tjängvide image stone is a horizontal figure holding a spear, which may be a valkyrie, and a female figure greets the <b>rider</b> with a cup. The scene has been interpreted as a <b>rider</b> arriving at {{the world of the}} dead. The mid-7th century Eggja stone bearing the Odinic name haras (Old Norse 'army god') may be interpreted as depicting Sleipnir.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} two {{beautiful}} women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a <b>rider</b> stood near the wheel. Uttanka praised {{the functioning of the}} weaving process, the <b>rider</b> and the horse, and equated the <b>rider</b> to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the <b>rider</b> asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The <b>rider</b> then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E

The top nine <b>riders</b> in each semi-final progress to the final which is run using a modified Grand Prix format with 20 heats. The winner of the final is awarded a gold medal and becomes the Swedish Individual Champion. <b>Riders</b> finishing second and third are awarded silver and bronze medals.|$|R
5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the <b>rider</b> can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of <b>rider</b> lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, <b>rider</b> lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
