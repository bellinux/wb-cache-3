500|$|The {{ornament}} of the chitinozoans may cast {{light on}} the question. Whilst in some cases a defensive role - by making the vessel larger, and thus less digestible by would-be predators - seems probable, it is not impossible that the protrusions may have anchored the organisms to the sea floor. However, their low-density construction makes this unlikely: perhaps more plausible is that they acted to attach to other organisms. Longer spines also make the organisms more buoyant, by decreasing their <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>number</b> (i.e. increasing {{the relative importance of}} water's viscosity) — it is therefore possible that at least the long-spined chitinozoans were planktonic [...] "floaters". On the other hand, the walls of some chitinozoans were probably too thick and dense to allow them to float.|$|E
