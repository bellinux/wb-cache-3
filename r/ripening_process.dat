25|$|The {{role that}} climate plays in {{influencing}} the <b>ripening</b> <b>process</b> cannot be overstated, {{but it is}} not the only factor. Vineyard management such as pruning and canopy management can also play a significant role as it not only influences the physiological processes of the grapevine but also how the vine responds in sharing its limited resources of energy and nutrients. The leaves of a grapevine produce energy via the process of photosynthesis. A certain amount of foliage is needed to ensure that the grapevine can produce enough energy to support all its physiological functions, but too much leaf cover will shade the grape clusters, limiting the direct exposure of sunlight and warmth needed for some chemical components of the grapes to develop. An excessive amount of foliage and shading may also promote the development of various vine diseases and ailments such as bunch rot and powdery mildew which can hamper the <b>ripening</b> <b>process.</b> A very vigorous vine with many clusters and vine shoots will have several parties competing for the same resources, with the overall development of an individual clusters thus slowed. Through the process of canopy management, viticulturists try to balance not only the amount of clusters and vine shoots on the vine but also try to achieve an optimal balance of needed foliage for photosynthesis without excessive shading that could hamper the <b>ripening</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

25|$|For {{other types}} of wines, such as {{sparkling}} wines like Champagne, maintaining {{a certain amount of}} acidity in the grapes is important to the winemaking process. As the concentration of acids in the grapes decrease the further along the <b>ripening</b> <b>process</b> you go, grapes destined for sparkling wines are often some of the earliest grapes to be harvested in a vintage. With their high acidity and low sugar levels, these grapes would be under ripe and would produce table wines that many wine drinkers would consider unpalatable yet the balance of sugars and acids is well suited for sparkling wine production.|$|E
25|$|Acidity {{is highest}} in wine grapes {{just before the}} start of veraison, which ushers in the {{ripening}} period of the annual cycle of grape vines. As the grapes ripen, their sugar levels increase and their acidity levels decrease. Through the process of respiration, malic acid is metabolized by the grape vine. Grapes from cooler climate wine regions generally have higher levels of acidity due to the slower <b>ripening</b> <b>process.</b> The level of acidity still present in the grape is an important consideration for winemakers in deciding when to begin harvest. For wines such as Champagne and other sparkling wines, having high levels of acidity is even more vital to the winemaking process, so grapes are often picked under-ripe and at higher acid levels.|$|E
25|$|The age of vine {{can also}} {{contribute}} to how much grassy character the resultant wine may have {{as well as how}} early the grapes are harvested. Many of the phenolic compounds and aroma compounds, such as pyrazine, that contribute to strong grassy flavours are found in the grape skins, eventually breaking down as it goes through its <b>ripening</b> <b>process.</b> Grapes that are harvested before they are physiologically ripe may have more overt grassy notes. How the harvest is conducted will depend on where the vineyards are located. As the steep slopes on which many Sancerre vineyards are planted make mechanical harvesting difficult many vineyards are picked by hand. However, in the flatter vineyards located more towards the west of the appellation, mechanical harvesting is starting to become more prevalent.|$|E

50|$|The {{flowering}} and <b>ripening</b> <b>processes</b> do {{not happen}} simultaneously, enabling harvesting of both {{fresh fruits and}} seeds over a long span of time. The fruits tend to fall from the plant as they ripen, getting lost in the soil. Thus, there is no optimal fixed harvest time. Consequently, to avoid yield loss, unripe fruits need to be harvested.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) as an inhibitor of ethylene action has provided {{an important tool}} in understanding fruit ripening physiology {{as shown by the}} huge amount of 1 -MCPtargeted research carried out particularly, although not exclusively, in postharvest science. It has been clearly demonstrated that 1 -MCP is able to improve the handling procedures and storage life of a number of commodities. In fact, 1 -MCP can reduce ethylene biosynthesis, respiration, softening color changes, aroma production, and the occurrence of physiological disorders and stress responses. These effects are related to the interference of 1 -MCP on the ethylene receptor functioning (1 -MCP-receptor binding is irreversible) and for some of them in their transcription rate and protein stability. However, the efficacy of this olefin strongly depends upon the concentration used, the species and variety, storage condition and duration, and maturity of the fruit before the 1 -MCP application. A marked effect of 1 -MCP occurs in climacteric fruit, although studies carried out in nonclimacteric fruit demonstrates that this olefin can also alter specific <b>ripening</b> <b>processes</b> in these fruit types. The research results obtained by applying 1 -MCP confirms the very well-known ethylene-dependent <b>ripening</b> <b>processes</b> as well as allowed tthe identification of previously unrecognized responses to ethylene. Molecular studies performed on 1 -MCP-treated fruit have provided new insights into the role of ethylene in the regulation (mainly at the transcriptional and, to a lesser extent, at the translational level) of genes involved in <b>ripening</b> <b>processes</b> such as cell wall metabolism, and pigment and aromatic compound biosynthesis, as well as the signal transduction pathway of the gaseous hormone. Postharvest use of 1 -MCP has improved our understanding of ethylene effects on the development of physiological disorders (e. g. superficial scald, internal breakdown) and stress responses (e. g. chilling injury and pathogen attack). This extensive information base will be extremely useful in the future development of innovative and more efficient postharvest strategies where the effect of 1 -MCP could be enhanced by the concomitant applications of other storage technologies...|$|R
25|$|Tartaric acid is, from a {{winemaking}} perspective, {{the most}} important in wine due to the prominent role it plays in maintaining the chemical stability of the wine and its color and finally in influencing {{the taste of the}} finished wine. In most plants, this organic acid is rare, but it is found in significant concentrations in grape vines. Along with malic acid, {{and to a lesser extent}} citric acid, tartaric is one of the fixed acids found in wine grapes. The concentration varies depending on grape variety and the soil content of the vineyard. Some varieties, such as Palomino, are naturally disposed to having high levels of tartaric acids, while Malbec and Pinot noir generally have lower levels. During flowering, high levels of tartaric acid are concentrated in the grape flowers and then young berries. As the vine progresses through ripening, tartaric does not get metabolized through respiration like malic acid, so the levels of tartaric acid in the grape vines remain relatively consistent throughout the <b>ripening</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following fruit set, {{the grape}} berries are green {{and hard to}} the touch. They have very little sugar and are high in organic acids. They begin to grow to about half their final size when they enter the stage of veraison. This stage signals the {{beginning}} of the <b>ripening</b> <b>process</b> and normally takes place around 40–50 days after fruit set. In the Northern Hemisphere this will be around the end of July and into August and between the end of January into February for the Southern Hemisphere. During this stage the colors of the grape take form-red/black or yellow/green depending on the grape varieties. This color changing is due to the chlorophyll in the berry skin being replaced by anthocyanins (red wine grapes) and carotenoids (white wine grapes). In a process known as engustment, the berries start to soften as they build up sugars. Within six days of the start of veraison, the berries begin to grow dramatically as they accumulate glucose and fructose and acids begin to fall.|$|E
25|$|The Grenache vine is {{characterized}} by its strong wood canopy and upright growth. It has good wind tolerance (which is useful with the northerly Cierzo and Mistral winds that influence the regions of Aragon and the Rhone) and has shown itself to be very suited for the dry, warm windy climate around the Mediterranean. The vine buds early and requires a long growing season in order to fully ripen. Grenache is often {{one of the last}} grapes to be harvested, often ripening weeks after Cabernet Sauvignon. The long <b>ripening</b> <b>process</b> allows the sugars in the grape to reach high levels, making Grenache based wines capable of substantial alcohol levels, often at least 15% ABV. While the vine is generally vigorous, it is susceptible to various grape diseases that can affect the yield and quality of the grape production such as coulure, bunch rot and downy mildew due to the vine's tight grape clusters. Marginal and wet climates can increase Grenache's propensity to develop these viticultural dangers. The vine's drought resistance is dependent on the type of rootstock it is planted on but on all types of rootstocks, Grenache seems to respond favorably to some degree of water stress.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} pectic {{oligomers}} and 1 -aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid on ethylene biosynthesis and color change was studied in ripening tomato pericarp discs excised from mature-green tomato fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Pectic oligomers induced {{at least four}} distinct responses when added to pericarp discs: (a) a short-term, transient increase in ethylene biosynthesis; (b) a long-term, persistent increase in climacteric ethylene in discs excised from mature-green fruit; (c) an advance in <b>ripening</b> <b>processes,</b> as indicated by increased reddening of the disc surfaces; and (d) a darkening of the treated endocarp surface. Pectic oligomers appear to affect the ripening of exocarp and endocarp tissues by different mechanisms. In exocarp tissues, the acceleration of reddening by pectic oligomers might simply be a consequence of induced ethylene biosynthesis. In endocarp tissues, the acceleration of reddening {{appears to be a}} direct effect of oligomers on <b>ripening</b> <b>processes.</b> We suggest that the rate of ripening of endocarp tissues may be regulated, in part, by the release of pectic oligomers from the cell walls of adjacent exocarp tissues. Exocarp and endocarp tissues of pericarp discs appear to differ in their sensitivity to ethylene at each maturity stage, and to exhibit independent changes in sensitivity to ethylene as ripening progresses. The tissue-specific pattern of reddening in tomato pericarp may result from this differential sensitivity to endogenous ethylene concentrations...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the change in sugar, acids and pH levels other components of the grapes are building up during the <b>ripening</b> <b>process.</b> The mineral components of potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium increase in concentration as they are disseminated among {{the skin of the}} grapes and its fleshy pulp.

Exposure to the warmth and sunlight during the ripening period ushers in chemical changes to the tannins that when processed into wine makes the tannins feel softer in the mouth.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the primary}} factors {{influencing}} the <b>ripening</b> <b>process</b> of grapevine is the climate and weather. Sunlight and temperature warmth are vital to the physiological functions of the grapevine (such as photosynthesis). An absence of either, such as long periods of extensive cloud cover, will cause many functions of the vine to slow or even completely halt as the vine enters a type of [...] "survival mode". As the grapevine funnels more resources to preserve its own survival, less resources are directed towards the ripening {{and development of the}} grape clusters. Excessive heat can also cause a grapevine to react adversely. The occurrence of heat waves during the growing season, particularly as it nears harvest, can cause the sugars in grapes to jump as acids fall dramatically. Some winemakers may decide to harvest early in order to maintain acid levels even though other components (such as tannins and phenolic compounds) may not be at optimal ripening. For the winemakers that decide to [...] "wait it out", a lack of acid can be partially rectify during the winemaking process with the addition of acids such as tartaric acid. It is much more difficult to remedy the effects of extensive rains during the ripening period. Steady rains before the harvest can cause the berries to swell with water which dilutes the flavors as well as causing cracking in the skin that creates openings for spoilage causing microorganism to propagate. Because of these risks, the threat of prolong rainfall during a vintage may cause an early harvest before the grapes have fully ripened. The most favorable vintages allow a slow, steady ripening without drastic jumps in heats or the threat of excessive rain fall.|$|E
