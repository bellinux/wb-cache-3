40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to measure and {{investigate}} factors affecting economic inefficiency of feedlot cattle farms in Thailand. The data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach and farm-level cross-sectional survey data of cattle farms in two provinces of the Southern Region in Thailand are used to estimate economic efficiency scores. Then, a Tobit regression is estimated and examined the effect of farm-specific socio-economic and management factors on farm efficiency. Through this, the likelihood of changes in inefficiency scores is explained by the above factors. The empirical results suggest two important findings. First, the economic efficiency scores of some farms were considerably low. Second, there is confirmation that farm size, the considerable variability of cattle breed and the difference in concentrated feed used have influenced the economic inefficiency of cattle farms while the differences in producers ’ age, education and experience, <b>rough</b> <b>feed,</b> the number of farm visits per year and belonging to farmer groups do not have different impacts on economic efficiency in Thai cattle production in different farms...|$|E
40|$|Agroecology uses natural {{processes}} and local resources rather than chemical inputs to ensure production while limiting the environmental footprint of livestock and crop production systems. Selecting {{to achieve a}} maximization of target production criteria has long proved detrimental to fitness traits. However, since the 1990 s, developments in animal breeding have also focussed on animal robustness by balancing production and functional traits within overall breeding goals. We discuss here how an agroecological perspective should further shift breeding goals towards functional traits rather than production traits. Breeding for robustness aims to promote individual adaptive capacities by considering diverse selection criteria which include reproduction, animal health and welfare, and adaptation to <b>rough</b> <b>feed</b> resources, a warm climate or fluctuating environmental conditions. It requires the consideration of genotype × environment interactions in the prediction of breeding values. Animal performance must be evaluated in low-input systems in order to select those animals that are adapted to limiting conditions, including feed and water availability, climate variations and diseases. Finally, we {{argue that there is}} no single agroecological animal type, but animals with a variety of profiles that can meet the expectations of agroecology. The standardization of both animals and breeding conditions indeed appears contradictory to the agroecological paradigm that calls for an adaptation of animals to local opportunities and constraints in weakly artificialized systems tied to their physical environment...|$|E

An aeration stage was applied both {{at the head of}} copper flotation (copper <b>rougher</b> <b>feed)</b> and after regrinding of the copper rougher tailings, before gold/pyrite selective flotation. Also, different collector regimes, involving sodium iso-butyl xanthate (SIBX) and N-butoxycarbonyl-nbutyl thionocarbamate (XD 5002), have been tested. It was found that aeration of the copper <b>rougher</b> <b>feed</b> produced lower gold (71 %) and copper (95 %) recoveries than the non-aeration of the copper <b>rougher</b> <b>feed</b> (73 % Au and 98 % Cu recoveries). Fine regrinding of the copper rougher tails increased both gold and copper recoveries in the subsequent flotation stage, due to improved liberation. The highest gold recovery from the rougher tailings (45 %) was achieved without aeration of the reground product. However, in these conditions poor rejection of pyrite was achieved, and the concentrate gold grade was low (1. 3 g/t, versus 2. 3 g/t obtained after aerating the pulp). With respect to the collector scheme, increased gold and copper recoveries were achieved blending the two collectors (SIBX and XD 5002) compared to XD 5002 alone. However, higher gold (3. 0 g/t) and copper (1. 0 %) grades were observed with XD 5002 alone, due to better pyrite rejection. This is believed to be due to the high affinity of xanthates (e. g., SIBX) for the copper activated pyrite. ...|$|R

40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, are fatal {{neurodegenerative}} {{diseases that}} affect several species, such as scrapie in sheep or goats and CJD in humans. In several species, neurological disease is preceded by TSE agent accumulation in lymphoid tissues prior to neuroinvasion. While oral transmission {{is considered the}} most common route for scrapie, transmission can also occur through lesions to the skin or mucosa, for example in the mouth or gastrointestinal tract due to <b>rough</b> <b>feed,</b> or birth associated skin damage. Scrapie has also been experimentally transmitted through skin scarification in mice. Following scrapie infection via skin scarification, PrPSc accumulates in the draining lymph node (LN) before spreading to other organs in the lymphoreticular system. It is not yet known by what means the scrapie agent is transported from the skin to the draining LN. Dendritic cells (DCs) in the skin {{have been found to}} transport viruses, such as HIV or Dengue, from the skin, thereby raising the question whether DCs or Langerhans cells (LCs), located within the epidermis, {{play a role in the}} uptake and transport of the TSE agent from the skin to the draining LN. CD 11 c is a cell surface marker traditionally used to identify or isolate DCs from other cell types. Mice and rats are naturally resistant to Diphtheria toxin (DTX). A transgenic mouse line was created where the Diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) was expressed on CD 11 c+ cells. The presence of this receptor on CD 11 c+ cells allowed for the temporary conditional depletion of CD 11 c+ cells following a single injection of DTX. The cells repopulate the tissues within a time frame specific to the tissues the cells are located in. These mice were used to determine whether the absence of CD 11 c+ cells at the time of scrapie infection via the skin had an effect on the early accumulation of PrPSc within the lymphoid tissues and on disease progression. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that early PrPSc accumulation in the draining LNs was delayed following depletion of CD 11 c+ cells, indicating that their potential role in the transport of the scrapie agent from the skin. Scrapie incubation period was not affected by the absence of the CD 11 c+ cells at the time of infection. Recent findings show that CD 11 c is not exclusive to DCs and is also expressed on macrophage populations. Following DTX-mediated depletion, DCs repopulate the tissues much faster than CD 11 c+ macrophages. Scrapie infection was carried out in the skin in DTX treated mice after DCs had repopulated the tissues but before macrophage numbers had returned, to determine whether macrophages rather than DCs played a role in the early accumulation of PrPSc in the draining LNs. No differences in PrPSc accumulation were observed in mice depleted of macrophages compared to controls and there was no effect on disease incubation period. Another transgenic mouse line was used, where DTX expression on langerin+ cells (LCs and langerin+ DCs in the dermis), allowed for their temporary depletion through DTX treatment. Following langerin+ cell depletion, increased PrPSc accumulation was observed in the draining LNs 7 weeks post infection, but did not affect the incubation period of disease. These results indicate that the absence of LCs somehow accelerated PrPSc accumulation, and that LCs might play a preventative role in early stages after infection. Histopathological analysis was used to complement microarray studies aimed to determine what immune responses were associated with scarification and DTXmediated depletion of cells within the skin and whether these responses might be linked to disease transmission. DCs and LCs in the skin appear to play different roles in the early stages following scrapie infection via the skin, but the lack of effect on incubation period does not rule out the involvement of other cell types or cell-free mechanisms of scrapie agent spread from the skin.

Sizing analysis of the survey samples demonstrated that a major limiting factor to overall lead recovery in {{this section of the}} plant was the diminished recovery of the fine galena in the minus 5 microns particle size fraction. Batch flotation experiments were carried out on a plant sample of lead secondary <b>rougher</b> <b>feed</b> and a sample of rod mill feed ore.

Changing of the grinding media used for the ore sample from a high carbon steel to a high chromium alloy steel resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} maximum recovery and flotation rate constant of the fine galena. EDTA (ethylene diaminetetraacetic) extractable iron measured for the high carbon steel media were similar in magnitude to those measured within the plant and were higher than those measured for the high chromium alloy steel media.

40|$|Tool failure {{remains one}} of the most {{challenging}} phenomena in machining that affects the productivity and product quality, and hence the cost. In high <b>feed</b> <b>rough</b> milling operations of hard-to-cut materials, chipping and breakage have been observed as the dominant failure modes of the end mill cutters. Most of the work in the open literature is focusing on either detecting the complete tool breakage after it takes place or detecting the progressive tool wear. Detecting the abrupt/sudden tool failure due to tool chipping before it takes place, which is essential to avoid any damage to the machined part, has not been addressed. Therefore, the main objective of this research work is to investigate the ability of using the process monitoring signals in order to detect the tool pre-failure and failure by chipping/breakage in intermittent cutting operations. A method was devised to induce impact load on the cutting tool tip to study the features of signals collected by various sensors due to unstable crack propagation and chipping, while ensuring minimal tool wear effect.

These types of laboratory data are used to investigate the effect of reagent and regrinding of coarse particles in an industrial flotation circuit. The addition of collector (BX) has a significant effect on the flotation response of chalcopyrite in the scavenger bank. The reconstructed recovery-time curve (combine products) is greater than that of the <b>rougher</b> tailings (scavenger <b>feed)</b> prior to reagent addition. By adding collector (BX) in the scavenger feed, the ultimate recovery of chalcopyrite increases 20 % which means an increase of 1. 7 % of chalcopyrite recovery in the scavenger feed. Meanwhile, the reagrinding of coarse particles shows a detrimental effect on the collectorless flotation of an initially hydrophobic chalcopyrite sample. Cyclone underflow, 80 % recovery at pH 7. 7, was decreased to 40 % after regrinding at the same range of pH. The chalcopyrite flotation response immediately after regrinding is severely retarded. It is assumed that the centrifugal action of the cyclone is another important factor restoring the chalcopyrite hydrophobic flotation due to the oxygenation of the slurry. Therefore, additional preconditioning time after a regrinding stage should have a positive change in the recovery of chalcopyrite. The overall flotation response before and after the regrinding stage showed that the cyclone underflow response is slightly slower compared with the combine feed in the first four minutes of flotation. This behavior is related to changes on surface chemistry because of the regrinding of coarse particles...|$|R

Animals were housed individually and were submitted to stressful ante mortem conditions (mixed in the lorry according to treatments and transported 1 h on <b>rough</b> roads). Individual <b>feed</b> intake was recorded during the 5 -day treatment. At the abattoir, pig behaviour was assessed in the raceway to the stunning system and during the stunning period by exposure to CO 2. Muscle pH, colour, water holding capacity, texture and cathepsin activities were determined to assess meat quality. The number of pigs with an individual feed intake lower than 2 kg/day was significantly different among diets (P 2 kg/day, all {{of them from the}} stress-sensitive pigs (nn). In general, no differences were observed in the behaviour of pigs along the corridor leading to the stunning system and inside the CO 2 stunning system. During the stunning procedure, Trp diet showed shorter periods of muscular excitation than control and Mg&Trp diets. The combination of a stressful ante mortem treatment and Mg&Trp supplementation led to carcasses with high incidence of severe skin lesions. Different meat quality results were found when considering all pigs or considering only those with adequate supplement intake. In this later case, Trp increased pH 45 (6. 15) vs Control diet (5. 96) in the Longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle (P< 0. 05) and pH at 24 h (Trp: 5. 59 vs C: 5. 47) led to a higher incidence of dark, firm and dry (DFD) traits in SM muscle (P< 0. 05).

Samples were taken of the <b>rougher</b> concentrate (cyclone <b>feed</b> could not be accurately sampled), cyclone underflow and cyclone overflow. The samples were filtered and dried at Minorca and the dried samples were sent to Coleraine. They were screened through 500 mesh and the individual screen fractions were analyzed for magnetic iron (Satmagan) and silica. Results from the chemistry by size fractions were balanced using the USIMPAC program. There was good agreement between the measured and balanced data. These {{results indicated that the}} main effect of the demagnetizing coil was in the minus 500 mesh fractions. The amount of minus 500 mesh material reporting to the underflow was significantly lower when the coil was energized. Also, the silica content of the minus 500 mesh fraction in the underflow has higher, and the amount of minus 500 mesh material in the cyclone overflow was higher when the coil was on. The USIMPAC program was used with the balance data to calculate the cyclone split size, d 50, and apparent by-pass for the magnetic iron and silica portion of the cyclone feed. Having the coil on or off had little effect on the d 50 values for either the magnetic iron or the silica, but having the coil off increased the magnetic iron apparent by-pass by about 100 percent. Computer simulations using USIMPAC were run using previous plant data and the cyclone parameters determined above. However, this produced unrealistic results, since the previous data had a significantly coarser cyclone split. Since the cyclone splits were essentially unaffected by the coil, simulations were run with the previous data splits and the current apparent by-passes. This simulation showed an increased circulating load, but little overall effect on the line performance. Test work conclusively showed that the use of a demagnetizing coil on the cyclone feed at Minorca will significantly reduce the amount of fine iron reporting to the cyclone underflow, which should improve line performance...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Flotation is {{a widely}} used {{separation}} process in the mineral industry. The successful operation of a flotation plant depends {{on a number of}} factors such as the suspension of mineral particles in the pulp, collector efficiency, bubble particle attachment and froth stability. In addition, the role of the froth zone is crucial in the flotation process as it plays a significant role in controlling the final product grade and recovery. The importance of the froth zone in both laboratory and plant scale flotation cells has been recognised by researchers for many years (Cutting et al., 1986; Feteris et al., 1987; Gorain et al., 1998 b; Lynch et al., 1981). Savassi et al. (1997), using an indirect mass balancing technique on a plant scale flotation cell, estimated that the recovery of particles in the froth zone of a rougher cell can vary from 70 % to 10 % depending on the position of the cell in a rougher bank. As a result 50 % of overall plant flotation cell efficiency can be lost due to poor froth performance. The froth recovery, the mass flowrate of particles reporting to the flotation product as a fraction of the mass flowrate that enters the froth layer, is a single parameter that can globally express the overall froth performance. If known, it could be a quantity of great utility in flotation plant design and the simulation of flotation circuits. However, the complexity of the froth zone, and interactions in the flow of solids and liquid between the pulp and froth zones, make it difficult to perform independent straightforward measurements of the froth recovery. At present, a number of indirect methods are available in the minerals industry to measure froth recovery (Alexander et al., 2003; Savassi et al., 1997; Vera et al., 1999). These methods are based on certain assumptions, which are not completely justified. As a result, it is quite important to develop a direct method to perform independent froth recovery measurements and investigation of froth behaviour. The overall objective of this research work is to study the froth zone and measure the froth recovery of a flotation cell A froth dropback method is used to directly measure froth recovery and experiments are performed with laboratory, pilot-scale and plantscale flotation cells. The effects of both physical and operating conditions (e. g. particle size, fine to coarse particles ratio in feed, air flowrate, froth depth, collector concentration and frother concentration) on froth recovery are investigated. In order to carry out the aforementioned works, a unique device has been developed to measure the dropback of particles from the froth zone. The aim is to decouple the froth zone from the pulp zone, to allow independent measurement of the froth recovery. The device consists of two concentric cylindrical tubes. The inner tube is denoted the dropback collection chamber or catcher. During the experiments, particleladen bubbles are allowed to pass through the annular gap between the two concentric tubes and a stable froth is formed {{at the top of the}} froth dropback (FDB) device. The collection chamber is mounted directly beneath the froth layer. Particles that fall off the froth are collected in the dropback chamber, and concentrate passes over the lip of the cell and is collected from a product launder. The mass flowrate into the device is estimated as the sum of the concentrate and dropback flowrates, and the froth recovery can then be calculated. In the first part of this thesis, the FDB device was used in a controlled laboratory environment to investigate the froth behaviour. Flotation experiments were performed using pure silica mineral. A mixture of finer 60 G (d₈₀ = 72 μm) and coarser 50 N (d₈₀ = 299 μm) silica particles with a wide particle size distribution was used as feed. The effect of important flotation parameters such as the ratio of fine-to-coarse particles in the feed, the collector concentration, the air flowrate, and froth depth on froth recovery were investigated. It was found that froth recovery can be as low as 60 % in the laboratory flotation environment. It was also found that the froth recovery is a strong function of particle size. Finer particles have high froth recoveries whereas the coarse particles have low froth recoveries, and are more prone to detach and report in the dropback stream. One of the important findings of the investigation is that the presence of fine particles can have a very significant effect on the collection of coarse particles in the flotation cell. The investigation also found that an increase in collector concentration significantly increases the collection of coarse particles in the collection (pulp) zone. However, higher collector concentrations can lead to destabilisation of the froth zone, resulting in a significant loss of the coarse particles from the froth zone. Air flowrate was found to have a positive impact on both collection and froth zone recovery. It was found that the froth zone works as a barrier to the collection of very coarse particles. However, at shallow froth depths, a significant collection of coarse particles in the product is found, but the froth recovery drops quickly as froth height is increased. In the second part of the thesis, an investigation into froth zone recovery in a controlled plant environment is presented. The laboratory apparatus was taken to the Northparkes copper mine, near Parkes, NSW, and a feed of copper-enriched minerals was taken from the head of the cleaner scavenger bank in an operating circuit. The feed slurry had a relatively higher copper grade varying from 5. 2 % to 6. 8 %. During this investigation, the size and grade of the particles in the flotation samples were analysed to acquire in-depth knowledge about the froth dropback mechanism. It was found that the froth recovery could be as low as 70 % but it is relatively easy to achieve values in the range 75 to 85 % by the correct choice of operating variables. The results show trends similar to those found in the laboratory with silica. Froth recovery was higher for finer particles whereas for coarse particles it decreases. It was found that the air flowrate has a positive impact on both collection (pulp) and froth zone recoveries. However, the effect was more prominent in the froth zone. Froth depth was found to have a significant effect on froth recovery. A larger number of valuable mineral particles detach and report to the dropback stream, with increasing froth height. Increasing the collector concentration gave expected results in the collection (pulp) zone, with a significant increase in coarse particle recovery. However, at high collector concentrations, it was observed that there was an increase in bubble coalescence and froth instability as well as a slight decrease in froth recovery. Increasing the frother concentration gave a significant improvement in froth recovery and a slight increase in collection zone recovery was also found. This may be attributed to the formation of finer, more stable, bubbles and a corresponding increase in froth stability. Size and grade analysis of the samples suggest that the dropback particles are mainly composite or middling fractions. It appears that particles whose grade is higher than the feed may be collected into the froth zone, but some particles with grades lower than the concentrate may detach from the froth and report to the dropback stream. In the third part of the thesis, a study of froth recovery and dropback in an operating plant rougher cell is presented. The dropback device was modified to make it sufficiently robust for in-plant testing. It was then inserted into the rougher bank of the Northparkes copper concentrator and the froth recovery was measured on two consecutive days. The feed grade to the rougher cell was 0. 4 % Cu. During the test work, the air flowrate into the rougher cell was varied. Each run was repeated for three times to check the reproducibility of the procedure. From the experimental results of Day 1 and Day 2, it was found that the froth recovery of the rougher cell was very high, around 90 %, and was a strong function of particle size. Increasing the air rate slightly increases the froth recovery overall, and also enhances the recovery of coarse particles. The dropback particles have higher grade than <b>rougher</b> cell <b>feed</b> but lower than concentrate grade. From grade vs particle size analysis, it was also found that for relatively coarser particles the dropback grade is much higher than the grades of both <b>feed</b> and <b>rougher</b> cell tailings. However, for relatively finer particles the dropback grade is lower than the feed grade, possibly as a result of entrainment. It was also found that the copper grade of concentrate collected from the dropback device was lower than that of the rougher cell itself, for the same froth height. This result could have come about because of a disparity in the froth residence time, which was lower in the dropback device than in the froth layer in the rougher cell. Alternatively, the finest gangue particles may not have had sufficient time to drain out of the froth. This thesis represents the first systematic attempt to measure froth dropback using feed samples drawn from an operating mineral concentrator. The froth recovery results are higher than had been expected from the few reported accounts in the literature. While the results are promising, it is clear however that the froth dropback device is still at an early development stage. There are few limitations in the current froth dropback device. However, one limitation is that entrainment is not eliminated and further research work should be carried out to minimise entrainment. It is worth noting that, because it is possible to physically capture samples of the particles that have dropped out of a froth, closer examination of the surfaces of these particles, and their fractional liberation using Mineral Liberation Analysis or QemScan, will give valuable information about the measures that could be taken to increase their overall recovery, especially relating to the flotation of coarse particles. In summary, the experimental results from the three phases of this investigation suggest that the froth recovery can be as low as around 60 %, but it is relatively simple to achieve froth recoveries in the range 75 % – 85 % using standard operating variables. Froth dropback is a strong function of particle size. Coarser particles are more prone to detach from the froth zone and report as dropback particles. Results from the high grade copper flotation work suggest that composite or middling particles, having lower grades than concentrate but higher grades than feed, report as dropback particles. These findings provide valuable information on the behaviour of flotation froths in the laboratory and in an operating concentrator. The value gained from the findings of this research work in industrial plant operations, together with further research into managing the froth zone effectively and improving coarse particle recovery, has the potential to reduce energy consumption and therefore further improve productivity in the mining industry...|$|R
