40|$|Abstract. When using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to {{optimize}} the feature space of pattern classification problems, the performance improvement is not only determined by the data set used, but also depends on the classifier. This work compares the improvements achieved by GA-optimized feature transformations on several simple classifiers. Some traditional feature transformation techniques, such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are also tested to see their effects on the GA optimization. The results based on some real-world data and five benchmark data sets from the UCI repository show that the improvements after GA-optimized feature transformation are in <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> with the original classification rate if the classifier is used alone. It is also shown that performing the PCA and LDA transformations on the feature space prior to the GA optimization improved the final result. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) encodes the p 7 {{protein that}} oligomerizes {{to form an}} ion channel. The 63 amino acid long p 7 monomer is an integral membrane protein predominantly found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although it is currently unknown whether p 7 is incorporated into secreted virions, its presence is crucial {{for the release of}} infectious virus. The molecular and biophysical mechanism employed by the p 7 ion channel is largely unknown, but in vivo {{it is likely to be}} embedded in membranes undergoing changes in lipid composition. In this study we analyze the influence of the lipid environment on p 7 ion channel structure and function using electrophysiology and synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopy. We incorporated chemically synthesized p 7 polypeptides into artificial planar membranes of various lipid compositions. A lipid bilayer composition comprising phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (4 : 1 PC:PE) led to burst-like patterns in the channel recordings with channel openings lasting up to 0. 5 s. The <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> of PC:PE (1 : 4) gave rise to individual channels continuously opening for up to 8 s.

40|$|Mobility and Permanence in Vendômois around 1800 What are {{the main}} {{features}} of mobility and permanence in a provincial society {{at the very end}} of the 18 th century? In order to answer that question, a systematic comprehensive study of marriage certificates registered in Vendomois between "an VII" (1798) and "an XII" (1804) has been carried out and the various data (places, occupations, education [...] .) thoroughly cross-referenced with the help of a computer. The picture emerging from this analysis is, for the most part, that of a steady community. It also reveals, mainly among men, a mobility, chiefly urban and exclusive of peasantry whose map points to standard migration flows. Matrimonial integration among these migrants can vary considerably and is on the whole in <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> to the social consistency of the different classes (for instance, vine-growers, when they make up the mass of a community tend to be imprevious to external influences.) The preeminence of the notion of consistency as well as its characteristics is one of the outstanding discoveries of our research. It must be noted that when they choose an occupation, sons tend to find agriculture a little less attractive than their fathers did (most of them, however, don't take another choice). As a rule, the same slow evolution can be traced between fathers-in-law and sons-in-law. A few rare instances, however, indicate that marriage seems to maintain with peasantry the very links which tend to die away when a non-agricultural activity is chosen. Vassort Jean.

40|$|Parasitic {{nematodes}} are {{of medical}} and veterinary importance, adversely affecting human health and animal welfare. Ascaris suum is a gastrointestinal parasite of pigs; {{in addition to its}} veterinary significance it is a good model of the human parasite Ascaris lumbricoides, estimated to infect ~ 1. 4 billion people globally. Anthelmintic drugs are essential to control nematode parasites, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on nerve and muscle are the targets of cholinergic anthelmintics such as levamisole and pyrantel. Previous genetic analyses of nematode nAChRs have been confined to Caenorhabditis elegans, which is phylogenetically distinct from Ascaris spp. and many other important parasites. Here we report the cloning and expression of two nAChR subunit cDNAs from A. suum. The subunits are very similar in sequence to C. elegans UNC- 29 and UNC- 38, are expressed on muscle cells and can be expressed robustly in Xenopus oocytes to form acetylcholine-, nicotine-, levamisole- and pyrantel-sensitive channels. We also demonstrate that changing the stoichiometry of the receptor by injecting different ratios of the subunit cRNAs can reproduce two of the three pharmacological subtypes of nAChR present in A. suum muscle cells. When the ratio was 5 : 1 (Asu-unc- 38 :Asu-unc- 29), nicotine was a full agonist and levamisole was a partial agonist, and oocytes responded to oxantel, but not pyrantel. At the <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> (1 : 5 Asu-unc- 38 :Asu-unc- 29), levamisole was a full agonist and nicotine was a partial agonist, and the oocytes responded to pyrantel, but not oxantel. These results represent the first in vitro expression of any parasitic nicotinic receptor and show that their properties are substantially different from those of C. elegans. The results also show that changing the expression level of a single receptor subunit dramatically altered the efficacy of some anthelmintic drugs. In vitro expression of these subunits may permit the development of parasite-specific screens for future anthelmintics...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND. The Stirling benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} {{natural history}} group have previously reported a prevalence of this condition of 255 per 1000 in a community study of 1610 men aged 40 - 79 years. AIM. It was decided to examine the consultation patterns of men with {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} in greater detail. METHOD. All participating men were invited to complete a previously validated lifestyle questionnaire including questions on consultations with their general practitioner {{during the previous year}} and previous history of prostatic problems. The men who had a urinary symptom score greater than 11, or who had a urinary flow rate of less than 15 ml per second were examined by transurethral ultrasonography for prostate size. RESULTS. Of 364 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, 89 % had not consulted their doctor about urinary symptoms in the year prior to the study. Men with moderate to severe urinary symptoms were six {{times more likely to have}} consulted their doctor than those with mild symptoms. Moderate to severe symptoms and greater interference with daily living activities were both associated with a greater likelihood of consultation, independent of age. Of all the men in the study referred to the specialist clinic for assessment of prostate size by transurethral ultrasonography, two thirds were referred because of low urinary flow rate and one third because of high urinary symptom scores. The reported consultation data showed a <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> of one third of those consulting having a low urinary flow rate and approximately two thirds having urinary symptoms. CONCLUSION. While mass screening is unjustified, there is a need for patient education about benign prostatic hyperplasia in general and the recognition of declining strength of urinary flow as a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia and not of ageing alone. Furthermore, evaluation of primary care use of urinary flowmeters and the development of local protocols are suggested as elements of a case finding strategy for benign prostatic hyperplasia based on patient led consultation...|$|E

Peripheral blood CD 4 + CD 25 + FoxP 3 + (Tregs), CD 4 + IFN-γ + (Th 1), and CD 4 + IL- 4 + (Th 2) lymphocytes were analyzed in 22 steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) patients in sustained remission, 21 steroid-resistant NS (SRNS) and 14 healthy controls. The absolute percentage values and ratio of Th 1 /Tregs, Th 2 /Tregs, and Th 1 /Th 2 were compared between SSNS, SRNS and control subjects. The percentage of Tregs was lower in SRNS patients (P = 0. 001) compared with that of SSNS and healthy control. The percentage of Th 1 cells was higher in SRNS (P = 0. 001) compared to that of SSNS patients; however, it was similar to healthy controls (P = 1. 00). The percentage of Th 2 cells in SRNS (P = 0. 001) was higher as compared to SSNS and controls. The ratio of Th 1 /Treg cells in SRNS (P = 0. 001) was higher as compared to SSNS patients and controls. The ratio of Th 2 /Treg was also higher in SRNS as compared to SSNS and controls. The ratio of Th 1 /Th 2 cells in SSNS, SRNS, and healthy controls were similar. The cytokines secretion complemented the change in different T-cell subtypes in SSNS, SRNS and healthy controls.

40|$|Early-age {{shrinkage}} {{and cracking}} have become reoccurring problem in concrete construction. Conditions such as reduced maximum aggregate size, increased amount of fines, presence of retarding admixtures, increased binder content and deficient covering and curing {{all contribute to}} this problem. At early age, when the cement paste is young and has poorly developed mechanical properties, autogenous and evaporating shrinkage, both incorporated in the plastic shrinkage, are the two main driving forces for cracking. For modern concretes developing large autogenous shrinkage, as the high performance and self-compacting concrete (SCC), early-age cracking is a highly topical and important area. When the concrete dries out due to evaporation there will be formation of water menisci near the concrete surface. The distance between the particles then tends to be reduced and the concrete will contract. These contracting capillary forces are in <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> to the meniscus radius. The capillary tension stresses will therefore increase with decreasing interparticle spaces. For a concrete where the evaporation is prevented, the negative capillary pressure will also start to develop as the concrete sets. As a solid skeleton starts to form the chemical shrinkage is not totally transformed into external volume change and, if the water supply is restricted, empty pores will be formed inside the paste and water meniscus occurs. In this work, early age (< 24 h) autogenous deformation and crack tendency due to plastic shrinkage was measured. For the autogenous deformation, a specially developed digital dilatometer was used with great satisfactory, generating accurately measures of the linear displacements of the concrete cast in a vapor proof flexible tube mould. The plastic shrinkage cracking tendency was evaluated, using a modified Nordtest method (NT BUILD 433), where the concrete sample was exposed to early drying conditions and where the restraining inner steel ring causes development of tangential stresses which if sufficiently high leads to cracking. As the underlying mechanisms are not quantified by the ring-test and as plastic shrinkage strongly {{are related to the}} negative capillary pressure in fresh concrete, the test was complimented with transducer recording the development of the pore pressure. In some cases, pore pressure development was also measured on sealed specimens, referring to the autogenous deformation tests. A large number of different SCC constituents and mix compositions have been investigated; e. g. w/c-ratio from 0. 38 to 0. 67, coarse aggregate content, silica fume, fly ash, cement type, extra water and different admixtures (accelerator, retarder, shrinkage reducer, air entraining agent, superplasticizer dosage). For comparison, tests with standard concrete were made. The crack tendency test was also performed on mixes with different fibers and curing compounds. The influence of different constituents and mixes on the autogenous deformation and plastic shrinkage crack tendency was significantly observed. The results indicated that: • High crack tendency was generated when: - large autogenous shrinkage (silica addition, low w/c, high fineness) - high water evaporation (extra water, high w/c, low fineness) - retardation (retarder, slow hardening cement, high superplastisizer dosage), - low content of coarse aggregate • Minimum crack tendency at w/c 0. 55 IV • Reduced crack tendency by: - shrinkage reducing admixture (large positive effect on both autogenous shrinkage and evaporation, without influencing the time to initial- and final set) - acceleration (accelerator, rapid cement) - air entraining agent - fibers - wax membrane (effectively for concretes with high evaporation) Finally the ring-test method and the experimental results were clearly verified by field studies...|$|E
