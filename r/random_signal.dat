25|$|Another example where sub-Nyquist {{sampling}} is optimal arises {{under the}} additional constraint that the samples are quantized in an optimal manner, as in a combined system of sampling and optimal lossy compression. This setting is relevant {{in cases where}} the joint effect of sampling and quantization is to be considered, and can provide a lower bound for the minimal reconstruction error that can be attained in sampling and quantizing a <b>random</b> <b>signal.</b> For stationary Gaussian random signals, this lower bound is usually attained at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate, indicating that sub-Nyquist sampling is optimal for this signal model under optimal quantization.|$|E
25|$|Bode {{designed}} the velocity computing networks of Director T-15 by applying a {{finite difference method}} instead of differentiation. Under this scheme the target positional coordinates were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a potentiometer or a cam. The velocity was then calculated by taking {{the difference between the}} coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times. This method was more robust than the differentiation method and it also smoothed out signal disturbances since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to <b>random</b> <b>signal</b> impulses (spikes). It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern digital signal processing theory rather than to the classical Calculus-based analog signal processing approach that was followed then. Not coincidentally it {{is an integral part of}} modern digital control theory and digital signal processing and it is known as the backward difference algorithm. In addition the Director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates thus eliminating coordinate transformation-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends and the Director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and it converged on a target twice as fast.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{behaviour}} of deterministic and wide-sense (WS) stationary <b>random</b> <b>signals</b> in multirate filter bank branches. We focus on subband energy spectra and energies for deterministic signals, and on subband power spectra and powers for <b>random</b> <b>signals.</b> We show that energy spectra and power spectra behave funda-mentally different in a filter bank branch: aliasing in decimation causes energy spectra and energies of deter-ministic signals to be translation variant. The shapes of power spectra of WS stationary <b>random</b> <b>signals</b> are also affected by decimation, but signals remain WS sta-tionary.

This technique {{is based on the}} combination of the Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and discrete sine transform (DST) of the inputs to the neural networks. The input data sets to traditional neural systems for FET small-signal modeling are the scattering parameters and corresponding frequencies in a certain band, and the outputs are the circuit elements. In the proposed approach, these data sets are considered as forming <b>random</b> <b>signals.</b> The MFCCs of the <b>random</b> <b>signals</b> are used to generate a small number of features characterizing the signals.
