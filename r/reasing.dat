40|$|For a {{very long}} time, Type II {{restriction}} enzymes (<b>REases)</b> have been a paradigm of ORFans: proteins with no detectable similarity {{to each other and}} to any other protein in the database, despite common cellular and biochemical function. Crystallographic analyses published until January 2008 provided high-resolution structures for only 28 of 1637 Type II <b>REase</b> sequences available in the Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE). Among these structures, all but two possess catalytic domains with the common PD-(D/E) XK nuclease fold. Two structures are unrelated to the others: R. BfiI exhibits the phospholipase D (PLD) fold, while R. PabI has a new fold termed ‘half-pipe’. Thus far, bioinformatic studies supported by site-directed mutagenesis have extended the number of tentatively assigned <b>REase</b> folds to five (now including also GIY-YIG and HNH folds identified earlier in homing endonucleases) and provided structural predictions for dozens of <b>REase</b> sequences without experimentally solved structures. Here, we present a comprehensive study of all Type II <b>REase</b> sequences available in REBASE together with their homologs detectable in the nonredundant and environmental samples databases at the NCBI. We present the summary and critical evaluation of structural assignments and predictions reported earlier, new classification of all <b>REase</b> sequences into families, domain architecture analysis and new predictions of three-dimensional folds. Among 289 experimentally characterized (not putative) Type II <b>REases,</b> whose apparently full-length sequences are available in REBASE, we assign 199 (69 %) to contain the PD-(D/E) XK domain. The HNH domain is the second most common, with 24 (8 %) members. When putative <b>REases</b> are taken into account, the fraction of PD-(D/E) XK and HNH folds changes to 48 % and 30 %, respectively.

30|$|Restriction endonucleases (<b>REases)</b> are {{components}} of restriction-modification systems that occur ubiquitously among prokaryotic organisms and {{are among the}} basic tools of molecular biology (Roberts, 2005). To date, more than 3600 <b>REases</b> representing more than 250 different specificities have been characterized and classified into four types (Roberts et al., 2003). Type II <b>REases</b> are widely used in genetic technologies because of their stable cleavage pattern and are the most well studied. They recognize short DNA sequences (3 – 8  bp) and create double strand breaks at constant positions within or close to that sequence to generate new ends with 5 ′-phosphates and 3 ′-hydroxyls (Roberts et al., 2003). In particular, type IIP <b>REases</b> recognize palindromic sequences and create symmetrical double strand breaks.|$|R
30|$|Although <b>REases</b> usually cleave {{specific}} DNA sequences accurately, certain <b>REases</b> cleave sequences {{which are}} similar, but not identical, to their defined recognition sequences under non-optimal conditions, {{such as the}} presence of organic solvent, sub-optimal pH values and high enzyme concentrations. This relaxed specificity has been termed star activity. Star activity has been reported with <b>REases</b> such as XbaI, SalI, PstI, BamHI, PvuII and EcoRV (Malyguine et al., 1980; Nasri and Thomas, 1987; Robinson and Sligar, 1995). Star activity is not desirable for most <b>REase</b> applications where off-site cleavage is detrimental. Because star activity is relatively weak, the star sites of only a few enzymes have been defined. Interestingly, all identified star sites are only different from the canonical sequence by one base (George and Chirikjian, 1982; Halford et al., 1986; Nasri and Thomas, 1987).

However, the extent of cleavage is varied depending on the metal ion and the sequence. The ability of the enzyme to be promiscuous or specific may reflect an evolutionary design. Based on the results, we suggest that the enzyme KpnI represents an <b>REase</b> evolving to attain higher sequence specificity from an ancient nonspecific nuclease...|$|R

In this paper, {{we present}} the SoftRouter ar hite ture that permits dynami asso iation between ontrol and forward-ing elements, and separates {{the implementation of}} on-trol plane fun tions from pa ket forwarding fun tions. In this ar hite ture, all ontrol plane fun tions are imple-mented on general purpose servers alled the ontrol el-ements (CE's) that ould be multiple hops away from the forwarding elements (FEs). A network element (NE) or a router is formed using dynami binding between the CEs and the FEs. We argue that this exibility results in sev-eral benets in luding in <b>reased</b> reliability, in <b>reased</b> s al-ability, in <b>reased</b> se urity, ease of adding new fun tionality, and de <b>reased</b> ost. 1...|$|R
