5|$|In 1894, {{with the}} help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian, founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. In 1906, {{convinced}} he could resolve the conundrum of Uranus's orbit, he began an extensive project to search for a trans-Neptunian planet, which he named PlanetX, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. The X in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter, as opposed to the <b>Roman</b> <b>numeral</b> for 10 (at the time, PlanetX would have been the ninth planet). Lowell's hope in tracking down PlanetX was to establish his scientific credibility, which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on the surface of Mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization.|$|E
5|$|Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre had, since 1849, {{designed}} coins {{with various}} visages {{of the goddess}} Liberty, based on a bust, Venus Accroupie, {{he had seen in}} a Philadelphia museum on loan from the Vatican. Although the Liberty as used on the three-cent nickel piece is closest to Longacre's experimental cents of 1857 and quarter eagles of 1860, she resembles most of the Chief Engraver's other depictions of Liberty. On the three-cent piece, she wears a coronet with her name on it, and a ribbon binds her hair. For the reverse, Longacre combined the <b>Roman</b> <b>numeral</b> III as rendered on the silver three-cent piece with the laurel wreath used on the 1859 Indian Head cent reverse. Breen suggested that the similarity of design to other Longacre coins has contributed to the low level of collector interest in the three-cent nickel.|$|E

2500|$|While scale degrees are {{typically}} represented in musical analysis or musicology articles with Arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3..., sometimes with a circumflex above the numeral: , , ...), the triads (three-note chords) that have these degrees as their roots are often identified by <b>Roman</b> <b>numerals</b> (e.g., I, IV, V, {{which in the}} key of C major would be the triads C major, F major, G major). In some conventions (as in this and related articles) upper-case <b>Roman</b> <b>numerals</b> indicate major triads (e.g., I, IV, V) while lower-case <b>Roman</b> <b>numerals</b> indicate minor triads (e.g., I for a major chord and i for a minor chord, or using the major key, ii, iii and vi representing typical diatonic minor triads): other writers, (e.g. Schoenberg) use upper case <b>Roman</b> <b>numerals</b> for both major and minor triads. Some writers use upper-case <b>Roman</b> <b>numerals</b> to indicate the chord is diatonic in the major scale, and lower-case <b>Roman</b> <b>numerals</b> {{to indicate that the}} chord is diatonic in the minor scale. Diminished triads may be represented by lower-case <b>Roman</b> <b>numerals</b> with a degree symbol (e.g., vii7 indicates a diminished seventh chord built on the seventh scale degree; in the key of C major, this chord would be b diminished seventh, which consists of the notes B, D, F and G).|$|R
