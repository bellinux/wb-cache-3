40|$|The {{use of a}} modal {{representation}} for {{the exterior}} acoustic field of a structure has received increasing attention in recent years. This modal approach generally seeks a set of orthogonal functions, representing independent surface velocity distributions, termed acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>modes,</b> which diagonalize a radiation operator in the exterior domain of the structure. These orthogonal acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> may be found, among other methods, through an eigenvalue analysis of a radiation operator and possess a corresponding set of eigenvalues that are proportional to the radiation efficiencies of the acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>modes.</b> In free space, the acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> of a sphere display a grouping characteristic in their radiation efficiencies, where each acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>mode's</b> <b>radiation</b> efficiency within a group has the same frequency dependency. This {{is a consequence of}} the fact that the acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> of a sphere are the spherical harmonics. Further, the acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> of an arbitrary three-dimensional structure exhibit the same frequency grouping as those for the sphere. The basis for the arbitrary structure's grouping follows from the sphere's grouping. The observation that the acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> of an arbitrary body are dominated by spherical harmonics provides insight on the behavior of such modes. These results have significance for various applications of acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>modes,</b> including active noise control design, radiation modeling, etc...|$|R

50|$|However, {{orthohydrogen}} is thermodynamically unstable at {{low temperatures}} and spontaneously converts into parahydrogen. This process lacks any natural de-excitation <b>radiation</b> <b>mode,</b> {{so it is}} slow {{in the absence of}} a catalyst which can facilitate interconversion of the singlet and triplet spin states. At room temperature, hydrogen contains 75% orthohydrogen, a proportion which the liquefaction process preserves if carried out {{in the absence of a}} catalyst like ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds,chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds to accelerate the conversion of the liquid hydrogen into parahydrogen. Alternatively, additional refrigeration equipment can be used to slowly absorb the heat that the orthohydrogen fraction will (more slowly) release as it spontaneously converts into parahydrogen. If orthohydrogen is not removed from rapidly liquified hydrogen, without a catalyst, the heat released during its decay can boil off as much as 50% of the original liquid.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new strategy}} {{for the design of}} <b>radiation</b> <b>mode</b> sensors by using shaped PVDF films for one-dimension structures.

A general expression of the PVDF sensor shape is obtained. It is found that the modal sensor shape can be expressed as a function of the second spatial derivative of the structural mode shape function.

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of an acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>mode</b> of a baffled plate, Rayleigh integral with free space Green’s function is involved. The boundary element method (BEM) {{is one of the}} approaches to compute its modes and radiation efficiencies. In this paper a fast multipole BEM in conjunction with an iterative solver based on the implicit restart Arnold method is proposed to efficiently and accurately evaluate acoustic radiation modes and efficiencies. Even though a 3 D free space Green’s function is used here, a quad tree is used for the hierarchical tree structure of the boundary mesh instead of an oct tree, which can speed up the fast multipole BEM. Similar to the analytical integration of moment evaluations, the analytical integration is also employed to compute the local expansion coefficients which further improves the efficiency of the fast multipole BEM for {{the analysis}} of an acoustic <b>radiation</b> <b>mode</b> of baffled plates.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the facet {{reflectivity}} of a semiconductor slab waveguide is reexamined {{as an extension of}} Ikegami's original approach but which includes radiation-like modes. The latter are included, using a guide-within-a-guide geometry, as modes bound to a thick air-cladding guide which contains the core profile of interest. In this model with a relatively simple analysis, the coupling from the fundamental <b>mode</b> to <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> can be analyzed. The cross-coupling to the <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> is considered in detail for the simple double hetero-structure waveguide and is shown to be important only for large core-cladding index differences and for strong modal confinement wherein it results in a true facet loss. The conditions for this are the same as for low threshold lasers so that the loss sets a maximum limit on the equivalent internal quantum efficiency. A separate one-dimensional finite element, numerical mode matching program, which treats evanescent and propagating <b>radiation</b> <b>modes,</b> is used as a comparison.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) in 3 -D cylindrical, square, and triangular microcavities with vertical optical confinement of semiconductors are numerically {{investigated by the}} finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique. For a microcylinder with a vertical refractive index 3. 17 / 3. 4 / 3. 17 and a center layer thickness 0. 2 mu m, Q-factors of transverse electric (TE) WGMs around wavelength 1550 nm are smaller than 10 (3), as the radius R < 4 mu m and reach the orders of 10 (4) and 10 (6) as R = 5 and 6 mu m, respectively. However, the Q-factor of transverse magnetic (TM) WGMs at wavelength 1. 659 mu m reaches 7. 5 x 10 (5) as R = 1 mu m. The mode coupling between the WGMs and vertical radiation modes in the cladding layer results in vertical radiation loss for the WGMs. In the microcylinder, the mode wavelength of TM WGM {{is larger than the}} cutoff wavelength of the vertical <b>radiation</b> <b>mode</b> with the same mode numbers, so TM WGMs cannot couple with the vertical <b>radiation</b> <b>mode</b> and have high Q-factor. In contrast, TE WGMs can couple with the corresponding vertical <b>radiation</b> <b>mode</b> in the 3 -D microcylinder as R < 5 mu m. However, the mode wavelength of the TE WGM approaches (is larger than) the cutoff wavelength of the corresponding radiation modes at R = 5 mu m (6 mu m), so TE WGMs have high Q-factors in such microcylinders too. The results show that a critical lateral size is required for obtaining high, Q-factor TE WGMs in the 3 -D microcylinder.

However, only the special cases of anisotropic media (e. g., uniaxial) and magneto-electric media (e. g., chiral and pseudochiral) are considered in the analysis. The structure under consideration is analyzed by means of a rigorous method, where the unbounded <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> are taken into account to the surface guided modes. Moreover, the least-squares boundary residual method, which is known to be a convergent method, is used as a discrete mode matching technique. The spectral amplitude of the <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> is expanded in a complete set of orthogonal functions and the accuracy of the solution is checked by a power balance criterion. Using a linear-operator formalism, (bi) orthogonality relations for the surface and <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> of several bianisotropic planar waveguides, are derived. These relations are used in order to settle a complete spectral representation for the electromagnetic field in the plane of the discontinuity. Moreover, a systematic analysis of the <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> in chiral and pseudochiral planar waveguides is presented in this work. For each one of this cases, a complete set of mutual orthogonal <b>radiation</b> <b>modes</b> is derived and a clear physical interpretation is achieved. Therefore, the radiation pattern of the step is analyzed along with the reflection and transmission characteristics of the discontinuity. Namely, the effects of the anisotropy and chirality on the radiated power and on the shape of the radiation pattern are investigated.
