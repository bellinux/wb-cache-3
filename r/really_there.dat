[...] Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them; the episodes [...] "Ups and Downs," [...] "Survey Ladies," [...] and [...] "I Got Yer Can" [...] were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively. Another episode, [...] "Bumbie's Mom," [...] both parodied the film Bambi and was a story based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} towards Moore's Boston accent in the series, executive producer Robert Carlock, {{who is from}} Boston, defended Moore. In an interview with New York magazine, Carlock said, [...] "I grew up with people like that. Not everyone talks like that in Boston, but I think she's enough of an actress to pull it off." [...] When asked if her accent [...] "sounded realistic", he noted, [...] "I'm {{going to go with}} that. I know people who sound like that." [...] In response to the accent, Moore explained [...] "I went to school in Boston and worked with a lot of guys from Dorchester, so that's where [...] came from.

500|$|The {{sequences}} where Superman utilizes close-combat fight {{scenes with}} the other Kryptonians {{proved to be a}} major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew. Desjardin explained, [...] "When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don’t want to do the traditional, 'OK I’m a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to pan over here to follow the action that’s not <b>really</b> <b>there</b> yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters—grappling, punching or flying away—and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So then we had a set of high-res stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment." ...|$|E

Dean did not mind when his melodies were not accepted by Weiland. [...] "hen I write a song, I know what I {{want it to be}} melodically. But Scott always... knocks my melodies out of the water." [...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved. Weiland was credited for the lyrical melodies, but Robert pointed out, [...] "This record was made in a way that Scott wasn't <b>really</b> <b>there</b> for the creation of these songs, musically." [...] However, both Dean and Robert would be surprised at the direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision.

Andy Gill of The Independent commented that the remixing techniques [...] "only occasionally work in its favour". Louise Brailey of NME wrote that he [...] "coaxes fresh narratives from the source material" [...] and that it [...] "isn’t exactly groundbreaking, but it showcases a producer {{so in love with}} the music of now that he not only preserves the power of his source material, but makes it more relevant". In MSN Music, Christgau called the record [...] "a young man's bad dream about mortality, and of interest as such", and wrote of the source material's importance to Jamie xx's remix, [...] "the snatches of Scott-Heron's voice, cracked for sure but deeper than night nonetheless, delivers it from callow generalization and foregone conclusion."

500|$|Technical {{director}} Lisa Forsell {{explained that}} {{to enhance the}} richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: [...] "Digital matte paintings are {{a way to get}} a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not <b>really.</b> <b>There</b> is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away." ...|$|E

[...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong."

500|$|Los Angeles was {{extensively}} researched for the game. The team organised {{field research}} trips with tour guides and architectural historians, and captured around 250,000 photographs and {{many hours of}} video footage. Houser said, [...] "We spoke to FBI agents that have been undercover, experts in the Mafia, street gangsters who know the slangwe even {{went to see a}} proper prison". He considered the open world's research and creation the most demanding aspects of the game's production. Google Maps and Street View projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks. The team studied virtual globe models of the city, census data and documentaries to recreate its geographical and demographic spread. The team opted to condense the city's spread into an area that players could comfortably traverse, and captured [...] "the essence of what's <b>really</b> <b>there</b> in a city, but in a far smaller area", according to Houser. The New Yorker Sam Sweet opined that the [...] "exhaustive field work...wasn't conducted to document a living space. Rather, it was collected to create an extremely realistic version of a Los Angeles that doesn't actually exist. The map of Los Santos is familiar but its contents are condensed".

500|$|Wonderland was {{revealed}} as the album's name in September, and a preliminary release date of 30 November was forwarded. Recording {{took place at}} Sarm Studios in Notting Hill, London, and completed in early October. Smith recorded her vocals during her school holidays. Initially, Smith was asked by her label for a track listing, but said that she [...] "didn't know what songs would be wrong or right for an album". Instead, she and Decca both created their own lists, and the final track list was compiled from the two. The result included a variety of songs; Smith said she {{was pleased with the}} mix, citing [...] "classical numbers" [...] like [...] "The Prayer", in contrast to [...] "a more unexpected song", [...] "Close to You". The track [...] "O Holy Night" [...] features a [...] "duet" [...] with Luciano Pavarotti, who died in 2007; Pavarotti's vocals were digitally added to Smith's recording to produce the song, resulting in the pair sounding [...] "as if they're <b>really</b> <b>there</b> together". The title track, [...] "Wonderland", is set to [...] "Winter", from Vivaldi's Four Seasons, and the lead track, [...] "Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence (Somewhere Far Away)" [...] is an adaptation of a piece by Ryuichi Sakamoto, originally from Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence. Smith's favourite tracks on the album are [...] "O Holy Night" [...] and [...] "The Prayer".|$|E

[...] Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter stated it was [...] "entertaining", but Spears [...] "doesn’t quite have that spring in her dance step anymore and who requires a constant barrage of visual distractions while she mostly lip-synchs along to her hits". Jim Harrington of the Oakland Tribune deemed the show as [...] "a mess pretty much from start to finish. The theatrics are awkward and confusing, the dance routines are numbingly bland and old-hat, the song selection is weak and misguided, and Britney's star power, so blinding on tours past, is remarkably dim." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the show two stars out of five, saying that [...] "there's a suspicion that {{the kind of person who}} goes to see Britney Spears live isn't <b>really</b> <b>there</b> for the music or her sparkling personality: tonight she seems as dead-eyed and distant as ever. What they're interested in is proximity to a global celebrity." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave the show one star out of five, and called it [...] "the saddest, laziest, dullest and most tawdry pop concert I have ever witnessed." [...] He added that [...] "the most amazing thing about the whole second-rate spectacle was that thousands of people, having forked out around £50 a head for tickets, practically raised the roof, cheering every dismal dance move, roaring for lip-synched vocals and lustily applauding limp erotica." ...|$|E
