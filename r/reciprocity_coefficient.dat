40|$|We {{show that}} a {{mesoscopic}} system such as Feynman's ratchet may operate as a heat pump, and clarify a underlying physical picture. We consider a system of a particle moving along an asymmetric periodic structure. When put into a contact with two distinct heat baths of equal temperature, the system transfers heat between two baths as the particle is dragged. We examine Onsager relation for the heat flow and the particle flow, and show that the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{is a product of}} the characteristic heat and the diffusion constant of the particle. The characteristic heat is the heat transfer between the baths associated with a barrier-overcoming process. Because of the correlation between the heat flow and the particle flow, the system can work as a heat pump when the particle is dragged. This pump is particularly effective at molecular scales where the energy barrier is of the order of the thermal energy. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures; revise...|$|E

We will describe an explicit basis for this algebra. This construction relates directly with the combinatorial description of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients in terms of Littlewood-Richardson tableaux. Philosophically, one may view this construction as a recasting of the Littlewood-Richardson rule {{in the context of}} classical invariant theory.

40|$|Administrative {{fragmentation}} among {{government agencies}} has posed a significant challenge to environmental governance. However, {{few studies have}} theoretically examined and empirically measured how local governments in China address this with collaborative approaches. Informed by the ecology of games framework (EGF), this paper examined the status of inter-agency water governance in Dongguan City: the pilot city of aquatic ecologically friendly city of China. The research question we seek to address is: What are the main characteristics of the water governance network in local China? With empirical data collected via survey questionnaires and semi-structured in-depth interviews following the EGF, we find that local agencies have realized the need for cooperation in water resource management. However, they were not substantially familiar {{with each other in}} the local policy network, failing to reach their full potential in collaboration. Social network analysis was used to analyze the collaborative network. We found that the network has a weak to moderate density, allowing for collective action problems and leading to insufficient cooperative governance. The network has presented central actors with strong bridging capital to control information and resource flows. We also find strong bonding capital among some policy actors as shown in high <b>reciprocity,</b> clustering <b>coefficient</b> and transitivity. To strengthen the effectiveness of local water governance, efforts should be made to establish a functional department and extend the boundary of collaborative network...|$|R
40|$|Despite wide {{structural}} and functional differences, {{the laws that}} govern quantum solar energy conversion to chemical energy or electricity share many similarities. In the photosynthetic membrane, in common with semiconductor solar cells, the conversion process proceeds from the creation of electron–hole pairs by a photon of light, followed by charge separation to produce the required high-energy product. In many cases, however, mechanisms are needed to enhance the optical absorption cross-section and extend the spectral range of operation. A common way of achieving this is by light harvesting: light absorption by a specialised unit which transfers the energy to the conversion apparatus. This paper considers two examples of light harvesting — semiconductor solar cells and the photosynthetic apparatus — to illustrate the basic operation and principles that apply. The existence of a light harvesting unit in photosynthesis has been known since the early 1930 's but details of the process — relating, in particular, {{to the relationship between}} the structure and spectral properties — are still being unravelled. The excitation energy carriers are excitons but the precise nature of the transport — via the solid state Frenkel–Peierls variety or by Förster's resonant energy transfer — is still subject to debate. In semiconductor solar cells, the energy of the absorbed photon is collected by minority carriers but the broad principles remain the same. In both cases it is shown that the rate of energy conversion is described by a law which parallels the Shockley's solar cell equation, and the light harvesting energy collection is subject to reciprocity relations which resemble Onsager's <b>reciprocity</b> relations between <b>coefficients</b> which couple appropriate forces and flows in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Differences in the basic atomic make-up in the two systems lead to different energy transport equations. In both cases, however, similar mathematical techniques based on Green's functions can be used to advantage. The Green's function provides a convenient vehicle for the determination of the probability of energy collection — known as the trapping probability in the photosynthetic unit. Using the reciprocity relation, both quantities are shown to be closely related to the distribution of the energy carriers in the dark. The collection probability can then be discussed in detail, by solving the semiconductor device equations in the case of solar cell, and by linking the Green's function formalism to the random walk model {{in the case of the}} photosynthetic unit. The concept of resonant energy transfer is beginning to enter the arena of solid-state optoelectronics. It is an aim of this paper to show that similar phenomena — which exist in the domain of bioenergetics — can throw new light on a range of energy transfer and collection processes that are of considerable importance in many modern optoelectronic device...|$|R
