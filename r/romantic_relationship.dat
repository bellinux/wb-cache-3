40|$|This {{research}} explored college students’ {{attitudes toward}} online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and their intentions {{to develop this}} type of relationship. Borrowing elements from both social cognitive theory and the theory of reasoned action, this study introduced a model that combined perceptions of indirect past experiences, beliefs, attitudes and social norms and associations with people’s intentions to form <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> over the Internet. Under the premise that people learn through observation, this study argued that when direct experience is lacking (as {{was the case with}} this sample), other sources of indirect experiences with online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> (perceptions of significant others’ past experiences and exposure to media messages about online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships)</b> would relate to people’s beliefs about these relationships and their perceptions of what significant others think (social norms). Based on the theory of reasoned action, it was hypothesized that people’s beliefs about online relationships would then be related to their attitudes toward such relationships. Lastly, also under the framework of reasoned action, it was hypothesized that both attitudes and social norms would predict people’s intentions to form or develop <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> over the Internet. The {{purpose of this study was}} thus to examine how well predictors from social cognitive theory and the theory of reasoned action explained intentions to form online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships.</b> A pilot study was conducted to derive beliefs and attitudes toward online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and to test the main instrument. In the main study, 226 college students with no prior direct experience forming online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> completed a web-based self-administered questionnaire. A structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to assess the relative importance and the strength among the different constructs. Results indicated that the overall model fit the data well. The final model accounted for 46 % of the variance in people’s intentions to form online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships.</b> Perceptions of friends’ and family’s past experiences with online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> were significantly related to people’s beliefs about these relationships. However, only friends’ past experiences was related to social norms. Exposure to media (news stories or ads about dating sites) was not related to either beliefs or social norms. Consistent with the theory of reasoned action, beliefs were strongly correlated with attitudes about online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships,</b> and lastly, both attitudes and social norms emerged as instrumental factors in predicting participants’ intention to develop online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships.</b> Overall, the findings confirmed the importance of integrating indirect past experiences in understanding people’s attitudes and intentions to form <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> over the Internet. The theoretical and methodological implications of these results for the study and understanding of online <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the associations between the quality of adolescents’ peer and family relationships {{and the quality of}} their young adult <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships.</b> Adolescents (N = 253) completed self-report measures of their family and peer relationships in grades 10 – 12; 7 years later, they reported on connectedness, discord, and the conflict tactics used by both partners in their current <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships.</b> Family relationship quality in adolescence predicted the levels of connectedness, discord, and specific conflict behaviors youth reported in their adult <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships.</b> The use of discussion to resolve conflict mediated the association between adolescent family relationships and the level of connectedness in adult <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships.</b> Moreover, use of discussion and physical conflict/threat each partially mediated the effect of family <b>relationship</b> quality on <b>romantic</b> discord. Possible mechanisms linking family of origin <b>relationships</b> to adult <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Technology {{has become}} an inescapable part of <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> in the 21 st century.

Previous studies have conducted research on a multitude of topics related to texting in <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships,</b> though {{none of them have}} analyzed the strategies and accepted rules and meanings of texting in early <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships.</b> Results suggest there are gender differences in texting initiation and negative texting behaviors. Both men and women use texting strategically to maintain their partner’s interest. Women can use emojis to flirt during texting, though both men and women find it unattractive when men use emojis. Resolving conflict through texting is appropriate in early <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships,</b> yet it is difficult for individuals to understand the emotion of their romantic interest.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to look at the effect of peer friendships on <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> at a Christian University.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the development of}} <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and sexual experiences of young adults with cerebral palsy (CP) and {{the physical and emotional}} obstacles they experience with sexuality. Regarding the ICF domains we investigated whether this development is associated with demographic and physical characteristics, peer group activities and dating and psychological and environmental factors. We compared the <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and sexual experiences of this group with an age-appropriate Dutch reference population. Design: Prospective longitudinal study with three biannual assessments. 	 Setting: Eight rehabilitation centers and departments in the southwestern regions of the Netherlands. Participants: Young adults (N= 103, 61 men, 42 women) with CP without cognitive disabilities, ranging from 16 to 20 years old at the first assessment, 82 % Gross Motor Function Classification System level I-II. Interventions: Not applicable. Main outcome measures: sexual interest, <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and sexual activity. Results: During the four years, the sexual experience of the participants increased significantly for all the sexual milestones evaluated. Compared with an age-appropriate Dutch reference population, young adults with CP participated at a lower level in <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and sexual activities, but had an equal sexual interest at the final assessment. Peer group activities and dating favored development of <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and a sexual career. Age and gross motor functioning explained 20 % of the variance in experience with intercourse. In addition, self-efficacy, self-esteem, sexual esteem and perceived attractiveness contributed significantly to having current <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and to intercourse experience. Conclusions: Young ambulatory adults with CP had comparable sexual interests and they had increasing experiences with <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and sexual activities during the transition from late adolescence to young adulthood. Social participation and aspects of a positive self image were positively associated with <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and sexual experiences...|$|R

40|$|In this review, it is {{proposed}} that a systems {{approach to the}} study of the development of <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> might enhance our understanding of the nature of social relationships, and the links between social relationships and individual psychosocial functioning. First, a selected literature review is provided on the normative development of <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> during adolescence, antecedents of different romantic involvement pathways, and positive and negative qualities of these relationships. Second, the focus is placed on the how the development of <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> occurs within existing systems of relationships including peer networks and close friendships. It is suggested that the development of <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> may change the peer network and nature of relationships with friends and others, and particular types of transitions in social relationships will likely occur. The timing of these transitions and an understanding of the entire peer system as <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> develop will likely improve our understanding of individual developmental processes such as identity formation and the development of externalizing and internalizing problems. Finally, it {{is proposed}} that adolescents are faced with a complicated task that includes developing <b>romantic</b> interests and <b>relationships</b> but managing their changing social networks.
