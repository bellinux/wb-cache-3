40|$|Skin {{failures}} of <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> rib in underground coal mines {{continue to be}} a significant safety hazard for mineworkers. Skin failures do not usually involve failure of the support systems, but result from rock or coal spalling from between the support elements. For instance, in 1997 more than 800 miners were injured by <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> rib falls, of which 98 % were the result of skin failures [Bauer et al. 1999]. Also, nearly 80 % of the <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> rib failure injuries occurred at or near the working faces in development sections. The face area is a zone where the potential for skin failure accidents and injuries <b>and</b> for <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> rib failures is high because of mining activity, ground readjustment due to changing stress conditions, and the higher exposure of mine workers. In addition, failures occur where the <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> rib are unsupported. This paper reviews the <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> rib accident statistics resulting from skin failure, and highlights the incidences by type, numbers and percentage, in-mine location, supported <b>and</b> unsupported <b>roof,</b> <b>and</b> worker activity at the time of injury. Also discussed are the causes of <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> rib skin failures, current and improved support methods and materials for skin surface control, and machine design modifications for improved roof bolter operator protection. It also reviews the historical literature on skin failures and control methods...|$|R
5|$|Not all {{cities have}} a {{distinct}} urban heat island. Mitigation {{of the urban}} heat island effect can be accomplished {{through the use of}} green <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> the use of lighter-colored surfaces in urban areas, which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{architectural}} planning authorities {{continue to}} take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems, recycling rainwater, green <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving.|$|E

5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel {{to the north}} tower, and the west face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> turrets of the northwest wing, and {{the upper part of}} the north tower was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light <b>roofs,</b> <b>and</b> curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|After 9 days, {{approximately}} 3,000 buildings (out of a {{total of}} 127,947 initially damaged) were still waiting for assistance and temporary fixes to shattered <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> windows, while a similar number still required assistance a further week later (as a number of tarpaulins became detached or otherwise ineffective). One month after the disaster, the main priority of the emergency services was ensuring that temporary fixes remained in place, as Sydney suffered further adverse weather in the period immediately following the storm.|$|E

On the northern and eastern portions of the island, the strong winds ripped off <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> downed trees across roadways. Overall, damage was light, and amounted to $1.1million (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the country}} club's Route 9 entrances have a gatehouse. Both are small, two stories high, three bays wide, and one bay deep, and were {{constructed}} along with {{the house in the}} 1890s. The gatehouses resemble Woodlea in materials and simplified stylistic detail. Both gatehouses have gable <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> a shed-roofed one-story high rear addition. The houses have stone and brick pedimented porticos over their entranceways. The lower-level windows have flat-arched surrounds with keystones; the oculi break the cornice lines beneath segmentally arched pediments. The northern gatehouse has another one-story rear addition and a small one-car garage. The club's two tall gateways are made of French-imported carved stone and ironwork.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle was {{not well}} {{maintained}} during the early 14th century and by 1321 a survey reported it was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> rotten timbers. These problems persisted until Edward, the Black Prince, took {{over control of the}} castle in 1343. Sir John Weston, his chamberlain, conducted repairs, building new stone support arches for the great hall {{and other parts of the}} castle. After the death of the Black Prince, however, Conwy fell into neglect again.|$|E

5|$|Gusty winds in Grenada damaged {{at least}} 34 <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> knocked down twelve trees and six {{electrical}} poles. Additionally, {{a nursing home}} on the island was evacuated due to significant structural damage. Two houses lost their roofs in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, while moderate crop damage was reported on the island. Downed trees and power lines in Tobago left 90% of the island without electricity. Overall, Earl was responsible for one fatality, nineteen missing, and an unknown amount of damage.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} exceeding 4in (100mm) {{caused many}} rivers to swell. An unspecified island {{was separated from}} the Mexico mainland after the bridge connecting the two was washed away, stranding dozens of families. In El Salvador, significant flooding killed four people. Gusts peaked at 58mph (85km/h) at an automated weather station in Puerto Madero, Chiapas. Across the affected regions, these winds caused damage limited to house <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> trees. Barbara caused severe crop damage totaling to 200 million pesos (2007 MXN; $55 million). About a hundred residents were forced to evacuate after the storm destroyed a dozen palm huts in Guatemala.|$|E
