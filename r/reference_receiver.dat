40|$|ABSTRACT: There is {{currently}} {{great interest in}} using regional-area <b>reference</b> <b>receiver</b> networks to perform precise positioning using GPS carrier-phase measurements. The NetAdjust algorithm described herein uses a network of reference receivers to significantly increase the distance over which kinematic carrier-phase ambiguity resolution can be performed. When using this algorithm, information from the <b>reference</b> <b>receiver</b> network is encapsulated into the measurements from a single <b>reference</b> <b>receiver</b> so that standard ambiguity resolution techniques can be used between that <b>reference</b> <b>receiver</b> and a mobile receiver. The NetAdjust method is applied to a 400 km 600 km network of 11 reference stations positioned throughout Norway. The NetAdjust algorithm yielded significant reductions in differential errors, and it improved positioning performance.

In the downlink of this system, it is not unusual to encounter scenarios in which the line-of-sight (LOS) component is significantly stronger than the reflected multipath components. To emulate such scenarios, we also derive the coverage probability in the absence of fading from the results of Nakagami-m fading by taking the limit m →∞. Using asymptotic expansion of incomplete gamma function, we concretely show that this limit reduces to a redundant condition. Consequently, we derive an accurate coverage probability approximation for this case using dominant interferer-based approach in which the effect of dominant interferer is exactly captured and the residual interference from other interferers is carefully approximated.
