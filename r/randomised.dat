5|$|Conclusions on dietary {{components}} have {{at times}} {{been difficult to}} ascertain as results have differed between population-based studies and <b>randomised</b> controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk of AD. There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, red wine, and tea may decrease the risk of AD.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, Steven Kirsh {{reported}} in the journal Childhood {{that the use of}} video games may lead to acquisition of a hostile attribution bias. Fifty-five subjects were <b>randomised</b> to play either violent or non-violent video games. Subjects were later asked to read stories in which the characters' behaviour was ambiguous. Participants <b>randomised</b> to play violent video games were more likely to provide negative interpretations of the stories. Another study done by Anderson and Dill in 2000 found that violence in video games increases aggressive behavior in the short term although other scholars have suggested that results from this study were not consistent, and that the methodology was flawed.|$|E

50|$|It {{was found}} that R is chosen quite {{frequently}} by subjects. While the Row Player <b>randomises</b> 50:50 between her strategies, the Column Player shows a marked preference for avoiding ambiguity and choosing his ambiguity-safe strategy. Thus, the results provide evidence that ambiguity influences behaviour in the games.|$|R

40|$|We {{define a}} network that relies on its protocol’s {{emergent}} behaviour to maintain the useful properties of a random regular topology. It does this by spontaneously performing flips {{in an effort to}} <b>randomise</b> [16], allowing it to repair damage and to embed new peers without over-complicated joining schema. The main theoretical result of this paper is informed by the need to show that flips <b>randomise</b> the network quickly enough. Formally, we show that performing random flip operations on a regular graph of size n will rapidly sample from all such graphs almost uniformly at random (i. e. with error ε). Here, “rapidly” means in time polynomial in n and log ε − 1. This is done by extending a similar result for random switches, obtained in [3], using a two-stage direct canonical path construction. The directness of our approach allows for a much tighter bound than obtained in previous work...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{a market}} game where traders are {{heterogeneous}} {{with respect to}} their rationality level and have asymmetric information. The market mechanism results into a statistical equilibrium, where traders <b>randomise</b> among their available actions due to their limited rationality. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence of statistical to strategic equilibria of market games, when traders become more informed and increasingly more rational. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} games where each player's aim is to <b>randomise</b> her strategic choices in order to affect the other players' expectations aside from her own. The way each player intends to exert this influence is expressed through a Boolean combination of polynomial equalities and inequalities with rational coefficients. We offer a logical representation of these games as well as a computational study of the existence of equilibria. Comment: In Proceedings SR 2014, arXiv: 1404. 041...|$|R

But this condition is not appealing, since {{there is a large}} chance that in the final outcome, many partners will be envious.

40|$|Photoexcited {{electron}} and hole spin relaxation {{has been}} studied in modulation doped InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots by means of time resolved photoluminescence. The electron spin relaxation times of 50 to 70 ps have been found for the undoped and p-doped samples, while the hole spins <b>randomise</b> on a much shorter time scale. Electrons preserve their spin orientation during capture and relaxation for excitation into the barriers, however, no preferential spin polarisation has been detected for carrier excitation directly into the dots...|$|R

25|$|A 2013 {{review and}} metaanalysis of <b>randomised</b> {{controlled}} trials of acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy in IVF found no overall benefit, {{and concluded that}} an apparent benefit detected in a subset of published trials where the control group (those not using acupuncture) experienced a lower than average rate of pregnancy requires further study, due {{to the possibility of}} publication bias and other factors.|$|E
25|$|Misoprostol is {{also used}} to prevent and treat post-partum bleeding. Orally {{administered}} misoprostol was marginally less effective than oxytocin. The use of rectally administered misoprostol is optimal in cases of bleeding; it was shown to be associated with lower rates of side effects compared to other routes. Rectally administered misoprostol was reported in a variety of case reports and <b>randomised</b> controlled trials. However, it is inexpensive and thermostable (thus does not require refrigeration like oxytocin), making it a cost-effective and valuable drug to use in the developing world. A <b>randomised</b> control trial of misoprostol use found a 38% reduction in maternal deaths due to post partum haemorrhage in resource-poor communities. Misoprostol is recommended due to its cost, effectiveness, stability, and low rate of side effects. Oxytocin must also be given by injection, while misprostol can be given orally or rectally for this use, making it much more useful in areas where nurses and physicians are less available.|$|E
50|$|Some game {{boards are}} divided into more or less equally-sized areas, each {{of which can be}} {{occupied}} by one or more game tokens. (Often such areas are called squares, even if not strictly square in shape.) Movement rules will specify how and when a token can be moved to another area. For example, a player may be allowed to move a token to an adjacent area, but not one further away. Dice are sometimes used to <b>randomise</b> the allowable movements.|$|R
50|$|As {{a spiritual}} sequel to DX-Ball 2, Longbow Games {{released}} Rival Ball in 2001. While the new title recycled {{the engine of}} DX-Ball 2, it also introduced many new features, including a buttoned layout with cursor-based navigation; two new Power-Ups (replacing two older ones); new graphics for the Power-Ups; new square shaped bricks; 4 difficulty modes; new sound effects and music; and 1-on-1 split screen network play. In addition, it also featured the ability to set timers, <b>randomise</b> board order and repeat board sets, also including support for DX-Ball 2 boards.|$|R

Furthermore, the system <b>randomises</b> {{the order of the}} choices within each chosen question. Thus a student may sit the exam many times. Our first version of this system has been described elsewhere. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of our first system that led to our current work, and give a description of the new system features, including XML tags for supporting collaborative authoring...|$|R
