5|$|The Rwandan Civil War was a {{conflict}} in the African republic of Rwanda, between the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAR) and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The war was fought in two phases. The first phase began on 1 October 1990, with an RPF invasion of the north east of the country from Uganda. This phase ended on 4 August 1993, with {{the signing of the}} Arusha Accords. The second phase took place following the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana on 6 April 1994, and the outbreak of the Rwandan genocide. The RPF resumed fighting on 7 April, and the civil war ended with an RPF victory on 18 July 1994.|$|E

25|$|The Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) (in Kinyarwanda: Ingabo z'u Rwanda; in French: Forces rwandaises de défense) is the {{national}} army of Rwanda. The country's armed forces were originally known as the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAR), but following {{the victory of the}} Rwandan Patriotic Front in the country's civil war in 1994, it was renamed to the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), and later to its current name.|$|E
50|$|The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is {{a former}} colony of Belgium between 1885 and 1960. Shortly after {{independence}} from Belgium, Mobutu Sese Seko seize power in a military coup d'état and installed himself as President. Under Mobutu's authoritarian rule, the country's name was also known as Zaire. By 1996, conflict from the Rwandan Genocide spilled over into Zaire and Hutu militias, including the Interahamwe, were using refugee camps in the Kivu region to attack Rwanda. Consequently, the <b>Rwandan</b> and Ugandan <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> invaded Zaire to fight Hutu militias, and ultimately overthrow Mobutu, in {{what was to become}} the First Congo War. The Rwandan and Ugandan forces were joined by Congolese politicians and militia leaders who were opposed to Mobutu's rule and these groups joined forces to become the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila. In 1997, Mobutu fled Zaire and Kabila named himself President and changed the name of the country back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|R

25|$|Many {{soldiers}} from the former <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAR), the national army under the previous regime, have been incorporated into the RDF since 1994. This process began soon after the genocide in January 1995, when several former FAR officers were given senior positions in the new armed forces: Col. (later Gen.) Marcel Gatsinzi became the Deputy Chief of Staff of the RPA, Col. Balthazar Ndengeyinka became commander of the 305th Brigade, Lt. Col. Laurent Munyakazi took command of the 99th Battalion, and Lt. Col. (later Brig. Gen.) Emmanuel Habyarimana became an RPA Member of Parliament and Director of Training in the Ministry of Defence. Gen. Gatsinzi later became Director of Security and then Minister of Defence in 2002.|$|E
25|$|As the {{massacre}} progressed and press {{accounts of the}} genocide grew, the U.N. Security Council backtracked on its position and voted to establish UNAMIR II, with a strength of 5,500 men {{in response to the}} French plan to occupy portions of the country. (The so-called Operation Turquoise, the presence of French troops, was initially opposed by Dallaire because the French had a history of backing the Hutus and the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces,</b> and thus their presence would be opposed by Kagame and the rebel RPF.) It was not until early July, when RPF troops under Kagame swept into Kigali, that the genocide ended. By August, the French had handed their portion of the country to the RPF, giving Kagame effective control of all of Rwanda.|$|E
25|$|One such {{massacre}} {{occurred at}} Nyarubuye. On April 12, more than 1,500 Tutsis sought refuge in a Catholic church in Nyange, then in Kivumu commune. Local Interahamwe, acting {{in concert with}} the authorities, used bulldozers to knock down the church building. The militia used machetes and rifles to kill every person who tried to escape. Local priest Athanase Seromba was later found guilty and {{sentenced to life in prison}} by the ICTR for his role in the demolition of his church; he was convicted of the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity. In another case, thousands sought refuge in the Official Technical School (École Technique Officielle) in Kigali where Belgian UNAMIR soldiers were stationed. On April 11, the Belgian soldiers withdrew, and <b>Rwandan</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> and militia killed all the Tutsi.|$|E

25|$|There were {{early signs}} that {{something}} was amiss when, on January 22, 1994, a French DC-8 aircraft landed in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, loaded with ammunition and weapons for the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAR). (FAR was the Hutu army under Habyarimana's control.) Through an informant, Dallaire learned that these weapons were {{to be used for}} an attack on Tutsis after the Belgians would have been forced to withdraw by violence orchestrated by the Interahamwe (a Hutu paramilitary organization). Despite his telegram to the UN, Dallaire was not permitted to seize the weapons, as this was deemed to be an action beyond his UN mandate. The Chief of Staff of the Rwandan Army told Dallaire that since the munitions were ordered before Arusha, the UN was not allowed to detain the shipment, and displayed paperwork showing that the weapons had been sent by Belgium, Israel, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Egypt. In addition to the arms deliveries, troops from the Rwandan government began checking identity cards which identified individuals as Hutus or Tutsis. These cards would later allow Hutu militias to identify their victims with accuracy.|$|E
500|$|At 2:30 pm on 1 October 1990, fifty RPF rebels deserted their Ugandan army {{posts and}} crossed the border from Uganda into Rwanda, killing a customs guard at the Kagitumba border post. They were {{followed}} by hundreds more rebels, dressed in the uniforms of the Ugandan national army and carrying stolen Ugandan weaponry, including machine guns, autocannons, mortars, and Soviet BM-21 multiple rocket launchers. Around 2,500 of the Ugandan army's 4,000 Rwandan soldiers {{took part in the}} invasion, accompanied by 800 civilians, including medical staff and messengers. Both President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Habyarimana of Rwanda were in New York City attending the United Nations World Summit for Children. In {{the first few days of}} fighting, the RPF made significant progress, advancing [...] south to the town of Gabiro. Their <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAR) opponents, fighting for Habyarimana's government, were numerically superior, with 5,200 soldiers, and possessed armoured cars and helicopters supplied by France, but the RPF benefitted from the element of surprise. The Ugandan government set up road blocks across the west of Uganda, to prevent further desertions and to block the rebels from returning to Uganda.|$|E
2500|$|However, Sendashonga {{realized}} {{that only the}} groups using violence were shaping events, stating to Prunier, [...] "Everybody uses a gun {{as a way of}} sitting at the negotiation table one day. [...] If I always refuse to use guns, I'll be marginalized when the time comes." [...] Sendashonga had attracted about 600 soldiers and 40 officers of the old <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces,</b> who were willing to fight for him because they saw him {{as an alternative to the}} RPF and the Hutu Army for the Liberation of Rwanda, whom they felt were motivated by opposing forms of violent racism. [...] After Tanzania agreed to host Sendashonga's rebel training camps, he used his contacts with Prunier to go to Uganda and talk to Salim Saleh, President Yoweri Museveni's brother, on 3 May 1998. [...] Relations between Uganda and Rwanda had deteriorated and Salim was open to the idea of a new force to counter the RPF. [...] Sendashonga then met Eva Rodgers of the United States Department of State, who was noncommittal but did not outright oppose the formation of the new armed group.|$|E

2500|$|Historians do {{not agree}} on the precise date on which {{the idea of a}} [...] "final solution" [...] to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda was first mooted. Gerard Prunier dates it to 1992, when Habyarimana began {{negotiating}} with the RPF, while journalist Linda Melvern dates it to 1990, following the initial RPF invasion. Also in 1990, The army began arming civilians with weapons such as machetes, and it began training the Hutu youth in combat, officially as a programme of [...] "civil defence" [...] against the RPF threat, but these weapons were later used to carry out the genocide. Rwanda also purchased large numbers of grenades and munitions from late 1990; in one deal, future UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his role as Egyptian foreign minister, facilitated a large sale of arms from Egypt. The <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAR) expanded rapidly at this time, growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined; a divide grew between the elite Presidential Guard and Gendarmerie units, who were well trained and battle ready, and the ordinary rank and file.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the context}} of the Rwandan genocide, victims of sexual {{violence}} were predominantly attacked {{on the basis of their}} gender and ethnicity. The victims were mostly Tutsi women and girls, of all ages, while men were only seldomly the victims of war rape. Women were demonized in the anti-Tutsi propaganda prior to the 1994 genocide. The December 1990 issue of the newspaper Kangura published the [...] "Ten Commandments", four of which portrayed Tutsi women as tools of the Tutsi community, as sexual weapons that would be used by the Tutsi to weaken and ultimately to destroy the Hutu men. Gender based propaganda also included cartoons printed in newspapers that portrayed Tutsi women as sex objects. Examples of gender based hate propaganda used to incite war rape included statements by perpetrators such as [...] "You Tutsi women think that you are too good for us" [...] and [...] "Let us see what a Tutsi woman tastes like". Victims of war rape during the Rwandan genocide also included Hutu women considered moderates, such as Hutu women married to Tutsi men and Hutu women politically affiliated with the Tutsi. War rape also occurred regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation, with young or beautiful women being targeted based on their gender only. Sexual violence against men occurred significantly less frequently, but it frequently included the mutilation of their genitals, which were often displayed in public. The perpetrators of war rape during the Rwandan genocide were mainly members of the Hutu militia, the [...] "Interahamwe". Rapes were also committed by military personnel within the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAR), including the Presidential Guard, and civilians.|$|E
