Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique.

25|$|Görgei {{planned to}} {{attack in the}} next day to advance with the III. corps towards Galánta via Vágsellye, while the II. corps protects its side by moving towards Alsószeli and Deáki. But already in the night of 20 June he learned that the enemy troops {{commanded}} by Wohlgemuth will attack, and the Panyutyin-division was also sent to help the IV. and the II. corps. So he understood that the <b>relative</b> <b>balance</b> of forces between the two armies (20,000 Hungarians with 80 cannons against 25,000 Austrians with 96 cannons) was about to be upset by the arrival of 12,000 Russians. So Görgei ordered Klapka to hold with any costs the bridge from Aszódpuszta, and József Nagysándor to force the crossing, with his troops, of the Vág river at Szered. The II. and III. corps had to wait the Austro-Russian attack and to repel it. The key of the Hungarian success was the arrival in time of the I. corps of Nagysándor, after accomplishing his initial tasks, to help the other two corps. Görgei believed that if Nagysándor's I. corps would make a successful attack, pushing the enemy back and cross the Vág river at Sempte, this would enable the counterattack of the II. and III. Hungarian corps, and the enemy instead of concentrating to capture the bridges from Aszódpuszta and Negyed to cut the retreat root of the Hungarians, will have to fight against the Hungarian attack from front, which with the help of Nagysándor's arriving troops, can threaten to encircle the main Austro-Russian troops north from Pered. So the only choice of Wohlgemuth would be the retreat, which would lead to the accomplishment of the Hungarian plans and to the victory. Görgei found also useful that his troops {{in the next day}} had to fight with Russian troops too, because they could so measure the tsarists real battle value.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt is a {{challenge}} to maintain a steady and stable locomotion when a biped robot navigates an uneven surface or a step. Firstly it needs to detect the gait of the robot and related environmental objectives, and then to perform appropriate controls of stable locomotion. In this paper, a new type of sensing module with flexible force is designed to be mounted under the robotic sole to measure the foot pressure map which is essential for the analysis of zero moment point (ZMP) to assist the biped robot to detect the gait conditions. In addition, a neuro-fuzzy control scheme is also proposed to control the ZMP trajectories and <b>relative</b> <b>balancing</b> by integrating the data of a 3 -axis gyroscope to adaptive posture. The experimental results show that the designed control system has improved the biped robot adaptive ability to overcome landform changes and the stability of locomotion while standing or walking on uneven terrain...|$|R

40|$|A new European {{parliament}} {{emerged from}} the June 2009 elections. Its 736 elected representatives will represent some 375 million European citizens coming from 27 European member countries in the 2009 - 2014 Parliament. The vote mainly resulted in a victory of right wing or centre- right parties {{to the detriment of}} socialist or social-democrat parties. Liberal party representation remains stable overall though low in new member countries. Green parties continue their progression. Both the far right and the far left have variable results. The progress of euro-scepticism is real though not as significant as expected. Within the European Parliament, those results translate in a reinforcement of the first place of the PPE group, however amputated of its conservative fraction, which is creating its own group. The PPE group beat the socialist group, which Changed its name to Progressiste Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S & D). The ADLE, Greens-ALE and GUE/NGL groups retain their weight. Though there is no far right group, euro-sceptic parties are gathered in agroup named "Europe, of Freedom and Democracy".

Hippocrates, who is considered the father of medicine, related behavioral tendencies and a person’s temperament to the <b>relative</b> <b>balance</b> of their body fluids. He believed that imbalances of these fluids led to aberrant behaviors. Other Greek philosophers such as Plato theorized that aberrant behaviors stemmed from societal issues that required a community response. Promoting happiness and wellness was also a major theme for the early Greeks and Romans. The founder of hedonism, Epicurus, advocated for the hedonistic lifestyle, but he also warned that there was a risk of pain if the pleasures were withdrawn. Epictetus, on the other hand, believed that people were not disturbed by things, but by the view they took of those things, so he advocated for peace of mind to treat these disturbances.|$|E

Despite the perception of an over-emphasis on sport, the list of past winners reveals a strong endorsement for scientific achievement; by 2009 thirteen Australian scientists have received the honour, including a remarkable ten from the medical sciences. A long-term view also reveals that Australia's talented artists have not been neglected; ten winners have excelled in creative pursuits, including six musicians, a dancer, a painter, a comedian and a Nobel Prize winning novelist.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is {{ethically}} {{mandated that}} potential beneficial aspects of low exposure to potentially hazardous material are {{incorporated in the}} risk-benefit balancing procedure. The potential harm done by pollutants does not justify the invocation of a categorical principle. Minimisation of risk is not required if health benefits are also at stake. Society needs to find an informed consent {{on the threshold of}} risk below compensation of goods is legitimate and morally justified. Such a threshold can be defined context-specific but any human action associated with potential health impacts makes such an acceptability judgment- implicitly or explicitly. Incorporating hormesis into risk management forces regulators to make such thresholds explicit. Once as risk is below this threshold all positive and negative impacts are subject to a <b>relative</b> <b>balancing</b> towards reaching a final judgment on acceptability and necessary risk management options. This balancing risk cannot be reduced to body counts: equity issues, context specific circumstances (voluntary or involuntary exposure, for example), avoidance of risks, the nature of vulnerable groups and many other factors need to be taken into account. Such a complex weighing exercise is best performed by an analytic-deliberative process by which the best available knowledge of impacts (including their uncertain ties) is fed into a deliberating body of individuals representing all sides of the debate.
