40|$|The main {{problems}} {{involved in}} substituting charcoal for top charged coke in blast furnaces are missing physical-mechanical properties (friability, density, and crushing strength) and the too high reactivity of charcoal, meaning substitution is only possible in mini blast furnaces. Although such furnaces {{make it possible}} to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, their use for this purpose remains marginal and {{more research is needed to}} upgrade the properties of the charcoal so it can be used in conventional blast furnaces. Recent studies have shown that increasing pressure can increase gravimetric yields, fixed carbon content and considerably shorten the carbonization cycle. The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of pyrolysis parameters – especially pressure – on the properties of charcoal, especially crushing strength, friability and CO 2 gasification reactivity. The experimental study was carried out using Eucalyptus Urophylla and Eucalyptus Camadulensis wood with two carbonization temperatures (350 and 600 °C), two <b>relative</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> (0. 2 and 0. 6 MPa) and two heating rates (1 and 5 K min− 1). Six response variables were analyzed using a random factorial design: charcoal yield (Ychar), fixed carbon content (Cf), bulk density (D), crushing strength (Rm), friability (F) and the reactivity (R) of charcoal. Except for the friability of charcoal, all the other properties were well correlated with the carbonization parameter. In our conditions, the best “steel” quality charcoal (i. e. the compromise required to maximize charcoal yield, fixed carbon content, bulk density and crushing strength, while minimizing the reactivity of the resulting charcoal) was obtained at a temperature above 496 °C, a pressure above 0. 6 MPa and low heating rate of around 1. 1 K min− 1.

40|$|Brazil is {{the leading}} {{producer}} and consumer of charcoal, 75 % of which goes to the steel industry alone. The carbonization processes are generally small-scale technologies {{that are difficult to}} control, with relatively low gravimetric yields. New technologies are currently being developed to improve those figures. One such technique is pressurized pyrolysis. Recent studies have shown that using pressure can increase gravimetric yields by 50 % and considerably reduce carbonization time. The purpose of this paper was to study statistically how pressure impacts {{on the quality of the}} resulting charcoal. We applied a random factorial design and used the General Linear System procedure to perform the statistical analysis. The experimental study was carried out on the wood of Eucalyptus grandis and involved three <b>relative</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> (0, 5 and 10 bars), two carbonization temperatures (450 and 600 °C) and three wood moisture contents (0, 15 and 110 %). Five response variables were analyzed and discussed following a random factorial design: charcoal yield (ychar), fixed carbon yield (yfC), bulk density (D), fixed carbon content (fC) and gross calorific value (GCV). The best "steel" quality charcoal seemed to be obtained with an anhydrous wood, a pressure of 10 bars and a temperature of 600 °C. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgery (MIS) applications require lightweight actuators that can generate a high force {{in a limited}} volume. Among pressure driven actuators, fluid elastic actuators demonstrate high potential {{for use in the}} medical field. They are characterized by nearly no friction and wear and they can be made of low-cost biocompatible elastomers. However, when compared to traditional piston-cylinder fluid actuators, fluid elastic actuators often result in smaller output forces as well as weaker return forces. This work is about the design of a linear elastic actuator (LEA) which is able to develop relevant pulling-pushing force in one direction. The LEA is composed of entirely disposable materials and it requires a simple manufacturing process. Thanks to its design, the LEA can be compared to traditional piston-cylinders actuators in terms of output forces (up to 7 N) with the advantage of using <b>relative</b> low <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> (0, 2 MPa). The actuator has been used for the actuation of a gripper for MIS, as a case study. The whole range of gripping forces developed by the tool actated by the LEA has been evaluated, thus verifying that the gripping device, is able to meet the force requirements for accomplishing typical surgical tasks...|$|R
