When a group of soldiers arrive the next morning, Torrance is dead.|$|E
5|$|Kohala's native Hawaiian <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> has a {{thick layer}} of ferns and mosses {{carpeting}} the floor, which act as sponges, absorbing water from rain and passing much of it through to the groundwater in aquifers below; when feral animals like pigs trample the covering, the forest loses its ability to hold in water effectively, and instead of recharging the aquifer, it results in a severe loss of topsoil, much of which ends up being dumped by streams into the ocean.|$|E
50|$|Temperate <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> {{occur in}} regions around the world: the Pacific {{temperate}} <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of the Pacific Northwest, the Valdivian temperate <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of southwestern South America, the <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of New Zealand and Tasmania, northwest Europe (small pockets in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Iceland and a somewhat larger area in Norway), southern Japan, {{and the eastern}} Black Sea-Caspian Sea region of Turkey and Georgia to northern Iran. The moist conditions of temperate <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> generally support an understory of mosses, ferns and some shrubs. Temperate <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> can be temperate coniferous forests or temperate broadleaf and mixed forests.|$|R
40|$|Concern {{about the}} future of {{tropical}} <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> has largely focused on threats to the survival of the extraordinary biological diversity that characterizes these ecosystems. Another perspective emphasizes the role that tropical <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> play in the global carbon cycle. Despite covering only about 8 % of the land surface, tropical <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> are thought to contain about 40 % of the terrestrial biomass and account for over 50 % of the annual net primary productivity of the biosphere (Williams et al., 1998). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that unlogged tropical <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> act as a sink of anthropogenic carbon emissions (Grace et al., 1995). Conversely, the destruction of <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> by land clearance and forest fires is a significant source of CO 2, a point dramatically highlighted by the recent massive fires that have occurred in tropical <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> worldwide (Malingreau et al., 1985; Brown, 1998). The purpose of this review is to report current research concerning the factors that influence carbon dynamics in tropical <b>rain</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Köppen {{classification}} {{depends on}} average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The {{most commonly used}} form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as <b>rain</b> <b>forest,</b> monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge {{much of their}} moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also home}} to several bogs, which exist as breaks in the cloud forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an accumulation of water that impedes the root systems of woody plants. Kohala's bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus Sphagnum, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> and mesophytic (wet) forests.|$|E

5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane <b>Rain</b> <b>Forest.</b>|$|E
5|$|In South America, dire wolves {{have been}} dated younger than 17,000 YBP and {{reported}} from only three localities: Muaco in Falcón state, Venezuela; Talara Province in Peru; and Tarija Department in Bolivia. If the dire wolf originated in North America, the species likely dispersed into South America via the Andean corridor, a proposed pathway for temperate mammals to migrate from Central to South America {{because of the}} favorable cool, dry, and open habitats that characterized the region at times. This most likely happened during a glacial period because the pathway then consisted of open, arid regions and savanna, whereas during inter-glacial periods it would have consisted of tropical <b>rain</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> habitats.|$|E
50|$|The Valdivian {{temperate}} <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> are temperate broadleaf {{and mixed}} forests. The Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests {{are the only}} temperate <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> in South America and one of {{a small number of}} temperate <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> in the world. Together they are the second largest in the world, after the Pacific temperate <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of North America (which stretches from Alaska to northern California). The Valdivian forests are a refuge for the Antarctic flora, and share many plant families with the temperate rainforests of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Australia. Fully half the species of woody plants are endemic to this ecoregion.|$|R

5|$|The fossa is a {{carnivore}} that hunts {{small to}} medium-sized animals. One of eight carnivorous species endemic to Madagascar, the fossa is the island's largest surviving endemic terrestrial mammal {{and the only}} predator capable of preying upon adults of all extant lemur species, the largest of which can weigh as much as 90percent {{of the weight of}} the average fossa. Although it is the predominant predator of lemurs, reports of its dietary habits demonstrate a wide variety of prey selectivity and specialization depending on habitat and season; diet does not vary by sex. While the fossa is thought to be a lemur specialist in Ranomafana National Park, its diet is more variable in other <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> habitats.|$|E
5|$|Manning explores {{these themes}} {{not only in}} her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, {{colonialist}} attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus {{on the impact of}} the end of colonial rule. The <b>Rain</b> <b>Forest</b> (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.|$|E
5|$|The conquering Spanish {{carried out}} several {{operations}} to relocate the Manche to Alta Verapaz, with their relocation being completed in 1697, {{a short time}} after the Spanish finally defeated their Itza Maya neighbours to the northwest. Most of the surviving Manche Ch'ol were forcibly resettled in the Guatemalan Highlands, in the villages of El Chol and Belén, in the Urran Valley near Rabinal. The resettled Manche Ch'ol suffered from the abrupt change of climate from tropical lowland <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> to the cold highlands. They were often not provided with suitable clothing by their Spanish overlords, and many died. The depopulation of the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ol lands, and the resulting collapse of long-standing trade routes, resulted in the gradual impoverishment of colonial Verapaz.|$|E

5|$|The Javan rhino {{can live}} around 30–45years in the wild. It {{historically}} inhabited lowland <b>rain</b> <b>forest,</b> wet grasslands, and large floodplains. It is mostly solitary, except for courtship and offspring-rearing, though groups may occasionally congregate near wallows and salt licks. Aside from humans, adults have no predators in their range. The Javan rhino usually avoids humans, but will attack when it feels threatened. Scientists and conservationists rarely study the animals directly {{due to their}} extreme rarity and the danger of interfering with such an endangered species. Researchers rely on camera traps and fecal samples to gauge health and behavior. Consequently, the Javan rhino is the least studied of all rhino species. Two adult rhinos with their calves were filmed in a motion-triggered video released on February 28, 2011, by WWF and Indonesia's National Park Authority, which proved it is still breeding in the wild. In April 2012, the National Parks Authority released video showing 35 individual Javan rhinos, including mother/offspring pairs and courting adults. As of 2016 there are only 63 individuals {{left out in the}} wild and none captive.|$|E
