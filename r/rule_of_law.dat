40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis explains several terms from the area of civil protection, such as civil protection, international humanitarian law, extraordinary and crisis event, and describes {{the historical development of}} civil protection in an international environment and in the territory of today's Czech Republic. The thesis also characterizes international institutions while addressing some of them, namely ICRC, UN, NATO and EU, in more detail. It describes the history, characteristics and organization structure of international institutions, as well as involvement of the North Atlantic Alliance and European Union in civil emergency planning. In terms of the Czech Republic, the thesis examines particularly how the population protection is organized in its territory. Last but not least, the thesis specifies international <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> connected with civil protection, <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the NATO addressing civil protection, <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the EU addressing civil protection and Czech <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> addressing population protection. The objective of thesis is to compare and evaluate fulfilment of tasks of the Czech and international legislation in the area of civil protection. The thesis will also serve as a study material for students of the branches "Civil Emergency Preparedness" and "Population Protection with Specialization in CBRNE" and as a supporting material for the regional authority and the authorities of municipalities with extended competence. The first section of the research part of the diploma thesis examines selected <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> civil protection of the Czech Republic, NATO and EU and, last but not least, Geneva Conventions. In 2013 the new Population Protection Policy for the period until 2020 with an outlook until 2030 entered into effect in the Czech Republic, based on which six areas of population protection were created. A new document of civil emergency planning of NATO is the 2014 - 2017 Political Guidance of CEP. Decision No. 1313 / 2013 /EU on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism has been used as the principal document for civil protection within the EU since 1. 1. 2014. These three <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> are the main documents used for the comparison and evaluation of fulfilment of tasks of the Czech and international legislation in this thesis and are examined in more detailed. The last of the documents mentioned {{in this part of the}} thesis are the Geneva Conventions, and the thesis examines particularly their embodiment in the Czech legal regulation. At the end of this part there is a summary table that matches Czech <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> to international <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> in individual areas. The <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the EU and NATO constitute a superstructure above the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> their Member States and cannot be directly compared; however, it is possible to determine whether the Czech <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> comply with them. The Geneva Conventions have been embodied in the legal order of the Czech Republic, and other provisions thereof have been implemented through other Acts. As far as NATO is concerned, cooperation takes place particularly between organizations in individual cases. Cooperation and coordination between EU and Member States do not interfere in the primary responsibility for the protection of population, environment, property and cultural heritage of the Member States within their own territories. The Decision on the Mechanism also does not concern mutual rights and obligations of Member States that are embodied in bilateral or multilateral treaties in the area of civil protection. At the conclusion, the thesis proposes certain changes and amendments to the Czech <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> which could improve civil protection in the territory of the Czech Republic and facilitate interconnection with the international environment, which has not been working yet as it is supposed to since the new Population Protection Policy has not been in full compliance with the international <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R
40|$|Trying {{criminal}} cases is hard. The problem faced {{by a judge}} in court can be phrased in a deceptively simple way though, as follows: in order {{to come to a}} verdict, a judge has to apply the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> to the facts of the case. In a naïve and often criticized model of legal decision making (reminding of the bouche de la loi view on judges), the verdict is determined by applying the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> that match the case facts. This naïve model of legal decision making can be referred to as the subsumption model. A problem with the subsumption model is that neither the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> nor the case facts are available to the legal decision maker in a sufficiently well-structured form to make the processes of matching and applying a trivial matter. First, there is the problem of determining what the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and the case facts are. Neither the rules nor the facts are presented to the judge in a precise and unambiguous way. A judge has to interpret the available information about the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and the case facts. Second, even if the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and the case facts would be determined, the processes of matching and applying can be problematic. It can for instance be undetermined whether some case fact falls under a particular rule's condition. Additional classificatory rules are then needed. In general, it can be the case that applying the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> leads to conflicting verdicts about the case at hand, or to no verdict at all. In the latter situation, it is to the judge's discretion to fill the gap, in the former, he has to resolve the conflict...|$|R
