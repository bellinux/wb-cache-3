5|$|Sheffield has an {{international}} reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. Many innovations in these fields {{have been made}} in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth. This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18thcentury. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912, and the work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park by Sheffield's universities and other independent <b>research</b> <b>organisations.</b> Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (CTI), The Welding Institute (TWI), and William Cook Group.|$|E

2500|$|The form of {{the work}} is highly symbolic. The figure is robed in a fabric richly {{embossed}} with emblems and figures representing the Community. The shallow saucer on which the figure stands represents Canberra's nick-name [...] "Frosty Hollow". The saucer is 6 sided because the plan for Civic square is itself hexagonal. The surface of the saucer bears a relief map of Canberra and the rolling countryside around it. At the feet of Ethos are indentations that represent the lake that was later to fill the space between the Civic Centre and the administrative part of the city. The bursting sun she holds aloft is symbolic of culture and enlightenment which the presence of Canberra's University, its <b>research</b> <b>organisations</b> and the Diplomatic Corps and so on give to the city. [...] Bass regarded the work as his most important civic work. [...] During the 1960s and 70s, pictures of the sculpture were frequently used in Canberra tourism images.|$|E
