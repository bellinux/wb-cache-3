5|$|The first {{automatic}} power {{windows were}} developed by Packard in 1940. Each of the major American brands experimented with the technology, which was initially for luxury vehicles {{as a replacement for}} manually operated <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> windows. In the 1950s, these became widespread in American passenger cars.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{battle plan}} for July 2 {{called for a}} general assault of Meade's {{position}}s. On the right, Longstreet's First Corps was to position itself to attack the Union left flank, facing northeast astraddle the Emmitsburg Road, and to <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> the U.S.line. The attack sequence was to begin with Maj. Gens. John Bell Hood's and Lafayette McLaws's divisions, followed by Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division of Hill's Third Corps.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E

5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on {{the insides of}} their elbows. This is spread across their bodies and those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> and drop from the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E
5|$|Booker T and Sharmell fought Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks in a Mixed Tag Team match. The {{encounter}} lasted {{ten minutes}} and forty-seven seconds. Sharmell {{ended up getting}} the pinfall on Brooks with a <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> pin. After the contest, Roode blamed Brooks for the lost, which resulted in Brooks slapping Roode and Roode grabbing her by the hair. Sharmell then came to Brooks' defense, causing Roode to accidentally smack her in the face, knocking her out in storyline.|$|E
5|$|On 23 December, Lieutenant-General Dempsey's XIII Corps {{launched}} a new attack to push back the German line from Orsogna. In the afternoon, the British 5th Infantry Division attacked on {{the right wing of}} the Corps front toward the Arielli stream. Their objective was to secure the flank of the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was in turn to attack northwest and west from the salient in order to <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> the Orsogna defences from the north.|$|E

5|$|On {{the left}} {{flank of the}} XI Corps, the attack focused on Gen. Schimmelfennig's division. They were {{subjected}} to a deadly artillery crossfire from Rodes' and Early's batteries, and as they deployed they were attacked by Doles' infantry. Early's troops were able to employ a flanking attack and <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> the division from the right, and they fell back in confusion toward the town. A desperate counterattack by the 157th New York from von Amsberg's brigade was surrounded on three sides, causing it to suffer 307 casualties (75%).|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Napoleon drafted {{his general}} order: Reille's Corps {{on the left}} and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward {{position}} on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A grande batterie of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, with Wellington's centre {{exposed by}} the fall of La Haye Sainte and the Plancenoit front {{temporarily}} stabilised, Napoleon committed his last reserve, the hitherto-undefeated Imperial Guard infantry. This attack, mounted at around 19:30, was intended to break through Wellington's centre and <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> his line away from the Prussians. Although {{it is one of the}} most celebrated passages of arms in military history, it had been unclear which units actually participated. It appears that it was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the grenadiers or chasseurs of the Old Guard. Three Old Guard battalions did move forward and formed the attack's second line, though they remained in reserve and did not directly assault the allied line.|$|E

5|$|On 10 June, the 7th Armoured Division {{took over}} parts of 50th Northumbrian Division front with the 56th Infantry Brigade under command. By nightfall, the 7th Armoured Division {{had reached the}} {{north-western}} fringe of Tilly-sur-Seulles and next day penetrated the village capturing the central crossroads. The Panzer-Lehr Division made several counter-attacks, which forced the British out and attacks by the 50th (Northumbrian) Division bogged down in the bocage against the Panzer-Lehr Division. Army Group B planned to relieve the armoured divisions facing the Second Army from 11 June {{and replace them with}} infantry divisions, to concentrate the tanks in the Carentan area and avert the danger to Cherbourg. Adolf Hitler overruled Rommel and the next day ordered him not to retreat and instead <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> the Allied beachhead from east to west, starting with the Orne bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} six days, the Japanese attacked the bridgehead, launching {{a series of}} assaults that, {{in the words of}} Robert Burla, bordered upon suicidal. These attacks were repulsed and the Australians began to launch patrols in all directions around the ridge. On 29 January, the Japanese launched a large-scale attack on 'C' Company's positions and although the Australians resisted, the attack succeeded in breaking through one part of the perimeter and managed to <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> the position {{all the way to the}} main battalion position around Puto before it was turned back. The Australian counter-attack, organised by the 'C' Company's commander, Captain Alwyn Shilton, and supported by accurate artillery fire, came on 1 February and resulted in over 30 Japanese killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts is a warning coloration which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> and secrete a milky substance.|$|E

5|$|The {{match that}} {{followed}} was a Fatal 4-Way Match for the WWE Women's Championship, with Victoria defending the title against Trish Stratus, Lita, and Gail Kim. The {{start of the}} match saw Victoria and Lita double team Stratus, however, Stratus avoided the assault, as she rolled out of the ring. Lita and Victoria went on to double team Kim, however, Stratus pulled Lita out of the ring, afterward Victoria performed a moonsault and landed on Kim's torso. Lita then drove Kim's head into the mat. Stratus {{then went on to}} use a <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> on Lita to gain a pinfall victory, becoming Women's champion for a fifth time.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} Naruto for his Part II appearance, Kishimoto {{changed his}} character's clothing to an orange and black top, orange pants, and black sandals. He also {{gave him a}} red cape with black flames at the bottom when fighting Pain, {{a member of the}} Akatsuki. He drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw, something that had bothered him with his previous design. He also noted that Naruto's pants made the character look too childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed them to <b>roll</b> <b>up,</b> giving him a more mature appearance. He gave Naruto this look in order to make him stand out during action scenes.|$|E
5|$|After {{some time}} away from TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live to declare that he would undergo a gimmick change on the following week's edition. He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a never seen before entrance but ended up being an entrance with no music, lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after a Roll Up; right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by a <b>roll</b> <b>up,</b> similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E

5|$|Late on {{the evening}} of 11 July, Hausser, the {{commander}} of the II SS-Panzer Corps, issued orders for the next day's advance on Prokhorovka. It was known that the Red Army had dug in many anti-tank guns on the southwest slopes of Prokhorovka, making a direct attack by Leibstandarte very difficult. The plan was for Totenkopf to capture Hill 226.6, and advance northeast along the Psel River to the Kartash—ëvka-Prokhorovka road, and then strike southeast into the flank and rear of Soviet forces at Prokhorovka. Leibstandarte was ordered to make a limited advance and secure Storozhevoe and Lamki just outside Prokhorovka, then it and Das Reich were to wait until Totenkopfs attack had disrupted the Soviet positions, after which Leibstandarte was to attack the main Soviet defences on the southwest slope of Prokhorovka. To Leibstandartes right, elements of Das Reich were also to advance eastward to the high ground south of Prokhorovka, then turn south away from Prokhorovka to <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> the Soviet defences opposing the III Panzer Corps' advance and force a gap. The 8th Air Corps was to concentrate its effort to supporting the advance of the II SS-Panzer Corps, with the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west assigned limited air resources.|$|E
5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature of stem and cap. However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall. The upper part rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores. The spores are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} peridium to shrivel and <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> more, exposing more spores. This is continued until the upper half of the peridium has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few spores, which may be washed away by rain.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), {{also called}} the white {{scavenger}} vulture or pharaoh's chicken, is a small Old World vulture and {{the only member of}} the genus Neophron. It is widely distributed; the Egyptian vulture is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. The contrasting underwing pattern and wedge-shaped tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large pebble onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of a pebble as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to <b>roll</b> <b>up</b> wool for use in their nest. Egyptian vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.|$|E
