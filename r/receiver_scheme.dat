This <b>receiver</b> <b>scheme</b> is well suited for transmissions over a frequency-selective channel with large delay spread and for high spectral efficiency modulations. A low-complexity soft-input soft-output-ary channel decoder is proposed. Turbo equalization allows intersymbol interference to be reduced drastically.

40|$|International audienceThe {{successful}} {{deployment of}} Impulse Radio (IR) Ultra Wide Band (UWB) wireless communication systems requie that they coexist and contend {{with a variety}} of interfering signals co–located over the same transmission band. In fact, if on the one hand the large transmission bandwidth of IR–UWB signals allows them to resolve multipath components and exploit multipath diversity, on the other hand it yields some new coexistence challenges for both unlicensed commercial and military communication systems, which are required to be robust to unintentional and intentional jammers, respectively. In particular, the design and analysis of low–complexity <b>receiver</b> <b>schemes</b> with good synchronization capabilities and high robustness to Narrow–Band Interference (NBI) is acknowledged as an important issue in IR–UWB research. Motivated by this consideration, in [1] we have recently proposed a low–complexity receiver design, the so–called Chip–Time Differential Transmitted–Reference (Tc–DTR) scheme, and have shown that it is more robust to NBI than other non–coherent <b>receiver</b> <b>schemes</b> available in the literature. In this paper, we aim at generalizing the results in [1] and at developing the enabling analytical tools for the analysis and design of timing acquisition algorithms for non–coherent receivers over frequency–selective fading channels with NBI. Furthermore, we move from the proposed analytical framework to tackle the optimization problem of devising optimal signature codes to reduce the impact of NBI on the performance of the Tc–DTR synchronizer.
