2500|$|For 1971, the SS option {{could be}} ordered with any {{optional}} V8 and became {{more of a}} dress-up option than a performance option. The SS option was reduced to one <b>RPO</b> <b>code,</b> RPO Z15, and was only available for the Chevelle Malibu. [...] This <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> required any optional engine and transmission available in the Chevelle lineup. [...] Since the 307 V8 was the standard base V8 in 1971, {{it could not be}} ordered with the SS option; one had to order the LS3 402 or the LS5 454, or one of the two 350 V8 engines (L65 or L48 - which reintroduced the small block to the SS option {{for the first time since}} the 1965 model year for USA market Chevelles).|$|E
2500|$|Z02 - Spyder {{appearance}} : Black highlights on front, {{side and}} rear of body headlight openings, parking light openings, windshield, rear window and side window moldings, body sill, door and center pillar louvers, {{rear end panel}} - (bright window moldings with black exterior), black or gold rear accents (taillight blackouts and rear end panel decals), body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems (front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel horn button insert), body side stripes with Spyder lettering in red, white or gold depending on body color, black painted styled-steel wheels with trim rings and center caps, black sport mirrors, special hood decal and rear spoiler decal. For the 1980 model year, Chevrolet combined the Spyder equipment and appearance packages into one Spyder equipment package with an <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> of Z29 and included newly re-designed bold Spyder side decals and a new front air dam that blends into the front fender wheel openings. [...] Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.|$|E
50|$|A few <b>RPO</b> <b>codes</b> {{have become}} notable {{enough that they}} have been used as model names. The Camaro Z28 name came from an option code which {{specified}} a performance-oriented configuration. This happened again with the Corvette Z06 models. Although most <b>RPO</b> <b>codes</b> that are promoted to model names are speed-oriented codes, the Z71 off-road suspension code for trucks became notable enough that the code was promoted to a model name, turned into a logo and applied as stickers onto the rear quarter panel of vehicles with the Z71 package.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the Z/28 {{nameplate}} came from the <b>RPO</b> <b>codes</b> - <b>RPO</b> Z28 was the code for the Special Performance Package. RPO Z27 was for the Super Sport package.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>RPO</b> <b>codes</b> {{have been}} reused over the years. For example, the ZR1 {{performance}} option {{was available for}} the 1970 Corvette, the 1990 through 1995 Corvette, and the 2009 Corvette. In some cases (such as this), the RPO specifies a package with similar function (in this case performance) to previous uses of the <b>code.</b> For <b>RPOs</b> that never became notable the code may be reused for entirely dissimilar options.|$|R
2500|$|The 2005 {{model year}} {{continued}} with standard hood scoops, split rear exhaust with a revised rear fascia, and {{late in the}} year, optional 18inch (45.7cm) wheels. The major change for 2005 was {{the replacement of the}} LS1 engine with the LS2 engine. This [...] engine increased power and torque in the GTO to [...] with [...] torque. Other changes included larger front rotors and caliper hardware from the Corvette, and the drivetrain was strengthened {{with the addition of a}} driveshaft with larger [...] "giubos" [...] and a larger differential flange, as well as revised half-shafts. Dashboard gauge graphics were revised. The optional dealer-installed Sport Appearance Package became available and differed visually by having a different lower rear fascia, aftermarket mufflers with quad chrome exhaust tips, revised spoiler and front lower fascia extension, recessed grilles, and revised rocker panels. This package was available from GM as an accessory in red, silver, black, or primer for other color cars. Production was 11,069 due in part to a shortened model year. Barbados Blue and Cosmos Purple were dropped this year, but Cyclone Grey and Midnight Blue Metallic were added. Customers also had the option to order their GTO without hood scoops (<b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> BZJ), though only 24 were produced this way. [...] With this improved powerplant, GM claimed the car capable of 0 to [...] in 4.7seconds and a 13.0second quarter mile at [...] (automatic transmission). Car and Driver magazine tested the car at 0–60mph in 4.8 seconds and the ¼ mile in 13.3seconds at [...] for the quarter mile with its BFGoodrich g-Force T/A KDWS, 245/45ZR-17 95W M+S front and rear tires but manual transmission. The 0–100 and 0–130 times were 11.7 and 19.6 respectively.|$|E

50|$|Chevrolet made {{extensive}} {{changes to}} the Spyder package including separate equipment and appearance packages with separate <b>RPO</b> <b>codes</b> found on the build sheet. The Spyder equipment package was a regular production option (RPO) Z01, while the Spyder appearance package was RPO Z02. The Spyder packages were available on Monza 2+2 sport hatchbacks. Spyder decal colors were determined by the body color of the Monza ordered. There were four color combinations for 1977. For 1979, there were six combinations, which included a green and a blue color scheme.|$|R

50|$|A Regular Production Option (RPO) is a General Motors {{standard}} coding for {{vehicle configuration}} options. These codes are {{a combination of}} 3 alphanumeric characters and refer to a specific option or modification to the vehicle. These codes signify how the vehicle is built during production and thus the specific configuration of a vehicle as it exits the factory {{up to and including}} the paint color can be described by specifying the base model and the complete list of <b>RPO</b> <b>codes</b> used during production. Even a vehicle with no extra-cost options will have some RPOs, as information like the engine type and exterior paint color are always specified.|$|R
50|$|The 1993 SCX {{production}} totaled 500 cars produced including (5) C41 <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> A/C-delete racing {{models as}} follows: (1) bright red, (1) aqua, and (3) white cars. The normal C60 <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> models included (128) black, (191) bright red, (20) medium garnet red, (73) aqua, (8) neon blue, (70) white, and (5) majestic pearl cars.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} GM 6.5 liter diesel engine {{production}} options. The Turbocharged L56, (VIN [...] "S") {{was used in}} most light duty 3/4 ton (2500). Heavy duty 3/4 ton and 1 ton trucks used the Turbocharged L65 (VIN [...] "F") engine. The L56 is emissions controlled with EGR and catalytic converters. The L65 engine has no EGR, and has no catalytic converter. There is a soot trap on L65 engines that is often mistaken for a catalytic converter. GM was the first manufacturer to introduce an electronically controlled fuel injection system into a diesel pickup truck. The L49 (VIN [...] "P") and L57 are both naturally aspirated engines. L57 is listed as HO or Heavy Duty. Additional <b>RPO</b> <b>codes</b> are LQM (175HP) and LQN (190HP).|$|R
5000|$|Performance {{modifications}} primarily differentiated the SCX {{from the}} SC models and {{were designed to}} make the SCX competitive for use in showroom stock racing series such as the IMSA Firehawk and SCCA GRAND-AM World Challenge. This included the move to smaller diameter yet wider V-rated P215/60VR-14 BF Goodrich Comp T/A tires on 14x6.5 inch cast aluminum wheels (compared to the SC's 205/55R-16 on 16x6 inch wheels) and different suspension components on the SCX-specific FX3 <b>RPO</b> <b>coded</b> suspension. The suspension changes included larger diameter direct-acting front sway bar over the base Achieva, a wider rear axle with dual rear sway bars, [...] "Computer Command Ride" [...] (CCR) electronically adjustable struts and shock absorbers, as well as higher spring rates and bushing changes. (A similar CCR electronic suspension was also offered as an option on the Achieva SC {{as well as the}} platform-mate Buick Skylark and works similar to the systems offered on Cadillac and Corvette models of the time.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The 6.6L <b>RPO</b> LML (VIN <b>code</b> [...] "8") is the 2011-2016 {{version of}} the Isuzu/GM Duramax V8 diesel engine. It is a further {{advanced}} {{version of the}} LMM engine {{with the majority of}} the changes addressing a required drastic reduction in engine emissions. Some mechanical aspects of the engine, such as piston oil flow design for improved temperature control and oil pump design, were also improved to enhance durability even further.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} {{numbers for}} the Achieva SCX in 1992 totaled 1146 cars made with (6) C41 <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> A/C-delete racing models as follows: (1) bright red, (2) medium garnet red, (1) aqua, (1) blue, and (1) white cars.

5000|$|<b>RPO</b> LB7 (engine <b>code</b> [...] "1") {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2001 and continued until early-2004. It is a 32-valve design with high-pressure common-rail direct injection and an experimental composite design cylinder head. The most common issue with the LB7 is injector failure, so common that a special policy bulletin was issued (#04039B). Fuel leaked and entered the crankcase, causing oil dilution. Early on, customers came forward complaining of severe overheating, and in some situations, blown head gaskets. Initially GM denied it was a problem, but after being sued by a consumer group, GM relented and included overheating and blown head gaskets as a warranted item.|$|R

50|$|The {{topic of}} {{available}} gear ratios {{has been widely}} debated due to the numerous applications of this transaxle. The 1987 GM Getrag Service Manual confirms that {{there are at least}} two versions of the Getrag 282. According to the manual, the two versions were sold under 5 different part numbers based on body and engine usage. The first version, <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> MG2 was used for all GM V6 applications (FWD and the RWD Fiero) and the second version, <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> MG1, was used for the 2.0 L turbocharged engine used by Pontiac and Buick. Gear ratios are given below, as taken from the GM Product Service Training Manual.|$|E
50|$|The 301 Turbo package (<b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> LU8) {{utilized}} {{air conditioning}} (C60) {{due to the}} turbo-specific heater core box, and automatic transmission (TH350 (non-lockup) for 1980, and THM350C (lock-up) for 1981) and 3.08 positraction rear axle ratio (G80).|$|E
50|$|The <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> 1LE {{was again}} {{available}} in 1990, triggered {{as in the}} previous year by RPO G92 Performance Axle combined with no air conditioning on the IROC-Z coupe. Only 62 Camaros were built with 1LE equipment in 1990.|$|E
50|$|The code {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a Regular Production Order (<b>RPO)</b> <b>code,</b> but technically is an SEO code for fleet use. Both groups of options are found on the production code sticker, which on most modern GM vehicles is located in the glove box.|$|E
5000|$|For 1971, the SS option {{could be}} ordered with any {{optional}} V8 and became {{more of a}} dress-up option than a performance option. The SS option was reduced to one <b>RPO</b> <b>code,</b> RPO Z15, and was only available for the Chevelle Malibu. This <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> required any optional engine and transmission available in the Chevelle lineup.

50|$|As a {{footnote}} to 1987 production, one 1986 Callaway Twin Turbo Corvette was {{built at the}} very start of production. This sole 1986 Callaway Corvette, was built {{using one of the}} (fifty) Malcolm Konner Commemorative Edition Corvette Coupes (<b>RPO</b> <b>Code</b> 4001ZA) built that year and counted under 1986 Callaway Corvette production.|$|E

And {{was equipped with}} a water-cooled Garrett T-25 turbocharger; however it did not utilize an intercooler. Maximum boost at WOT was [...]|$|E
5000|$|As for {{the rest}} of the Firebird line, GM made a new dual {{catalytic}} converter exhaust system (<b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> N10) available, freeing up 13% more power from some LB9- and L98-equipped Formulas and Trans Ams; so equipped, LB9 engine output was increased to 225 hp while the L98 increased to 235 hp. The N10 option remained available throughout the balance of the Third Generation production run, however the L98 powerplant was only available with an automatic transmission, whereas the LB9/N10 combination could only be coupled to a 5-speed manual (<b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> MM5) and a limited-slip differential (<b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> G80) using a 3.45 performance axle ratio (<b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> GM3). According to a March 1990 (Vol. 35, No. 9) Car and Driver article, when the latter set of options were combined into the relatively unassuming (and 300-pounds-lighter) Formula body, which shared the same WS6 suspension with the top-end Trans Am GTA, it created a [...] "sleeper" [...] Firebird that could out-perform the heavier Trans Am GTA (even when equipped with the L98 engine) - at a roughly 30% lower sticker price. Car and Driver also reported that (aside from the TTA, offered only in 1989) these [...] "sleeper" [...] Formulas were the fastest Third-Generation Firebirds - capable of accelerating from 0-60 mph in under 7 seconds and boasting a top speed of more than 135 mi/h km/h (quite impressive for the day). Although not an exhaustive comparison, these claims would seem to be supported by a simple examination of the weight-to-power ratios of both models: a 225 hp Formula at a curb weight of 3300 lb versus a 235 hp Trans Am GTA at a curb weight of 3600 lb; the weight-to-power ratio for the Formula is 14.67 lb/hp compared to 15.32 lb/hp for the Trans Am GTA. According to the same Car and Driver article, very few of these [...] "sleeper" [...] Formulas hit the streets; only about 50 were built each model year, as almost all LB9-equipped Formulas came with an automatic transmission - which disqualified them from receiving the high-performance N10 and GM3 options.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, GM {{began to}} market the 231 as the 3.8 liter as metric engine sizes became common in the United States. The <b>RPO</b> <b>Code</b> was LD5, though California-emissions {{versions}} were called LC6. Starting in 1979, the engine {{was used in the}} front-wheel drive Buick Riviera, though still with a longitudinal mounting. Larger valves and better intake and exhaust boosted the power output for 1979.|$|E
50|$|For the 1980 model year, Chevrolet {{combined}} the Spyder equipment and appearance packages into one Spyder equipment package with an <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> of Z29 and included newly re-designed bold Spyder side decals {{and a new}} front air dam that blends into the front fender wheel openings. Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.|$|E
5000|$|A smaller {{version of}} this engine was {{produced}} in 1978 and 1979 for the Century and Regal and Chevrolet Monza. The bore was reduced to 3.5 in, resulting in an engine of 196 cuin L piston displacement. The <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> was LC9. Initially this engine produced , but in 1979 it received the same improvements in the cylinder heads as did the LD5, and therefore power increased to [...]|$|E
5000|$|For the 1997 model year, the Camaro {{featured}} a new interior and tri-colored taillights {{that would be}} standard on all models from 1997 to 2002. It was offered with a [...] "30th Anniversary Limited Edition" [...] that included unique orange stripes on white base paint. It was only available on the Z28 and SS models. A 30th Anniversary Camaro may be identified by <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> Z4C on the trim tag. A total of 979 30th Anniversary SS Camaros were made in 1997. An additional 108 30th Anniversary Camaro SS vehicles were modified by SLP to include a 330-horsepower (250 kW) and 340 lb·ft (461 N·m) version of the LT4 engine (108 total LT4 cars were made, 100 US, 6 Canadian & 2 prototypes). SS cars will have <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> R7T. The LT4 was the fastest factory-built Camaro available, {{as well as the}} most expensive at over US$38,000. New 5-spoke 16-inch wheels became standard on the Z28 this year (17" [...] ZR1 style on SS coupe models) available in either polished, chrome, or white on the 30th Anniversary models, replacing the previous 10-spoke design.|$|E
50|$|GM never {{offered a}} {{four-wheel-drive}} counterpart of the C3500 HD, {{so there was}} no K3500 HD. Several aftermarket conversion companies offered a 4x4 version with either a Dana 60 or Dana 70 front axle. At least one company, Monroe Truck, was offered by GM dealers as a ship-through 4WD upfit using the <b>RPO</b> <b>code</b> VCB. Tulsa is another company that did 4x4 conversions for utility companies. Quigley conversions were mostly for fire/ambulance applications.|$|E
