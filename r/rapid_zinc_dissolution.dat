40|$|Abstract: Topography and {{composition}} of Cr-free, titanium-based pretreatment layers on hot dip galvanized steel were studied with scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and Auger electron spectroscopy. A layer within the target coating weight range (4 - 10 mg Ti/m 2) for industrial coil coating processes contained a micro-structure with hillocks and valleys, showing significant topographical variations. A local maximum film thickness of about 50 nm was detected for a sample containing 5. 0 mg Ti/m 2. The hillocks were composed of metal complexes and phosphates, formed {{as a result of}} <b>rapid</b> <b>zinc</b> <b>dissolution</b> and metal hydroxide/phosphate precipitation reactions. During the layer formation also the polymer component of the pretreatment chemical becomes embedded within the structure. The structure composed of hillocks and valleys may be highly beneficial for paint adhesion, increasing the surface contact area for primary and secondary chemical bonding.

The effects of pH and temperature variations and ferrous ions addition upon the extent of copper and <b>zinc</b> <b>dissolution</b> have been examined.

40|$|In this paper, an {{investigation}} of the Cd 2 -/Zn cementation system is attempted through a semi-theoretical approach, correlating the rates of <b>zinc</b> <b>dissolution</b> and cadmium precipitation under various conditions. Two series of experiments were carried out using zinc in the form of sticks and dust, respectively, while cadmium ions were dissolved as sulphates. The parameters examined were temperature (25 - 50 °C), additives (H 2 SO 4, NH 4 OH, Na 2 SO 4), stirring speed (200 - 600 rpm), initial Cd 2 + concentration and granulometric size of zinc dust (0 - 78 - 1 - 84 mm). In the second group of tests, continuous recording of pH change versus time was carried out. Total dissolved solids curves versus pH were constructed for each experiment showing solid cadmium to be the only precipitated phase, and mass balances for the two elements were evaluated for all tests. To account for the sampling position in the reactor, a new concept, the normalisation coefficient, is introduced and evaluated, correlating the species' concentrations in the system. Also time expansion was taken into account and equilibrium constants were evaluated. Based on the above, a correlation equation between the rates of <b>zinc</b> <b>dissolution</b> and cadmium precipitation is derived theoretically and it is confirmed by the experimental results. This analysis demonstrated the important role of pH for the system kinetics and the considerable effect obtained using normalisation coefficient on the experimental data.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the <b>dissolution</b> of <b>zinc</b> oxide have {{concentrated}} {{on the effects of}} temperature, reagent concentration, particle size and agitation rate, among other factors. However, there is dearth data on the effect of a combination of product concentration and pH on leaching rates. This work examines the effects of the concentration of pH and zinc ions on the <b>dissolution</b> kinetics of <b>zinc</b> oxide. The results showed that the rate of <b>zinc</b> <b>dissolution</b> was greatest at lower pHs. This is because at lower pH, the concentration of acid (H+ ions) is also expected to be high (pH = log 10 [H+]), thus increasing the reaction kinetics in accordance with the kinetic molecular theory. The rate of reaction was found to increase with an increase in the concentration of zinc ions (Zn 2 +), which is in contrast to established theories. This observation {{can be explained by the}} fact that since heat energy produced (via an exothermic reaction) was continuously being dissipated through a constant temperature water bath it favoured <b>zinc</b> oxide <b>dissolution.</b> <b>Zinc</b> oxide ore at 62. 5 % purity also comprised of other metal oxides (e. g., iron, copper, manganese, etc) which were simultaneously leached.

40|$|MasterThe overall {{performance}} of galvanized steel {{has been greatly}} improved by different surface treatments, various bath chemical compositions and application of organic coatings. In spite of improved surface corrosion resistance, the sheared edges of the steel sheet still suffer from corrosion attack. Since the involved mechanism in the cut edge corrosion {{is different from that}} of general surface, the approach of minimizing this problem has to be adjusted in order to satisfy both surface and edge resistance. When the cut edge corrosion resistance is evaluated, it can be interpreted by three main characteristics such as the time of corrosion commencement, degree of galvanic protection, and initiation site which gives an insight of further corrosion propagation. Therefore, the effect of the coating manufacturing method, aluminum addition, and phosphate pretreatment was investigated by employing potentiostatic polarization test to reveal coating dissolution behavior along with the initiation site of cut edge corrosion. The results of coating resistance were obtained from exposure to simulated marine environment in cyclic corrosion chamber. The following analysis of the coating deterioration caused by cut edge corrosion was performed with the aid of scanning electron microscope and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Consequently, it has been revealed that galvannealing process resulted in substantially reduced cut edge corrosion resistance due to the high iron content at the outer surface and presence of innate cracks in the coating. On the other hand, 55 % of aluminum addition showed good corrosion resistance owing to slow degradation rate of the coating. Further, phosphate was found to inhibit <b>zinc</b> <b>dissolution</b> from the surface of electrogalvanized steel, which led to the accelerated <b>zinc</b> <b>dissolution</b> from the edges. In addition, the geometry of the sheared edge of organic coated specimen was shown to affect cut edge corrosion resistance through initial adhesion loss caused by cutting process...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{experimental}} observations, {{a mechanism}} {{is presented to}} explain existence of the different morphologies of electrodeposited zinc in alkaline solution. The high current density dendrites appear {{to be due to}} more rapid growth on the nonbasal crystallographic planes than on the basal plane. The low current density moss apparently results from dissolution from the nonbasal planes at low cathodic voltages. Electrochemical models were sought which would produce such a phenomenon. The fundamental plating mechanism alone accounts only for different rates on different planes, not for <b>zinc</b> <b>dissolution</b> from a plane in the cathodic region. Fourteen models were explored; two models were in accord with the proposed mechanism. One involves rapid disproportionation of the zinc + 1 species on the nonbasal planes.

This was attributed to a reduction in the rate of the <b>zinc</b> <b>dissolution</b> reaction from the electro-deposit which in turn extended the cathodic protection periods of the deposit. Passivation of the electro-deposited alloy in the cerium-containing solution lead to the precipitation of cerium oxides/hydroxides in a non-uniform manner over the surface.

The Tafel slopes of the anodic polarization curves are close to 40 mV dec- 1 at lower current densities (10 - 5  5 x 10 - 4 A cm- 2), while at higher current densities (5 x 10 - 4  10 - 2 A cm- 2) the slopes {{are in the range}} of 60  120 mV dec- 1.

In both cases the relevant EDTA species directly participate as reactants in the anodic reaction.

Specifically, our electron microscopy, plant cell, and fluorescence assays showed that the adsorption and aggregation of ZnO NPs compromised algal cell morphology, viability, and membrane integrity, resulting from <b>zinc</b> ion <b>dissolution</b> as well as possible mechanical cell damage induced by the NPs. Conversely, algal cells displayed a remarkable capability of self-protection by minimizing their surface area through aggregation mediated by the oppositely charged metal ions and suppressing zinc ion release from the NPs through exudation, as evidenced by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, zeta potential, and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This study illustrates the adaptive nature and complexity in potential ecological response to discharged nanomaterial...|$|R
