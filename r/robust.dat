5|$|A 2017 study {{indicates}} that juveniles were born with a <b>robust</b> build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea {{with those of the}} contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the <b>robust</b> direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is <b>robust</b> against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more <b>robust</b> against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E

5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally <b>robust</b> and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a <b>robust</b> and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E
5|$|Ji and Ji (1996) {{identified}} many {{features that}} set Sinosauropteryx {{apart from other}} birds and dinosaurs. They {{found that it was}} a small primitive bird with a relatively high skull, blunt rostrum and a slightly high premaxilla; that the antorbital fenestra was elliptical but not enlarged, the dentary was <b>robust,</b> the surangular was narrow and elongated, and the dentition is extremely well developed and acute; that there are over 50 extremely elongated caudals, constituting 60% of the body length, and the forelimb is extremely short with a short and thick humerus; the pubis was elongated and extremely inflated at its distal end and the ischium is broad; the hind limb was long and <b>robust,</b> the tibia is only slightly longer than the femur, the tarsals are separated, and the metatarsals are relatively <b>robust</b> with unfused proximal ends; the feathers are short, small, and uniform; many ornament the top of the skull, cervical, and dorsal regions, in addition to the dorsal and ventral caudal region.|$|E

25|$|Carrano et al. (2002) {{distinguished}} {{two forms}} of Masiakasaurus, a <b>robust</b> form and a gracile form. The <b>robust</b> morph includes specimens with thicker bones and more pronounced projections for the attachment of ligaments and muscles. The gracile form includes specimens that are more slender and have less pronounced muscle attachments. It also has unfused tibiae, unlike the fused tibiae of the <b>robust</b> form. These two varieties may be an indication of sexual dimorphism in Masiakasaurus, but they may also represent two distinct populations.|$|E
25|$|The main {{benefits}} of L-estimators {{are that they}} are often extremely simple, and often <b>robust</b> statistics: assuming sorted data, they are very easy to calculate and interpret, and are often resistant to outliers. They thus are useful in <b>robust</b> statistics, as descriptive statistics, in statistics education, and when computation is difficult. However, they are inefficient, and in modern times <b>robust</b> statistics M-estimators are preferred, though these are much more difficult computationally. In many circumstances L-estimators are reasonably efficient, and thus adequate for initial estimation.|$|E
