25|$|The {{evening of}} June 2, Truman called {{a meeting of}} his top advisors to discuss what to do. Attending the meeting were Attorney-General James P. McGranery, who had been {{confirmed}} by the Senate on May 20; Solicitor General Philip Perlman; Secretary of Defense Robert A. Lovett; White House Counsel Charles S. Murphy; Press Secretary Joseph Short; Steelman and Sawyer. The group discussed invoking Taft-Hartley, but felt that the union would <b>resent</b> <b>it</b> and that the law would do little to end the strike.|$|E
500|$|Borah was not {{personally}} harmed by {{the stock market}} crash of October 1929, having sold any stocks and invested in government bonds. [...] Thousands of Americans had borrowed on margin, and were ruined by the crash. [...] Congress in June 1930 passed the Hawley–Smoot Tariff, [...] sharply increasing rates on imports. [...] Borah was one of 12 Republicans who joined Democrats in opposing the bill, which passed the Senate 44–42. Borah was up for election in 1930, and despite a minimal campaign effort, took over 70percent of the vote in a bad year for Republicans. When he returned to Washington for the lame-duck session of the Senate beginning in December, Borah pressed the passage of legislation that would help business and suggested that members of Congress turn back their salary to the Treasury. The economy continued to worsen in the winter of 1931, and Borah urged relief legislation, stating that opponents argued [...] "that for the Government to feed this woman and her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her. [...] Does anyone believe it? It is a cowardly imputation on the helpless. [...] I <b>resent</b> <b>it</b> and I repudiate it." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of Brownlee's appointment, the UGG was embroiled in an income tax dispute. [...] Though the farmers' {{movement}} had generally supported the 1917 introduction of income tax, as rates climbed the UGG began to <b>resent</b> <b>it,</b> especially given that the pools were exempt. [...] While the rationale for this exemption—that the pools were agents of their members, and that any income should therefore be taxed as personal income once disbursed, and not as corporate income pre-disbursal—was initially accepted, the UGG argued that the pools' 1931 reorganization eliminated the differences {{between them and the}} UGG, and that the exemption thus put the UGG at a competitive disadvantage. [...] In 1941, Brownlee travelled to Ottawa to express the UGG's case; there he collaborated with O. M. Biggar, representing the private grain companies {{in the form of the}} North-West Line Elevators Association (NLEA), who also objected to the pools' exemption, on a joint brief to the Minister of National Revenue. [...] The government ruled that the pools were taxable; the pools appealed to the Exchequer Court, which found in the government's favour in 1943. [...] By this time, the government had agreed not to tax the pools for pre-1941 revenue and to grant generous exemptions on taxation thereafter.|$|E

60|$|PYGMALION. They are sensations. When {{the rays}} of light enter their eyes and make a picture on their retinas, their brains become {{conscious}} of the picture and they act accordingly. When the waves of sound started by your speaking enter their ears and record a disparaging remark on their keyboards, their brains become conscious of the disparagement and <b>resent</b> <b>it</b> accordingly. If you did not disparage them they would not <b>resent</b> <b>it.</b> They are merely responding to a stimulus.|$|E
