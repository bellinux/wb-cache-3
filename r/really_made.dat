5|$|Officials from Trinidad and Tobago {{reported}} that Joyce made landfall in that country. The National Hurricane Center differs, not attributing any landfall to Joyce. If Joyce <b>really</b> <b>made</b> landfall on Tobago, {{it would have}} been the first tropical storm to do so since 1990's Arthur. In addition, Joyce moved south of west for a time at a location where it is rare for tropical cyclones to do so.|$|E

His teammate Jackie McGlew claimed Pollock could have made an outstanding bowler—"He bowled right {{over the top and}} <b>really</b> <b>made</b> the ball 'fizz'"—but he bowled mainly for enjoyment and with a light heart. In total, he took 4 Test wickets and 43 in first-class cricket. He was also a naturally gifted fielder.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{calls to}} hire Joe Paterno or another successful college coach, the Giants settled on Ray Perkins, then an assistant for the San Diego Chargers, to replace McVay. While Perkins {{was able to}} follow the Eagles' lead and build a team that eventually made the playoffs in 1981, the moves that <b>really</b> <b>made</b> a difference for the Giants drew less attention that off-season.|$|E
25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and I really wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that <b>really</b> <b>made</b> the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E

25|$|The {{great success}} of Reese on Play (an {{outstanding}} guide to dummy play and defence) {{was followed by}} an even more ambitious work. The Expert Game was the book which <b>really</b> <b>made</b> his name. As the title suggests, it dealt with card play at the highest level, including some ideas that were novel at the time, for instance, inferences from events that did not occur, and the principle of restricted choice. Examples of bridge logic abound in Reese, for instance, a player who overcalls but does not lead his suit is likely to lack one or two key honours; this concept is often called 'the dog that did not bark in the night' (after Sherlock Holmes in Arthur Conan Doyle's Silver Blaze). Another form of logic {{can be seen in}} 'If it must be so, assume it is so'. His examples of counting (and other ways of drawing inferences from the bidding and play) spread such ideas from a coterie of masters in London (or New York) to a much wider group of nascent experts. For at least twenty years after this book was published, one could be sure that virtually every top-class player had studied it minutely.|$|E

Co-writer Morgan also praises it as a script he is proud of. Director Nutter says of the episode, [...] "I think it's the most accomplished piece of directing of actors I've been able to do ... I think this episode <b>really</b> <b>made</b> a difference in how the audience looks at Scully. I think it brought a lot of dimension to her character and for her person it definitely had a lot of impact." ...|$|E

He added that the game's primary task was staying alive since almost everyone other than the pedestrians and teammates are against the Saints. Andrew acknowledged {{the limitations of the}} top-down view on mobile and thought that the developers did the best job possible considering their platform's limitations, but asked, [...] "Is a game like Saints Row <b>really</b> <b>made</b> for your mobile?" ...|$|E

Van Sant knew Flea due to the bassist's role in his 1991 film My Own Private Idaho. The members of the band respected Van Sant both {{as a person and}} an artist, and were elated when he agreed to direct the video for [...] "Under the Bridge".

5000|$|Another Zhuangzi chapter {{describes}} breathing meditation {{that results}} in a body [...] "like withered wood" [...] and a mind [...] "like dead ashes".Sir Motley of Southurb sat leaning against his low table. He looked up to heaven and exhaled slowly. Disembodied, he seemed bereft of soul. Sir Wanderer of Countenance Complete, who stood in attendance before him, asked, [...] "How can we explain this?

500|$|According to Taylor's recollection, he {{was visiting}} McCartney {{at his home}} in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the {{instrument}} and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: [...] "And so it went – black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye." [...] Taylor later reflected: [...] "I've no memory at all of the tune... I wonder whether Paul <b>really</b> <b>made</b> up [...] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. IGN reporter Robert Canning gave the episode a 7.7/10 rating ("Good"), commenting that [...] "what <b>really</b> <b>made</b> me enjoy 'The Great Wife Hope' were the peripheral bits, characters and jokes outside the main storyline. There were many, {{and they were}} funny." [...] Canning wrote that the weakest part about the episode was the underdevelopment of Englebrit, but that [...] "there were plenty of other things squeezed in around this bout to make the episode an enjoyable watch"—these included Ralph Wiggum {{being used as a}} bell for Bart and Nelson's fight, Nelson wanting to be an event planner, and Carl's line about not knowing all African Americans in the world simply because he is one himself.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, Attanasio, Levinson and Fontana wanted the {{dialogue}} {{to reflect the}} kinds of things detectives would talk about when not discussing murders or cases, which led to the inclusion of several scenes in which detectives talk casually among themselves during lunch or around the office. Fontana, who compared the scenes to Levinson's 1982 film Diner, said, [...] "That <b>really</b> <b>made</b> the show different from other shows, because we had the room to have conversations that seemingly didn't (storywise) connect anything, but they did reveal a lot about the characters." [...] Levinson specifically asked that the body by Howard and Felton be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other police dramas did not portray corpses in a realistic way.|$|E
500|$|Kathy Baker saw {{her part}} of Joyce, the {{neighbor}} {{who tries to}} seduce Edward, as a perfect chance to break into comedy. Alan Arkin says when he first read the script, he was [...] "a bit baffled. Nothing <b>really</b> <b>made</b> sense to me until I saw the sets. Burton's visual imagination is extraordinary". The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price's films as a child, and, after completing Vincent, the two became good friends. Robert Oliveri was cast as Kevin, Kim's younger brother. Nick Carter from The Backstreet Boys plays an uncredited role as the blond boy playing on the Slip 'n Slide as Edward rides in Peg's car through suburbia.|$|E

[...] When reviewing the final scene, Marsi commended the appearance of the positive pregnancy test to the audience, calling the it [...] "Quite the cliffhanger to leave us with after a finale that was already pretty darn entertaining.
