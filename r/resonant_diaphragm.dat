40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} driving ability {{of gas and}} light fluid which is {{sensitive}} to the temperature change, based on the system resonant principle a novel kind of piezoelectric <b>resonant</b> <b>diaphragm</b> air pump has been proposed. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} maximum flow rate is 1650 ml/min when the sinusoidal AC driving voltage is 200 v, the vibrating spring thickness is 0. 6 mm, the adjusting spring thickness is 1. 4 mm, and it was 0. 5 as the radius ratio of the rigidity transfer vibration piston and the diaphragm...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of measuring pressure {{by means of}} a <b>resonant</b> <b>diaphragm</b> has been studied. An oscillator consisting of an integrated amplifier with a piezoelectrically driven diaphragm in its feedback loop has been built. The oscillator frequency is accurately proportional to the square of the pressure in the range of 60 to 130 Torr. The frequency range is 1324 to 1336 Hz (this range being limited by a spurious mode which could be suppressed by better processing) for a 25 mm diameter diaphragm made of a silicon wafer and with PZT ceramics as driver and receptor. We have made an integrated version (1 × 1 mm 2) of a square <b>resonant</b> <b>diaphragm</b> pressure guage by selective etching of (1 0 0) planes with ethylenediamine. The piezoelectric driving materials was sputtered zinc oxide. A driver was deposited midway between the bending point and the point of greatest curvature. A receptor was located at a symmetrical position to give a optimum transfer condition. The integrated current amplifier had a low impedance differential input stage, two gain cells and a high impedance output stage. These electrical conditions ensured maximum elastic freedom of the diaphragm. A digital circuit in I 2 L technology has been designed and made with eight-bit parallel read out of the frequency. This circuit may be directly connected to a microprocessor. The whole system contains the sensor chip, the analog amplifier chip and the digital chip, all in compatible technology. ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantage}} of the ribbon microphone when introduced was that the light ribbon had a much higher natural <b>resonant</b> frequency than <b>diaphragms</b> in existing microphones, above hearing range, so it had flatter response at high frequencies. [...] The voltage output of older ribbon microphones is typically quite low compared to a dynamic moving coil microphone, and a step-up transformer is used to increase the voltage output and increase the output impedance. Modern ribbon microphones do not suffer from this problem due to improved magnets and more efficient transformers and have output levels that can exceed typical stage dynamic microphones.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the output {{capacity}} of a piezoelectric pump when transferring gas, this paper presents a compact <b>resonant</b> piezoelectric <b>diaphragm</b> pump (hereinafter {{referred to as the}} piezoelectric diaphragm pump), which is driven by a rectangular piezoelectric vibrator. The compact structure can effectively release the vibrating constraints of the vibrator, and enlarge its center output displacement, so as to increase the volume change rate of the pump chamber. Based on the structure and the working principle of this piezoelectric diaphragm pump, a dynamic model for the diaphragm system is established in this paper, and an analysis on factors affecting the resonant frequency of the system is then conducted. We tested on the prototype under the driving voltage of 260 Vpp. The results show that the diaphragm system reaches resonance under the driving frequency of 265 Hz, which is very close to the fundamental frequency of check valve. Compared with the rectangular piezoelectric vibrator’s amplitude, the diaphragm’s amplitude is double amplified. At this time, the piezoelectric diaphragm pump achieves the maximum gas flow rate as 186. 8 mL/min and the maximum output pressure as 56. 7 kPa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{phased array}} {{measurement}} technique is proposed for high resolution and ghost-suppressive measurement {{based on a}} synthesized directivity pattern using multiple frequencies. Tunable resonant-type piezoelectric ultrasonic microsensors {{have been developed for}} the measurement technique. The ultrasonic sensor consists of a silicon-micromachined diaphragm structure and a piezoelectric PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3) capacitor on it. The capacitor has inner and outer top electrodes; the inner electrode for ultrasonic sensing, and the outer electrode for resonant frequency tuning through converse-piezoelectrically induced stress by applying external dc voltage. Two kinds of fabrication process have been developed to make flat and deflected <b>diaphragms.</b> <b>Resonant</b> frequency has increased nearly twice on the flat diaphragm and decreased to a half on the deflected diaphragm under a bias voltage application in the range of ± 8 V...|$|R
40|$|Thermofluids {{experiments}} {{often require}} the use of fast-response pressure transducers that maintain their accuracy over a wide range of operating temperatures. Existing pressure sensing technologies are available which suit these demanding applications, however these transducers are usually relatively expensive. This project investigates the use of inexpensive piezoresistive pressure transducers in the measurement of transient fluid pressures. A temperature compensation routine was developed which improved the accuracy of the piezoresistive pressure transducers over a substantial range of operating temperatures. A dynamic response analysis indicated that the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>resonant</b> frequency of these sensors was 246. 7 kHz (without the addition of latex or grease) and that the response times could be improved from approximately 12. 5 'ms' to 0. 38 'ms' with simple case modifications. These results demonstrated the suitability of piezoresistive pressure transducers for use in fast-response thermofluids experiments. A piezoresistive pressure transducer produced very similar results to a piezoelectric sensor when both devices were tested simultaneously in the USQ Gun Tunnel. This indicated that the piezoresistive sensor was capable of accurately recording rapid fluctuations in pressure levels. The cylinder pressures of an internal combustion engine recorded by a piezoresistive and piezoelectric sensor also compared well. The high operational temperatures of the engine verified the success of the piezoresistive sensor temperature compensation routine...|$|R
