40|$|Diafenthiuron is an {{effective}} insecticide used for pest management in cardamom. <b>Residues</b> <b>of</b> <b>diafenthiuron</b> and its degradation/dissipation pattern in cardamom were determined to work out safe waiting period. Samples were collected after three sprays of diafenthiuron @ 400 and 800 [*]g[*]a. i[*]ha− 1 and the residues extracted in acetonitrile and quantified in normal phase HPLC in UV detector. Diafenthiuron was detected in 6. 61 ± 0. 1 [*]min. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were determined to be 0. 01 and 0. 05 [*]μgmL− 1. The initial deposits {{were found to be}} 3. 82 and 4. 10 [*]μg[*]g− 1 after sprays of diafenthiuron @ 400 [*]g[*]a. i[*]ha− 1 in the first and second experiments, respectively. Nearly cent percent of residues dissipated at 10 days after treatment in the recommended dose of diafenthiuron 400 [*]g[*]a. i[*]ha− 1 and the half life varied from 2. 0 to 2. 8 days with a waiting period of 5. 5 to 6. 7 days in green capsules of cardamom. The waiting period was 5. 4 to 7. 0 days in cured capsules of cardamom. With harvest being the focal point for enforcement of residue tolerances, the suggested waiting period of seven days is safe without the problem of pesticide residues in harvestable produce...|$|E

For differential pulse voltammetry detection limit was found to be 1, 5 * 10 - 5 mol/l and quantification limit was found to be 5 * 10 - 5 mol/l.

Pertencem à tribo Attini e cultivam um fungo simbionte utilizado como alimento, a qual é considerada uma grande comunidade microbiana. Entretanto, estudos sobre o efeito da aplicação de ingredientes ativos em operárias isoladas e colônias de A. sexdens rubropilosa têm sido frequentes, mas não tem apresentado resultados satisfatórios para serem empregados no controle destes insetos. Sendo assim, o trabalho teve como objetivos: (1) avaliar o efeito de ingredientes ativos de formicidas comerciais sobre a micota de A. sexdens rubropilosa; (2) avaliar a toxicidade tópica de novos ingredientes ativos em operárias de A. sexdens rubropilosa; (3) avaliar a mortalidade de operárias de A. sexdens rubropilosa após o processo de fotólise de diafentiuron; (4) avaliar o efeito de diafentiuron adicionado em isca granulada após o processo de fotólise em colônias de A. sexdens rubropilosa. Foram utilizadas colônias de laboratório submetidas aos diferentes experimentos com aplicação de ingredientes ativos. Desta forma, obtiveram-se os seguintes resultados: (1) houve prevalência do fungo simbionte, demostrando que não ocorre o sinergismo quando se aplica isca formicida; (2) diafentiuron apresentou ação tópica retardada, mostrando-se um ingrediente ativo promissor para iscas tóxicas; (3) após o processo de fotólise, diafentiuron apresentou mortalidade de operárias acima de 80 % entre o terceiro e quinto dia após a aplicação; (4) tratamentos contendo diafentiuron (2 h e 6 h) conseguiram reduzir o corte de folhas e a massa do jardim de fungo, mas não levaram as colônias de A. sexdens rubropilosa à morteLeaf-cutting ants {{are social}} insects of {{agricultural}} importance {{due to its}} damaging attack to the various production systems.

However, studies {{on the effect of}} active ingredients in isolated workers and colonies of A. sexdens rubropilosa have been frequent, but have not shown satisfactory results to be used to control these insects. Thus, the study aimed to: (1) evaluate the effect of active ingredients of formicides commercials on the mycota of A. sexdens rubropilosa, (2) evaluate the toxicity of new active topical ingredients on workers of A. sexdens rubropilosa, (3) evaluate the mortality of A. sexdens rubropilosa workers after the process <b>of</b> photolysis <b>of</b> <b>diafenthiuron,</b> (4) evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>diafenthiuron</b> added to granulated bait after the process of photolysis in A. sexdens rubropilosa colonies.

Thus, the following results were obtained: (1) there was prevalence of symbiotic fungus, demonstrating that no synergism occurs when applying formicidal bait; (2) diafenthiuron showed topical delayed action, showing a promising active ingredient for toxic baits; (3) after the process <b>of</b> photolysis, <b>diafenthiuron</b> show mortality <b>of</b> workers above 80 % between the third and fifth day after application; (4) treatments containing diafenthiuron (2 and 6 h) managed to reduce the cutting leaves and mass of the fungus garden, but led the colonies of A. sexdens rubropilosa to deat...|$|R

The respective LC 50 -values of diflubenzuron via ingestion and residual contact were 229. 9 and 391. 1 mg a. i. /l. Diafenthiuron did not cause significant mortality to fifth-instar nymphs and adults via ingestion but was toxic by residual contact with LC 50 -values of 329. 4 mg a. i. /l and 125. 9 mg a. i. /l for nymphs and adults respectively.

The correct structure of proinsulin is crucial for the correct folding of mature insulin, as {{the placement of the}} C peptide sets the molecule up to create correctly positioned disulfide bonds in and between the A and B chains.
