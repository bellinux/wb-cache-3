Furthermore, fosfomycin <b>resistance</b> <b>plasmids</b> did not confer on E. coli cells resistance to the novel antibiotic FR- 31564, which is incorporated by the same transport systems as fosfomycin.

40|$|Plasmids {{allow the}} {{movement}} of genetic material, including antimicrobial resistance genes, between bacterial species and genera. They frequently mediate resistance to multiple antimicrobials and can result in the acquisition by a pathogen of resistance to all or most clinically relevant antimicrobials. Unfortunately, there are still large gaps {{in our understanding of}} how new multi-resistance plasmids evolve. Five Australian clinical institutions collaborated in this study of multi-resistance plasmids in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli. We characterized 72 <b>resistance</b> <b>plasmids</b> in terms of the antimicrobial resistance profile they conferred, their size and their incompatibility group. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms were used to determine the genetic relationships between the plasmids. Relationships between the host cells were determined using multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis. A lack of correlation between the evolutionary history of the host cells and their plasmids suggests that the horizontal transfer of <b>resistance</b> <b>plasmids</b> between strains of E. coli is common. The <b>resistance</b> <b>plasmids</b> were very diverse, {{with a wide range of}} resistance profiles and a lack of discrete evolutionary lineages.

40|$|Thirty three {{penicillinase}} producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) and 152 non-PPNG strains were serologically classified {{in relation}} to their patterns of resistance to antimicrobials, nutritional requirements (auxotypes), and plasmid contents. Of the 185 strains, 65 (35 %) belonged to the WI and 120 (65 %) to the WII/III serogroup, the predominant serovars of which were Arost and Bropt, respectively. Associations between serotype and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, auxotype, and plasmid content were observed. Of the 152 non-PPNG strains, 112 (74 %) belonged to serogroup WI. The WI non-PPNG strains were more sensitive to penicillin, thiamphenicol, tetracycline, and cefotaxime than the WII/III non-PPNG strains. Auxotyping and serogrouping the strains showed no differentiation other than that arginine, hypoxanthine, and uracil dependent (AHU-) strains belonged to serogroup WI. The proline, citrulline, and uracil dependent (PCU-) strains belonged, as expected, to serogroup WII/III. Analysing the 33 PPNG strains showed that of 21 carrying the 4. 5 megadalton (Asian type) penicillin <b>resistance</b> <b>plasmid,</b> 17 (81 %) belonged to serogroup WI, with serovar Arst predominating, and only four (19 %) to serogroup WII/III.
