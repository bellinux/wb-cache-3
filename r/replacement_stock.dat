25|$|Female calves {{born on a}} {{dairy farm}} will {{typically}} be raised as <b>replacement</b> <b>stock</b> {{to take the place}} of older cows that are no longer sufficiently productive. The life of a dairy cow is a cycle of pregnancy and lactation starting at puberty. Obviously the timing of these events is very important to the production capacity of the dairy. A cow will not produce milk until she has given birth to a calf. Consequently timing of the first breeding as well as all the subsequent breeding is important for maintaining milk production levels.|$|E

50|$|Despite its self-oxidizing hazards, nitrate {{is still}} {{regarded}} highly {{as the stock}} is more transparent than <b>replacement</b> <b>stocks,</b> and older films used denser silver in the emulsion. The combination results in a notably more luminous image with a high contrast ratio.|$|R

2500|$|All {{transmissible}} livestock diseases can be mitigated by generic good husbandry practices.

50|$|After a sale is {{identified}} as a wash sale and if the <b>replacement</b> <b>stock</b> is bought within 30 days {{before or after the}} sale then the wash sale loss is added to the basis of the <b>replacement</b> <b>stock.</b> The basis adjustment is important as it preserves the benefit of the disallowed loss; the holder receives that benefit on a future sale of the <b>replacement</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
50|$|Note: The {{identification}} of a wash sale and adjusting {{the basis of the}} <b>replacement</b> <b>stock</b> is an iterative process. Thus, the sale of the <b>replacement</b> <b>stock</b> (after its basis is adjusted) can also be identified as a wash sale if it meets the above criteria.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to know the version of the 682 in question, as the wood components from a current narrow 682/686/687 inches, 38.7 mm will not fit on an older S682 wide receiver inches, 40.3 mm shotgun; <b>replacement</b> <b>stocks</b> for wide 682 shotguns need to be custom made at this point. Other than serial number lookup for production year, measurement of the frame size is the width measured in front of the breech across the recoil shoulders.|$|R

50|$|Example: You've held {{shares of}} XYZ for 10 years. You sell it {{at a loss}} but then buy it back within the wash sale period. When you sell the <b>replacement</b> <b>stock,</b> your gain or loss will be long-term—no matter how soon you sell it.|$|E
40|$|A fish {{hatchery}} operation that rears brood fish for eggs, <b>replacement</b> <b>stocks,</b> and fish for stocking {{is more complex}} than an operation which produces only fish for stocking. A combination broodstock-production hatchery may have many species of fish, comprised of many year classes. The placement of various species and sizes of fish within the hatchery system can be of major importance because of water quality demands, possible disease transmittal, and the volume of waste generated. All salmonids, large and small, require water that is high in oxygen, moder-ate in temperatures, and low in metabolic waste levels (Laio, 1971). Small fish and adult fish generally do not tax water quality as much as fish approaching release or market size because of the lower densities (in kilograms per cubic foot) involved. Among species, fish have different requirements for water quality. Brook trout cannot tolerate poor water conditions, rainbows are more tolerant and brown trout are the most tolerant. As fish size increases, so does their tolerance for “used ” water. However, attempts to rear broodstock in re-use...|$|R
5000|$|Of note, in the 1960s, the 6BK11 Triple Triode Compactron tube {{was used}} by the Ampeg {{amplifier}} company in some of their guitar amps. Ampeg is the only guitar amp manufacturer that used this tube in their amps. The 6BK11 is in increasingly short supply today as an NOS <b>replacement</b> for <b>stock</b> tubes. NOS tubes are very important in guitar amps because they keep the amp performing as it was designed, which means it will produce the desired tone. There is a whole [...] "cottage industry" [...] that exists in producing vacuum tubes that are <b>replacements</b> for <b>stock</b> guitar amp tubes. The cottage industry exists because class A, open-ended, hand-wired, tube-driven guitar amps have a warm sound that is preferred by many musicians. The warmer sound of older amps means they command a premium resale value on the open market, and so in turn, any parts in the amp that may wear out over time or with use (including the vacuum tubes), also command similar values. The 6BK11 {{is a good example of}} this.|$|R

40|$|Two {{important}} {{classes of}} problems encountered by {{industry and government}} are those dealing with replacement policies and ordering policies. These problems are usually treated separately. A particular model which treats the <b>replacement</b> and <b>stocking</b> problems as one is considered in this paper.

In attaining the optimal policy, this structure is exploited so that an optimal policy can be obtained in {{a finite number of}} steps. ...|$|R
