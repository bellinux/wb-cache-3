40|$|The use {{of modern}} control theory to produce an {{electrical}} motor simulation of a Formula 1, Grand Pnx, passive motorcycle front suspension shock absorber is investigated. It is shown, using a test-rig comprising two permanent magnet DC motors directly coupled, that desired shock absorber responses to load forces can be achieved using model reference control. The controller feedback in this test rig is provided via a high resolution <b>rotary</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor.</b> A stochastic Kalman filter is used to produce estimates of the load(disturbance), force and velocity from this position information. All states are then used in the controller. A mass, spring and damper model is chosen as a suitable representation of a shock absorber, and is assumed sufficiently complex to justify the control techniques used. This linear model is translated using mathematical techniques into a rotary equivalent that is compatible {{for use in the}} controller. This translation takes into account thermal effects, as well as kinematic requirements encountered by the motor on the basis of load-force data taken from the front suspension of a Formula 1 motorcycle in race conditions.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{reported in this}} thesis addresses the improvement of both rotor position sensored and sensorless Field Oriented Control (FOC) of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSM) intended for Electric Vehicle (EV) propulsion applications. Three main contributions have been done on this subject. The details of each of them are given below. The first contribution {{is the development of}} a novel algorithm based on polynomial approximations (PA) for an efficient position error compensation of magnetic analog encoders (MAE) used in PMSMs for EV traction. The proposed PA algorithm requires a negligible memory space compared to a very high-resolution look-up table (LUT). The use of polynomials allows compensating every possible input rotor position without carrying out an interpolation or a rounding to the nearest quantized value. Advantageously, the polynomial coefficients are deduced from a calibration procedure that does not require an accurate and high-resolution position sensor for comparison and error-calculation purposes. The PA algorithm has been implemented to work in real time on a TM 4 EV drive controlling an 80 kW PMSM. The performance of the algorithm has been validated at 6000 and 9000 r/min under + 85 and ± 55 Nm of torque, respectively. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) effects have been minimized using a type- 2 phase-locked loop (PLL). The proposed PA algorithm assisted with the PLL is capable of reducing the total position error to a range as small as ± 0. 2 mechanical degrees. This error has been measured under steady state conditions. However, the transients from the PMSM operation do not deteriorate the achieved compensation given that the only parameters input to the PA algorithm are the voltage samples of the sine and cosine signals from the uncompensated encoder and they are independent of the operating point of the machine. The combination of the PA algorithm and the type- 2 PLL is a promising solution for compensating the position error from low-cost MAEs, thus allowing to achieve high-performance field-oriented control of PMSMs in EV applications. The characteristics of this high-performance PMSM-drive are the development of 1) Average torque with a small plausibility range for reducing the torque variation 2) Maximum torque with optimal stator currents to avoid wasting the energy from the battery and thereby extending the vehicle autonomy and 3) Small torque ripple generation for maximizing the torque-speed curve. By reducing the torque oscillations, the voltage ripple produced in the DC bus becomes smaller and the defluxing current variations are reduced, thus the DC bus voltage percentage utilization is increased and the based speed as well as the maximum operating speed are also extended. The higher the accuracy of the rotor position sensor, the lower the voltage, current and torque ripples and hence the closer to the full capacity and optimal operation of the machine-drive. The second contribution is the modeling and the analysis of the effects from the rotor position error in the performance of FOC-PMSMs for EV applications. A special focus is given to the torque ripple generated along the characteristic trajectories in the different operating regions of the PMSM. An extended and generalized model of the torque ripple produced by the PMSM {{as a function of the}} rotor position error has been analytically deduced. An infinite-speed interior-(I) PMSM drive and a finite-speed surface-mounted (SM) -PMSM drive are considered for the simulations carried out in MATLABSimPowerSystems. The experimental results have been validated with a TM 4 EV drive controlling an 80 kW SM-PMSM. The torque ripple has been evaluated for both motoring and regenerative braking operation modes under maximum torque conditions varying from 100 Nm at 1000 r/min up to 55 Nm at 9000 r/min. The obtained simulation and experimental results demonstrate the good accuracy of the proposed model for evaluating the torque ripple produced in PMSMs due to the error from the rotor position sensor. The simulation and experimental results obtained from the time- and frequency- domain analysis show that the influence of the rotor position error in the torque ripple generation is much significant than other causes such as the current sensor inaccuracy, the finite word-length (FWL) effect, the finite PWM resolution, the PWM switching, the inverter dead-time, the asymmetric stator phase resistance, the cogging effect, and the nonsinusoidal air-gap flux density. The compensation of the error from the <b>rotary</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> mounted on the 80 kW SMPMSM from TM 4 allowed reducing the equivalent torque ripple percentage to an interval between 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a representation of}} a low-cost rigid-frame exoskeleton glove {{that is used to}} track finger-joint flexion mapped onto a robotic hand to mimic user movements. The overall setup consists of an exoskeleton glove (exo-glove), sensors, a microcontroller, and a telerobotic hand. The design of the exo-glove is crafted to fit onto a left hand. SolidWorks was used for the prototype designs which were then sent to the Stratasys 400 rapid prototyping machine to be 3 D printed in ABS-M 30 plastic. The exo-glove houses five <b>rotary</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> and three flexible sensors to track angle changes of the finger joints from two fingers and a thumb. Five low-pass filters are implemented as signal filtering for the <b>rotary</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors.</b> An Arduino Mega microcontroller is connected to the sensors of the exo-glove and processes the input values. Using an open-loop controller to control the robotic hand, the values processed by the microcontroller from the exo-glove are sent to the servo motors on the robotic hand to operate the corresponding fingers of the user. Throughout the initial calibration and testing phase, each sensor was tested individually to ensure the sensor functionally performs well. Signal analysis was conducted on the sensors at steady state and while in operation to show fluctuations in sensor readings and response to finger flexion. Experimental results show that averaging sensor data in the processing code yields smoother values and better precision. Due to the use of low-pass filtering with the <b>rotary</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors,</b> the data sets collected were grouped together tightly compared to the flex sensors without filtering. However, the actual angles measured were not accurately portrayed in sensor readings. The true flexion angles were compared in the data samplings to find a variety of ranges spanning around the angles desired to track. Many of the actual flexion angles were offset from the sensor readings by a variation of degrees, but the data shows the sensor readings were able to follow the general magnitude of the true flexion angles. The precision seen in the data was also apparent in the robotic hand mirroring the posture. Changes in sensor readings caused jerking movements to occur in the robotic fingers but were able to maintain an overall flexion mirroring of the RF exo-glove. There is quarter-second delay between the exo-glove sensor reading and the robotic hand mirroring capability when not implementing averaging. When averaging the sensor values, there was a delay of more than half a second between the exo-glove posture and robotic hand mirroring...|$|R
