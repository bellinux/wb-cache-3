50|$|The amplified mode {{will differ}} {{depending}} on the spin direction, which explains the rattleback's asymmetrical behavior. Depending on whether it is rather a pitching or <b>rolling</b> <b>instability</b> that dominates, the growth rate will be very high or quite low.|$|E
5000|$|This {{explains}} why, due to friction, most rattlebacks {{appear to}} exhibit spin-reversal motion only when spun in the pitching-unstable direction, {{also known as}} the strong reversal direction. When the rattleback is spun in the [...] "stable direction", {{also known as the}} weak reversal direction, friction and damping often slow the rattleback to a stop before the <b>rolling</b> <b>instability</b> has time to fully build. Some rattlebacks, however, exhibit [...] "unstable behavior" [...] when spun in either direction, and incur several successive spin reversals per spin.|$|E
40|$|In {{three-roll}} planetary rolling process, {{there is}} secondary torsion phenomenon {{that may lead}} to <b>rolling</b> <b>instability.</b> This article proposed a new idea to alleviate the secondary torsion phenomenon by dividing the secondary torsion segment out of the roll as an independent and passive one. To study the performance of the roll with passive segment, the three-dimensional finite element models of planetary rolling process using actual roll or new roll with passive segment involving elastic–plastic and thermal–mechanical coupling were established by the software ABAQUS/Explicit, and a series of analysis had been done successfully. The rolling temperature and rolling force of planetary mill were in good agreement with the measured results, which indicated that the finite element method would supply important reference merit for three-dimensional thermo-mechanical simulation of the three-roll planetary rolling process. Comparing the simulation results of the two models, the results indicated that the change in the roll structure had just a little influence on the metal deformation, temperature, and rolling force, but it lessened the secondary torsion deformation effectively and improved the outside roundness of the rolled tube slightly. The research provided a new idea for the roll design of three-roll planetary mill (PSW) ...|$|E
40|$|Fixed wing micro air {{vehicles}} (wingspan between 10 and 15 cm) are aerodynamically challenging {{due to the}} low Reynolds number regime (104 - 105) {{they operate}} in. The low aspect ratio wings (typically used to maximize area under a size constraint) promote strong tip vortices, and are susceptible to <b>rolling</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Wind gusts can be of the same order of magnitude as the flight speed (10 - 15 m/s). Standard control surfaces on an empennage must be eliminated for size considerations and drag reduction, {{and the range of}} stable center of gravity locations is only a few millimeters long. Membrane aeroelasticity has been identified as a tenable method to alleviate these issues: flexible wing structures with geometric twist (adaptive washout for gust rejection, delayed stall) and aerodynamic twist (adaptive inflation for high lift, larger stability margins) are both considered here. Recent investigations in static aeroelastic characterization, including flight loads, wing deformation, flow structures, aeroelastic-tailoring studies through laminate orientation, as well as unconventional techniques based on membrane pre-tension, are reviewed. Multi-objective optimization aimed at improving lift, drag, and pitching moment considerations is also discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{problem of}} the " tippe-top " has been {{discussed}} in several papers, one by Synge [1] makes the assumption of <b>rolling</b> and discovers <b>instability</b> when the axis is vertical with the peg up, but requires as a necessary condition that the top be not a solid of revolution. Since it appears {{that as far as}} is constructionally possible the top is axially symmetric, in which case th...|$|R
40|$|Magnetohydrodynamically induced {{interface}} {{instability in}} liquid metal batteries is analyzed. The batteries {{are represented by}} a simplified system {{in the form of}} a rectangular cell, in which strong vertical electric current flows through three horizontal layers: the layer of a heavy metal at the bottom, the layer of a light metal at the top, and the layer of electrolyte in the middle. A new two-dimensional nonlinear model based on the conservative shallow water approximation is derived and utilized in a numerical study. It is found that in the case of small density difference between the electrolyte and one of the metals, the instability closely resembles the <b>rolling</b> pad <b>instability</b> observed earlier in the aluminum reduction cells. When the two electrolyte-metal density differences are comparable, the dynamics of unstable systems is more complex and characterized by interaction between two nearly symmetric or antisymmetric interfacial waves...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{finite-element method}} (FEM) {{is used to}} develop the {{governing}} equation of motion of the working roll of a four-high rolling mill and to study its vibration due to different process parameters. The working roll is modeled as an Euler Bernoulli beam by taking beam elements with vertical displacement and slope as the nodal degrees-of-freedom in the finite-element formulation. The bearings {{at the ends of}} the working rolls are modeled using spring elements. To calculate the forces acting on the working roll, the interaction between the working roll and the backup roll is modeled by using the work roll submodel, and the interaction between the working roll and the sheet is modeled by using the roll bite submodel (Lin et al., 2003, "On Characteristics and Mechanism of <b>Rolling</b> <b>Instability</b> and Chatter," ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 125 (4), pp. 778 - 786). Nodal displacements and velocities are obtained by using the Newmark Beta method after solving the governing equation of motion of the working roll. The transient and steady-state variation of roll gap, exit thickness profile, exit stress, and sheet force {{along the length of the}} strip have been found for different bearing stiffnesses and widths of the strip. By using this model, one can predict the shape of the outcoming strip profile and exit stress variation which will be useful to avoid many defects, such as edge buckling or center buckling in rolling processes...|$|E
40|$|Shrinkage {{behavior}} and crack formation during firing {{have been investigated}} for Al 2 O 3 /Ce-TZP composites that have been fabricated by colloidal rolling and folding. These com-posites show improved sinterability and sinter isotropically after repeated <b>rolling.</b> Interface <b>instability</b> in <b>rolling</b> creates corrugated interfaces with large layer waviness; therefore, rolling can substantially alleviate the in-plane sintering constraints, which leads to improved sinterability. A loss of sintering anisotropy also is observed and is directly corre-lated to the microstructure instability, which is coincident with the laminate–cellular transition. Sintering cracks dur-ing heating and thermal cracks during cooling both are limited to the thick Ce-TZP layers in the composites. The critical layer thickness and the normalized crack spacing of the thermal cracks follow the predicted behavior of elastic-ity theory. Thus, crack-free, high-density Al 2 O 3 /Ce-TZP composites with either a laminate or cellular microstruc-ture can be obtained, with a layer thickness of 4 – 60 µm, via pressureless sintering.

40|$|A {{solution}} {{has been}} found to the long-standing problem of experimental modelling of the interfacial instability in aluminium reduction cells. The idea is to replace the electrolyte overlaying molten aluminium with a mesh of thin rods supplying current down directly into the liquid metal layer. This eliminates electrolysis altogether and all the problems associated with it, such as high temperature, chemical aggressiveness of media, products of electrolysis, the necessity for electrolyte renewal, high power demands, etc. The result is a room temperature, versatile laboratory model which simulates Sele-type, <b>rolling</b> pad interfacial <b>instability.</b> Our new, safe laboratory model enables detailed experimental investigations to test the existing theoretical models for the first time.
