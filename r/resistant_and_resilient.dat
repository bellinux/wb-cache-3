40|$|We {{investigated}} the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) diversity and enzyme activities in soils from the volcano, Mt. Etna (Sicily). The soils were at sites {{which have been}} developing for different periods of time and have formed in volcanic lava of differing ages that have been supplemented with volcanic ejecta from subsequent eruptions. However, the plant communities indicated a marked successional difference between the sites and we have used this {{as a proxy for}} developmental stage. We have compared the structural and functional properties of the microbial communities in soils from the two sites and tested experimentally the hypothesis that the more diverse community was more <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> <b>resilient</b> to disturbance. The experimental disturbance imposed was heating (60 C for 48 h) and the recovery of enzyme activities (b-glucosidase, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase) and structural properties (PLFA profiles) were then followed over six months. The microbial community in the soil from the older site was more structurally diverse and had a larger total PLFA concentration before disturbance than that of the soil from the younger site. The older soil community was not more <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> <b>resilient</b> following an environmental disturbance as the younger soil community was equally or more <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> <b>resilient</b> for all parameters. Changes in enzyme activities following disturbance were almost entirely attributable to changes in biomass (total PLFA) ...|$|E

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{is a major}} disturbance {{associated with}} logging, but we lack a fundamental understanding of how this affects the soil microbiome. We assessed the structural resistance and resilience of the microbiome using a high-throughput pyrosequencing approach in differently compacted soils at two forest sites and correlated these findings with changes in soil physical properties and functions. Alterations in soil porosity after compaction strongly limited the air and water conductivity. Compaction significantly reduced abundance, increased diversity, and persistently altered {{the structure of the}} microbiota. Fungi were less <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> <b>resilient</b> than bacteria; clayey soils were less <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> <b>resilient</b> than sandy soils. The strongest effects were observed in soils with unfavorable moisture conditions, where air and water conductivities dropped well below 10 % of their initial value. Maximum impact was observed around 6 - 12 months after compaction, and microbial communities showed resilience in lightly but not in severely compacted soils 4 years post disturbance. Bacteria capable of anaerobic respiration, including sulfate, sulfur, and metal reducers of the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, were significantly associated with compacted soils. Compaction detrimentally affected ectomycorrhizal species, whereas saprobic and parasitic fungi proportionally increased in compacted soils. Structural shifts in the microbiota were accompanied by significant changes in soil processes, resulting in reduced carbon dioxide, and increased methane and nitrous oxide emissions from compacted soils. This study demonstrates that physical soil disturbance during logging induces profound and long-lasting changes in the soil microbiome and associated soil functions, raising awareness regarding sustainable management of economically driven logging operations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} and function of alluvial Highly Dynamic River Systems (HDRS) are driven by highly variable hydrological disturbance regimes, <b>and</b> alternate between <b>resistant,</b> metastable states <b>and</b> <b>resilient,</b> transitional states. These are in turn subject to influences of feedback loops within hydrogeomorphic and biological processes. Here we consider how resistance and resilience largely determine HDRS ecosystem trajectories and how these characteristics can be modified by natural and anthropogenic processes. We review the mechanisms by which biodiversity can affect both resistance and resilience and introduce a conceptual framework that incorporates some unique HDRS characteristics. We suggest that <b>resilient</b> <b>and</b> <b>resistant</b> patterns frequently coexist in the active tract of these river systems, and that this coexistance promotes the return of metastable states after major disturbances. In contrast, highly <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> poorly <b>resilient</b> patterns dominate at their external boundaries. The loss of these natural dynamics resulting from direct and indirect human impacts causes deviations to resistance and resilience patterns and therefore to HDRS trajectory. We propose that understanding the role of interactions between biological and physical processes that control resistance and resilience is crucial for system restoration and management...|$|R

But risk reduction policies and measures need to be oriented towards resilience building and vulnerability reduction, that is, understanding what in our behavior makes us stronger or weaker in the effort to resist and reduce the impact of natural hazards. To a large extent the effort is about the construction techniques and the building locations where we chose (or are allowed to) build our houses, offices, schools, health centers, and infrastructure in general. The goal is to integrate risk reduction criteria and approaches in urban and land-use planning and environmental management to develop and enforce construction and building codes and zoning regulations.

40|$|This study {{integrated}} coastal watershed {{models and}} combined {{them with a}} risk assessment method to develop a methodology to investigate the impact resulting from coastal disasters under climate change. The mid-western coast of Taiwan suffering from land subsidence {{was selected as the}} demonstrative area for the vulnerability analysis based on the prediction of sea level rise (SLR), wave run-up, overtopping, and coastal flooding under the scenarios of the years from 2020 to 2039. Databases from tidal gauges and satellite images were used to analyze SLR using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). Extreme wave condition and storm surge were estimated by numerical simulation using the Wind Wave Model (WWM) and the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). Coastal inundation was then simulated via the WASH 123 D watershed model. The risk map of study areas based on the analyses of vulnerability and disaster were established using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique. Predictions of sea level rise, the maximum wave condition, and storm surge under the scenarios of 2020 to 2039 are presented. The results indicate that the sea level at the mid-western coast of Taiwan will rise by an average of 5. 8 cm, equivalent to a rising velocity of 2. 8 mm/year. The analysis indicates that the Wuqi, Lukang, Mailiao, and Taixi townships are susceptive, low <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> low <b>resilient</b> <b>and</b> reach the high-risk level.

30|$|While reconstructing {{historical}} {{forest structure}} is problematic (Stephenson 1999), recent analyses of inventories of productive ponderosa pine forests conducted in 1911 for trees ≥ 15.2 cm DBH near our study sites identified average stand densities of 72.7 trees ha− 1 and basal area of 21.5 m 2 ha− 1 (Collins et al. 2015). Using the same stem diameter range, our burned plots {{had an average}} stand density of 159 trees ha− 1 and average basal area of 74.0 m 2 ha− 1. These statistics suggest that, even after prescribed burning, our forests contain many more trees relative to estimates of historical averages.

Stress factors increase nutritional demands imposed on a tree, leading to initial destabilization of its functions, followed by normalization and improved resistance or resilience depending on the stress intensity and duration. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the optical variability in Norway spruce needle categories collected from primary and secondary shoots throughout juvenile (upper) and production (middle) functional crown parts of stress <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> stress <b>resilient</b> trees. Needles of three past generations were included into the analyses; however, spectral differences due to the leaf ageing were not statistically examined. The needle optical properties, i. e. hemispherical-directional reflectance, transmittance and absorption, of five defined needle categories were statistically tested for their quantitative and qualitative differences within the wavelength range from 505 - 800 nm. Spectral analyses were followed by laboratory measurements of needle pigment concentration (chlorophyll a+b and total carotenoids) and dry matter content.

Magnetite was particularly effective in stabilizing a build-up of propionic acid and therefore improving the process robustness and reliability. The enhanced biomethanation in terms of productivity and stability was attributed to the facilitated direct IET (DIET) between exoelectrogens and methanogens via magnetite particles.

30|$|It may be {{possible}} to eventually manage for drought <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> <b>resilient</b> forest structures. Such knowledge would provide a target when designing prescriptions using fire (perhaps in combination with mechanical thinning) under expected future climatic conditions. We currently do not know if prescribed fire prescriptions will need to be more aggressive to promote resistance and resilient to drought. If prescribed prescriptions do need to be more aggressive, how much and under what conditions? These are critical management concerns, as many regions in the western United States are expected to see increased frequency and intensity of both drought and wildfire (Littell et al. 2009, Williams et al. 2012, Cook et al. 2015). It may {{be possible}} that pre-scribed fire can serve as an adaptation tool for both of these threats, using existing resources and human capital. Yet many barriers exist to maintaining, let alone expanding, the deployment of prescribed fire, particularly logistical constraints and air quality concerns (Ryan et al. 2013). Our study also underscores the need to maintain plot-based forest monitoring networks, in both treated and untreated stands, to gauge the success of prescribed fire. Overcoming obstacles to the use of prescribed fire may prove crucial to the future integrity of western forests.|$|E
40|$|Copper (Cu) -polluted and unpolluted soils {{were used}} to study the effect of initial {{pollution}} on soil biological resistance and resilience by measuring the responses to perturbation using different parameters. Microbial biomass carbon, substrate-induced respiration and copy numbers of 16 S rRNA gene were grouped as general parameters, while potential ammonia oxidation rate and copy numbers of amoA gene were grouped as specific functions. In addition, to illustrate how initial pollution affects soil biological resistance and resilience following secondary perturbation, the microbial community structure, together with free Cu 2 + activities ([Cu 2 +]) in soil pore water and soil pH were also measured after secondary perturbation. Results showed that general parameters were more stable than specific ones. High [Cu 2 +] and low pH in soil pore water induced by Cu addition may lead to apparently low resistance and resilience, whereas {{the formation of a}} tolerant community after Cu pollution, secondary perturbation and Cu aging may contribute to resistance and resilience. Analysis of the phospholipid fatty acids profile showed that microbial community structure shifted along with the [Cu 2 +] gradient.

Second, we built and used a line source plume model to trace chemical plumes released by a slow-moving freight train that could impact rail passengers, as well as people in surrounding areas. Third, we crafted an economic simulation model that estimates the regional economic consequences of a variety of rail-related hazard events through the year 2020.

Channel areas between islands were severely damaged. Areas with steep reef slopes were damaged by sand slides or coral collapse more than areas with low slopes. Massive, sub-massive, and encrusting corals were more <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> <b>resilient</b> to the direct impact of the tsunami than branching, tabulate, and foliose life forms whereas the latter were more tolerant of temporary coverage by sand.

Low turbidity, lack of pollution, and mild currents possibly contributed to rapid recovery and limited long-term effects of the tsunami. Impact assessment shortly after a major disturbance may give an initial measure of damage but subsequent surveys must be undertaken to identify long-term effects.

40|$|More diverse {{communities}} {{are thought to}} be more stable—the diversity–stability hypothesis—due to increased resistance to and recovery from disturbances. For example, high diversity can make the presence of resilient or fast growing species and key facilitations among species more likely. How natural, geographic biodiversity patterns and changes in biodiversity due to human activities mediate community level disturbance dynamics is largely unknown, especially in diverse systems. For example, few studies have explored the role of diversity in tropical marine communities, especially at large scales. We tested the diversity–stability hypothesis by asking whether coral richness is related to resistance to and recovery from disturbances including storms, predator outbreaks, and coral bleaching on tropical coral reefs. We synthesized the results of 41 field studies conducted on 82 reefs, documenting changes in coral cover due to disturbance, across a global gradient of coral richness. Our results indicate that coral reefs in more species-rich regions were marginally less resistant to disturbance and did not recover more quickly. Coral community resistance was also highly dependent on pre-disturbance coral cover, probably {{due in part to the}} sensitivity of fast-growing and often dominant plating acroporid corals to disturbance. Our results suggest that coral communities in biodiverse regions, such as the western Pacific, may not be more <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> <b>resilient</b> to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Further analyses controlling for disturbance intensity and other drivers of coral loss and recovery could improve our understanding of the influence of diversity on community stability in coral reef ecosystems...|$|E

The evolution of the community physiognomy, composition and diversity were monitored after shrub clearing followed by biomass removal, deposition on soil surface and incorporation with the soil, over a 9 -year period. Maximum shrub density was recorded {{in the first year}} after the disturbances, excepting in mulched plots which showed the greatest number of individuals 1 year later. The increment of shrub leaf biomass was very fast in the first 3 years, whereas wood production was slower but occurred along the whole study period. At the end of the study, leaf and wood biomass was still significantly lower than in the predisturbance situation. The variation pattern of leaf area index was similar to that of leaf biomass. The evolution of total plant cover and diversity was similar across treatments. The highest species richness and diversity were recorded 2 years after cutting, decreasing afterwards with the increasing dominance of shrubs. Thus it seems likely that, although a 9 year period is too short for these communities to reach steady equilibrium, they are very <b>resistant</b> <b>and</b> <b>resilient</b> to disturbances, as regeneration was fast and vegetation dynamics was not influenced by differences among treatments.
