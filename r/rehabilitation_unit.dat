5|$|Donna {{is shocked}} when her estranged father Derek (Clarke Peters) is {{admitted}} to the hospital and diagnosed with cancer. He dies soon thereafter, and when dealing with his effects, Donna learns that he unknowingly fathered another daughter. Though her half-sister is recently deceased, Donna meets her half-niece Mia (Jada Wallace-Mitchell), who is being raised by her grandmother, Patti (Barbara Drennan). Within weeks, Patti also dies, and Donna decides to adopt Mia. She and her friend Maria (Phoebe Thomas) compete for a ward sister position on the general surgery ward. Although Maria is the successful applicant, she realises that Donna needs the job in order to support Mia, and withdraws her candidacy so Donna is appointed sister. Donna falls in love with agency nurse Kieran Callaghan (Barry Sloane), and is devastated when he is called to serve in Afghanistan with the Territorial Army (TA). Kieran asks her to marry him, but Donna refuses, terminating their relationship with the intention of giving Mia stability. When Kieran is injured by an improvised explosive device (IED), Donna reconsiders, supporting him through the amputation of his leg. Upon learning that he will be transferred to a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>unit</b> in Liverpool, Donna resigns in order to move there with him.|$|E

500|$|Once {{medically}} stable, {{people may}} be transferred to a subacute <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>unit</b> of the medical center or to an independent rehabilitation hospital. Rehabilitation aims to improve independent function {{at home and in}} society and to help adapt to disabilities [...] and has demonstrated its general effectiveness, when conducted by a team of health professionals who specialise in head trauma. As for any person with neurologic deficits, a multidisciplinary approach is key to optimising outcome. Physiatrists or neurologists are likely to be the key medical staff involved, but depending on the person, doctors of other medical specialties may also be helpful. Allied health professions such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, cognitive rehabilitation therapy, and occupational therapy will be essential to assess function and design the rehabilitation activities for each person. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional distress and clinical depression may involve mental health professionals such as therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists, while neuropsychologists can help to evaluate and manage cognitive deficits.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Understanding the {{nutritional}} journey that older adults make from rehabilitation to home {{will help to}} target nutrition screening and intervention programs. This study aimed to determine {{the nutritional}} status, physical function and health-related quality of life amongst malnourished older adults admitted to two rural <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> and 12 weeks post-discharge to the community. Design: Observational prospective cohort study, conducted August 2013 to February 2014. Setting: <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> in rural New South Wales, Australia. Participants: Thirty community-dwelling, malnourished older adult inpatients (mean age 79. 5 ± 7. 1 years, 57 % female). Intervention: Observation of usual care: basic nutrition services typical to rural <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units.</b> Measurements: Outcome assessments were measured at rehabilitation admission, discharge and 12 weeks post-discharge, with nutrition status via the Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included physical function (Modified Barthel Index) and health-related quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life- 6 D). Results: At admission, half of the rehabilitation patients were moderately malnourished and half were severely malnourished, with the cohort becoming and remaining moderately malnourished on discharge and 12 weeks post-discharge. Only four patients (24 %) were well-nourished 12 weeks post-discharge. Following discharge, there was a trend showing decline in physical function. No improvement was found in health-related quality of life following discharge. Conclusion: Malnourished older adults admitted to rural <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> with basic nutrition care {{are likely to be}} discharged with moderate malnutrition, and remain moderately malnourished in the community for at least 12 weeks. Physical function and health-related quality of life remain poor in this population. Collaboration between health services and within the multidisciplinary team is essential to identify and treat malnourished older adults, and novel approaches for inpatient and post-discharge nutrition support is needed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{correlation}} between adherence to recommended management and good recovery outcomes in an Australian cohort of inpatients receiving rehabilitation. Design: Processes of care were audited and included those recommended in the Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Rehabilitation and Recovery. Setting: National audit data from 68 <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> were used, with each hospital contributing up to 40 consecutive cases. Participants: Not applicable. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Discharged home or an increase of {{greater than or equal}} to 22 in FIM scores between admission and discharge. Multivariable logistic regression models controlling for patient clustering were used to assess the associations between adherence to recommended management and recovery outcomes (dependent variables). Results: Hospitals contributed 2119 patients (median age 75 y, 53 % men). We found that <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> providing evidence-based management (eg, treatment for sensorimotor impairment 38 %, hypertonicity 56 %, mobility 94 %, and home assessments 71 %) were more likely to provide better recovery outcomes for people with stroke. A discharge FIM score of 100 was clinically relevant and was strongly correlated with whether or not a patient was discharged home. We found very good correlation between admission and discharge FIM scores in stroke rehabilitation. Conclusions: This is one of the first study comparing adherence to recommended management in Australian <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> and stroke recovery outcomes based on national audit data. Novel findings include the significance of an FIM score between 80 and 100 and the clinical significance of various management processes...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose - Although {{implemented}} in 1998, no research has examined {{how well the}} Australian National Subacute and Nonacute Patient (AN-SNAP) Casemix Classification predicts length of stay (LOS), discharge destination, and functional improvement in public hospital stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> in Australia. Methods - 406 consecutive admissions to 3 stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> in Queensland, Australia were studied. Sociode-mographic, clinical, and functional data were collected. General linear modeling and logistic regression {{were used to assess}} the ability of AN-SNAP to predict outcomes. Results - AN-SNAP significantly predicted each outcome. There were clear relationships between the outcomes of longer LOS, poorer functional improvement and discharge into care, and the AN-SNAP classes that reflected poorer functional ability and older age. Other predictors included living situation, acute LOS, comorbidity, and stroke type. Conclusions - AN-SNAP is a consistent predictor of LOS, functional change and discharge destination, and has utility in assisting clinicians to set rehabilitation goals and plan discharge...|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} {{is a major}} trauma, with its {{short and long term}} effects and {{consequences}} to the patient, his friends and family. Spinal cord injury is addressed in the developed countries with standard trauma care system commencing immediately after injury and continuing to the specialized <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units.</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> is important to those with spinal injury for both functional and psychosocial reintegration. It has been an emerging concept in Nepal, which has been evident with the establishment of the various hospitals with <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units,</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> centres and physical therapy units in different institutions. However, the spinal cord injury rehabilitation setting and scenario is different in Nepal from those in the developed countries since spinal cord injury rehabilitation care has not been adequately incorporated into the health care delivery system nor its importance has been realized within the medical community of Nepal. To name few, lack of human resource for the rehabilitation care, awareness among the medical personnel and general population, adequate scientific research evidence regarding situation of spinal injury and exorbitant health care policy are the important hurdles that has led to the current situation. Hence, it is our responsibility to address these apparent barriers to successful implementation and functioning of rehabilitation so that those with spinal injury would benefit from enhanced quality of life.

40|$|AbstractThe study aims were: (i) {{to define}} the {{prevalence}} of and risk factors for colonization by extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Enterobacteriaceae (EPE) among healthcare workers (HCWs) and family members (FMs) of EPE-colonized patients in <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> and (ii) to compare EPE isolates from these three groups. The study included 286 FMs of 194 EPE-carrying patients identified in five <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> located in Israel, Italy, France and Spain. The EPE were detected in rectal swabs from 26 (9 %) of 286 FMs screened. In multivariate analyses, older age of FM, greater mean number of hours spent with the patient, being a daughter or a female spouse of a patient, and chronic lung disease of the patient {{were significantly associated with}} carriage in the FM. Escherichia coli was the most common organism (76 %), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (19 %). Isolates were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing, and ESBLs were identified by PCR sequencing. A comparison of paired species isolates from FMs and their respective patient showed that 17 of 23 strains were indistinguishable. EPE were detected in 35 (3. 5 %, E. coli = 34) of the 1001 HCWs screened. Feeding patients was associated with EPE carriage by HCWs. Only 7 of 23 E. coli subclones cultured from HCWs were also represented among 376 patient-derived ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from the same <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units.</b> In Spain, a higher proportion of HCWs and FMs were ESBL carriers than elsewhere (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, the molecular and epidemiological data suggest that FMs are at higher risk of EPE acquisition from their relative patients than HCWs...|$|R
