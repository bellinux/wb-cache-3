500|$|The {{popular music}} video for [...] "The Scientist" [...] was notable for its {{distinctive}} reverse narrative, which employed <b>reverse</b> <b>video.</b> The same concept {{had been previously}} used for Spike Jonze's 1995 music video for The Pharcyde's [...] "Drop." [...] The <b>reverse</b> <b>video</b> style had first been seen in 1989 for the video for the song [...] "The Second Summer of Love" [...] by Scottish band Danny Wilson. In order for Martin {{to appear to be}} singing the lyrics in the reversed footage, he had to learn to sing the song backwards, which took him a month. The video was filmed at various locations, including London and at Bourne Woods in Surrey, before the first leg of the A Rush of Blood to the Head tour. It was directed by Jamie Thraves. The video was shot between 30 September – 3 October 2002, premiering on 14 October.|$|E

50|$|Murphy {{has always}} enjoyed {{having fun with}} {{technology}} and pushing it to the limits, often with budgetary constraints. He believes such limitations inspire innovation. In 1965 he invented a way of <b>reversing</b> <b>video</b> tape to enable images to be run backwards. In 1990, Murphy made Let's Do Lunch, the first television series {{in the world to}} be filmed on Handicam.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{extension}} {{to the traditional}} method for creating video textures is presented. By exploiting the symmetric properties of the frames in a given video sequence, a new endless video stream or video loop is generated by <b>reversing</b> <b>video</b> playback when appropriate. We aim at a larger set of possible input video’s for video texture creation, including captured motions containing no smooth transitions (eg. turbulent plant movements). To achieve this, good turn points, instead of transitions are extracted from the video data, after which a simple algorithm synthesizes a new video sequence while optimally exploiting the original frame data. Visual artifacts caused by changed lighting conditions are reduced significantly...|$|R
50|$|The {{video display}} RAM was not memory-mapped {{as it had}} been on the {{previous}} Models I and III. Rather, whenever a program called functions requiring video RAM to be modified, TRSDOS executed code that switched the 2KB bank of video RAM into Z-80 address space (the upper 2KB of hexadecimal F400 - FFFF). The keyboard matrix and typeahead buffer also occupied this address range. While this freed 1920 bytes of Z-80 address space, it was marginally slower than writing directly into video RAM. The video hardware supported characters in <b>reversed</b> <b>video</b> and Model I/III style block graphics. A 40 character wide display mode was available a using double-width raster image. An alternate character set was available which included the entire Greek alphabet and special symbols.|$|R

50|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>video</b> (or invert {{video or}} inverse video or ''''reverse screen'''') is a {{computer}} display technique whereby the background and text color values are inverted. On older computers, displays were usually designed to display text on a black background by default. For emphasis, the color scheme was swapped to bright background with dark text. Nowadays the two tend to be switched, since most computers today default to white as a background color. The opposite of <b>reverse</b> <b>video</b> is known as true video.|$|E

40|$|Delivery of {{manufacturing}} technology and practical workshop-based work, on undergraduate engineering courses that engage the learners, is challenging. The paper presents an experimental method of workshop delivery using the flipped learning approach, a pedagogical {{model in which}} the typical lecture and homework elements of a course are <b>reversed.</b> <b>Video</b> lectures are viewed by students prior to class. In-class time can be devoted to exercises, projects, or discussions as in this case. Learners were asked to observe three audiovisual clips in preparation for class. The objective {{was to determine whether}} the flipped classroom approach can enhance the learning experience, through better engagement with the students, compared to conventional classroom-based learning. The level of student participation and level of success have been established by means of feedback questionnaires from more than 100 participants and peer observation. The results are encouraging and demonstrate that this approach is favoured by the students...|$|R

50|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>video</b> is also {{sometimes}} used for accessibility reasons. When most computer displays were light-on-dark, {{it was found}} that users looking back and forth between a white paper and dark screen would experience eyestrain due to their pupils constantly dilating and contracting. Flicker was also an issue with early white-background displays. Today, people with visual impairments such as ocular toxocariasis may find it less tiring to the eyes to work with a predominantly black screen, since modern operating systems usually display a lot of white in a normal use. For the same, white-dominant reason, <b>reverse</b> <b>video</b> is an efficient way to read or write text in a dark environment, since the darkness of the screen may blend into the darkness of the environment.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{progress on}} the topic of human visual attention allocation in scene perception and its simulation is based mainly on studies with static images. However, natural vision requires us to extract visual information that constantly changes due to egocentric movements or dynamics of the world. It is unclear to what extent spatio-temporal regularity, an inherent regularity in dynamic vision, affects human gaze distribution and saliency computation in visual attention models. In this free-viewing eye-tracking study we manipulated the spatio-temporal regularity of traffic videos by presenting them in normal <b>video</b> sequence, <b>reversed</b> <b>video</b> sequence, normal frame sequence, and randomised frame sequence. The recorded human gaze allocation was then used as the ‘ground truth’ to examine the predictive ability of a number of state-of-the-art visual attention models. The analysis revealed high inter-observer agreement across individual human observers, but all the tested attention models performed significantly worse than humans. The inferior predictability of the models was evident from indistinguishable gaze prediction irrespective of stimuli presentation sequence, and weak central fixation bias. Our findings suggest that a realistic visual attention model for the processing of dynamic scenes should incorporate human visual sensitivity with spatio-temporal regularity and central fixation bias...|$|R
