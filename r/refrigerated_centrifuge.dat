40|$|The Complement put {{to be the}} {{experiment}} {{was made by the}} following procedure : (a) Male-guinea-pigs of health, each weighting 350 grams or more, were prepared. (b) About 200 c c of blood was extracted from ten animals (about 20 c c from each) by puncturing their hearts, and serum was separated in a <b>refrigerating</b> <b>centrifuge</b> adjusted at 4 ℃. (c) The complement acquired thus was injected dividedly into ampoules and dried by fleezing in a desicator. (d) The dried complement was sealed some under negative pressure in some ampoules and in the other ampoules under normal pressure. Thus the two kinds of materials under different conditions were put to the following tests. THE RESULTS OF TESTS 1. Preservation Test : By examining from time to time the said two materials which were kept at the room temperature and measuring their complement titres, it was observed that both of them were unchangeable in titre for five months at least. It seemed, however, that stability was a little higher under negative pressure than under normal pressure. 2. Stability Test After Dissolution : It was seen that the dried complement lost its activity soon after dissolution, particularly becoming inactive under normal pressure sooner than under negative pressure...|$|R

40|$|Objective: A {{total of}} 30 ejaculates from five Ibérico × Landrace boars were studied {{in order to}} {{establish}} the effect of different centrifugation conditions on semen quality after refrigeration and freezing. Methods: The Westendorf method was used for freezing, with some variations.

Individual boar was a random effect. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} semen quality associated with the shape of the centrifugation tube either for refrigerated (5 ˚C) or thawed semen. The g-force of centrifugation did affect semen quality. In <b>refrigerated</b> samples <b>centrifuged</b> at 250 g, the percentage of sperm with normal apical ridges (NAR) was lower (P . 05). Implications: Centrifugation at 2250 g in tubes with spherical bottoms is faster and makes handling easier.

In this protocol we describe a co-culture system where primary simian hepatocyte could be maintained {{for a month or}} more through co-cultivation with an immortalised liver derived cell line, Hepa-RG. The hepatocytes can be infected with Plasmodium sporozoites and the persisting hypnozoites can then observed and investigated. ### Introduction Infection by malaria is initiated by the deposition of sporozoites in the skin from the salivary of an infected Anopheles mosquito during its blood meal. These sporozoites then {{make their way to the}} liver where they immediately develop in hepatocytes to produce the merozoite forms that invade red blood cells, thus staring the cycle of multiplication that causes disease and allows transmission to mosquitos. In a few of the parasite species that infect primates, the development of some of the hepatic parasites is arrested early after invasion, to resume only months or years later (1 - 3). During this time these quiescent parasites are insusceptible to all anti-malarial drugs except for primaquine. The activation of these dormant forms, known as hypnozoites, causes a relapse episode thereby increasing the morbidity of the infection and its potential to transmit. In humans, two species Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale are capable of forming hypnozoites, and this considerably hampers efforts to control and eventually eliminate them. Searching for drugs active against hypnozoites suitable for mass deployment is a urgent requirement because primaquine administration can lead to potentially severe haemolysis in persons with glucose- 6 -phosphate deficiency, a genetic trait common in populations living the areas endemic for vivax and ovale malaria. At present, screening for hypnozoitocidal activity can only be done one experimentally infected hosts, which must be followed for many months after drug administration. Since the 1950 ’s, the P. cynomolgi-infected rhesus monkey, an excellent model for P. vivax, has been used to test for efficacy (4). Given the costs and ethical limitations inherent to research on primates, screening is restricted to very few compounds indeed. Moreover, there is very little known about the biological processes associated with quiescence and activation of hypnozoites that could help narrow down the molecules to test. Clearly, in vitro cultivation of hypnozoites would make it possible to envisage more efficient and cost-effective screening strategies. We had previously demonstrated that hypnozoite-like forms could be obtained in cultured primary simian hepatocytes infected with P. cynomolgi sporozoites (5). However confirmation that these were indeed hypnozoites, and optimal use for screening assays, were hampered by the characteristic short durations (10 - 14 days at most) of primary hepatocyte cultures. Here we describe protocols in which the co-culture of simian primary hepatocytes with a HepaRG cell line allows to maintain the cultures for about a month, during which hypnozoites resulting from an initial infection with P. cynomolgi sporozoites can be enriched and observed to activate and develop into mature forms. It is likely that these protocols would also be suitable for the cultivation of P. vivax hypnozoites in human primary hepatocytes. ### Materials 1.

It is based on mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines that express, from the endogenous loci, remodelers fused with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) -tag. Two versions of the TAP-tag, introduced at the C terminus, have been used successfully: (FLAG 3 -TEV-HA) and (FLAG-HA). ES cells are first fixed either with formaldehyde, or {{with a combination of}} disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) and formaldehyde. ES cells are then permeabilized, and incubated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to fragment the genome into mononucleosomes. These nucleosomes are then incubated with agarose beads coupled with an antibody against HA or FLAG epitopes. After a series of washes, tagged-remodeler-nucleosome complexes are eluted, either by TEV protease cleavage or by peptide competition. The eluted protein is then subjected to a second immunopurification step, using beads coupled to the antibody against the second HA or FLAG epitope. After elution, DNA is extracted from the highly purified mononucleosome fraction, and processed for high-throughput sequencing. ### Materials 1. Solution I: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 15 mM, Sucrose 0. 3 M, KCl 60 mM, NaCl 15 mM, MgCl 2 5 mM, EGTA 0. 1 mM Solution II: Solution I with 0. 6 % (v/v) IGEPAL CA- 630 (SIGMA, ref. I 3021) - MNase buffer: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, Sucrose 0. 34 M, KCl 15 mM, NaCl 60 mM, CaCl 2 1 mM - TKNSE buffer: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, Sucrose 0. 34 M, KCl 15 mM, NaCl 60 mM, EDTA 4 mM - TEGN: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, NaCl 150 mM, MgCl 2 3 mM, EDTA 0. 1 mM, 10 % Glycerol, 0. 01 % IGEPAL - SDS elution buffer: 1 % SDS, 0. 1 M NaHCO 3 ### Procedure 1. Preparation of ES cells - Prior to the experiment, expand ES cells to twelve 70 - 80 % confluent 10 cm culture dishes (1. 5. 10 e 7 cells/dish). Tagged ES cells are cultured at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2, on mitomycin C-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (feeder cells), in DMEM (Sigma) with 15 % fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), L-Glutamine (Invitrogen), MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), pen/strep (Invitrogen), 2 -mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and a saturating amount of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), as described in (Tessarollo, 2001). - The day before the experiment, pass the cells into twenty five 10 cm culture dishes coated with gelatin, without feeder cells. Between 30 and 50. 10 e 7 cells are expected for one tandem ChIP experiment. - The first day of the procedure, 2 h before starting the protocol, check the aspect and confluence of ES cells. Change the ES cell medium, using precisely 10 ml of fresh medium per 10 cm dish, and further incubate the cells for 2 h at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2. - Set a water bath at 37 °C, and <b>refrigerate</b> the <b>centrifuge</b> (e. g. 5810 R eppendorf centrifuge, with an A- 4 - 62 rotor). Put the following solutions on ice: Solution I, Solution II, MNase buffer, Complete 50 x (Roche, ref. 11836145001) and PBS 1 X. - When the 2 h incubation period in fresh medium is finished, trypsinize one dish and count the cells (these cells will be used only for counting, in order to calculate the amount of MNase required for genome fragmentation). We expect 1 to 2. 10 e 7 cells per dish. 2. Fixation. Caution: formaldehyde must be manipulated in a chemical fume hood. - Option 1 : Fixation with formaldehyde: - Remove the cells from the incubator and rapidly add 275 μl of formaldehyde 36. 5 % (SIGMA, ref. F 8775) in each dish, directly into the culture medium, and mix well. The final concentration of formaldehyde is 1 %. - Leave exactly 10 min at room temperature. - Option 2 : Fixation with DSG and formaldehyde: - Dilute DSG to 2 mM in PBS. The DSG (Di-(N-succinimidyl) glutarate, Sigma-Aldrich Ref. 80424) stock solution is 500 mM (50 mg in 306 μl of DMSO) - Wash the ES cell culture dishes with 10 ml PBS at room temperature, and remove the last bits of PBS by vacuum aspiration. - Add 4 ml of DSG 2 mM solution per 10 cm dish - Shake gently and make sure that the DSG solution has been in contact with all cells in the dish. - Keep the dishes at room temperature under the hood during 45 min. Shake gently 3 - 4 times during this period. - Add 4 ml of 2 % formaldehyde in PBS to each dish (final concentration 1 %). Mix well. - Leave exactly 10 min at room temperature. Removal of the fixation agent and collection of fixed ES cells - Quickly remove the formaldehyde (or DSG + formaldehyde) solution from the dishes by vacuum aspiration (transfer this waste into an appropriate trash recipient). - Immediately wash each dish with 10 ml of cold PBS, and remove the last bits of PBS by vacuum aspiration. Repeat this washing step once. - Add 2 ml of PBS (with protease inhibitors) per dish. - Scrap cells and collect them in four 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes. Store the collected cells on ice. - Centrifuge at 1000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C. - Wash each tube of cells twice with 10 ml PBS 1 x without protease inhibitors. - Wash each tube of cells once with 5 ml Solution I. - Centrifuge at 1000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C. 3. Permeabilization of ES cells with IGEPAL - Resuspend each of the four cell pellets in 2 ml Solution I with protease inhibitors. - Add 2 ml Solution II with protease inhibitors. - Mix gently by pipetting or inverting the tubes several times. - Leave 10 min on ice. During this step, the cells are permeabilized by IGEPAL. Note that because of the formaldehyde fixation, nuclei are not efficiently released from the cells. - Centrifuge 10 min at 2000 g (3153 rpm using an eppendorf A- 4 - 62 rotor), 4 °C. 4. Chromatin fragmentation by MNase - Wash each cell pellet twice with 6 ml MNase buffer (without protease inhibitors). - Resuspend each cell pellet in 500 μl MNase buffer (without protease inhibitors). - Mix well with ± 20 up-and-down, using a P 1000 pipetman. Make sure that there are no more clumps of cells. - Transfer the cell suspension of each conical centrifuge tube into a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. Store on ice. - Dilute MNase (New England Biolab, ref.

The optimal amount of MNase has to be tested for each new batch of enzyme. The proper amount of MNase will release mostly mononucleosomes, but di- and tri-nucleosomes should still be visible when a sample is run onto a 1. 3 % agarose gel. - Mix well with a P 1000 pipetman. - Incubate 10 min at 37 °C in a water bath.

Discard the pellets. Collect an 80 μl aliquot of this input chromatin for DNA analysis and quantification, and for western blot analysis. DNA preparation from input chromatin Before DNA analysis, the formaldehyde-mediated cross-link must be reversed. - In a new microfuge tube, add 20 μl of input chromatin, 480 μl H 2 O, 20 μl NaCl 5 M and 0. 5 μl RNase A (30 μg/μl). - Incubate overnight at 65 °C. - add 10 μl EDTA 0. 5 M, 20 μl Tris-HCl 1 M pH 8. 0 and 4 μl proteinase K 10 mg/ml. Incubate 2 h at 55 °C. - Add 500 μl Phenol/Chloroform, vortex 30 s, and centrifuge 10 min at 13000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1. 5 microfuge tube. - Add 50 μl of NaAc 3 M pH 5. 2. Mix. - Add 1 ml 100 % ethanol (- 20 °C), and mix by inverting 10 times the tubes. - Precipitate DNA 1 h at - 20 °C (or overnight at 4 °C). - Centrifuge 15 min at 4 °C, 13000 rpm. Discard the supernatant, centrifuge again for 30 s and remove the last drop of liquid. - Wash the DNA pellet with 500 μl of 70 % ethanol. Centrifuge and discard all the liquid. - Add 20 TE (Tris-HCl pH 8, 0. 1 mM EDTA). Once prepared, the DNA is run onto a 1. 3 % agarose gel, to analyze the distribution of mono- and oligo-nucleosomes in the input chromatin. In addition, DNA is quantified by measuring the OD at 260 nm. 5. Preparation of HA- or FLAG-agarose beads for steps 1 and 2 of the tandem affinity purification scheme Anti-HA-agarose (ref. A 2095) and anti-FLAG-agarose (ref. A 2220) beads are purchased from SIGMA. - Resuspend the beads, and pipet the required amount of beads into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube: 80 μl of beads (this is the volume of beads estimated after centrifugation, not the volume of slurry) for the first immunoprecipitation step, 40 μl for the second step. - Wash the beads three times with 10 ml TKNSE buffer. Centrifuge one min at 1000 rpm between each wash to collect the beads. - Keep the beads at 4 °C until use. 6. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation: first step of the tandem affinity protocol - In four 1. 5 ml microfuge tubes, mix 500 μl of input chromatin with 20 μl of HA antibody-agarose beads. - Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. - Pool the content of the four microfuge tubes into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. - Centrifuge 2 min at 1000 rpm, at 4 °C. - Take an 80 μl aliquot of the unbound fraction of the first IP as a control for western blot analysis (store on ice). - Wash the beads 8 times with 10 ml TEGN. - Resuspend in 500 μl TEGN if elution is to be made by TEV proteolysis, or in 300 μl of TEGN for elution by peptide competition (see below), and transfer into a new 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. - Take a 10 μl aliquot|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to show the {{capability}} of captopril as a thiol ACEi (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor),in suppressing mitochondrial toxicity due to paraquat. Method: In this study, rats liver mitochondria were isolated with buffer using <b>refrigerated</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> In order to obtain the minimum toxic dose of paraquat and the effective dose of captopril, different concentrations of paraquat (1 to 100 mM) and captopril (0. 08 to 1 mM) were investigated by determining LC 50, viability indices, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial swelling, catalase activity, GSH and GSSG. Results: Simultaneous treatment of mitochondria with captopril (0. 08 mM) and paraquat (5 mM) significantly ameliorate the mitochondrial toxicity of paraquat (5 mM) alone. Our results show that captopril is a effective antioxidant. The antioxidative action of captopril appears to be attributable to the sulphahydryl group (SH) in the compound. This effect may be due to captopril abilities to scavenge reactive oxygen species. Conclusion: Our results indicate that Captopril can ameliorate oxidative stress induced by paraquat and therefore, can be used for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by environmental toxins.
