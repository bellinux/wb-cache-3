40|$|Rolling-element {{fatigue tests}} were run in {{standard}} and high-speed rolling-contact <b>rigs</b> at <b>bar</b> speeds from 5000 to 50, 000 rpm {{to determine the}} effects of speed and lubricant film parameter on rolling-element fatigue life. AISI 52100 test bars were tested at a maximum Hertz stress of 4. 83 GPa (700, 000 psi) with three traction fluids and an automatic transmission fluid. Rolling-element fatigue life increased with speed, with the greatest increases occurring from 10, 000 to 50, 000 rpm. The life data tended to follow published life-versus-lubricant-film-parameter data up to a film parameter of approximately 3...|$|R

Tensile, shear and compression loadings {{were carried out}} with a standard tensile rig and a crossbow/Hopkinson pressure <b>bar</b> <b>rig.</b> The specimen strain was measured by digital image correlation technique. It is concluded that the composite stiffness and strength are highly sensitive to strain rate. Static and dynamic multicycle tests were also undertaken to identify and quantify softening phenomenon. Thus, permanent plastic strain and reduction in stiffness are observed and quantified...|$|R

Unlike the Colosseum in Rome, the theatre was built in an intimate setting, with the furthest seating being 120 ft from the stage. To reinforce its intimacy, the venue is equipped with 200 acoustical panels to control the amplified sound. [...] The theatre also includes {{a state of the}} art humidity control system. This $2 million installation helped provide the perfect air atmosphere around the performers on stage for optimal acoustics, performance, and conditioning. The venue also includes state of the art technology. Some of these state of the art technology include, the lighting and sound board.

40|$|The {{response}} to mechanical loading of the thermosetting resin system RTM- 6 {{has been investigated}} experimentally {{as a function of}} strain rate and a constitutive model has been applied to describe the observed and quantified material behaviour. In order to determine strain rate effects and to draw conclusions about the hydrostatic stress dependency of the material, specimens were tested in compression and tension at strain rates from 10 - 3 to 104 s- 1. A Standard screw-driven tensile machine was used for quasi-static testing, with an 'in house' hydraulic <b>rig</b> and Hopkinson <b>bars</b> for medium and high strain rates, respectively. At all rates appropriate photography and optical metrology have been used for direct strain measurement, observation of failure and validation of experimental procedures. In order to enable the experimental characterisation of this brittle material at very high rates in tension, a novel pulse shaping technique has been applied. With the help of this device, strain rates of up to 3800 s- 1 have been achieved while maintaining homogeneous deformation state until specimen fracture in the gauge section of the tensile specimens. The yield stress and initial modulus increased with increasing strain rate for both compression and tension, while the strain to failure decreased with strain rate in tension. An existing constitutive model, the Goldberg model has been extended in order {{to take into account the}} nonlinear strain rate dependence of the elastic modulus. The model has been validated against 3 -point impact bending tests of prismatic RTM- 6 beams. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{capture of}} CO 2 is of high {{interest}} in a society concerned by climate change and consequently by greenhouse gas emissions. If the amine absorption or hot potassium scrubbing are widely used, several membrane processes are also employed. Many studies are realized to develop new polymers {{in order to increase}} the selectivity and permeability of membranes. Polyether based copolymers are particularly studied because of the high flexibility of the polyether chain which enables good gas diffusion properties and favorable polar interactions between the oxygen atoms of ether and the carbon dioxide. Moreover, the mechanical and thermal properties can be tailored using different hard segments, different chain lengths or compositions for the soft segment which affect the crystallinity of both phases. Fixed sites carrier membranes are also studied because facilitated transport enables to get membranes with both high selectivity and permeability. In this study, polyether based copolymers containing poly(ethylene oxide) or poly(propylene oxide) soft segments are considered. The hard segments are aldehyde groups for one series and aldehyde and histamine groups for a second series, based on the same soft segments. The permeation properties for pure N 2, CH 4 and CO 2 have been tested using a time lag permeation <b>rig</b> at 5 <b>bars.</b> Mixed gases experiments have also been performed using a gas mixture of 10 % CO 2 – 90 % N 2 at 1. 2 and 5 bars feed pressure, in dry and humidified conditions, in order to identify the presence of a possible facilitated transport. The sorption of carbon dioxide has been studied by gravimetric method using a Rubotherm magnetic suspension balance. The membranes materials have been characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry and by Fourier Transformed Infrared spectroscopy and some of them with Atomic Force Microscopy. Water vapors swelling experiment has been performed in order to characterize the amount of water sorbed in each membrane and its influence on membrane properties. The gas permeability and gas sorption results were correlated with the chemical polymers structure. Twelve membranes have been studied, half of them containing histamine groups. Infrared Spectroscopy showed that all the membranes have the same functional groups but in different relative proportions which is consistent with the structures of the membranes. Differential Scanning Calorimetry gave the characteristic temperatures of the polymers, the most interesting one being the glass transition temperature. All the soft membranes had a negative Tg whereas the glassy ones had a Tg greater than 35 °C. The membranes from the series “without histamine” were softer than the other membranes. Histamine membranes, due to their additional amine groups which can react with water, were able to uptake a bigger amount of water per volume of polymer. CO 2 sorption in polymers followed different mechanisms depending on the membranes: Henry’s law for rubbery membranes – all “without histamine” series and T 3 and T 6; dual sorption model for the other membranes. The membranes without histamine showed higher CO 2 permeability for both pure and mixed gases experiments. This is expected and correlated with their rubbery structure which enables bigger free volume. The CO 2 /N 2 selectivity was generally higher for the membranes without histamine. For all the membranes, CO 2 /N 2 selectivity was higher in wet conditions than in dry conditions, proving that facilitated transport was occurring in a certain degree for all membranes. However, {{it is not possible to}} conclude that histamine groups enhance this facilitated transport. T 3 without histamine and T 6 without histamine present the best tradeoff between selectivity and permeability and T 2 without histamine and T 5 show also good separation properties. Therefore, they are the membranes which could be further developed in order to be used in industry. </p...|$|R
