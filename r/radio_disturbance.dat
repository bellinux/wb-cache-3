40|$|The {{communication}} {{performance in}} wireless net-works is often {{heavily influenced by}} failures caused by node mobility and <b>radio</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Proactive link-state routing protocols like OLSR and OSPFv 3 with wireless extensions (WOSPF) are currently relying on slow re-convergence to restore successful packet for-warding. This may not be appropriate for particular applications, and it may cause instability during tran-sient failures. Support for fast and local reroute should therefore be added as a feature to proactive link-state based routing protocols. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and requirements {{that are associated with}} such solutions. In addition, we evaluate and discuss to what extent recent developments for fixed IP routing can serve as solutions. To our best knowledge, no pub-lished work presents a similar study on fast recovery in proactive link-state routed wireless networks. ...|$|E

That is to say, the electromagnetic energy of the commutation sections of armature windings, the sparking factor and the intensity of <b>radio</b> <b>disturbances</b> depend on the supplementary commutation current.

40|$|As {{the second}} step of the real time {{monitoring}} system of the solar <b>radio</b> <b>disturbance,</b> we constructed a 2. 8 GHz radio receiver with 500 MHz bandwith. Using the control and observing system (Yoon et al. ~ 2004), we observed the Sun, and found some frequencies, which disturb the Solar radio flux to be observed. DMB and aiport control frequencies are identified as responsible for this disturbance. As well as the testing the receiver, the measurment of the radio environment at 2. 8 GHz with 500 MHz bandwith are carried out around Chungbuk National University. In fact, the radio power of the two frequencies, 2. 649 GHz and 2. 874 GHz is so high {{that we can not}} observe the Solar radio signal at 2. 8 GHz. We report some results of this measurment and suggest the method to overcome this problem. We conclude also that the frequecies, which are important for the astronomy, should be protected in the future...|$|E
40|$|A {{possibility}} {{to improve our}} understanding of high latitude ionospheric <b>radio</b> <b>disturbance</b> phenomena seen in GNSS signals is artificial ionospheric heating. An induced and controlled electron temperature increase leads to localized and temporal disturbances and can be produced by the EISCATs heating facility. First investigations using a 2 D 3 fluid model were showing that similar to natural heating and ionization, a large variation of TEC {{of the order of}} ˜ 1 TECU can be expected from F-region heating. The use of artificial HF heating provides the opportunity of conducting a controlled experiment for TEC variation or even scintillation. The result of a controlled input causing an ionospheric response, in terms of plasma density, electron/ion temperature and vertical ion velocity, is measured. The present study reports on GEISHA, which is a coordinated measurement campaign including several EISCAT heating experiments simultaneously monitored by ISR, ionosondes and dual frequency signals transmitted by GNSS obtained from two high frequency receiver stations.

40|$|Space weather impacts {{related to}} {{particle}} precipitations are common and first are impacting Earths upper atmosphere at high latitudes. There trans‐ionospheric radio {{signals from the}} sparsely distributed global navigation satellite system are frequently disturbed. The aim of this presentation is to discuss high latitude ionospheric <b>radio</b> <b>disturbance</b> phenomena seen in GNSS signals caused both by artificial and natural ionospheric heating. Artificial ionospheric heating {{can be obtained by}} induced and controlled electron temperature increase, which leads to localized and temporal disturbances. This can be produced by the EISCAT heating facility. First investigations using a 2 D 3 fluid model were showing that similar to natural heating and ionization, a variation of TEC of the order of some tenth of a TEC Unit can be expected from F‐region artificial heating. The use of artificial HF heating provides the opportunity of conducting a controlled experiment for TEC variation. The result of a controlled input causing an ionospheric response, in terms of plasma density, electron/ion temperature and vertical ion velocity, is measured. Stronger space weather impacts are seen in TEC variations due to natural heating caused by, e. g., the aurora phenomena. During active geomagnetic conditions and aurora displays TEC variations can be derived from the GNSS measurements of the order of several TEC units. The present study reports on GEISHA 2010 ‐ 2011, which is an ongoing coordinated measurement campaign including several EISCAT heating experiments simultaneously monitored by ISR, ionosondes, all‐sky camera and dual frequency signals transmitted by GNSS obtained from two high frequency receiver stations...|$|E

40|$|Magnetic fields play a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} evolution of astrophysical systems. These fields can be studied through wide-field spectropolarimetry, which allows for faint polarised signals to be detected at relatively low radio frequencies. An interferometric polarisation mode has recently become available at the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). A detailed analysis of the GMRT’s instrumental response is presented. The findings are used to create a polarisation pipeline, which in combination with rotation measure (RM) Synthesis is used for the detection of extended linearly polarised emission at 610 MHz. A number of compact sources are detected and their Faraday depth and polarisation fraction are reported for the first time. New holography observations of the GMRT’s primary beam are presented. Instantaneous off-axis polarisation is substantial and scales with the Stokes I beam. The developed beam models are used to reduce direction-dependent instrumental polarisation, and the Stokes I beam is shown to deviate from circular symmetry. A new technique for electric vector polarisation angle calibration is developed that removes the need for known sources on the sky, eliminates ionospheric effects, and avoids a flaw in current methods which could erroneously yield multiple Faraday components for sources that are well-parameterised by a single RM. A sample of nine galaxies from two Southern Compact Groups are then presented, with constraints being placed on the polarised fraction, RM, spectral index, star formation rate, companion sources, and hydrodynamical state. One galaxy has a displaced peak of radio emission that is extended beyond the disk in comparison to the near-IR disk – suggesting the <b>radio</b> <b>disturbance</b> may be a consequence of ram pressure stripping. Linear polarisation is detected from the core of NGC 7552 at 610 MHz, while another three galaxies ESO 0353 –G 036, NGC 7590, and NGC 7599 are found to be unpolarised. An analysis of additional extended sources allows for an FR-I and an FR-II radio source to be morphologically classified. Finally, spatial spectral variations are identified in the youngest known Galactic supernova remnant G 1. 9 + 0. 3, with flatter spectra in the NW and SE. Models of cosmic ray acceleration at oblique shocks suggest the variation is most consistent with an ambient B field perpendicular to the axis of bilateral symmetry. For the first time, the presence of polarised emission is detected. There is increased ordering of the B field in the NW and strong Faraday depolarisation must also be present. An intrinsically radially-oriented field could be provided by a systematic gradient in RM of 140 rad m- 2 from N to S and can also explain the depolarisation. Such a gradient may be caused by an anisotropic regular magnetic field within the remnant or in an intervening Faraday screen. The lack of strong constraints on the RM, and the remnant’s current evolutionary stage, leave open the possibility that Rayleigh–Taylor instability formation has not yet fully taken place...|$|E
40|$|An ideal Open Area Test Site {{consists}} of an infinite, perfectly conducting ground plane which is free from any obstruction and with no ambient electromagnetic noise, over which the test frequency is radiated' (Coates 2004). This project investigates the Faculty of Engineering and Surveying (FOES) 5 th floor landing for its suitability as an Open Area Test Site (OATS). The main Australian standard to be applied is AS/NZS CISPR 16. 1 : 2002 - Specification for <b>radio</b> <b>disturbance</b> and immunity measuring apparatus and methods. Compliance with the Australian standard AS/NZS CISPR 16. 1 : 2002 is used to ensure conformity across all certified sites. This standard applies to the frequency range of 30 MHZ to 1 GHz and seeks to replicate a perfect system in free space. As this is a theoretical possibility only, tolerances are institutionalised {{in the form of}} standards to allow their uniformity. It is also recognised that compliance across the entire spectrum is highly unlikely and therefore partial compliance in the frequency domain is another option available. These two levels are referred to as a Calibration Test Site (CALTS) and a Compliance Test Site (COMTS). This dissertation discusses why the OATS should be developed and the roles that it can serve in. It looks at the issues of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and electromagnetic interference (EMI). The impact this is having on the world today {{and what can be done}} with an OATS to help improve the situation. In order to understand what the OATS is capable of, it is best that users comprehend the principles behind the sites operation. The subject matter of OATS theory is presented and covers the types of EMI, phase centre (PC) variation of antenna, near and far field boundaries, antenna factors (AF), ground reference planes, multipath propagation, wave reflections and statistical uncertainties. Consideration is also given to environmental sustainability and ethical responsibilities. The practicality of the site is discussed in the context of Australian standards. The standards are looked at individually for their contribution in the overall development of the site. The OATS is then assessed for indicative parameters such as physical site influences, equipment limitations, spectral allocation and legal responsibilities. The site validation procedure developed for this project is presented in detail. This includes the combination of several site modifications and the methodology behind each configuration. The determination of test equipment correction factors (CF) and the correct implementation is introduced. Methodology concerning derivation of the factors for specific equipment configurations and their limitations is presented. Modelling of data outside of these designated datum's is developed through a theoretical model and the accuracy of this model is considered. Test data sheets are available in a spreadsheet format (on dissertation CD and Appendix D) that enables data collation to be standardised between users. Support is provided in the form of a series of test data sheet 'walk throughs' enabling data entry, collation and graphical formatting of results. Results from periodical testing throughout 2004 are catalogued. These results are presented in a series of graphs. The results discussion considers the impact of site modifications and the overall conformity of the OATS. The dissertation concludes with the technical results obtained. Specifically that the site is classified as a compliant test site (COMTS) for the region of 60 MHZ to 85 MHz in a variety of polarisations. Achievement of the years objectives are discussed along with the possibilities of future works concerning the OATS...|$|E

40|$|Ninety-three ssc's {{during the}} 4 -year period from 1968 to 1971 at {{and near the}} peak of the solar {{activity}} cycle were examined.

It was found that 41 of the 48 disturbances corresponded to IP shock waves, and the remaining 7 events were tangential discontinuities. Thirty per cent of the IP shocks had thick structure (i. e., the magnetic field jump across the shock occurred over a distance much greater than 50 proton Larmor radii). By considering the orientations of 22 well-determined shock normals in relation to the positions of the parent flares on the solar disk, it is suggested that a typical shock front propagating out from the sun at 1 AU has a radius of curvature of the order of 1 AU...|$|R
30|$|The first direct {{evidence}} {{of the existence of}} electrified regions in the upper atmosphere was carried out by Appleton and Barnett in Southern England (Appleton and Barnett 1925). This experiment initiated the subsequent development of the major new science of upper atmosphere geophysics using radio waves. Australian scientists were to play an important role, both in England and at home, in the early discoveries. The Australian Federal Government established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in 1926 (White and Huxley 1975) and provided significant support funding. In the same year, the Australian Radio Research Board (ARRB) was established (White and Huxley 1975), following the British precedent (RRB-UK) which had just commenced research on the ionosphere, now a prestigious and autonomous discipline. The ARRB from 1927 was the first, using Australian Federal Government funding to sponsor university research. Two major research activities were supported. At the University of Sydney, John Madsen led extensive contributions to studies of the electrified regions of the atmosphere, now known as the ionosphere. The University of Melbourne under Thomas Laby devoted primary attention to “atmospherics” or lightning discharges, a major source of <b>radio</b> communication <b>disturbance.</b>|$|R
40|$|Cinematographic {{observations}} of solar prominences made at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, {{during the past}} few years suggest that there is a well-defined subclass of ascending prominences characterized by closed-system transference of chromospheric material along an arch or loop (up one leg and down the other). While this occurs, the entire prominence envelope steadily rises upward and expands through the corona. These prominences are denoted as 'fountains'. Several examples are described. Fountains appear to be well contained by coronal magnetic fields. Their total kinetic energy is of the order of 10 to the 30 th power erg, but dissipation is typically quite slow (over time periods of 100 min or so), so that the correlative <b>disturbances</b> (<b>radio</b> bursts, coronal transients, chromospheric brightenings) are generally not spectacular or nonexistent...|$|R
40|$|Earthquakes can be {{associated}} with non-seismic phenomena which may manifest many weeks before and after the main shock. These phenomena are characterized by ground fractures and soil liquefactions at surface often coupled with degassing events, chemical alterations of water and soils, changes in temperature and/or waters level in the epicentral area. Further manifestations include <b>radio</b> <b>disturbances</b> and light emissions. On the other hand, anomalous behavior of animals has been reported to occur before environmental changes. The co-occurrence of several phenomena may be considered as a signal of subsurface changes, and their analysis may be used as possible forecast indicators for seismic events, landslides, damages in infrastructure (e. g., dam) and groundwaters contamination. In order to obtain an accurate statistical analysis of these factors, a pre-crisis large database over a prolonged period of time is a pre-requisite. To this end, we elaborated a questionnaire for the population to pick up signs about anomalous phenomena like as: animal behavior, geological manifestations, effect on vegetation, degassing, changes on aquifers, wells and springs. After the January 25, 2013, mainshock (ML 4. 8) in the Garfagnana seismic district, the Bagni di Lucca Municipality was selected as pilot site for testing this questionnaire. The complexity, variety and extension of this territory (165 kmq) sound suitable for this project. Bagni di Lucca is located in the southern border of the Garfagnana seismogenic source, characterized by the carbonate Mesozoic sequences and the Tertiary terrigenous sedimentary deposits of the Tuscan Nappe. The questionnaire was published on Bagni di Lucca web site ([URL] in collaboration with Municipal Commitee, Local Civil Protection and Local Red Cross, and sent by ordinary mail to the citizenry. It is possible to answer to the questionnaire, also anonymously, direct on line ([URL] calling the Local Civil Protection or Local Red Cross, and by mail. In a second time, an application for Smartphone and Tablets will be developed to allow a faster reply. The questionnaire, constituted by eleven questions and organized in four macro-themes (i. e. animal behavior, geological factors, vegetation anomalies and hydrogeological changes) has been published in June 2013 and will remain on-line for several years. Indeed, the social perception is not fully trustworthy during and soon after an earthquake. So far this is the first attempt to acquire data during quiescent times for comparison with post-seismic ones. This approach may provide clues to identify phenomena properly linked to the event. This questionnaire can be a useful tool to educate population not only about earthquake precursors but also to recognize the "Earth language". Submitted testimonies will be statistically analyzed evidencing the specific responses to the different phenomena in space and time. On the basis of obtained results the questionnaire project could be extended to national level...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} the {{development}} of electron density height profiles based on space time distributed ionization sources and reaction rates in the lower ionosphere is described. Special attention is payed to the definition of an auroral oval distribution function for energetic electron energy input into the lower ionosphere based on a Maxwellian energy spectrum. The distribution function is controlled by an activity parameter which is defined proportional to <b>radio</b> signal amplitude <b>disturbances</b> of a VLF/LF transmitter. Adjusting the proportionality constant allows to model precipitation caused VLF/LF signal <b>disturbances</b> using <b>radio</b> wave propagation calculations and to scale the distribution function. Field aligned current (FAC) data from the new Swarm satellite mission are used to constrain the spatial extent of the distribution function. As an example electron precipitation bursts during a moderate substorm on the 12 April 2014 (midnight–dawn) are modeled along the subauroral propagation path from the NFR/TFK transmitter (37. 5 kHz, Iceland) to a midlatitude site...|$|R
40|$|Among all noise sources {{present in}} {{wireline}} transmission systems {{we focus on}} one special type: narrowband radio frequency interference generated by radio amateurs (HAM) and broadcast <b>radio</b> stations. This <b>disturbance,</b> characterized by high power and narrow bandwidth, {{has the potential of}} overloading the receiver's analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Once the ADC is in saturation, any countermeasure taken in digital domain will fail. A viable way to face this problem is cancellation using the common-mode signal as a reference. This paper describes in detail an adaptive, mixed-signal, narrowband interference canceller employing a modified recursive least-squares algorithm, which is split into an analog and a digital part. The mixed-signal approach enables the circuit to generate an interference-cancelling signal of several MHz while operating the adaptive algorithm at some kilohertz. Simulation as well as measurement results show a steadystate disturbance suppression of about 35 dB. The convergence speed is high enough to protect the ADC from overloading due to time-variant HAM interference...|$|R
50|$|The first {{attempts}} by serious composers to incorporate radio effects into music may be {{those of the}} Russian physicist and musician Léon Theremin, who perfected a form of radio oscillator as a musical instrument in 1928 (regenerative circuits in radios of the time were prone to breaking into oscillation, adding various tonal harmonics to music and speech); {{and in the same}} year, the development of a French instrument called the Ondes Martenot by its inventor Maurice Martenot, a French cellist and former wireless telegrapher.

40|$|Abstract — The {{increasing}} demand of electric power in electric vehicles cannot be supplied by conventional automotive power networks. Therefore novel power bus systems, capable {{to deliver the}} required power are under development. These bus systems have higher operating voltages, which result in lower current amplitudes for power transmission. As power efficiency {{is one of the}} main factors determining the range of an electric car with a given battery capacity, fast slew rates of the power semi-conductors are preferred. But with increasing slew rates also emitted <b>radio</b> frequency (RF) <b>disturbances</b> increase. To reduce electromagnetic interferences (EMI) of power electronics a complete shielding of the power bus system is necessary. Thus the network configuration is changed from unshielded single core multi wire harnesses into coaxial conductor layouts, and therefore also the impedance characteristics of the entire network are changed. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of automotive components is measured according to CISPR 25, substituting the vehicle environment with line impedance stabilization networks (LISN). Recent research shows that LISNs, developed for low voltage networks, are not ideal to measure conducted emissions of high voltage (HV) components because of changed characteristic impedances and additional shielding. This paper deals with a method of determining the high-frequency impedances of automotive HV power networks. A Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) is used to measure Scattering parameters of different HV power cables and an automotive Li-Ion accumulator battery. Matrix conversions allow calculating an impedance network, which is able to represent an automotive HV networks...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a greater project run by No Picnic: the {{development}} of a brand new food store concept with a clear focus on healthy and ecological food and good service. It should be easy and pleasant to shop healthy food. The concept gives a global approach including skilled staff, interior decoration, advanced technology solutions and a good layout. The main focus of the thesis is to develop functional and intelligent interior for the store, and the project later focuses on developing a concept shopping cart, cart flow, a check-out station and the user interface for the information system. Literature studies, competitor analysis and a survey are carried through. They indicate that more focus on health is needed since people’s health is deteriorating. People need to find more pleasure in shopping and cooking, and make it with consideration for both their own health and the environment. There are some food stores similar to the concept internationally. However, they tend to focus on ecological food rather than healthy food, even if the first often implies the other. A problem definition is set to construct and design a smart, ergonomic and aesthetic concept for moving merchandise through the store that also helps finding nutrition values and other information about the products. The concept should also integrate an automatic check out function. A problem analysis is made which results in lists of requirements and wishes. One condition is given from the beginning, namely that the concept is to be optimized for use with an item-level RFID solution. This eliminates repacking of merchandise but requires an environment with no <b>radio</b> signal <b>disturbance.</b> Six concepts for moving items in-store are presented: one handheld, one carried on the arm, one shoulder-strap basket, two carts and one modular cart with bagholders. Evaluation shows that the concepts need to be improved to allow space-efficient storage and to minimize metal as construction material as it disturbs radio waves for the implemented RFID solutions. The concept development results in a small and convenient four-wheeled cart concept, CartER, almost solely made of plastic and with two foldable shelves. The back wheels are fixed while the front ones are flywheels, which makes the cart easy to manoeuvre. The sides of the cart are low to avoid heavy lifting and extra functions such as coat hanger, shopping list display and dampers, are integrated. The cart is supplemented with high quality, stable and strong paper bags, BagZ, with soft handles and slightly converging sides for optimal fitting in the cart. These bags can either be used like conventional baskets, or up to two can be placed on each shelf of the cart. The information system consists of E-ink signs and shelf strips, possibly a display on CartER, the check-out system CheckOUT and Active Spots, which are small areas within reach of a RFID reader with a touch screen for customer interaction. The information system is connected to the Internet and the store's website. The check-out is an Active Spot for non- staff operated payment.
