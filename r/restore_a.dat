5|$|In 2006, the Kakapo Recovery Programme {{presented}} a new management {{plan that would}} run from 2006 to 2016. The key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity (since the low number of individuals {{can be expected to}} result in inbreeding depression), maintain or <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the kakapo population, and maintain public awareness and support.|$|E

5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Lee learned that Venerable Tao Chiai wanted to <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> {{dilapidated}} Chinese temple in Sarnath (the deer park where the Buddha gave his first sermon after his enlightenment) that a Chinese emperor of the Tang Dynasty {{built in the}} 8th century AD. Venerable Tao Chiai died before he could accomplish this task; however, his chief disciple, Venerable Teh Yue, continued the restoration project, which Lee personally funded. Lee went {{on a pilgrimage to}} India with Venerable Teh Yue and brought along an English engineer, A. H. King, to assess and assist the restoration works. This temple still stands today in Sarnath and is called simply The Chinese Temple in Sarnath.|$|E
5|$|Plans to {{construct}} a road from Brawley to Glamis date from 1953; the road would provide improved access to two newer state parks. The ceding of the Chocolate Mountains to the U.S. Navy had closed a north–south road traversing Imperial County, and the government needed to <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> corridor for local residents to use, as the road was closed during the day for five days a week. However, in August, the Riverside Chamber of Commerce opposed the construction, even though it would replace the Niland–Blythe road. The chamber reversed its stance in December, as the road would mostly be constructed in Imperial County.|$|E

5|$|Twelve Knights are {{available}} from the start (including Arthur King), each with his own weapon, personality and statistics for life force, defense, strength and speed. Each boss of the game has a specific weakness against one of the Knights. Changing party members is done by visiting the Round Table room in Camelot. Each character has a life meter, and Arthur also has a power meter. Various items must be collected to complete quests and objectives, while some can be used to <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> character's life meter.|$|E
5|$|In 1179, William {{was one of}} {{the delegates}} from Jerusalem and the other crusader states at the Third Lateran Council; among the others were Heraclius, {{archbishop}} of Caesarea, Joscius, bishop of Acre and William's future successor in Tyre, the bishops of Sebastea, Bethlehem, Tripoli, and Jabala, and the abbot of Mount Sion. Patriarch Amalric and Patriarch of Antioch Aimery of Limoges were unable to attend, and William and the other bishops did not have sufficient weight to persuade Pope Alexander III of the need for a new crusade. William was, however, sent by Alexander as an ambassador to Emperor Manuel, and Manuel then sent him on a mission to the Principality of Antioch. William does not mention exactly what happened during these embassies, but he probably discussed the Byzantine alliance with Jerusalem, and Manuel's protectorate over Antioch, where, due to pressure from Rome and Jerusalem, the emperor was forced to give up his attempts to <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> Greek patriarch. William was absent from Jerusalem for two years, returning home in 1180.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any direct damage {{as long as there}} is at least one Bezel. If there are enough Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked into the air and the Bezel is shattered into shards that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking direct damage from every attack. Four Bezel Shards must be collected by the characters in order to <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> Bezel and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up Bezel Shards to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Lancastrian {{forces were}} {{regrouping}} in Yorkshire and raiding York's and Salisbury's estates and tenants. Thomas Neville accompanied {{them when they}} marched out of London on 2 December 1460 to <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> semblance of order to the region; they arrived at York's Sandal Castle on 21 of the month. It is possible that a Christmas Truce was arranged; in any case, nine days later, York, his son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, Salisbury, Thomas, {{and many of their}} closest retainers led a sortie in strength to attack a Lancastrian army gathered near the castle. Here, at the Battle of Wakefield, they went down to a crushing defeat, and Thomas died in combat, his father was subsequently executed, and their heads were displayed above the gates of York.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{from the}} end of the 10th century Skopje {{experienced}} a period of wars and political troubles. Bulgarian capital from 972 to 992, Samuil ruled it from 976 until 1004 when its governor Roman surrendered it to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Bulgar Slayer in 1004 in exchange of the titles of patrician and strategos. Later, Skopje was briefly seized twice by Slavic insurgents who wanted to <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> Bulgarian state. At first in 1040 under Peter Delyan's command, and in 1072 under the orders of Georgi Voyteh. In 1081, Skopje was captured by Norman troops led by Robert Guiscard and the city remained in their hands until 1088. Skopje was subsequently conquered by the Serbian Grand Prince Vukan in 1093, and again by the Normans four years later. However, because of epidemics and food shortage, Normans quickly surrendered to the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{was among}} several authors {{who wrote about}} Florida {{following}} the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something {{that may have been}} allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.|$|E

5|$|The Angolan {{military}} launched Operation <b>Restore,</b> <b>a</b> massive offensive, in September 1999, recapturing N'harea, Mungo and Andulo and Bailundo, {{the site}} of Savimbi's headquarters just one year before. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 1268 on 15 October, instructing United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to update the Security Council {{to the situation in}} Angola every three months. Dos Santos offered an amnesty to UNITA militants on 11 November. By December, Chief of Staff General João de Matos said the Angolan Armed Forces had destroyed 80% of UNITA's militant wing and captured 15,000tons of military equipment. Following the dissolution of the coalition government, Savimbi retreated to his historical base in Moxico and prepared for battle. In order to isolate UNITA, the government forced civilians in countryside areas subject to UNITA influence to relocate to major cities. The strategy was successful isolating in UNITA but had adverse humanitarian consequences.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Miami {{was also}} {{recently}} awarded a federal grant {{as part of}} the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program to <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> connection between the Florida East Coast Railway's yard in Hialeah and the Port of Miami, directly connecting the port to rail networks across the United States, as well as re-establish the port's on-dock rail capability (loading and unloading directly between ships and trains). The railroad bridge connecting the Port of Miami to the mainland was damaged by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, at which time service was suspended, and the bridge remained closed for well over a decade. Rail service to the port was restored by 2014. The rail project is part of another element of increasing PortMiami's capacity; an inland intermodal center to be built near the airport known as Flagler Logistics Hub, which was planned to be built on 300 acres of land in Hialeah.|$|E
