40|$|Office {{machines}} (such as printers, scanners, fax, and copiers) can consume {{significant amounts}} of power. Few studies have been devoted to power management of office equipment. Most office machines have sleep modes to save power. Power management of these machines are usually timeout-based: a machine sleeps after being idle long enough. Setting the timeout duration can be difficult: if it is too long, the <b>machine</b> <b>wastes</b> power during idleness. If it is too short, the machine sleeps too soon and too often—the wakeup delay can significantly degrade productivity. Thus, power management is a tradeoff between saving energy and keeping short response time. Many power management policies have been published and one policy may outperform another in some scenarios. There is no definite conclusion which policy is always better. This thesis describes two methods for office equipment power management. The first method adaptively reduces power based on a constraint of the wakeup delay. The second method is a hybrid with multiple candidate policies and it selects the most appropriate power management policy. Using six months of request traces from 18 different offices, we demonstrate that the hybrid policy outperforms individual policies. We also discover that power management based on business hours does not produce consistent energy savings. ...|$|R

For that purpose, {{the material and}} heat balance of the cardboard machine at Umka Cardboard Mill has been determined. Field measurements were conducted in order to define the unknown values of process parameters used for calculation in the balance equations and modelling. The focus {{was given to the}} cardboard drying section, which consumes most of the energy supplied to the machine. Additional aim of the work presented in the paper was to evaluate the specific energy consumption and the thermal ef-ficiency of all individual energy units within the machine’s drying section. The results indicate two main sources of waste heat: waste heat released to the atmosphere with the discharge air from the present waste heat recovery system (14, 380 kW), and waste heat released in the hall from the machine and extracted by the hall ventilation system (4, 430 kW). Waste heat from both sources is cha-racterized by fairly low temperatures 58 - 75 °С and fairly high moisture content (30 - 40 g/kg).

40|$|State {{of the art}} in {{multi-stage}} {{production systems}} is End-Of-Line (EOL) quality control. The main drawback of EOL inspection is the off-line inspection at {{the final stage of}} the manufacturing chain, where already all possible defects of the production chain have been accumulated. Thus, a defective workpiece is <b>machined</b> <b>wasting</b> time, money and energy resources for creating a final product, which is out of tolerances and has to be recycled or scrapped. To overcome this drawback it is necessary to create solutions to reduce either defect generation or defect propagation. This paper focusses on the second approach, which aims at repairing defective workpieces by adapting consecutive process parameters in a multi-stage production system (downstream repair). By applying this concept to the production of electrical drives for power train applications, the effort needed for EOL testing can be reduced by shifting testing steps into the previous process chain. The currently used total flux measurement of laminated steel stacks is replaced by a space-resolved measurement. This permits the identification and local allocation of deviations in the magnetic field due to defective or weak magnets. The downstream repair strategy solves an optimization problem in order to compensate deviations in the magnetic field of single laminated steel stacks by adapting the assembly stage. Two repair strategies are discussed within this paper, namely sequential and selective assembly. In the proper assembling sequence, the laminated steel stacks are then assembled on the rotor according to the optimal assembling policy. Thus deviations of the laminated steel stacks are compensated. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

Recent regulations have, however, rendered most of these solvents unacceptable for these purposes. New processes which are being used or which have been proposed to replace these solvents usually either fail to remove water soluble contaminants or produce significant aqueous wastes which must then be disposed of. In this work, a new method for cleaning surfaces will be investigated. Solubility of typical contaminants such as lubricating greases and phosphatizing bath residues will be studied in several surfactant/supercritical fluid solutions. The effect of temperature, pressure, and {{the composition of the}} cleaning mixture on the solubility of oily, polar, and ionic contaminants will be investigated.

Additionally, knowledge of detergents and spot treatment products is sparse. Samples of still bottoms and separator water, and cleaning products were taken from ten petroleum based hydrocarbon solvent dry cleaners in King County and one cleaner using a new solvent (Solvon K 4) to the market based on butylal. The samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOC), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC), metals, pH, flash point, and total organic halogens (TOH). This information was used to characterize the waste using Washington State hazardous waste criteria. All samples of hydrocarbon and butylal still bottoms designated as dangerous waste on the basis of TOH. Five of the ten hydrocarbon solvent still bottom samples also had flash points below 140 ˚F as did one of the four butylal still bottom samples. Only one sample of separator water designated as dangerous. This sample was visually different from the others, with a clear layer of solvent on the surface. A wide variety of spot treatment products are used by the dry cleaners sampled. Six of these contained probable or potential carcinogens at concentrations greater than 0. 1 % not listed as such on the MSDS. Additionally, one of the seven detergents sampled contained 0. 11 % methylene chloride. These findings raise concerns for occupation exposure to toxic chemicals that the workers may not be aware of even if they have read the MSDS for the products they work with on a daily basis. The waste characterization indicates that waste from alternative solvent dry cleaners may be considered dangerous waste and should be treated as such with proper disposal and handling procedures...|$|R

The properties of the lever, the wheel-and-axle, etc., are recognised in every machine, and to machinery in these times we owe all production. Trace the history of the breakfast-roll. The soil out of which it came was drained with machine-made tiles; the surface was turned over by a machine; the wheat was reaped, thrashed, and winnowed by machines; by machinery it was ground and bolted; and had the flour been sent to Gosport, it might have been made into biscuits by a machine. Look round the room in which you sit. If modern, probably the bricks in its walls were machine-made; and by machinery the flooring was sawn and planed, the mantel-shelf sawn and polished, the paper-hangings made and printed. The veneer on the table, the turned legs of the chairs, the carpet, the curtains, are all products of machinery. Your clothing--plain, figured, or printed--is it not wholly woven, nay, perhaps even sewed, by machinery? And the volume you are reading--are not its leaves fabricated by one machine and covered with these words by another? Add to which that for the means of distribution over both land and sea, we are similarly indebted.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Plymouth in partial fulfilment for the degree of Master of Philosophy, Department of Mechanical and Marine Engineering, Faculty of TechnologyThe recent expansion of civil aviation {{has been accompanied by}} significant growth in the use of advanced composite structures with carbon fibre reinforced epoxy often the material of choice in many structures. Composite structures have a long history in engine nacelles, where an optimised design can both fulfil structural requirements and simultaneously provide an acoustic liner for sound attenuation. The "traditional process" involves the drilling of high-density multiple holes with the twin consequences of extended production times and <b>machining</b> <b>waste.</b> Elimination of this perforation process is an attractive target in a commercial environment. Structural performance could be improved by retaining fibre continuity whilst controlling fibre paths around the perforations through a moulding approach. This thesis reports an investigation to evaluate novel approaches to moulding multiple perforations in composite structures and the application of those approaches in both traditional pre-preg and resin infusion processing technologies. Two approaches were explored: castable soluble pins and an adaptation of z-pinning technology. The composites produced using one of these techniques were subjected to mechanical testing (tension, compression and interlaminar shear) both dry and after exposure to hot/wet conditions. The laminates were also characterised for thickness variation, fibre volume fraction, degree-of-cure, glass transition temperature and acoustic impedance. These validations demonstrated that while significant improvements to property retention can be achieved for tensile loading conditions, certain compression conditions fail to achieve the same benefits. It was also found that a key aspect to implementing any perforation moulding technique lies in consistently achieving high quality hole definition to retain acoustic impedance performance. From the concept characterisation, a preliminary weight and detailed cost analysis were developed to assess the industrial feasibility for the method developed. This analysis showed that, with further investigation and the right application selection, the benefits of the novel approach could be realised. In collaboration with GKN Aerospace Limite...|$|R
