40|$|In {{the article}} a modern data {{processing}} method of reflectometry measurement of communication line, {{based on the}} application of wavelet transform to reflectograms is claimed. This method {{is based on a}} multi-level one-dimensional dis- crete wavelet-decomposition of the <b>reflectogram</b> to the j level (depth) allowing decomposition of the <b>reflectogram</b> into ap- proximation and detail coefficients, containing information on the useful and noise components of the <b>reflectogram.</b> The noise term of the <b>reflectogram</b> is most clearly revealed in the detail coefficients obtained at the lowest decomposition level (j = 1, 2, 3), and which needs to be applied to the threshold processing with different threshold for each coefficient thus the removal of sufficiently small coefficients, which are considered to be noise, is carried out. After this processing of detail coefficients reconstructed <b>reflectogram,</b> with great accuracy, corresponds to the <b>reflectogram</b> without the noise term, that will significantly reduce the localization error of damage and discontinuity of communication line. Evaluation is carried out by comparing mean-square error of recovered, noisy, and original <b>reflectogram</b> without the noise component, {{as well as on the}} basis of visual comparison of these reflectograms...|$|E

Conversely, established acoustical metrics derived from the measured room impulse responses (RIRs) in both multichannel reproduction setups do not highlight the differences noticed in the <b>reflectograms.</b> The potential consequences regarding individual system properties and the metrics themselves are discussed in this work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{identify}} if a subscriber loop is suitable for DSL service, the transfer function of the loop has to be estimated. Several measurement techniques exist, however Single Ended Line Testing is gaining much attention lately. This method allows only measuring at the central office side and yields a <b>reflectogram.</b> One of the critical issues in the estimation of the transfer function from this data is the correct extraction {{of the features of}} the <b>reflectogram.</b> This paper presents a new feature extraction algorithm for a previously reported transfer function estimator. It starts by explaining the previously reported algorithm. Its main drawbacks are modelling errors and loss of information due to the iterative approach. The paper explains how the new algorithm tackles these problems. The new method strongly relies on the first and second derivatives of the <b>reflectogram,</b> which is a completely new approach. Finally, the efficiency of both algorithms is compared. The improvements are both in terms of accuracy and identification time...|$|E
30|$|Caution must be {{exercised}} {{in interpreting the}} infrared <b>reflectogram.</b> Specifically, the effectiveness of infrared reflectography decreases due to (1) the usage of light colored grounds, which are less reflective than white chalk-based preparation layers (2) the application of thick paint layers and (3) the use of low infrared-absorbing drawing materials.|$|E
40|$|Coal is a {{heterogeneous}} substance and its heterogeneity is identified and characterized by variation in reflectance. The main {{objective of this}} paper is to characterize the heterogeneity of char and to correlate it with the coal <b>reflectogram,</b> which accounts for both rank and maceral composition effects. Chars from two density fractions in a set of coals were obtained in a Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) at 1400 degrees C in N- 2 environment. The chars were examined under a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and the morphology information was obtained from the image-processing technique. The average porosity of char changes systematically with the FMR of its parent coals (defined as the summation of each reflectance multiplied with its frequency). The char porosity increased with an increase in FMR up to a critical value around 98. With further increase in FMR, the corresponding char becomes dense. The char macro porosity distribution was found to be related to the coal <b>reflectogram.</b> In general, the char porosity distribution shows two peaks, which corresponds to the inertinite and vitrinite peaks in <b>reflectogram.</b> The intensity depends on the maceral content. The relationship between the char porosity and coal reflectance for this set of sample has been found, which is strongly dependent on the coal rank. However. these findings cannot be applied to coals with a strong maceral association (microlithotype) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{elimination}} of cracks in infrared <b>reflectograms</b> is presented. Infrared <b>reflectograms</b> show the underdrawing – the basic concept of the artist drawn on the ground layer – in ancient wood panel paintings. Caused by different mechanical behaviour of the panel and the covering ground layer during the aging of the painting, cracks appear. Cracks not only disturb the appearance of a painting, but are also a problem for segmenting the lines and strokes of the underdrawing. A method based on mathematical morphology, namely morphological reconstruction with viscosity, is used to eliminate the cracks while keeping as much detail as possible in the brush strokes. A priori information that the cracks are usually thinner than the brush strokes and have a preferred orientation is taken into account. 1...|$|R
30|$|In {{this section}} {{we aim to}} fuse the details {{appearing}} in the near infrared <b>reflectogram</b> (IR) with the colours of the visible colour image, in particular the skin tones, to create a digital version of the illuminations as they could have looked before overpainting. Since we only have access to one near infrared <b>reflectogram</b> and we cannot chose the wavelength and have no information on the pigments used, {{we find ourselves in}} one of the following three situations: (i) the added cloth is transparent in the IR; (ii) the added cloth appears in the IR but without texture; (iii) the added cloth and its texture appear in the IR. The fact that the original pigments can also be IR transparent poses an additional challenge. For these different situations we use different methods all based {{on the use of the}} linear image osmosis model studied by Weickert et al. in [31].|$|E

40|$|Proximate and {{ultimate}} analyses of a coal {{are regarded as}} sufficient to describe its chemical composition, {{and they have been}} widely used for practical applications. However, coal is actually a heterogeneous substance and is composed of different materials (macerals); therefore, the corresponding chemical compositions are average values of the individual composition of the macerals present in the coal. The reflectance distribution of a coal (the <b>reflectogram),</b> which shows the heterogeneity of the coal, can be represented by several reflectance bins. In this paper, the variation of chemical properties of a coal is differentiated by the difference in reflectance. The main focus {{of this paper is to}} establish correlations between chemical properties of a single reflectance bin and its reflectance from a maceral-independent approach and maceral-dependent approach. The bulk chemical properties (volatile matter (VM) content, ratio of hydrogen to carbon (H/C), etc.) of a coal then can be obtained by adding the properties of each individual reflectance bin together. Proximate {{and ultimate}} analyses with <b>reflectogram</b> analyses were conducted for 29 coal samples. A least-squares fit strategy was applied to derive the correlations, which were then used to predict the bulk properties of another eight samples. The relative error of the estimated VM from the maceral-dependent approach is 3. 9 %, whereas the relative error from the maceral-independent approach is 7. 9 %. No single reflectance bin data are available in the literature; therefore, comparisons between the properties of single reflectance bin from maceral-dependent approach and bulk properties of maceral-rich fractions (bulk VM content versus mean maceral reflectance) in the literature have been made, and both show similar qualitative trends...|$|E

We concentrate on an algorithm for the automatic segmentation of strokes in underdrawings- the basic concept of the artist- in ancient panel paintings and the removal of cracks in infrared images. The purpose of the stroke analysis is the determination of the drawing tool used to draft the painting. This information allows significant support for a systematic stylistic approach in the analysis of paintings. Stroke segmentation in paintings is related to the extraction and recognition of handwriting, therefore similar techniques to segment the strokes from the background incorporating boundary information are used.

30|$|Infrared reflectography (IRR) {{remains an}} {{important}} method to visualize underdrawing and compositional changes in paintings. Older IRR camera systems are being replaced with near-infrared cameras consisting of room temperature infrared detector arrays {{made out of}} indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) that operate over the spectral range of ~ 900 to 1700  nm. Two camera types are becoming prevalent. The first is staring array infrared cameras having 0.25 – 1 Megapixels where the camera or painting is moved to acquire tens of individual images that are later mosaicked together to create the infrared <b>reflectogram.</b> The second camera type is scanning back cameras in which a small InGaAs array (linear or area array) is mechanically scanned over a large image formed by the camera lens to create the <b>reflectogram,</b> typically 16 Megapixels. Both systems have advantages and disadvantages. The staring IR array cameras offer more flexible collection formats, provide live images, and allow {{for the use of}} spectral bandpass filters that can provide reflectograms with better contrast in some cases. They do require a mechanical system for moving the camera or the artwork and post-capture image mosaicking. Scanning back cameras eliminate or reduce the amount of mosaicking and movement of the camera, however the need to minimize light exposure to the artwork requires short integration times, and thus limits the use of spectral bandpass filters. In general, InGaAs cameras are not sensitive in the 1700 to ~ 2300  nm spectral region, which has been identified in prior studies as useful for examining paintings with copper green pigments or thick lead white paints. Prior studies using cameras with sensitivity from 1000 to 2500  nm have found in general the performance at wavelengths longer than 1700  nm degraded relative to the performance at shorter wavelengths. Thus, there is interest in a camera system having improved performance out to 2500  nm that can utilize spectral bandpass filters.|$|E
40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT), ultrasound {{and other}} reflection based biomedical imaging technologies involve image signal processing that {{is primarily a}} filtering, digitizing and summing process so that the tissue cross-section can be visualized.

A physician can make a subjective interpretation and evaluation from the B and/or C-scans {{that may lead to}} actions impacting on the patient&# 039;s prognosis.

40|$|Automated imaging {{techniques}} were refined to characterise {{the rank and}} maceral composition of coals by a full maceral <b>reflectogram</b> of polished coal grain mounts. Precision was improved by processing individual grains in each image separately and correcting within the software for the topography that occurs between the different macerals and minerals in the grains. Maceral group proportions and vitrinite reflectance information extracted from these reflectograms compared well with manual results for a comprehensive suite of Australian coals varying in rank from a mean vitrinite reflectance of 0. 48 - 2. 13 %. A parameter that combines rank and type calculated from the reflectograms correlated strongly with chemical properties determined by ultimate and proximate analyses. For {{a limited number of}} samples, for which coking tests had been performed, this parameter also correlated with estimated coking performance.
