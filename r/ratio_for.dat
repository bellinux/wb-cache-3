5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium <b>ratio,</b> <b>for</b> which the data is usually given).

40|$|Odds <b>ratios</b> <b>for</b> {{head and}} neck cancer {{increase}} with greater cigarette and alcohol use and lower body mass index (BMI; weight (kg) /height 2 (m 2)). Using data from the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium, the authors conducted a formal analysis of BMI as a modifier of smoking- and alcohol-related effects. Analysis of never and current smokers included 6, 333 cases, while analysis of never drinkers and consumers of ≤ 10 drinks/day included 8, 452 cases. There were 8, 000 or more controls, depending on the analysis. Odds <b>ratios</b> <b>for</b> all sites increased with lower BMI, greater smoking, and greater drinking. In polytomous regression, odds <b>ratios</b> <b>for</b> BMI (P = 0. 65), smoking (P = 0. 52), and drinking (P = 0. 73) were homogeneous for oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers. Odds <b>ratios</b> <b>for</b> BMI and drinking were greater for oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer (P < 0. 01), while smoking odds <b>ratios</b> were greater <b>for</b> laryngeal cancer (P < 0. 01). Lower BMI enhanced smoking- and drinking-related odds <b>ratios</b> <b>for</b> oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer (P < 0. 01), while BMI did not modify smoking and drinking odds <b>ratios</b> <b>for</b> laryngeal cancer. The increased odds <b>ratios</b> <b>for</b> all sites with low BMI may suggest related carcinogenic mechanisms; however, BMI modification of smoking and drinking odds <b>ratios</b> <b>for</b> cancer of the oral cavity/pharynx but not larynx cancer suggests additional factors specific to oral cavity/pharynx cancer...|$|R

5|$|Investigation on this {{reaction}} was continued; {{the research was}} aimed at looking for fission fragments of isotopes of element 105. A subsequent paper was published in February 1970. Two activities were found, with half-lives of 14 ms and 2.2±0.5 s. The former activity was assigned to 242mfAm; the latter one was described as having been caused by an isotope of element 105. The possibility that the latter activity could come from a transfer reaction and thus not be from element 105 {{was said to be}} diminished {{by the fact that the}} yield <b>ratio</b> <b>for</b> {{this reaction}} was lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction. The idea that this synthesis reaction was indeed a (22Ne,xn) reaction was supported by research on reactions of the 243Am target with 18O; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little spontaneous fission (SF) activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, falling in line with theoretical data.|$|E

5|$|This led to {{a series}} of {{increasingly}} sophisticated models to better predict the effectiveness of an ABM system and what the opposition would do to improve their performance against it. A key development was the Prim-Read theory, which provided an entirely mathematical solution to generating the ideal defensive layout. Using a Prim-Read layout for Nike-X, Air Force Brigadier General Glenn Kent began considering Soviet responses. His 1964 report produced a cost-exchange ratio that required $2 of defense for every $1 of offence if one wanted to limit US casualties to 30 percent of the population. The cost increased to 6-to-1 if the US wished to limit casualties to 10 percent. ABMs would only be cheaper than ICBMs if the US was willing to allow over half its population die in the exchange. When he realized he was using outdated exchange rates for the Soviet ruble, the exchange <b>ratio</b> <b>for</b> the 30 percent casualty rate jumped to 20-to-1.|$|E
