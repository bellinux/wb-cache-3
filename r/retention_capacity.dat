40|$|ABSTRACT: Associations {{between high}} overpressures and sparse {{hydrocarbon}} occurrence are commonly ascribed to hydrocarbon leakage through pressure-induced fractures in the cap rock. However, several hydrocarbon traps in the North Viking Graben {{area in the}} North Sea still contain abundant commercial volumes of hydrocarbons at very high pore pressures. By contrast, {{a majority of the}} over-pressured structures at the Halten Terrace further to the north have leaked hydrocarbons, even at considerably lower overpressures. A selection of wells in the North Viking Graben and the Halten Terrace areas was investigated to find possible explanations for these observations. Distinct regional differences emerged, as the emptied reservoirs at the Halten Terrace generally have higher <b>retention</b> <b>capacities</b> than the overpressured discoveries in the North Viking Graben area. Thus, {{there appears to be a}} lack of any clear relationship between structures emptied of hydrocarbons and low <b>retention</b> <b>capacities,</b> which could be expected if pressure-induced fracturing of the cap rock was the main process of the hydrocarbon leakage. The regional differences in <b>retention</b> <b>capacities</b> were mainly attributed to different leakage processes in the two basins. Stress history variations are suggested to be the main controlling factor of these leakage processes...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic and {{selenium}} compounds may be emitted to {{the environment}} during coal conversion processes, although some compounds are retained in the fly ashes, in different proportions depending {{on the characteristics of}} the ashes and process conditions. The possibility of optimizing the conditions to achieve better trace element retention appears to be an attractive, economical option for reducing toxic emissions. This approach requires a good knowledge of fly ash characteristics and a thorough understanding of the capture mechanism involved in the retention. In this work the ability of two fly ashes, one produced in pulverized coal combustion and the other in fluidized bed combustion, to retain arsenic and selenium compounds from the gas phase in coal combustion and coal gasification atmospheres was investigated. To explore the possible simultaneous retention of mercury, the influence of the unburned coal particle content was also evaluated. <b>Retention</b> <b>capacities</b> between 2 and 22 mg g- 1 were obtained under different conditions.

For the TM data distinctly high relative reflectance values (greater than 0. 3) in the near infrared (Band 4, 0. 73 to 0. 94 micrometers) correspond to regions characterized by xeric (dry) forests that overlie soils with low water <b>retention</b> <b>capacities.</b> These soils are derived primarily from rhyolites. More mesic forests characterized by lower TM band 4 relative reflectances are associated with soils of higher <b>retention</b> <b>capacities</b> derived predominately from non-cherty carbonates. The major factors affecting canopy reflectance appear to be the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf optical properties. The Suits canopy reflectance model predicts the relative reflectance values for the xeric canopies. The mesic canopy reflectance is less well matched and incorporation of canopy shadowing caused by the irregular nature of the mesic canopy may be necessary.

40|$|The present work {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of capturing toxic elements other than sulfur in coal gasification flue gases using metal oxide mixtures. Arsenic and selenium compounds were the elements selected for study because they are toxic species which are present in coal gasification flue gases in different amounts, depending on temperature. Among the regenerable sorbents already developed for hot gas cleaning systems in Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles, metal oxide mixtures based on iron, titanium, or zinc oxides (zinc ferrites and zinc titanates) were tested for arsenic and selenium retention. These sorbents have previously been proved to possess good characteristics for H 2 S(g) retention. The study {{was carried out in}} a laboratory scale reactor, using the sorbent in a fixed bed, at 550 °C. Good <b>retention</b> <b>capacities</b> (56 mg g- 1) were obtained in these conditions for selenium in a metal oxide mixture containing zinc titanate. A metal oxide mixture containing zinc ferrite proved to be an appropriate sorbent for both elements, <b>retention</b> <b>capacities</b> being 21 mg g- 1 for arsenic and 55 mg g- 1 for selenium. The results obtained indicate that arsenic and selenium compounds can be retained together with sulfur compounds in these sorbents and be desorbed in the sorbent regeneration processes.

To access the final edited and published work see [URL] collected from the basic oxygen furnaces of two Linz-Donawitz steel making plants were tested as adsorbents for H 2 S removal at room temperature (298 K). Two different particle size fractions, namely < 212 and 212 – 500 μm, were selected from the original slag samples. Dynamic adsorption tests were carried out using a column-bed configuration and <b>retention</b> <b>capacities</b> were calculated after bed exhaustion. <b>Retention</b> <b>capacities</b> as high as 180 mg of H 2 S g– 1 of slag were attained, {{in spite of the}} very low specific surface area of the steel slags. As expected, humidity {{played a crucial role in}} the removal of H 2 S. Particle size had also an important effect on the capacity of the adsorption beds. Analysis of the exhausted slags revealed considerable amounts of elemental sulfur on the surface of the particles. Sulfates were also found on the exhausted slags, especially on the 212 – 500 μm size fractions. The characterization of the slags prior and after the H 2 S adsorption experiments allowed us to postulate plausible mechanisms to understand the outstanding capacity of these steel byproduct for H 2 S adsorption.

40|$|International audienceAging {{triggers}} several abnormalities in muscle glycolytic fibers including increased proteolysis, reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) production and apoptosis. Since the mitochondria are the main site of substrate oxidation, ROS production and programmed cell death, we tried {{to know whether the}} cellular disorders encountered in sarcopenia are due to abnormal mitochondrial functioning. Gastrocnemius mitochondria were extracted from adult (6 months) and aged (21 months) male Wistar rats. Respiration parameters, opening of the permeability transition pore and ROS production, with either glutamate (amino acid metabolism) or pyruvate (glucose metabolism) as a respiration substrate, were evaluated at different matrix calcium concentrations. Pyruvate dehydrogenase and respiratory complex activities as well as their contents measured by Western blotting analysis were determined. Furthermore, the fatty acid profile of mitochondrial phospholipids was also measured. At physiological calcium concentration, state III respiration rate was lowered by aging in pyruvate conditions (- 22 %), but not with glutamate. The reduction of pyruvate oxidation resulted from a calcium-dependent inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase system and could provide for the well-known proteolysis encountered during sarcopenia. Matrix calcium loading and aging increased ROS production. They also reduced the oxidative phosphorylation. This was associated with lower calcium <b>retention</b> <b>capacities,</b> suggesting that sarcopenic fibers are more prone to programmed cell death. Aging was also associated with a reduced mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity, which does not intervene in toxic ROS overproduction but could explain the lower calcium <b>retention</b> <b>capacities.</b> Despite a lower content, cytochrome c oxidase displayed an increased activity associated with an increased n- 6 /n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio of mitochondrial phospholipids. In conclusion, we propose that mitochondria obtained from aged muscle fibers display several functional abnormalities explaining the increased proteolysis, ROS overproduction and vulnerability to apoptosis exhibited by sarcopenic muscle. These changes appear to be related to modifications of the fatty acid profile of mitochondrial lipids...|$|R
