5000|$|Operation Glory was {{the code}} name for Operations Plan KCZ-OPS 14-54 which {{involved}} {{the effort to}} transfer the remains of United Nations Command casualties from North Korea {{at the end of}} the Korean War. The Korean Armistice Agreement of July 1953 called for the repatriation of all casualties and prisoners of war, and through September and October 1954 the Graves <b>Registration</b> Service <b>Command</b> received the remains of approximately 4,000 casualties. Of the 1,868 American remains, 848 unidentified remains were buried as [...] "unknowns" [...] at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii.|$|R
40|$|In This Issue: New Herbicide Registrations Leafy Spurge Control New Herbicide <b>Registrations</b> FMC <b>Command</b> is now {{registered}} {{for use as}} a preemergence application in the following counties: Adams, Antelope, Boyd, Buffalo, Clay, Cedar, Dawson, Dixon, Franklin, Fillmore, Furnas, Hamilton, Harlan, Holt, Jefferson, Kearney, Knox, Nemaha, Pawnee, Phelps, Pierce, Red Willow, Richardson, Saline, Seward, Thayer, Thurston, Wayne, and York. Leafy Spurge Control Leafy spurge, an aggressive plant, continues to spread in Nebraska greatly reducing the carrying capacity of grazing land. The weed is more common across the northern portions of the state but can be found elsewhere. Leafy spurge is a perennial and reproduces from seed as well as from buds on its deep, extensive root system. It reduces forage production and cattle avoid grazing infested areas because it is an irritant and mildly poisonous...|$|R
50|$|In fact, fearing {{theft of}} the company's diamond resources, the MIBA {{actively}} discouraged {{building in the}} region and closely monitored who went {{in and out of the}} region. Every person in the region needed a permit allowing them to be there, and <b>registration</b> at a <b>command</b> post that monitored the population, which made indefinite residence in the area almost impossible to establish. There was limited economic activity besides the company-run mining, with even limited agriculture, and the city's population remained low, at approximately 39,830 by the late 1950s.|$|R
40|$|Dish is {{a command}} {{interpreter}} {{that allows the}} user to create and manipulate Fresco objects interactively or with a script. Dish uses the Tcl[3] language and interpreter for the basic script control flow and object naming. Because Fresco operations are specified in the CORBA Interface Definition Language (IDL), Dish can automatically translate a Tcl command line into the appropriate call using the CORBA dynamic invocation mechanism. Unlike Tk[4], Dish requires no special <b>registration</b> of <b>commands</b> or explicit argument parsing, and commands in Dish scripts can easily be moved into compiled code. Introduction Scripting is a popular form of implementing portions of an interactive application. A command interpreter can either read commands interactively or from a script, and is generally more responsive {{and easier to use}} than a compiled environment. Furthermore, scripting languages tend to be simpler than traditional programming languages and therefore appeal to users who do not wish to lea [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{present the}} {{importance}} of the method on commands in cost calculation and the particularities of the cost calculation method on commands in the furniture industry. This paper presents a hypotetical study on the method on commands, considering the observations made during 2013 - 2014, on how it is organized and managed accounts management using method on commands. By presenting this hypothetical model about the accounting in management accounting using the method on commands, the paper contributes to the correct application of this method in practice, specifically in management accounting in companies from the furniture industry. In my opinion the method on commands is an appropriate method for achieving management accounting for companies that have as main activity the production of furniture. When applying the method on commands in cost calculation and in management accounting, the companies must to consider the particularities of the cost calculation, in the furniture industry, like: technical and economic factors from this sector, the technical details of each command, the codification of the commands, planning materials and labor costs for each command, monitoring and recording production costs, registration of the direct costs, distribution of the indirect costs on <b>commands,</b> <b>registration</b> of the indirect costs and registration in management accounting...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mini-Mental State Examination cutoffs {{have been}} {{presented}} for schooling levels to screen cognitive impairment. However, items may behave differently with regards to education. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the impact of education on MMSE subscales and items. METHOD: Community-dwelling participants aged 65 years or more (n = 990, females = 637, age = 74. 1 years, range 65 - 108) were stratified as illiterate (n = 373), 1 - 8 (n = 540), 9 - 12 (n = 63), and more than 12 years of schooling (n = 14) and were screened with MMSE and Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire. To make the Mini-Mental State Examination items comparable, each item was transformed into z scores. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the effect of schooling on MMSE subs and items controlling for age, sex, and activities of daily life. RESULTS: Temporal and space orientation, attention/calculation, repetition, reading, writing, and drawing scores improved as education increased, but not memory <b>registration,</b> three step <b>command,</b> and naming. Reading and writing displayed the largest coefficients, whereas education exerted no influence on naming and three step command tasks. CONCLUSION: Education does not exert an important effect on naming, three step <b>command,</b> memory <b>registration,</b> and delayed recall. As memory is a key factor for diagnosing dementia, these items could be considered despite education...|$|R
