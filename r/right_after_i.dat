5000|$|In 2015, he gave an {{explanation}} about his split from his former band: [...] "The {{reason for the}} separation of MORBID ANGEL and I was not really a religious matter.

I had to get my back fixed, and they were gonna wait for me, actually, for me to recover. But then it took more than what we expected it was gonna take. So the bottom line is MORBID ANGEL could not wait for me, because I could not do it for years. So they had to find a new drummer. And that's the reason why I don't play in MORBID ANGEL anymore. Four years it took… I didn't even think I was gonna come back and play drums again, because I was really bad. I was, like, four years of recovering. And while MORBID ANGEL had already done a new record with a new guy, I recall. And so, in 2012, <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> recorded TERRORIZER's 'Hordes Of Zombies' record, during that year, somehow that's when I found God.

[...] "They moved into my basement in August, before I went to the Vuelta a Espana, and <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had ridden the Meisterschaft von Zurich.
