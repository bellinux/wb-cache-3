Inland, freshwater-dependent birds such as the common merganser, osprey, <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawk,</b> great blue heron, and Steller's jay {{are a few of}} the bird species that have been documented. At least 400 bird species have been documented in the forestlands.|$|E
25|$|Other raptors, {{large and}} small, are often {{outright}} dominated by golden eagles. In Eurasia, the relative paucity of mid-sized Buteo species {{is thought to}} be due to the radiation of large Aquila eagles that already occupied the large raptor niche and outcompeted them. In North America, where there are no Aquila eagles other than the golden eagle, Buteo species are more diverse with at least 3 large hawks (the red-tailed, Swainson's (Buteo swainsoni) and ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis)) that occur in similar habitats and sometimes eat similar prey as both each other and golden eagles. On occasion, golden eagles will kleptoparasitize or even predate these three Buteos. Other small to medium-sized diurnal raptors are known to occasionally be hunted by golden eagles, including ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), black kite (Milvus migrans), hen harriers (Circus cyaneus), Eurasian sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), Cooper's hawks (Accipter cooperii), northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), common buzzards (Buteo buteo), long-legged buzzards (Buteo rufinus), upland buzzards (Buteo hemilasius), rough-legged buzzards, Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), American kestrels (Falco sparverius), merlins (Falco columbarius), prairie falcons and gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus). Occasionally, golden eagles may even boldly predate these smaller species during migration in mid-flight, as was recorded at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary with a <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawk.</b> It is thought that on rare occasions, more nimble, smaller raptors like rough-legged buzzards and harriers can kleptoparatisize golden eagles. Interestingly, northern goshawks in Scandinavia rely on grouse to about the same extent as golden eagles there and even hunt in similar forest edge habitats there. However, the goshawks primarily hunt neonatal and fledgling grouse (30% and 53% of their take of grouse) rather than adult grouse (17% of their prey) in late summer when grouse dominate other birds in their diet, whereas the eagles seem to mainly adult grouse and hunt them aseasonally. Similarly, hen harriers may become somewhat specialized at taking young red grouse, whereas the eagles are more likely to take adults.|$|E

5000|$|In the East, {{individuals}} from the northern half of the species’ range are migratory. In the West, most populations are sedentary. <b>Red-shouldered</b> <b>hawks</b> are short- to moderate-distance migrants, with most individuals traveling distances between 300 km and 1,500 km each way. The species follows leading lines, migrating along inland ridges and coastlines. Larger numbers of <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawks</b> are counted at coastal watchsites than at inland sites. Juveniles often precede adults on migration in autumn, whereas adults precede juveniles in the spring. <b>Red-shouldered</b> <b>hawks</b> typically migrate alone, although they sometimes form small flocks of three or more birds. The species usually avoids crossing large bodies of water. While migrating, <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawks</b> are observed in soaring, gliding, and flapping flight ...|$|R

2500|$|The genus Buteo, {{known as}} [...] "hawks" [...] in North America {{and not to}} be {{confused}} with vultures, has worldwide distribution but is particularly well represented in North America. The red-tailed hawk, ferruginous hawk, and rarely, the <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawk</b> are all examples of species from this genus that are used in falconry today. The red-tailed hawk is hardy and versatile, taking rabbits, hares, and squirrels; given the right conditions it can catch geese, ducks, pheasants, and even wild turkeys. The red-tailed hawk is also considered a good bird for beginners. The Eurasian or common buzzard is also used, although this species requires more perseverance if rabbits are to be hunted.|$|E

[...] Peak migration in the fall is from the last week in September through the first week in October.

50|$|Although {{they have}} lived as long as within a month of 20 years old, few live half that long and only around half survive their first year. Each year overall nesting success can be lower than 30 percent. Early {{mortality}} can be due to natural causes, relating to harsh weather conditions, or more often starvation. Young hawks are often parasitized by species such as Trichomonas gallinae, Protocalliphora avium, and blood parasites. Humans, unintentionally or intentionally are a threat to <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawks,</b> including hunting, collision with electric wires, road accidents and logging. A further common cause of mortality is natural predation. Raccoons, martens, fishers and large arboreal snakes can predate eggs, hatchlings, fledgings and occasionally incubating and brooding adults. Non-nesting adults, being a fairly large and powerful predator, have fewer natural predators, but (both {{during and after the}} breeding season as well among nestling hawks) they may be predated by great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, barred owls, other <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawks,</b> northern goshawks, peregrine falcons, prairie falcons, and bald and golden eagles. In western New York, the main cause of nest failure was stated to be great horned owl predation. Many of the same predators sometimes compete over territory and food with this species. Despite their highly similar diet and habitat preferences, it has been found that <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawks</b> can nest within 48 m barred owl without interspecies conflict. In Florida, <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawks</b> sometimes collaborate and peaceably coexist with American crows (usually an enemy to all other birds because of their egg-hunting habits) so they cooperatively mob mutual predators, mainly great horned owls and red-tailed hawks.|$|R

50|$|Prior to 1900, the <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawk</b> {{was one of}} {{the most}} common North American raptors. Population densities have {{decreased}} precipitously due to the clearing of mature forests (principally the wet hardwood forest they prefer) since that time. The changing of habitats has led to a general population increase of the red-tailed hawk, an occasional predator of its cousin. Additionally affecting the <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawk</b> was the greater availability of firearms in the early 1900s, leading to unchecked hunting of this and all other raptor species until conservation laws took effect in the latter half of the 20th century. Local forest regrowth and the ban of hunting has allowed <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawk</b> populations to become more stable again and the species is not currently considered conservation dependent. In Florida, the <b>red-shouldered</b> <b>hawk</b> is perhaps the most commonly seen and heard raptor species (outside of abundant black and turkey vultures). However, human activity, including logging, poisoning from insecticides and industrial pollutants, continue to loom as threats to the species.Before its use was outlawed in the United States, red-shouldered hawks and other raptors suffered from exposure to DDT, a pesticide. The DDT would cause their eggs to have thin, breakable shells, reducing their ability to reproduce. Accidental encounters with power lines and automobiles also take a toll on hawks. In spite of these dangers, habitat loss remains the biggest threat to red-shouldered hawks.|$|E
