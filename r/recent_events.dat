5|$|Borrowing {{from the}} French again, Planché {{introduced}} the revue (or review) to British theatre, as {{a commentary on}} <b>recent</b> <b>events,</b> particularly events in the theatre. His first revue, Success; or, a hit if you like it, was produced in 1825. He wrote another seven over the next 30 years, a peak of four in the years 1853–1855.|$|E

5|$|ATMOS is {{marketing}} {{a satellite}} navigation system developed by young prodigy Luke Rattigan (Ryan Sampson). The system also reduces {{carbon dioxide emissions}} to zero; UNIT requested the Doctor's help because the technology is not contemporary and might be alien. UNIT are also concerned about fifty-two simultaneous deaths occurring spontaneously several days earlier. The Doctor travels to Rattigan's private school to investigate the system and discovers that the <b>recent</b> <b>events</b> have been plotted by an alien warrior race known as the Sontarans.|$|E
5|$|As Chapter 66 of his On the Reckoning of Time, in 725 Bede {{wrote the}} Greater Chronicle (chronica maiora), which {{sometimes}} circulated {{as a separate}} work. For <b>recent</b> <b>events</b> the Chronicle, like his Ecclesiastical History, relied upon Gildas, upon {{a version of the}} Liber pontificalis current at least to the papacy of Pope Sergius I (687–701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on Eusebius's Chronikoi Kanones. The dating of events in the Chronicle is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the anno mundi.|$|E
5|$|Fears grew {{about the}} threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were particularly concerned about the potential of a French raid on the city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich {{and the experience of}} Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated by a French attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the <b>recent</b> <b>events</b> of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E

5|$|In 1831 {{there were}} {{extensive}} riots in the Forest of Dean, led by Warren James. After {{the intervention of}} the military, the rioters were dispersed and order restored, but a range of complaints were levied about the enforcement of the local laws on miners and metal-workers. There had been attacks against St Briavels Castle by discontented locals before during the 1780s, but the degree of violence in this case was much greater. An act of Parliament followed, establishing a number of commissioners who investigated local practices and <b>recent</b> <b>events</b> at the Castle.|$|E
5|$|In a later scene, Marcus {{encounters}} Sal. Marcus {{wants to}} apologize for his misbehavior, and chases Sal when he flees. Sal runs onto a street right ahead of an oncoming truck. Before the truck can hit Sal, the laughing man kicks Sal out of the way, sacrificing his own life for Sal's. Miranda finds the fourth note in Richard's shoe and learns that the laughing man came from the future to save Sal's life. The note asks Miranda to prepare a chronicle of <b>recent</b> <b>events</b> and deliver it by hand, {{but she does not}} know who to give it to.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{goes into}} labour and Reyes helps her deliver an {{apparently}} normal baby with the alien Super Soldiers surrounding them, all witnessing the birth {{in a cold}} stare. Without explanation, the aliens leave the area as Mulder arrives. While Doggett and Reyes report to the FBI Headquarters, Doggett initiates an investigation into Kersh after previously witnessing a late night meeting between him, Rohrer and Crane (& their consequent disappearance). Mulder takes Scully and their newborn baby back to her apartment. After marveling over the baby and discussing <b>recent</b> <b>events,</b> the two agents share a long, passionate kiss.|$|E

However, later releases of said version {{do not include the}} soundtrack CD and contain a PDF version of the newspaper on the game's disc.|$|E
5|$|The episode when {{broadcast}} in the United States was viewed by 16.54 {{million people and}} received mixed reviews from critics. It is the first episode to feature a 'Previously on Lost' segment, a clip shown {{at the beginning of}} each episode summarizing the <b>recent</b> <b>events</b> of the show. The episode receives its name from the philosophical idea of tabula rasa, meaning blank slate, a concept which is brought in one of the episode's final lines, when Jack tells Kate that all of the Flight 815 survivors should be allowed to restart with a new life.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>recent</b> <b>events,</b> Queen Margaret still {{considered}} Warwick {{a threat to}} the throne, and cut off his supplies. In August 1457, however, a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off fears of a full-scale French invasion. Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast. In disregard of royal authority, he then conducted highly successful acts of piracy, against the Castilian fleet in May 1458, and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later. He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip the Good of Burgundy. Developing a solid military reputation and with good international connections, he then brought a part of his garrison to England, where he met up with his father and York in the summer of 1459.|$|E

5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering <b>recent</b> <b>events</b> (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the Labour {{government}} in Britain, exhausted by <b>recent</b> <b>events</b> such as World War II and numerous riots, {{realized that it}} had neither the mandate at home, the support internationally, nor {{the reliability of the}} British Indian Army for continuing to control an increasingly restless British India. The reliability of the native forces for continuing their control over an increasingly rebellious India diminished, and so the government decided to end the British rule of the Indian Subcontinent. In 1946, the Indian National Congress, being a secular party, demanded a single state. The Muslim majorities, who disagreed with the idea of single state, stressed the idea of a separate Pakistan as an alternative. The 1946 Cabinet Mission to India was sent to try to reach a compromise between Congress and the Muslim League, proposing a decentralized state with much power given to local governments, but it was rejected by both of the parties and resulted in a number of riots in South Asia.|$|E
5|$|The French Democracy {{begins with}} a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event that {{triggered}} riots in France: the electrocution of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré. In the film, the youths attempt to hide from police in a building near an electric power station. In a televised speech, the Minister of the Interior vows to increase efforts to fight crime. Three fictional Moroccan men discuss the <b>recent</b> <b>events</b> and disagree with means used by the police, and feel that blacks are unfairly targeted. They face different forms of discrimination: overnight detention {{for lack of a}} passport during an identity check, refusal of employment and housing rental, and police brutality. Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of the chaos, and the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traoré, lamenting the loss of the French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{generated}} further {{controversy in}} September 2005, when Channel 4 in the United Kingdom decided to air the episode {{a week after}} Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Arguing that the episode was an insensitive choice, given <b>recent</b> <b>events,</b> several viewers filed complaints with Ofcom. Two days later, Channel 4 apologized on-air and directly contacted all those who had complained. Channel 4 had screened the episode for offensive content, but the reviews focused on the main content of the episode, and the song was not considered {{a key part of}} the plot. Channel 4 promised to update their review process to ensure that similar incidents would not occur. The New Orleans song was edited out of all future showings, and remains absent from all Channel 4 airings as of March 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{interval}} between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime {{body of work}} rather than a single achievement. The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts. However, {{they can also be}} awarded for specific <b>recent</b> <b>events.</b> For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords.|$|E
5|$|The {{men at the}} Plum River {{settlement}} waited {{overnight and}} then fled to Galena where they reported the incident to Colonel James M. Strode. He ordered a militia party to the settlement to secure the it {{and make sure the}} attackers were dealt with accordingly. When the detachment arrived at Savanna they found no Native Americans, and plenty of bullet holes from the battle. The group continued to Fort Armstrong, where they picked up supplies, and returned to Galena without incident. On June 1, then-Colonel Zachary Taylor expressed his concerns about <b>recent</b> <b>events,</b> including the Plum River raid in a letter to General Henry Atkinson. He stated that there had no doubt been an attack at the settlement, but no one was killed and the site abandoned since.|$|E
