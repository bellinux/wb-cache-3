40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{study has}} been conducted in a fixed-base research simulator to assess the directional handling qualities for various <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> feel characteristics for commercial transport airplanes. That is, the effects of static pedal force at maximum <b>pedal</b> <b>travel,</b> breakout force, and maximum <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> on handling qualities were studied. An artificial maneuver with a severe lateral wind shear and requiring runway tracking {{at an altitude of}} 50 feet in a crosswind was used to fully exercise the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals.</b> Twelve active airline pilots voluntarily participated in the study and flew approximately 500 maneuvers. The pilots rated the maneuver performance with various <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> feel characteristics using the Cooper- Harper rating scale. The test matrix had 15 unique combinations of the 3 static pedal feel characteristics. A 10 -term, second-order equation for the Cooper-Harper pilot rating {{as a function of the}} 3 independent pedal feel parameters was fit to the data. The test matrix utilized a Central Composite Design that is very efficient for fitting an equation of this form. The equation was used to produce contour plots of constant pilot ratings as a function of two of the parameters with the third parameter held constant. These contour plots showed regions of good handling qualities as well as regions of degraded handling qualities. In addition, a numerical equation solver was used to predict the optimum parameter values (those with the lowest pilot rating). Quantitative pilot performance data were also analyzed. This analysis found that the peak values of the cross power spectra of the pedal force and heading angle could be used to quantify the tendency toward directional pilot induced oscillations (PIO). Larger peak values of the cross power spectra were correlated with larger (degraded) Cooper-Harper pilot ratings. Thus, the subjective data (Cooper-Harper pilot ratings) were consistent with the objective data (peak values of the cross power spectra) ...|$|R
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual control wheels and <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals.</b> The control wheels operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and bell cranks. Trim functions, microphone keying, autopilot override and steering system switches {{are located in the}} control wheels. The <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw control. Nose wheel steering is electrically controlled via the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bellcranks {{are often}} used in {{aircraft}} control systems to connect the pilot's controls to the control surfaces. For example: on light aircraft, the rudder often has a bellcrank whose pivot point is the rudder hinge. A cable connects the pilot's <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> {{to one side of}} the bellcrank. When the pilot pushes on the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal,</b> the <b>rudder</b> rotates on its hinge. The opposite <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> is connected to the other end of the bellcrank to rotate the rudder in the opposite direction.|$|R

40|$|A piloted, fixed-base {{simulation}} {{was conducted}} in 2006 to determine optimum <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> force/feel characteristics for transport aircraft. As part of this research, an evaluation of four metrics for assessing <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> characteristics previously presented in the literature was conducted. This evaluation was based upon the numerical handling qualities ratings assigned {{to a variety of}} pedal force/feel systems used in the simulation study. It is shown that, with the inclusion of a fifth metric, most of the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> force/feel system designs that were rated poorly by the evaluation pilots could be identified. It is suggested that these metrics form the basis of a certification requirement for transport aircraft...|$|R

50|$|<b>Rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> are dual control. The {{distance}} from the seat to the pedals is fixed because the seat position is not adjustable.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} primary flight controls: control stick, <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals,</b> and throttle. Typically, the control stick is termed the cyclic and tilts the rotor in the desired {{direction}} to provide {{pitch and roll}} control (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor relative to the airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.|$|R

Both hydraulic systems were destroyed by the bullets fired from the gun in the cabin.|$|R

25|$|Contributing {{factors include}} the following: first, the first officer's {{predisposition}} to overreact to wake turbulence; second, the training provided by American Airlines {{that could have}} encouraged pilots to make large flight control inputs; third, the first officer likely not understanding an airplane's response to large rudder inputs at high airspeeds or the mechanism by which the rudder rolls a transport-category airplane; finally, light <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> forces and small pedal displacement of the A300-600 <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> system increased the airplane's susceptibility to a rudder misuse.|$|R
50|$|In the {{mechanical}} law back-up mode, pitch {{is controlled by}} {{the mechanical}} trim system and lateral direction {{is controlled by the}} <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> operating the <b>rudder</b> mechanically.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> control {{rotation}} of the plane about the yaw axis. There are two pedals that pivot so that when one is pressed forward the other moves backward, and vice versa. The pilot presses on the right <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> to make the plane yaw to the right, and pushes on the left pedal to make it yaw to the left. The rudder is used mainly to balance the plane in turns, or to compensate for winds or other effects that tend to turn the plane about the yaw axis.|$|R

50|$|Its {{tricycle}} gear was fixed, all {{units with}} bungee cord shock absorbers. Both legs and wheels were enclosed in streamlined fairings. The nosewheel was steerable via the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The ERCO 310, which {{included}} a fully cowled engine, made its first flight in October 1937 at College Park Airport and was soon renamed the [...] "Ercoupe". The easy-to-fly design included unique design features, including a large glazed canopy for improved visibility. The prototype 310 featured an ERCO-made inverted four-cylinder engine, the ERCO I-L 116, which was quickly dropped due to its high manufacturing cost compared to the new Continental A-65 horizontal. Lacking <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals,</b> the Ercoupe was flown using only the control wheel. A two-control system linked the rudder and aileron systems, which controlled yaw and roll, with the steerable nosewheel. The control wheel controlled the pitch and the steering of the aircraft, both {{on the ground and}} in the air, simplifying control and coordinated turning and eliminating the need for <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals.</b> A completely new category of pilot's license was created by the CAA for Ercoupe pilots who had never used a <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some cockpit {{components}} of the aircraft survive, the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals,</b> {{the base of the}} throttle quadrant and other parts. They are part of the collection of the Royal Air Force Museum.|$|R
50|$|The cockpit {{provides}} {{room for}} students wearing military equipment and helmets. The plane {{is equipped with}} movable seats and <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> and an air conditioning system. A second thrust lever is available.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nose wheel}} is {{attached}} to the two rear engine mounts by y-shaped steel tubes attached to a steel tube with a shaft that slides freely with the wheel. Cables run underneath the belly directly from fixtures on the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> to the nose wheel shaft. This gave the ability to steer by pivoting the nose wheel shaft with the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals.</b> The shock system consisted of six circular bungee cords, sometimes four for softer landings, located {{on either side of the}} nose wheel shaft to ears on the top tube and the bottom shaft connected to the wheel.|$|R
50|$|The prone pilot's {{emergency}} escape {{involved an}} extremely complex procedure which included jettisoning the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals,</b> crawling backward to an escape hatch and retracting the nose wheel. Fortunately, this system was never used.|$|R
5000|$|Thrustmaster is {{also using}} the MMJ {{connector}} for connecting its line of <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> and racing pedals to either USB via a proprietary Thrustmaster Adapter, or {{directly to a}} joystick or racing wheel.|$|R
50|$|All Cherokees have a {{brake lever}} under the pilot {{side of the}} {{instrument}} panel. Differential toe brakes on the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> were an optional add-on for earlier Cherokees, and became standard with later models.|$|R
50|$|When {{entering}} a side slip, {{which is not}} uncommon as an energy management technique, the rudder can aerodynamically over centre, requiring an input from the pilot for the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> to return to neutral.|$|R
