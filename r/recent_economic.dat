In 1996 it {{produced}} 58,000 tonnes out of a world production of 81,000, followed by India at 13,000 tonnes. Japanese production is now marginal, at only 2500 tonnes. Between 1995 and 1997 Chinese silk production went down 40% {{in an effort to}} raise prices, reminiscent of earlier shortages.|$|E
5|$|The city {{struggled}} to make a transition to new industries. During {{the second half of}} the 20th century, the city's recessions were longer than the national average. The exodus of defense companies (such as Lockheed Martin, formed from the merger of the Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta in 1995) and the electrical-manufacturing industry played a major role in Utica's <b>recent</b> <b>economic</b> distress. From 1975 to 2001, the city's economic growth rate was similar to that of Buffalo, while other upstate New York cities such as Rochester and Binghamton outperformed both.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the site}} of the {{recently}} closed Homestake gold mine near Lead was chosen as the location of a new underground research facility, the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory. Despite a growing state population and <b>recent</b> <b>economic</b> development, many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states. Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture has contributed greatly to the declining number of smaller family farms and the resulting economic and demographic challenges facing rural towns.|$|E

25|$|A few ghost towns get {{a second}} life, often due to {{heritage}} tourism generating a new economy able to support residents. For example, Walhalla, Victoria, Australia, became almost deserted after its gold mine ceased operation in 1914, but owing to its accessibility and proximity to other attractive locations it has had a <b>recent</b> <b>economic</b> and holiday population surge.|$|E
25|$|This {{classical}} liberal renewal, {{sometimes called}} libertarianism, lasted through the 1980s and the 1990s, although <b>recent</b> <b>economic</b> troubles have prompted a resurgence in Keynesian economic thought.

25|$|At {{his first}} {{parliamentary}} session as Opposition Leader, Pearson asked Diefenbaker to give power {{back to the}} Liberals without an election, because of a <b>recent</b> <b>economic</b> downturn. This strategy backfired when Diefenbaker showed a classified Liberal document saying that the economy would face a downturn in that year. This contrasted heavily with the Liberals' campaign promises of 1957.|$|E

25|$|In the future, DSPD {{will face}} the {{challenge}} of growing support for privatization. Voices within the state legislature have questioned the continued operation of the State Developmental Center with taxpayer funds.

25|$|Other {{research}} findings report {{a projection of}} opposite trend. Although the demand for nurses continues to increase, the rate of employment has slowed down since 1994 because hospitals were incorporating more less-skilled nursing personnel to substitute for nurses. With the decrease in employment, the earnings for nurses decreased. Wage among nurses leveled off in correlation with inflation between 1990 and 1994. The <b>recent</b> <b>economic</b> crisis of 2009 has further decreased the demand for RNs.|$|E
25|$|The authors use {{the example}} of the {{emergence}} of democratic pluralism in Great Britain after the Glorious Revolution in 1688 as being critical for the Industrial Revolution. The book also tries to explain the <b>recent</b> <b>economic</b> bloom in China using its framework. China's recent past does not contradict the book's argument: despite China's authoritarian regime, the economic growth in China is due to the increasingly inclusive economic policy by Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's Opening up policy after the Cultural Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{local economy}} is broadly diversified among professional, service, and {{manufacturing}} jobs.

25|$|From an {{economic}} standpoint, Cuba relies {{much more on}} Venezuela than Venezuela does on Cuba. As of 2012, Venezuela accounted for 20.8% of Cuba's GDP while Cuba only accounted for roughly 4% of Venezuela's. Because of this reliance, the most <b>recent</b> <b>economic</b> Crisis in Venezuela (2012-present), with inflation nearing 800% and GDP shrinking by 19% in 2016, Cuba is not receiving their amount of payment and heavily subsidized oil.
