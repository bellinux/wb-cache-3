A <b>roped</b> off enclosure for directors was created and {{the remainder of the}} field was reserved for invited guests. A mile long procession headed by John Lewis Ricardo, Member of Parliament for Stoke-on-Trent and chairman of the NSR Company, formed. On Ricardo's arrival, the crowds broke through the <b>roped</b> off area and Ricardo was pushed and shoved. During the actual cutting he buckled the silver spade and had difficulty removing the sod. Finally, his hat blew away.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{negotiations}} between Sultan Ali and the Temenggong ensued with the British colonial government {{acting as the}} intermediary, after Sultan Ali had questioned the Temenggong's rights of keeping the state revenue to himself. Initially, the Temenggong proposed to split the trade revenue of Johor on condition that Sultan Ali surrendered his claims of sovereignty over Johor. The term was declined by Sultan Ali. Both parties agreed to seek the direct intervention of the British government, among which, the British Governor of the Straits Settlement, Colonel William Butterworth, and his successor, Edmund Blundell were <b>roped</b> in to act as meditators.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{commenced}} on July12,2009 at Valluvar Kottam in Chennai, {{where an}} entire ancient township film set with temples, forts, a lake and palaces was created. Scenes containing actor and politician Napoleon as the historical figure Thalaiyoor Kaali were shot there first. Thereafter, scenes featuring Jayaram and Kushboo were filmed, portraying characters which were considerably younger {{than they are}} in real life. Prashanth revealed that portraying a dual role meant that he was forced to change his costumes up to forty times a day in order portray the twin brothers' differences correctly. In March2010, Sneha was <b>roped</b> in to play Arukaani, sister of the warrior twins, and her scenes were filmed.|$|E
50|$|Rock {{climbing}} <b>ropes</b> {{come with}} either a designation for single, double or twin use. A single <b>rope</b> {{is the most common}} and it is intended to be used by itself, as a single strand. Single <b>ropes</b> range in thickness from roughly 9mm to 11mm. Smaller <b>ropes</b> are lighter, but wear out faster. Double <b>ropes</b> are thinner <b>ropes,</b> usually 9mm and under, and are intended for use as a pair. These <b>ropes</b> offer a greater margin or security against cutting, since it is unlikely that both <b>ropes</b> will be cut, but they complicate belaying and leading. Double <b>ropes</b> are usually reserved for ice and mixed climbing, where there is need for two <b>ropes</b> to rappel or abseil. They are also popular among traditional climbers, and particularly in the UK, due to the ability to clip each <b>rope</b> into alternating pieces of protection; allowing the <b>ropes</b> to stay straighter and hence reduce <b>rope</b> drag.Twin <b>ropes</b> are {{not to be confused with}} doubles. When using twin <b>ropes,</b> both <b>ropes</b> are clipped into the same piece of protection, treating the two as a single strand. This would be favourable in a situation where there was a high chance of a <b>rope</b> being cut. However new lighter-weight <b>ropes</b> with greater safety have virtually replaced this type of <b>rope.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Ropes</b> {{used for}} {{climbing}} {{can be divided}} into two classes: dynamic <b>ropes</b> and low elongation <b>ropes</b> (sometimes called [...] "static" [...] <b>ropes).</b> Dynamic <b>ropes</b> are designed to absorb the energy of a falling climber, and are usually used as Belaying <b>ropes.</b> When a climber falls, the <b>rope</b> stretches, reducing the maximum force experienced by the climber, their belayer, and equipment. Low elongation <b>ropes</b> stretch much less, and are usually used in anchoring systems. They are also used for abseiling (rappelling) and as fixed <b>ropes</b> climbed with ascenders.|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the sport}} was pushed forward by American {{mathematician}} John Gill, who contributed several important innovations. Gill's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics, a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions. He applied this idea to bouldering, which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds. Gill developed a closed-ended rating system: B1 problems were {{as difficult as}} the most challenging <b>roped</b> routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once.|$|E

With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the newest}} traditions on the UCF campus {{pertains}} to the Pegasus seal {{in the center of}} the main floor of the Student Union. From their first day on campus for orientation, new students are told to never walk on the Pegasus. As the tradition is told, those who step on the seal will never graduate from UCF. Usually the seal is <b>roped</b> off with heavy black velvet ropes, but when the ropes are not in place, students can be seen carefully avoiding the seal. In 2005, Florida Leader magazine named this new tradition the best college superstition in Florida.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, Ganguly {{was removed}} from the {{captaincy}} of the KKR for the 2009 season of the IPL, and was replaced by McCullum. The decision was questioned by media and other players of the team, when KKR finished {{at the bottom of the}} ranking table with three wins and ten losses. After that, Bengali television channel Zee Bangla <b>roped</b> him as the host of the reality quiz show titled Dadagiri Unlimited. It presented participants from the 19districts of West Bengal, who had to answer questions posed by Ganguly. By August, he was appointed the chairman of CAB's Cricket Development Committee. The job of the committee is to receive a report from the selectors at the end of every cricket season, assess the accountability of the selectors and make necessary recommendations. He played for the Ranji cup in the Bengal team in October 2009. Ganguly scored 110 in the match against Delhi and was involved in a partnership of 222 runs with Wriddhiman Saha.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rope</b> {{splicing}} in ropework is {{the forming}} of a semi-permanent joint between two <b>ropes</b> or {{two parts of}} the same <b>rope</b> by partly untwisting and then interweaving their strands. Splices can be used to form a stopper {{at the end of a}} line, to form a loop or an eye in a <b>rope,</b> or for joining two <b>ropes</b> together. Splices are preferred to knotted <b>rope,</b> since while a knot typically reduces the strength by 20-40%, a splice is capable of attaining a <b>rope's</b> full strength. However, splicing usually results in a thickening of the line and, if subsequently removed, leaves a distortion of the <b>rope.</b> Most types of splices are used on 3-strand <b>rope,</b> but some can be done on 12-strand or greater single-braided <b>rope,</b> as well as most double braids.While a spliced 3-strand <b>rope's</b> strands are interwoven to create the splice, a braided <b>rope's</b> splice is constructed by simply pulling the <b>rope</b> into its jacket.|$|R

5|$|In November 2010 sources {{reported}} that director Vishnuvardhan would direct a film featuring Pawan Kalyan {{in the lead}} role, to be produced by Neelima Nagesh and Shobu Yarlagadda. Neelima in an interview stated {{that she was a}} big fan of Pawan Kalyan. Vishnnuvardhan, following the release of his 2009 film Sarvam, which fared poorly at the box office, had been working on two scripts – the other one being the prequel to the 2007 version of Billa – but was unable to start either project due to unavailable dates of Pawan Kalyan and Ajith Kumar. He had planned to shoot both projects simultaneously from March 2011 onwards, but since that was not possible, he was forced to drop one of the projects, with Vishnuvardhan eventually deciding to direct this film. Reports also claimed that Krish, director of critically acclaimed films Gamyam (2008) and Vedam (2010), would pen the dialogues for the film, besides revealing that it would feature two female leads. It turned out that Abburi Ravi was <b>roped</b> in to write the dialogues, while the screenplay was provided by Rahul Koda.|$|E
