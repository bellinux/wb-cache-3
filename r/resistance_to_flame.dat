40|$|ABSTRACT: Furniture is {{globally}} {{the major}} {{field of application}} of poly-urethane foam polymers and flame retardancy is definitely the major issue for this product-market. The challenge is not only in designing foams with better combustibility <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flame</b> spread, but also to define test methods that, even if not representing the risk of stringent fire conditions, could at least be a meaningful indicator of the improvement in the foam combustibility char-acteristics. Europe is now {{looking forward to a}} common standard in the nineties. At pres-ent some countries, as Italy and the United Kingdom, have defined specific FR test methods and regulations for flexible polyurethane foams to be used by the furniture industry. This paper deals with flexible polyurethane foam systems especially devel-oped for cold molding furniture applications meeting the above mentioned regulations. Foam flame behaviour is described, together with physical-mechanical prop-erties and processing characteristics. Data are compared with those of non-FR-containing polyurethane foam. Also smoke emission data were generated, in-cluding the evaluation of a smoke suppressant additive. All the developed products, {{with the exception of the}} smoke modified ones, are stable and commercialized as fully formulated, ready to use, systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{elemental}} flame is a subgrid {{model for}} turbulent combustion, parameterized by time-varying strain rate and curvature. This thesis develops the unsteady one-dimensional governing equations for the elemental flame incorporating detailed chemical kinetics and transport and a robust and efficient numerical method for solving the governing equations. Hydrogen enrichment of some hydrocarbon fuels {{has been shown}} to improve stability and extend flammability limits of lean premixed combustion in a number of recent experiments. It is suggested that these trends may be explained by the impact of hydrogen on the flame response to stretch and curvature. The elemental flame model is used to simulate premixed hydrogen-enriched methane flames in positively curved, negatively curved and planar configurations at varying strain rates. Curvature and stretch couple with non-unity species Lewis numbers to affect the burning rates and flame structure. Hydrogen addition is found to increase burning rate and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flame</b> stretch under all conditions. Positive curvature reinforces the effect of hydrogen enrichment, while negative curvature diminishes it. (cont.) The effects of strong curvature cannot be explained solely in terms of flame stretch. Hydrogen enriched flames display increases in radical concentrations and a broadening of the reaction zone. Detailed analysis of the chemical kinetics shows that high strain rates lead to incomplete oxidation; hydrogen addition tends to mitigate this effect. by Raymond Levi Speth. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) {{is known}} as wood {{composite}} which are extensively used in furniture manufacture and building construction. In such application enhanced <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flame</b> spread is considered as an advantage. The properties of MDF boards can be improved {{with the use of}} flame retardant chemicals. As a potential solution, Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) will be used as flame retardant in MDF due to its good thermal properties and stability. Urea formaldehyde (UF) will be used as a binder to bind all the wood fibers. Flame retardant properties of the boards were investigated by IS 1734 - 1 to 20 (1983) : Methods of test for plywood [CED 20 : Wood and other Lignocellulosic products] standard. The physical and mechanical properties including Thickness Swelling (TS), Internal Bond (IB) and Modulus of Rupture (MOR) of the samples were determined. The TS, MOR and IB tests were conducted as per ASTM D 1037 standard. Throughout the experiment, MDF boards treated with 2. 5 wt% MWCNTs showed good fire retardant properties compared to Control board and 1. 0 wt% + MDF boards. The mechanical and physical properties improved significantly when MWCNTs were added to boards. From the DSC and TGA graph, {{it can be seen that}} the thermal conductivity and thermal stability of the samples, based on MWCNTs, were higher than control samples. Furthermore, the FTIR and XRD analysis proved that the presence of MWCNTs in the MDF samples. This research study will be useful in providing an effective way to increase the fire retardancy and as well as mechanical and physical properties of MDF board...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, natural fiber-reinforced {{composites}} {{are finding}} new applications in many sectors {{as they can}} yield economic, environmental and social benefits. In certain industries, such as building and transport, reduced material flammability is a key requirement. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine, flammability property on Naturally Woven coconut tree leaf sheath (CLS) reinforced Phenol Formaldehyde (PF) composites. CLS composite were prepared in both treated and untreated forms with volume fraction of 60 % of sheath and 40 % of Phenol Formaldehyde resin. CLS were chemically treated using 5 % of NaOH and composites plates were prepared by using a hydraulic hot press at 1400 C. Flammability of these composites was evaluated using Underwriters Laboratory test (UL 94) and limiting oxygen index (LOI). The UL flammability tests include a standard burning test applied to vertical (UL 94 V) and horizontal test (UL 94 HB) bars from which a general flammability rating is derived. In treated composites, the mass loss rate and flame propagation rate of treated composites has been decreased and <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>flame</b> has been increased and it is proved in both UL 94 V and UL 94 HB tests. And in Limiting oxygen index test, alkali treated composites requires more oxygen than untreated composite material to burn. The result obtained revealed that the alkaline treated CLS fiber with PF resin has more compatibility. Hence treatment of CLS fibers will improve the flammability of the composite material indicating that, materials have promising applications in construction and decorative purposes...|$|R

The results of horizontal shock tube experiment shows that there are obvious laws of blasting pressure increase drop before and after filling explosion suppression materials. The transport resistance form 150 mm diameter steel pipeline filled with explosion suppression material has also been investigated in different length and different air velocity conditions.

40|$|Cotton fabrics {{have been}} treated with two {{different}} finishing compositions based on urea (U) and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (AP) in order <b>to</b> enhance their <b>flame</b> retardancy properties, particularly referring <b>to</b> the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> a <b>flame</b> application (namely, Limiting Oxygen Index tests) and to an irradiative heat flux of 35 kW/m 2 (by cone calorimetry). The collected results have proven a remarkable increase of cotton flame resistance: indeed, the fabrics treated with the high concentrated bath showed a LOI increase of 121 % (from 19 for neat cotton, to 42 %) and did not ignite under 35 kW/m 2 heat flux. Thermogravimetry coupled with pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimetry has demonstrated efficient features of the proposed flame retardant system as char promoter for cotton. In {{order to reduce the}} amounts of U and AP employed in the selected formulations, the use of water glasses (WG) has been explored. A very low WG amount has proven to be effective in halving U and AP contents, maintaining the same fire performances already provided by the high concentrated finishing bath.

50|$|Resistance {{soldering}} {{is unlike}} using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an element and then {{passed through a}} thermally conductive tip into the joint area. A cold soldering iron requires time to reach working temperature and must be kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance soldering an intense heat can be rapidly developed directly within the joint area and in a tightly controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder melt temperature and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made, making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance soldering equipment, unlike conduction irons, {{can be used for}} difficult soldering and brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required. This makes <b>resistance</b> comparable <b>to</b> <b>flame</b> soldering in some situations. When the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area.|$|R
30|$|If the FR coating {{is applied}} to the inside face of the cover fabric as a backcoating, there may be little impact to the fabric aesthetics. However, when applied to the outside face or to both sides of the cover fabric, the fabric color, feel, and {{stiffness}} may be significantly altered. Although the aesthetics of laminated/coated fabrics may not be as desirable, these fabrics are often used to comply with the more stringent high occupant dwelling flammability regulations (e.g., Cal TB 133, Cal TB 129). In the UK, backcoated FR cover fabrics are considered to take about 80 % of the soft furnishing market ([Horrocks et al. 2007]). While FR coated cover fabrics self-extinguish and exhibit limited flame spread, they do not perform well when exposed to large ignition sources even for a short duration as they have a tendency to form brittle chars that crack open and expose the more flammable core materials. Research has shown that FR backcoating improves <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> small <b>flames</b> like match and BS: Crib 5 (17 [*]±[*] 1 [*]g of wood), but when tested with large ignition sources as in Cal TB 133 or CFR 1633, the increased heat release of the backcoating results in accelerated thermal decomposition of the underlying PUF ([Gallagher 1993]). As discussed previously, it is these types of unexpected interactions between the components resulting in a synergistic or antagonistic impact on pyrolysis that makes it difficult to predict soft furnishing flammability based on the flammability characteristics of the individual components.|$|R
40|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{has been}} mostly {{considered}} as a carrier of genetic information and gene expression. Recently, we have demonstrated that this biomacromolecule is very effective in providing cellulosic fabrics with flame retardant features, thanks to its intrinsic intumescent-like behaviour. Here, we have investigated {{the role played by}} different parameters on the overall flame retardant features: DNA molecular size, pH of the DNA aqueous solutions, and number of impregnations. For this purpose, herring DNA, at three different molecular sizes, low (100 - 200 base pairs, bp), medium (400 - 800 bp) and high (2000 - 10000 bp), has been selected as model biomacromolecule; its effect as fire protective coating on cotton fabrics has been assessed in terms of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> a <b>flame</b> application (through horizontal flame spread tests) and to an irradiative heat flux of 35 kW/m 2 (by cone calorimetry). Furthermore, thermogravimetric analyses have been exploited for evaluating thermal and thermo-oxidative stability of the treated fabrics. The results clearly indicate that, despite a similar composition, the coatings containing low molecular size DNA exert a superior fire protection on the fabric substrate, as clearly indicated by horizontal flame spread and cone calorimetry tests. Multiple impregnation treatment {{turned out to be more}} performing than the single one, being equal the final add-on achieved. More specifically, the use of multiple impregnations at pH= 4 and 8 allowed achieving self-extinction for 86 and 74 % of the tested samples; in addition, 45 and 25 % reductions of total heat release and heat release rate peak under 35 kW/m 2 have been found with respect to untreated cotton. These findings may be attributed to themorphology of the low molecular size DNA coating, which shows a greater penetration into the microfibrillar surfaces of the component fibres within the fabric and to its higher thermal stability in ai...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{founding}} in 1905, the U. S. Forest Service {{has been responsible for}} maintaining public lands. The Forest Service and other public lands agencies respond to an average of 73, 000 wildfires per year, and responding firefighters are required to carry a number of safety gear items, including the M 2002 emergency fire shelter. The emergency fire shelter is intended to serve as a last resort means of protection in case a firefighter's escape route has been compromised {{in the face of an}} approaching flame front. No fire shelter deployment tragedy has been more costly than the 2013 Yarnell Hill fire in Arizona, where 19 members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots perished. After the tragedy at Yarnell Hill, the Forest Service decided to expedite the next redesign cycle of the fire shelter in order to improve its ability to withstand direct contact with flames. Engineers at NASA Langley Research Center have spent the better part of a decade developing flexible thermal materials for use in inflatable aerodynamic decelerators and have demonstrated their performance in the IRVE- 2 and IRVE- 3 flight programs (Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment). NASA engineers recognized an opportunity to leverage their experience and knowledge with flexible thermal protection systems to potentially improve the fire shelter's <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> direct <b>flame</b> contact, and have been working directly with the U. S. Forest Service to achieve this goal. They launched the CHIEFS project (Convective Heating Improvement for Emergency Fire Shelters) in 2014. Over the past three years, CHIEFS has screened over 270 unique material layups, and tested over 30 unique full scale shelter concepts in an effort to achieve a game changing improvement to the thermal protection of the fire shelter, while maintaining minimal mass and volume. This paper will discuss CHIEFS' 1 st and 2 nd generation fire shelter development efforts and test results...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the large}} amount of {{electric}} equipment in our surroundings, fire safety of cable materials is becoming increasingly important. Because of environmental and health issues, much focus is on development of halogen-free materials. In this thesis, a halogen-free flame retardant material named Casico™ is studied. The main constituents of Casico are ethylene-acrylate copolymer, calcium carbonate and silicone elastomer. The flame retardant mechanism of the system is multifaceted with swelling, ionomeric cross-linking and formation of a protective surface layer as the most important processes. The performance of a Casico material in a fire situation is much dependant on its dimensional stability and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> dripping. The <b>flame</b> retardant properties when using poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) and poly(ethylene-co-butyl acrylate) as the copolymer have been compared. Ionomeric formation between acidic groups in the polymer and calcium ions results in a viscosity increase above 250 – 300 °C. This increase occurs at lower temperatures with the EMAA material which has great impact on the fire performance as shown with cone calorimetry and dripping test. In addition, the effect of three different nanofillers (montmorillonite, sepiolite and POSS) on the rheological properties and fire behaviour of the system has been studied. Montmorillonite gave a significant increase in viscosity above 250 °C resulting in reduced dripping and decreased heat release rate...|$|R
