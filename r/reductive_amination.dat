25|$|The {{reaction}} of enantiopure tryptophan or its short-chain alkylesters leads to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-'-carbolines {{in which a}} new chiral center at C-1 adopts either a cis or trans configuration towards the C-3 carboxyl group. The cis conduction is kinetically controlled, i.e. it is performed at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures the reaction becomes reversible and usually favours racemisation. 1,3-trans dominated products can be obtained with Nb-benzylated tryptophans, which are accessible by <b>reductive</b> <b>amination.</b> The benzyl group can be removed hydrogenolytically afterwards. As a rough rule, 13C NMR signals for C1 and C3 are downfield shifted in cis products relative to trans products (see steric compression effect).|$|E

25|$|Although {{pseudoephedrine}} occurs naturally as an alkaloid {{in certain}} plant species (for example, as a constituent of extracts from the Ephedra species, {{also known as}} ma huang, in which it occurs together with other isomers of ephedrine), the majority of pseudoephedrine produced for commercial use is derived from yeast fermentation of dextrose {{in the presence of}} benzaldehyde. In this process, specialized strains of yeast (typically a variety of Candida utilis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (such as found in beets and other plants). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the benzaldehyde is added to the vats, and in this environment the yeast converts the ingredients to the precursor l-phenylacetylcarbinol (L-PAC). L-PAC is then chemically converted to pseudoephedrine via <b>reductive</b> <b>amination.</b>|$|E
25|$|When GLUD1 {{is highly}} {{saturated}} with the active site ligands (substrates), an inhibitory abortive complex {{forms in the}} active site: NAD(P)H.Glu in the oxidative deamination reaction at high pH, and NAD(P)+.2-oxoglutarate in the <b>reductive</b> <b>amination</b> reaction at low pH. GLUD1 assumes its basal state configuration {{in the absence of}} allosteric effectors, regardless of whether the allosteric sites are functional. The allosteric regulators of GLUD1 - ADP, GTP, Leu, NAD+ and NADH - exert their effects by changing the energy required to open and close the catalytic cleft during enzymic turnover, in other words by destabilizing or stabilizing, respectively, the abortive complexes. Activators are not necessary for the catalytic function of GLUD1, as it is active in the absence of these compounds (basal state). It has been suggested that GLUD1 assumes in its basal state a configuration (open catalytic cleft) that permits catalytic activity regardless of whether the allosteric sites are functional. GLUD regulation is of particular biological importance as exemplified by observations showing that regulatory mutations of GLUD1 are associated with clinical manifestations in children.|$|E
2500|$|Jason Wallach of Vice {{magazine}} commended {{the accuracy}} of the cooking methods presented in the series. In early episodes, a once common clandestine route, the Nagai red phosphorus/iodine method, is depicted, which uses pseudoephedrine as a precursor to d-(+)-methamphetamine. By the season 1 finale, Walt chooses to use a different synthetic route based on the difficulty of acquiring enough pseudoephedrine to produce on the larger scale required. The new method Walt chooses is a <b>reductive</b> <b>amination</b> reaction, relying on phenyl-2-propanone and methylamine. On the show, the phenyl-2-propanone (otherwise known as phenylacetone or P2P) is produced from phenylacetic acid and acetic acid using a tube furnace and thorium dioxide (ThO2) as a catalyst, as mentioned in episodes [...] "A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal" [...] and [...] "Más".

2500|$|There are {{numerous}} methods available to synthesize MDMA via different intermediates. The original MDMA synthesis described in Merck's patent involves brominating safrole to 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-bromopropane and then reacting this adduct with methylamine. Most illicit MDMA is synthesized using MDP2P (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone) as a precursor. MDP2P {{in turn is}} generally synthesized from piperonal, safrole or isosafrole. [...] One method is to isomerize safrole to isosafrole {{in the presence of}} a strong base, and then oxidize isosafrole to MDP2P. Another method uses the Wacker process to oxidize safrole directly to the MDP2P intermediate with a palladium catalyst. Once the MDP2P intermediate has been prepared, a <b>reductive</b> <b>amination</b> leads to racemic MDMA (an equal parts mixture of (R)-MDMA and (S)-MDMA). Relatively small quantities of essential oil are required to make large amounts of MDMA. The essential oil of Ocotea cymbarum, for example, typically contains between 80 and 94% safrole. This allows 500ml of the oil to produce between 150 and 340 grams of MDMA.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{cysteine}} protease IdeS is an IgG degrading enzyme secreted by {{the bacterium}} Streptococcus pyogenes {{to evade the}} human immune system. In this thesis several inhibitors of IdeS have been synthesized and evaluated. Such inhibitors should be highly useful when elucidating the detailed mechanism of IdeS action. They might also have a potential as treatment of acute and severe infections caused by the bacteria. Further, IdeS has a therapeutic application of its own due to the proteolytic ability and an IdeS inhibitor might contribute during the development. Only irreversible, unselective inhibitors of IdeS were known five years ago. In this thesis, three strategies with the aim to synthesize and identify more inhibitors have been undertaken. Focus was first set on compounds with a substructure resembling the known inhibitors but with reversible warheads, i. e. nitrile, azide and aldehyde functions. The aldehyde derivatives were found to provide the first reversible inhibitors of IdeS. Then, to avoid covalent interactions and obtain more selective inhibitors, a substrate based strategy was undertaken. A 3 -aminopiperidine fragment was used as replacement of {{either of the two}} residues adjacent to the scissile bond in IgG. Such fragments can be synthesized from N-protected 3 -aminopiperidone and amino acid esters in <b>reductive</b> <b>aminations</b> in which a stereogenic center is formed. A series of di-, tri- and tetrapeptide analogues, together with eight peptides covering the cleavage site of IgG, were screened for their capacity to inhibit the cysteine proteases IdeS, SpeB and papain. Several analogues showed inhibition capacity, two compounds showed also high selectivity for IdeS. In contrast, none of the tested peptides showed any inhibition. Computational docking studies indicate that the identified IdeS peptide analogues and the non-active peptides do not share the same binding site in IdeS. Probably, the piperidine moiety hinders the inhibitor to enter the catalytic site. A more detailed study of the stereoselectivity in the <b>reductive</b> <b>aminations</b> affording the 3 -aminopiperidine fragment showed that a large protecting group (trityl) together with a large reducing agent (NaBH(O- 2 - ethylhexanoyl) 3) gave the highest diastereomeric ratio. The highest ratio obtained was 21 : 79 when Lproline methyl ester was used. The newly formed stereogenic center had the R-configuration, determined by chemical correlation. Computer based conformational analysis combined with Boltzmann distribution calculations implies an axial attack by the reducing reagent on the intermediary imine. To improve the potency of the two identified di- and tripeptide analogues synthetic routes to conformationally restricted N-containing bicyclic derivatives was undertaken in a third strategy. Five compounds with different bicyclic scaffolds were screened for their inhibition capacity towards IdeS and papain. One of the compounds was able to inhibit the first step of proteolytic cleavage of IgG by IdeS, a process usually completed in seconds...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of nitroalkenes and nitroalkanes has been explored {{with regard to}} synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, including 3 -sustituted azepanes and 1 -azoniapropellanes. A general synthesis of 3 -sustituted azepanes has been developed using nitroalkenes as building blocks. A novel, vinylogous, conjugate addition reaction of an acylsilane-derived dienol ether to nitroalkenes was discovered. Reaction conditions were optimized {{for a number of}} ???-substituted nitroalkenes. Nitro acylsilanes as the conjugate adducts were obtained in good to moderate yield. Nitro acylsilanes were converted to the corresponding enals through a photoinduced protodesilylation. Saturation of the olefinic portion of the enals and subsequent <b>reductive</b> <b>aminations</b> afforded the 3 -sustituted azepanes, which were protected as N-tosylamides. Using this streamlined process, a number of 3 -sustituted azepanes were obtained in good yield. Efficient synthesis of chiral, enantiopure 1 -azoniapropellanes as phase transfer catalysts has been developed. In the first method, the tandem [4 + 2]/[3 + 2] cycloaddition of nitroalkene was applied as the key step, wherein a chiral, enantiopure vinyl ether, a nitroalkene and a vinyl ketone were rapidly assembled. The resulting enantiopure nitroso acetals were then elaborated into 1 -azoniapropellanes. Four azoniapropellanes were prepared using this method. Another method was developed using the conjugate addition of nitroalkanes to Michael acceptors as the key strategy.
