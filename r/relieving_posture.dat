30|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in a rabbit model, that an adaptive immune response in defects from the patellar and trochlear groove upon implantation of an allogenic matrix is primarily intermediated by {{the vicinity of the}} synovium and not in contact with the blood supply (Arzi et al. 2015). The clinical evaluation revealed that an edema or a <b>relieving</b> <b>posture</b> of the hind leg at the defect site in the HA gel or HA gel[*]+[*]matrix groups, followed by an increase in the incidence of swelling, increased body temperature, reduced food consumption and discolored urine or feces in the test subjects. Nevertheless, the body weight gain was not influenced post implantation.|$|E
30|$|Between {{the animal}} {{delivery}} and the surgery, the animals displayed a stagnating or positive body weight gain {{except for one}} rabbit, with a decrease in body weight {{as a result of}} reduced food consumption. In both treatment groups, single animals demonstrated a <b>relieving</b> <b>posture</b> of the right hind leg or an edema or hematoma formation, which was not observed in untreated animals. In 4 (out of 6) animals treated with 1.75 % hyaluronan thiomer gel (HA gel), an increased incidence of swelling was noted at the surgery site only at some time points and in some animals with an increased body temperature (39.5  °C) and reduced food consumption. In comparison, the 1.75 % hyaluronan thiomer gel and 1.5 % hyaluronan thiomer matrix group (HA gel[*]+[*]matrix) exhibited a swelling at the surgery site in the first 3  weeks with reduced food consumption and discolored urine in 2 (out of 6) animals. A treatment-related influence could not be ruled out, but also the half of the untreated animals showed reddening or swelling of the skin in the surgery area. Nevertheless, all implantation sites and all animals were carried forward without any findings {{at the end of the}} second observation period.|$|E
40|$|Platypnea-orthodeoxia is an {{uncommon}} condition {{characterized by the}} development of hypoxia and breathlessness in the upright <b>posture,</b> <b>relieved</b> by resuming a supine position. First described in 1969, the condition has since been associated with intracardiac and intrapulmonary shunts, liver disease {{and a host of other}} conditions. We report an unusual case of episodic breathlessness and hypoxia cured by percutaneous cardiac intervention and discuss the evolving role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in the demonstration of functional distortions of cardiac and mediastinal anatomy that may not be as well characterized by other available imaging modalities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Head-Up project {{that aims to}} provide innovative head support to help improve <b>posture,</b> <b>relieve</b> pain and aid communication for people living with progressive neck muscle weakness. The initial focus is motor neurone disease. The case study illustrates collaborative, interdisciplinary research and new product development underpinned by participatory design. The study was initiated by a two-day stakeholder workshop followed by early proof-of-concept modeling and patient need evidence building. The work subsequently led to a successful NIHR i 4 i application funding a 24 -month iterative design process, patenting, CE marking and clinical evaluation. The evaluation has informed amendments to the proposed design we refer to here as the Sheffield Support Snood (SSS). The outcome positively demonstrates use and performance improvements over current neck orthoses and, the process of multidisciplinary and user engagement has created {{a sense of ownership}} by MND participants, who have since acted as advocates for the product. </p...|$|R
40|$|Extremity {{dystonia}} (ED) is a disabling {{condition that}} may represent an isolated focal symptom {{or may be}} part of generalized dystonia. It may develop secondary to any process affecting the contralateral basal ganglia or may be idiopathic. Diffuse or severe dystonia generally improves by administration of various medications and only in rare cases, stereotaxic surgery may be needed. Idiopathic forms or focal symptoms frequently respond to botulinum toxin (BoNT) injections. BoNT type A injection decreases pain and spasms in more than 80 % of cases and results in 50 - 66 % functional improvement in daily living activities and motor performance. Furthermore, BoNT injection also provides improvement in some symptoms of generalized dystonia and <b>relieves</b> disabling <b>posture,</b> skin lacerations and pain in more than 80 % of patients. BoNT may also be used to accelerate recovery in the postoperative period for a short time since it prevents the spasms. Truncal dystonia frequently accompanies segmental or generalized dystonia and it rarely presents as an isolated form. Axial involvement is mostly seen in neuroleptic use. This form of truncal dystonia is often severely painful and disabling and rarely responds to oral medications. BoNT is the treatment of choice in truncal dystonia, similar to the other focal dystonias. Clinical status improves dramatically by targeting proper muscles and using appropriate doses. In case of failure of BoNT treatment, the first alternative should be oral medications and, physiotherapy may additionally decrease the symptoms. Continuous intrathecal baclofen pump is known to be beneficial, while the effect of epidural spinal electrostimulation is still unclear and surgery should be the last option.
