The effect of various operation parameters such as pyrolytic temperature, flow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carbonizing</b> agent {{and time of}} pyrolysis on the carbonization of the lignocellulosic biomass as a carbon precursor was reviewed. Various physical and chemical processes for the activation of the biomass-based char and their effects on textural properties of the activated char were discussed. Conversion of activated chars to CMS as {{the final stage of}} the preparation process through different techniques of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and controlled pyrolysis was assessed.

Besides showing the bands for sp 2 -bonded carbon, the Raman spectra showed a shoulder near 1100 cm− 1 assigned to sp 3 -bonded carbon. With an increase of heat treatment temperature, the peak position of the Raman sp 3 band shifted to a lower frequency from 1190 to 1120 cm− 1, which is due to the transformation of sp 3 -bonded carbon from an amorphous phase to a nanocrystalline phase. These data showed that the microstructure <b>of</b> <b>carbonized</b> wood from 700 ° to 1800 °C consisted of the combination of sp 2 - and sp 3 -bonded carbon, which is probably due to the disordered microstructure <b>of</b> <b>carbonized</b> wood.
