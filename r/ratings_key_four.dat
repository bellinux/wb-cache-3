Use of such an instrument provides a simple method to quantify the cognitive demands of chemistry exam items. Instrument validity was established in two different ways: statistically significant correlations between expert-based cognitive complexity ratings and student performance (as measured through statistical difficulty of items), and statistically significant correlations between expert-based cognitive complexity ratings and student mental effort <b>ratings.</b> <b>Key</b> benefits associated with instrument use include an enhanced understanding of the cognitive complexity of chemistry assessment tasks and {{as a means for}} characterizing exam content for the measurement of cognitive development...|$|R

40|$|Abstract On the Semantic Desktop users {{maintain}} their {{model of the}} world in a formal personal information model ontology. Concepts from this ontology are used to annotate documents from desktop, allowing efficient navigation and browsing of these. However, the mental overhead required for correctly classifying new incoming document is substantial. We present the integration of the ontology-based informa-tion extraction system iDocument into the Nepomuk Semantic Desktop for classifying documents within the personal information model. A comparison is done between iDoc-ument and the original classification system Structure Recommender. It is based on real models and documents from five Nepomuk users. Results reveal evidences that iDocument’s categorization proposals are rated with higher recall and precision values and show that iDocument’s result ranking corresponds to user <b>ratings.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: semantic desktop, ontology-based information extraction, text classifi-cation, personal information mode...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine service orientation of restaurant employees and manag-ers. Data were collected from 852 employees and 309 managers working in p iua restaurants in the United States. Respondents provided job attribute and demo-graphic information. Results suggest that service-orienJation is comprised of three elements: organizational suppofl, customer focus, and service under pressure. Common to each of the three components of service orientation was therelationship of job security; employees who indicated higher ratings for jbb security also had higherratings for each of the service orientation components. Hbherrafings forthe organizational support and customer service components of service orientation were indkated by employees with higher job satisfaction and job involvement <b>ratings.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: Service orientation, organizational support, customer focus, service under pressure...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the feasibility {{and efficacy of}} a randomized clinical pilot trial comparing routine services (RS) with a school intervention program (SIP) for children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Method Twenty-four children (ages 8 – 12 years) with SCA were randomized to RS or SIP. General disease knowledge, consumer satisfaction, self-concept, and school absences were evaluated. Results Compared with children receiving RS, children and teachers receiving SIP evidenced more accurate information about their disease, and children with SCA had significantly fewer absences. Teachers receiving SIP reported higher consumer satisfaction. Conclusions A modest educational curriculum can increase knowledge of SCA, is associated with lower absentee rates, and yields high consumer satisfaction <b>ratings.</b> <b>Key</b> words sickle cell anemia; school intervention; randomized controlled trial; consumer satisfaction.

40|$|Multilevel SEM {{was used}} to examine the extent to which student, instructor, and course {{characteristics}} affect student ratings. Data were gathered from 1867 students enrolled in 117 courses at a large teacher training college in Israel. Four alternative two-level models that differ in only {{the nature of the relationship}} among interest in the course subject, expected grade, and student ratings were tested. Two of the models were judged as less appropriate, one because it failed to support the spurious relationship assumed between expected grade and student ratings, and the other on grounds of poor model-data fit. The other two models were equally good both in terms of the model-data fit and the amount of variance in student ratings that is accounted for by each of them. Both models supported the mediation effect of expected grade in the relationship between interest in the course subject and student <b>ratings.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS: student ratings; multilevel analysis; student characteristics; instructor characteristics...|$|R

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of signal detection theory, human variation in image reading degrades diagnostic accuracy by broadening the statistical distributions of perceived evidence upon which decisions were based. A new multivariate "random-effects " model formulates the total variation in a diagnostic decision variable as a sum of three uncorrelated components that represent differences among cases, readers, and repeated readings by a given reader. This model provides a basis for quantitative predictions concerning the amount by which diagnostic accuracy, as specified by ROC analysis, can be enhanced by the replication of image readings. Although these predictions apply exactly only to the hypothetical situation in which normally distributed decision variables from equivalent readers are averaged, computer-simulation studies and an analysis of mammographic image-reading data from five radiol-ogists show that similar gains in accuracy {{can be achieved by}} averaging discrete confidence <b>ratings.</b> <b>Key</b> words diagnostic accuracy, random-effects model; image interpretation; ROC analysis.
