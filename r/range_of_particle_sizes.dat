50|$|The Rayleigh {{scattering}} model {{breaks down}} when the particle size becomes larger than around 10% of the wavelength of the incident radiation. In the case of particles with dimensions greater than this, Mie's scattering model {{can be used to}} find the intensity of the scattered radiation. The intensity of Mie scattered radiation is given by the summation of an infinite series of terms rather than by a simple mathematical expression. It can be shown, however, that scattering in this <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> differs from Rayleigh scattering in several respects: it is roughly independent of wavelength and it is larger in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction.|$|E
50|$|Light scattering. These {{techniques}} {{are based on}} probing the scattered light from an aggregating suspension in a time-resolved fashion. Static light scattering yields {{the change in the}} scattering intensity, while dynamic light scattering the variation in the apparent hydrodynamic radius. At early-stages of aggregation, the variation of each of these quantities is directly proportional to the aggregation rate constantk.At later stages, one can obtain information on the clusters formed (e.g., fractal dimension). Light scattering works well for a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes.</b> Multiple scattering effects may have to be considered, since scattering becomes increasingly important for larger particles or larger aggregates. Such effects can be neglected in weakly turbid suspensions. Aggregation processes in strongly scattering systems have been studied with transmittance, backscattering techniques or diffusing-wave spectroscopy.|$|E
50|$|The uniform {{particle}} size achieved using a burr grinder can be desirable for coffee preparation. However, some methods of brewing {{may be more}} tolerant of the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> produced by a blade grinder; {{this may be the}} case for percolated coffee. Regardless, burr coffee grinders are more suited for keeping the flavor and aroma of the coffee beans intact. This is because burr mills produce less heat from friction compared to blade grinders; this is especially important for coffee aficionados looking to get the most flavor from the freshly ground beans, as heat from friction lessens or taints the natural flavor. Burr grinders create less friction and require lower motor speeds, which reduces potential flavor loss due to heat.|$|E

50|$|The major {{drawback}} to dynamic image acquisition {{is that the}} flow cell depth must be limited as described above. This means that, in general, <b>particles</b> larger in <b>size</b> than the flow cell depth can not be allowed in the sample being processed, because they will probably clog the system. So the sample will typically have to be filtered to remove particles larger than the flow cell depth prior to being evaluated. If it is desired {{to look at a}} very wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> this may mean that the sample would have to be fractionated into smaller size range components, and run with different magnification/flow cell combinations.|$|R
50|$|During high-energy milling {{the powder}} {{particles}} are repeatedly flattened, cold welded, fractured and rewelded. Whenever two steel balls collide, some amount of powder is trapped in between them. Typically, around 1000 particles with an aggregate weight of about 0.2 mg are trapped during each collision. The {{force of the}} impact plastically deforms the powder particles leading to work hardening and fracture. The new surfaces created enable the particles to weld together and this leads {{to an increase in}} particle size. Since {{in the early stages of}} milling, the particles are soft (if we are using either ductile-ductile or ductile-brittle material combination), their tendency to weld together and form large particles is high. A broad <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> develops, with some as large as three times bigger than the starting particles. The composite particles at this stage have a characteristic layered structure consisting of various combinations of the starting constituents. With continued deformation, the particles get work hardened and fracture by a fatigue failure mechanism and/or by the fragmentation of fragile flakes.|$|E
