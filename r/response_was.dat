5|$|A {{rough cut}} premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, but {{post-production}} work continued, {{and the film}} was not released in France until almost a year later. A cut-down version was released in the United States and United Kingdom in September 2010. The critical <b>response</b> <b>was</b> sharply divided: positive reviews described the film as captivating and innovative, while negative critics called it tedious and puerile. The film performed poorly at the box office.|$|E
5|$|A {{three-dimensional}} film, , {{was released}} to American cinema in February2008. The film received an overwhelming commercial response, grossing {{a total of}} $70.6million worldwide and setting numerous records, including once being the highest-grossing concert film of all time. Critical <b>response</b> <b>was</b> generally positive to mixed. When televised {{for the first time}} on Disney Channel, Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert was watched by over 5.9million viewers. A live album was released as a soundtrack for the film, Best of Both Worlds Concert, with recordings from the same concerts was released in March2008.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1957, Florida's <b>response</b> <b>was</b> mixed. Its {{legislature}} {{passed an}} Interposition Resolution denouncing {{the decision and}} declaring it null and void.

5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{employed}} by the New Zealand Company, Heaphy, emboldened {{by the success of}} his report and the public reception to his paintings, sought further opportunities for similar work. From London, he wrote to the company secretary seeking support for exploration of the area inland of Nelson. The <b>response</b> <b>was</b> unenthusiastic, the company was concentrating on developing its settlements, rather than undertaking in further exploration of the country. Despite this, Heaphy returned to New Zealand and arrived in Nelson on 22 December 1842.|$|E
5|$|Both Lasser and Hornig printed fiction {{translated}} from French and German writers, including Otfrid von Hanstein and Otto Willi Gail. With {{the rise of}} Adolf Hitler in Germany in the 1930s a few readers (including Donald Wollheim) wrote letters complaining about the inclusion of German stories. The editorial <b>response</b> <b>was</b> a strong defense of the translations; Gernsback argued that events in Germany were irrelevant {{to the business of}} selecting fiction.|$|E

5|$|Churchill's and the British <b>response</b> <b>was</b> officially restrained. This {{was due to}} the strong-willed defence of the Belgian {{defensive}} campaign {{presented to}} the cabinet by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30am 28 May. The French and Belgian ministers had referred to Leopold's actions as treacherous, but they were unaware of the true events: Leopold had not signed an agreement with Hitler in order to form a collaborative government, but an unconditional surrender as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Coverage of {{this event}} varied {{significantly}} between Nashville's two major newspapers. The Tennessean emphasized the mayor's agreement that lunch counters should be desegregated, while the Nashville Banner emphasized the mayor's statement that {{it was up to}} the city's merchants to decide whether to desegregate. This was largely indicative of the two papers' opposing stances on the issue. Regardless, the mayor's <b>response</b> <b>was</b> later cited as an important turning point by both activists and Nashville business owners.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A joint model fo r multivariate mixed ordinal and {{continuous}} <b>responses</b> <b>is</b> presented. In this model the ordinal <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> intercorrelated and also {{are dependent on}} the continuous <b>responses.</b> The likelihood <b>is</b> found and modified Pearson residuals, where the correlation between multivariate <b>responses</b> can <b>be</b> taken into account, are presented to find abnormal observations. The model is applied to a medical data, obtained from an observational study on women, where the correlated <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> the ordinal <b>response</b> of osteoporosis of the spine {{and continuous}} <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> body mass index and waist. The effect of some covariates on all <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> investigated simultaneously.

40|$|Characteristics {{of sensory}} responses. Even though sensory <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> diverse and occur in {{different}} complex environments, {{it is possible}} to derive some characteristics common to all responses: 1) For a given subject the sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> unusual and abnormal because two conditions must be respected: the individuality of the response and the blind presentation of the samples. 2) When it hasn't been learned, the sensory <b>response</b> <b>is,</b> more or less, specific to the subject who gives the response. 3) The sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> not only a mechanical translation of events produced at the receptor level; it is an event which is largely cognitive. 4) The sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> changeable and unstable in time {{because of the nature of}} the nervous system and the conditions of taking the samples. 5) The sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> often obtained by means of verbal expression and the words may imperfectly translate the perception. Despite these characteristics, the sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> irreplaceable; it can be reliable when the operator who obtains it controls the experiment with care...|$|R
30|$|For both {{encoding}} {{items and}} problem-solving items, participants’ <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> coded for whether they correctly represented both slope and intercept. For items that required students to generate equations, slope <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if the value provided as the slope {{in the equation}} was exactly correct, and intercept <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if the value provided as the intercept in the equation was exactly correct. For items that required students to generate graphs, intercept <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if the graph intersected the correct point on the y-axis. Slope <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if a straight line calculated with the intercept and the last point of the graph had the correct gradient. For the item in which {{students were asked to}} identify the slope and intercept terms in an equation, <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if they correctly identified the appropriate terms. For the item in which students were asked to write a sentence explaining how the terms in the equation related to the graph, slope <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if they conveyed how the slope term in the equation related to the slope of the graph, and intercept <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if they conveyed how the intercept term in the equation related to the intercept of the graph.|$|R
5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear <b>response</b> <b>was</b> a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E

A flood of victims soon began {{to arrive at the}} city's hospitals, which were quickly overwhelmed. The new military hospital, Camp Hill, admitted approximately 1400 victims on 6 December.|$|E
5|$|In December 1989, Lexus {{initiated}} a voluntary recall of all 8,000 LS 400s based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light.

This <b>response</b> <b>was</b> covered in media publications and helped establish the marque's early reputation for customer service.|$|E
