40|$|Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a {{permeability}} {{pulmonary edema}} characterized by increased permeability of pulmonary capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, leading to hypoxemia that is refractory to usual oxygen therapy. ARDS {{is characterized by}} a brief precipitating event followed by <b>rapidly</b> <b>developing</b> <b>dyspnea.</b> These patients have markedly impaired respiratory system compliance and reduced lung volume. The hypoxemia is refractory to low fraction of oxygen concentration and low positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). The mortality of ARDS is around 35 - 40...|$|E
40|$|A 71 -year-old male, who {{had been}} {{followed}} up after being treated with chemo-radiotherapy for {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (adenocarcinoma), <b>rapidly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>dyspnea</b> and mild fever. Radiographs showed left pleural effusion and cardiomegaly, and echocardiographic examina-tion revealed echo-free space, suggesting a pericardial effusion. The patient was treated con-servatively without any surgical procedures such as pericardiocentesis. Disappearance of the echo-free space was followed by development of pericardial constriction within two months. At post-mortemexamination, a direct extension to thepericardium from theprimary lesionof the right upper lobe through the mediastinum was observed. The rapid development of pericardial con-striction is extremely rare in patients with malignant pericarditis.

40|$|Sensitized Sprague-Dawley rats {{developed}} respiratory impairment after {{challenge with}} aerosolized antigen. The response to challenge was heterogeneous. A proportion {{of each group}} of rats <b>developed</b> <b>dyspnea</b> and other symptoms similar to asthma; the remainder developed apnea but no other symptoms. Selective breeding from rats which <b>developed</b> <b>dyspnea</b> increased the incidence from 44 % in F 0 to 55 % in F 1 and greater than 90 % in F 2 and F 3. Inbreeding also produced {{a significant increase in}} the duration of antigen-induced dyspnea. The results from the selective inbreeding suggest antigen-induced dyspnea is controlled genetically, possibly by multiple gene loci. These inbred rats constitute a population which have a predictable response to aerosolized antigen challenge. They should have utility in investigating allergic asthma and evaluating potential new drugs...|$|R

The polypoid lesion was identified microscopically as {{inflammatory polyp}}. It was suspected that its development was due to tracheal cannula intubation...|$|R

The probable pathophysiological mechanism is a clot creating a one-way valve allowing inspiration but not expiration, resulting in dyspnea and pulmonary hyperinflation. Chroni...|$|R
