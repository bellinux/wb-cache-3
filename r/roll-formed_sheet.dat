40|$|Cold {{roll-forming}} {{process of}} a U profile is modelled and simulated. The simulation {{is based on}} a 3 D finite element analysis {{with the help of the}} home made Metafor code. The prediction on dimensions and deformed shape of the cold <b>roll-formed</b> <b>sheet</b> is in good agreement with the experimental results. Parametric study on roll forming parameters, such as the yield limit and the hardening property of materials, and the distance between stations is performed. Peer reviewe...|$|E

5000|$|Originally, metal roofs {{were made}} of {{corrugated}} galvanized steel: a wrought iron-steel sheet was coated with zinc and then <b>roll-formed</b> into corrugated <b>sheets.</b> Another approach is to blend zinc, aluminum, and silicon-coated steel. These products are sold under various trade names like [...] "Zincalume" [...] or [...] "Galvalume". The surface may display the raw zinc finish, {{or it may be}} used as a base metal under factory-coated colors. Another metal roofing product comes in a rolled form of various widths of so-called standing seam metal. The material is [...] "seamed" [...] together using a special seaming tool that is run vertically up the panel to seal the joints and prevent water intrusion.|$|R
