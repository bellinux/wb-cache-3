40|$|Several {{political}} theorists {{argue that}} states have <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>self-determination</b> and these <b>rights</b> justify immigration restrictions. Call this: the self-determination argument for immigration restrictions. In this article, I develop an objection <b>to</b> the <b>self-determination</b> argument. I {{argue that if}} it is morally permissible for states to restrict immigration because they have <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>self-determination,</b> then {{it can also be}} morally permissible for states to deport and denationalize their own citizens. We can either accept that it is permissible for states to deport and denationalize their own citizens or reject the <b>self-determination</b> argument. <b>To</b> avoid this implication, we should reject the self-determination argument. That is, we should also reject the conclusion that <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>self-determination</b> can justify any significant immigration restriction...|$|R

5|$|British {{control of}} Gibraltar enabled the Allies {{to control the}} {{entrance}} to the Mediterranean during the Second World War. It was attacked on several occasions by German, Italian and Vichy French forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the Gibraltarians themselves, who vigorously asserted their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>self-determination.</b> Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.|$|E
