5|$|As the 1880 presidential {{elections}} approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been <b>robbed</b> <b>of</b> {{the presidency in}} 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought {{an investigation into the}} 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the major}} {{architecture}} of the site core is covered by secondary forest, including some large trees, {{while much of the}} city's remains lie within the modern village, including mounds of various sizes. Some mounds were destroyed in order to build the modern streets, in other cases the mounds were <b>robbed</b> <b>of</b> stone that was reused in modern construction. There are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms. Modern houses had previously also occupied the outskirts of the acropolis but were relocated during the Guatemalan Civil War in the late 20th century due to guerrilla activity.|$|E
5|$|Stanley {{acted upon}} a remark made {{by his father}} in 1854 about the high cost and poor quality of English drawing {{instruments}} compared to those imported from France and Switzerland, and started a business making mathematical and drawing instruments. At first he rented a shop and parlour at 3 Great Turnstile, Holborn, and began the business with £100 capital. He invented a new T-square which improved the standard one and became universally used. A cousin, Henry Robinson, joined him with a capital of £150, but died in 1859. Stanley stopped using the name Robinson and changed his signature {{as a consequence of}} being <b>robbed</b> <b>of</b> his cheque book during the early days of his business.|$|E
5|$|The Grey dynasty {{maintained}} their {{ownership of the}} castle, which passed into Lady Mary Grey's {{side of the family}} following a law case in 1704. The lands around the castle and the outer bailey were used for growing wheat, barley and oats, and the walls were <b>robbed</b> <b>of</b> their stone for other building work. A small settlement, called Nova Scotia or Novia Scotia, was built {{on the site of the}} castle's harbour, possibly by Scottish immigrants. Several engravings were published of the castle in the 18th century, including a somewhat inaccurate depiction by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck in 1720, and by Francis Grose and William Hutchinson in 1773 and 1776 respectively.|$|E

30|$|Additionally, the <b>Robs</b> <b>of</b> DP 6 to 8 COS {{increased}} with TMP, which {{indicate that the}} concentration polarization was a subordinate factor for the separation conditions in this case. As an alkaline molecule, the rejection properties of COS are significantly affected by the Donnan effects [23]. When the concentration was kept at 28.3  g/L, the <b>Robs</b> <b>of</b> solute decreased with the decrease of the pressure (6.0 to 16.0  bar). According to the Donnan theory, dielectric exclusion impels the increasing sugar accumulation, {{which is responsible for}} the considerable <b>Robs</b> <b>of</b> DP 6 to 8 COS. Therefore, it could be seen that the dropping of observed retention at a high-pressure range (18.0 to 20.0  bar) was similar. The corresponding results were of the same order with reported phenomena by Zhang [24]. Impressive retention proportions of DP 6 to 8 COS at all selected concentrations and applied pressures were performed.|$|R

5|$|The castle was {{attacked}} during the Madog ap Llywelyn revolt of 1294, the Llywelyn Bren uprising in 1316 {{and during the}} overthrow of Edward II in 1326–27. In the late 15th century, however, it fell into decline and by the 16th century the lakes had drained away and the walls were <b>robbed</b> <b>of</b> their stone. The Marquesses of Bute acquired the property in 1776 and under {{the third and fourth}} Marquesses extensive restoration took place. In 1950 the castle and grounds were given to the state and the water defences were re-flooded. In the 21st century, the Welsh heritage agency Cadw manages the site as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The {{desperation and}} the violent {{reaction}} {{of a generation}} <b>robbed</b> <b>of</b> a safe future are well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977–1978, whose rebellion against the establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s. These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing. They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety pins and ripped clothes, and considered musical prowess unimportant {{as long as the}} music was simple and loud. However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal, which was equally effective in providing fun, stress relief, and peer companionship– otherwise denied because of their unemployment.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} in England, de Vere {{returned}} to the Continent in 1342, where he served with Northampton, who had been made lieutenant of Brittany. They both {{took part in the}} Battle of Morlaix that year. The next year the two earls were sent to Scotland to relieve Lochmaben Castle, and in 1345 they were again campaigning in Brittany. Tradition has it that, returning to England, their ships were forced ashore by bad weather, and the party was <b>robbed</b> <b>of</b> their possessions by the locals. In the summer of 1346 de Vere was campaigning with the king in Normandy, and took part in the Battle of Crécy. According to the chronicler Froissart, de Vere was fighting with the Black Prince, and was among the captains who sent a request to Edward III for reinforcements when the king famously answered 'Let the boy win his spurs'. Oxford was also at the Siege of Calais, but reportedly fell ill in 1348, and did not take part in any major campaigning until 1355.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Liverpool, {{he was put}} in charge of the Clarendon Furnishing shop in Hoylake and was made a director of NEMS in 1955. In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend but after being there for only one day, was <b>robbed</b> <b>of</b> his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had on him. He did not want his parents to find out, so he worked as a department store clerk until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool. Back in Liverpool, he confessed his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions, Epstein revealed his ambition of becoming an actor, so his parents allowed him go to London to study.|$|E

5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be <b>robbed</b> <b>of</b> some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey. These first excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that it was indeed the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not been entirely <b>robbed</b> <b>of</b> stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E
