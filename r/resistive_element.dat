The body of the resistor is protected with paint or plastic. Early 20th-century carbon composition resistors had uninsulated bodies; the lead wires were wrapped around {{the ends of the}} resistance element rod and soldered. The completed resistor was painted for color-coding of its value.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>resistive</b> <b>element</b> is {{made from}} a mixture of finely {{powdered}} carbon and an insulating material, usually ceramic. [...] A resin holds the mixture together. [...] The resistance {{is determined by the}} ratio of the fill material (the powdered ceramic) to the carbon. [...] Higher concentrations of carbon, which is a good conductor, result in lower resistance. Carbon composition resistors were commonly used in the 1960s and earlier, but are not popular for general use now as other types have better specifications, such as tolerance, voltage dependence, and stress. Carbon composition resistors change value when stressed with over-voltages. Moreover, if internal moisture content, from exposure for some length of time to a humid environment, is significant, soldering heat creates a non-reversible change in resistance value. [...] Carbon composition resistors have poor stability with time and were consequently factory sorted to, at best, only 5% tolerance.|$|E

5000|$|A {{logarithmic}} taper potentiometer is a potentiometer {{that has}} a bias built into the <b>resistive</b> <b>element.</b> Basically this means the center position of the potentiometer is not {{one half of the}} total value of the potentiometer. The <b>resistive</b> <b>element</b> is designed to follow a logarithmic taper, aka a mathematical exponent or [...] "squared" [...] profile. A logarithmic taper potentiometer is constructed with a <b>resistive</b> <b>element</b> that either [...] "tapers" [...] in {{from one end to the}} other, or is made from a material whose resistivity varies from one end to the other. This results in a device where output voltage is a logarithmic function of the slider position.|$|E

The wiper is connected to a third terminal (F), usually between the other two. On panel potentiometers, the wiper is usually the center terminal of three. For single-turn potentiometers, this wiper typically travels just under one revolution around the contact. The only point of ingress for contamination is the narrow space between the shaft and the housing it rotates in.|$|E

50|$|Many power {{processing}} {{systems can be}} improved by the application of <b>resistive</b> <b>elements.</b> Resistors may be applied for waveshaping, damping of oscillatory waveforms, stabilization of nonstable systems, and power flow balancing. The losses involved by the application of conventional resistors may be eliminated by the synthesis of artificial, loss-free <b>resistive</b> <b>elements</b> which replace the conventional ones. The conventional resistor converts the electrical energy absorbed at its terminals into heat; however, {{it has been found}} that creation of a resistive characteristic is not necessarily followed by such energy conversion. It is possible to synthesize a Loss-Free Resistor (LFR) by the combination of a switched mode converter and a suitable control circuit. The LFR is a two-port element that has a resistive i-v curve at the input terminals. The power absorbed at the input is transferred to the source that powers the total system, so in principle no losses occur.|$|R

Linear-taper potentiometers are used when the division ratio of the potentiometer must be proportional to the angle of shaft rotation (or slider position), for example, controls used for adjusting the centering of the display on an analog cathode-ray oscilloscope.

40|$|Abstract — This brief {{investigates the}} Restore {{mechanism}} of a nonvolatile static {{random access memory}} (NVSRAM) cell that utilizes two magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJs) as nonvolatile <b>resistive</b> <b>elements</b> and a 6 T SRAM core. Two cells are proposed by employing different mechanisms for the Restore operation once the power is reestablished. The proposed cells use the bitline and supply as mechanisms to initiate the Restore operation, so connecting the two MTJs to different nodes of the NVSRAM circuitry. The cells are extensively analyzed in terms of their operations with respect to different figures of merit, such as operational delays (for the Write, Read, and Restore operations), the static noise margin, power consumption, critical charge, and process variations (in both the MOSFETs and the <b>resistive</b> <b>elements).</b> Simulation results show that the cell with the MTJs connected to the supply offers the best performance in terms of power for the Read/Restore operations; it also achieves the best Read delay, but the worst Restore delay.

50|$|The energy {{dissipated}} {{within a}} medium as sound travels through it {{is analogous to}} the energy dissipated in electrical resistors or that dissipated in mechanical dampers for mechanical motion transmission systems. All three are equivalent to the resistive part of a system of <b>resistive</b> and reactive <b>elements.</b> The <b>resistive</b> <b>elements</b> dissipate energy (irreversibly into heat) and the reactive elements store and release energy (reversibly, neglecting small losses). The reactive parts of an acoustic medium are determined by its bulk modulus and its density, analogous to respectively an electrical capacitor and an electrical inductor, and analogous to, respectively, a mechanical spring attached to a mass.|$|R

50|$|Note {{that since}} {{dissipation}} solely {{relies on the}} <b>resistive</b> <b>element</b> it is independent of frequency. In practice however the <b>resistive</b> <b>element</b> varies with frequency. For instance, vibrations of most materials change their physical structure and so their physical properties; {{the result is a}} change in the 'resistance' equivalence. Additionally, the cycle of compression and rarefaction exhibits hysteresis of pressure waves in most materials which is a function of frequency, so for every compression there is a rarefaction, and the total amount of energy dissipated due to hysteresis changes with frequency. Furthermore, some materials behave in a non-Newtonian way, which causes their viscosity to change with the rate of shear strain experienced during compression and rarefaction; again, this varies with frequency. Gasses and liquids generally exhibit less hysteresis than solid materials (e.g., sound waves cause adiabatic compression and rarefaction) and behave in a, mostly, Newtonian way.|$|E

40|$|The AC {{impedance}} of {{the isolated}} perineurium of the frog sciatic nerve was examined at frequencies from 2 Hz to 100 kHz. A Nyquist {{plot of the}} imaginary and real components of the impedance demonstrated more than 1 capacitative element, and a DC resistance of 478 +/- 34 (SEM, n = 27) omega cm 2. Transperineurial potential {{in the absence of}} externally applied current was 0. 0 +/- 0. 5 mV. The impedance data were fitted by nonlinear least squares to an equation representing the generalized impedance of four equivalent circuits each with two resistive and two capacitative elements. Only two of these circuits were consistent with perineurial morphology, however. In both, the perineurial cells were represented by a <b>resistive</b> and capacitative <b>element</b> in parallel, where capacitance was less than 0. 1 microF/cm 2. The extracellular matrix and intercellular junctions of the perineurium were represented as single <b>resistive</b> and capacitative <b>elements</b> in parallel or in series, where capacitance exceeded 2 microF/cm 2. Immersion of the perineurium in low conductance Ringer's solution increased DC <b>resistive</b> <b>elements</b> as compared with their values in isotonic Ringer's solution, whereas treatment for 10 min with a hypertonic Ringer's solution (containing an additional 1. 0 or 2. 0 mol NaCl/liter of solution) reduced DC <b>resistive</b> <b>elements,</b> consistent with changes in perineurial permeability. The results indicate that (a) perineurial impedance contains two time constants and can be analyzed in terms of contributions from cellular and extracellular elements, and (b) transperineurial DC resistance, which is intermediate between DC resistance for leaky and nonleaky epithelia, represents intercellular resistance and can be experimentally modified by hypertonicity...|$|R
