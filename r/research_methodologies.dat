E.g. several studies use self-reported bruxism as a measure of bruxism, and since many people with bruxism are not aware of their habit, self-reported tooth grinding and clenching habits may be a poor measure of the true prevalence.|$|E

Correspondingly, an adapted <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> is required {{to meet the needs of}} current circumstances. This paper articulates employment of a quantitative computational <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> for design studies. The research framework, implementation and validations are expressed in details. Computational charrette test method and computational emulation reasoning and representation are incorporated in order to validate the discussed <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> outputs. In summary, the developed <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> is articulated in details to enable further exploitations in academic research and practices...|$|R

25|$|Video game {{rehabilitation}}, {{also known}} as gaming rehabilitation {{is a process of}} using common video game consoles and methodology to target and improve physical and mental weaknesses through therapeutic processes. Platforms that feature motion control, notably the Nintendo Wii, Microsoft's Xbox Kinect, and Sony's Eye Toy, and virtual reality scenarios have all been effective in this field of <b>research.</b> <b>Methodologies</b> have been applied to all age groups, ranging from toddler to elderly aged people worldwide and have been used in a variety of cases ranging from stroke rehabilitation, cerebral palsy and other neurological impairments, to people with tendinitis and multiple sclerosis. Researchers have promoted such technology based on the personalization of gaming systems to patients which allows for further engagement and interaction. Additionally, gaming consoles have the ability to capture real-time data and provide instant feedback to the patients using the systems. Currently, several researchers have performed case studies to demonstrate the benefits of this technology, however, repeat trials and experiments have shown that outcomes are easily replicated among several groups worldwide. Additionally, the outcomes have increased interest in the field, growing experiments beyond simple case studies to experiments with larger participant basis.|$|E

2500|$|Critics of GM and {{proponents of}} {{electric}} vehicles claim that GM feared {{the emergence of}} electrical vehicle technology because the cars might cut into their profitable spare parts market, as electric cars have far fewer moving parts than combustion vehicles. Critics further charged that when CARB, {{in response to the}} EV1, mandated that electric vehicles make up a certain percentage of all automakers' sales, GM came to fear that the EV1 might encourage unwanted regulation in other states. GM, which was also joined by other automakers, battled against CARB regulations, going as far as to sue CARB in federal court. At the 2000 hearings, GM claimed that consumers were simply not showing sufficient interest in the EV1 to meet the sales requirements called for by CARB mandates. The American automaker, along with Toyota, cited a study they had commissioned, which showed that customers would only choose an electric car over a gasoline car if it cost a full $28,000 less than a comparable gasoline car. Dr. Kenneth E. Train of UC Berkeley, who conducted the study, stated that given a typical retail price of $21,000 for a RAV4 SUV, [...] "Toyota would have to give the average consumer a free RAV4-EV plus a check for approximately $7,000." [...] An independent study commissioned by the California Electric Transportation Coalition (CalETC) and conducted by the Green Car Institute and the Dohring Company automotive market research firm found very different results. The study [...] "used the same <b>research</b> <b>methodologies</b> employed by the auto industry to identify markets for its gasoline vehicles". It found the annual consumer market for EVs to be 12–18% of the new light-duty vehicle market in California, amounting to annual sales of between 151,200 and 226,800 electric vehicles, approximately ten times the quantity specified by CARB's mandate. The study, however, took care to note that vehicles would require increased range and be sold at prices close to a regular gasoline sedan rather than the premium then demanded for electric vehicles. The results of the Toyota-GM study were questioned in light of the success of Toyota's electric RAV4-EV, which retailed at $30,000, though at this price the RAV4 was sold at a net loss. At the hearings, the automakers also presented the hydrogen vehicle as a better alternative to the gasoline car, bolstered by a recent federal earmark for hydrogen research. Many, including members of the CARB hearing committee, were concerned that this was a bait-and-switch on the automakers' part, in order to make CARB eliminate the EV mandate, and that hydrogen was not as viable an alternative as it was made to seem.|$|E

Initially the authors, one being a supervisor and the other, a PhD student and a colleague, were confronted with the question during supervision and writing of a thesis on theoretical research. Reflection on the external examiners’ reports about whether a <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> for theoretical <b>research</b> is necessary prompted the writing of this paper. In order to answer the question, the characteristics of theoretical research are clarified and contrasting views regarding the necessity or not of including a <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> section in such a thesis, are examined. The paper also highlights the justification for including a <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> in a thesis that reports on theoretical research, investigates the soundness of such justification and finally draws conclusions on the matter...|$|R
