50|$|Pozzolona {{increases}} the later age strength of concrete as it reacts with calcium hydroxide {{and turns it}} into calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H). However Portland pozzolona cements have higher activation energy and therefore, their rate of hydration is lower as compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). This results in lower early age strength as compared to OPC. Accelerated curing techniques radically help to increase the rate of strength gain. Halit et al. showed that steam curing improved the 1 day compressive strength values of high volume fly ash concrete mixtures (40%, 50% and 60% fly ash by replacement) from 10MPa to about 20MPa which is sufficient to enable the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> and greatly aids the precast concrete industry.|$|E

30|$|As a {{construction}} material, UHPFRC {{has a high}} potential for newer applications, because of the following superior performance under harsh environments: high impermeability against moisture or other chemicals, high mechanical resistance to corrosion and abrasion, and high physical resistance to impact (Mirmiran and Mohsen 1997; Foster and Mario 2001; Neves and Fernandes de Almeida 2005; Pimienta and Chanvillard 2005; Mehta and Monteiro 2006; Fehling et al. 2008; Paultre et al. 2010; Toutlemonde and Resplendino 2011; Nematollahi et al. 2012; Park et al. 2016).

A wide range of calibrated joint openings between the formwork panels are tested. During casting of the SCC the mortar loss through the gaps is visually observed.

The {{objective of the}} present study is to attain better understanding of the curing mechanism of FBMs and lessen the gap between laboratory curing and field evolution of these mixtures. This was achieved by carrying out a laboratory curing study in two phases. The first phase aimed to understand the curing mechanism and to interpret the level of impact of factors such as temperature and time on the curing of FBMs. The effect of these factors on curing was evaluated with reference to stiffness gain and water loss of FBM specimens. The second phase was intended to develop a tool to assess in-situ curing of FBMs. With a view to assessing in-situ strength (or stiffness) the applicability of the maturity method, which is commonly used to estimate in-situ compressive strength of concrete before <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>formwork,</b> to FBMs was evaluated.

First, {{the location of}} existing reinforcing bar is determined using magnetic techniques. In areas between bars holes are drilled. Into these holes is inserted and glued an L-shaped bar that protrudes 15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches). This bar is retained in the hole with a high-strength epoxy adhesive. The entire surface of the structure is thus covered with closely spaced protrusions. A network of horizontal and vertical reinforcing bars is then attached to these protrusions. Mold surface plates are then positioned to retain high-strength concrete, which is then pumped into the void. After <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>formwork</b> the surface appears similar to the original concrete.

The specimens were cast in the inverted position such that each bar protruded out of one end of the specimen by 15  mm when in the upright position. The protrusions of the bars were meant to allow connection of the electric circuit from the power supply to the specimens. After the main bars were put in place, spiral reinforcements were then tied to the main bars. Subsequently, epoxy coating was applied to both ends of the region of each specimen to prevent corrosion to these regions. Spacer blocks were also put along the spiral reinforcements to ensure required concrete cover. Large pipes of 208  mm diameter were also cut which formed the moulds of the specimens. A slit was made along the longitudinal direction of each pipe to facilitate the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>formwork</b> upon demoulding. The slit was then closed by tying wires around the pipe. After that, the pipes were placed onto the wooden base and sealed along the circumference using silicone. Silicone was also applied along the slit to close up the gap.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of the {{construction}} industry is that projects are too often completed behind schedule (and/or with cost overruns).

A portable and quick way to check and map the uniformity and the strength of concrete has been developed utilizing the use of pressure wave and signal processing techniques.

The accelerometer receives the wave and changes the display from time to frequency domain. The highest observed frequency is determined as the depth frequency. The velocity is calculated as CP = 2 fD. Hundreds of specimens were tested. The relationship between the strength and the velocity is correlated. From correlation equation, the strength of concrete can be estimated within 10 % error (Hamid et al, 2004). The mapping process is done automatically in computer-generated program.

40|$|Concrete is {{the most}} {{important}} building material in the world {{due to the fact that}} it is versatile and gives architectural freedom. For sustainable construction solutions concrete is the material of choice if the embodied CO 2 content is considered. In concrete, cement is the main constituent and due to the limit on the availability of natural minerals used, the energy released and the CO 2 emissions produced during its manufacture, it can be partially replaced using industrial by-products e. g. Pulverised Fuel Ash (PFA), Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag (GGBS) and silica fume. The effects of the partial replacement of cement with these industrial by products on fresh and hardened properties of concrete cured under summer and winter environments are established and compared with the Portland cement (PC) concrete. Early age strength of concrete containing GGBS and PFA is less than the PC concrete, which would prevent its use in the in the post tensioned concrete and in fast-track construction, where early <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>formwork,</b> or early application of load to the structure are the main requirements. For this reason, and due to the demand of high strength concrete in construction, for its improved durability properties, concrete containing GGBS and PFA was produced by keeping the water/cement ratio low and a superplasticiser was used to achieve the required workability.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that a reduced rate of hydration is observed in composite cement materials, but there remains {{a lack of knowledge}} regarding the early age reaction kinetics of the separate phases. This may become important when considering early <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> in practice. Furthermore, the reduced Ca(OH) 2 content, characteristic of composite cements, presents additional limitations when considering resistance to carbonation induced corrosion. The decrease in portlandite content results in a reduced pH; allowing carbonation to progress more readily. This behaviour is likely to become more pronounced with increasing levels of replacement. Moreover, the expected retardation of the rate of CO 2 ingress typically observed in PC systems upon carbonation is a result of densification of the microstructure. This, however, is not concurrent with the behaviour exhibited in composite cements with high replacement levels, in which carbonation may lead to a coarser microstructure and greater porosity. This study investigates the effects of carbonation following short curing periods (72 h) on CEMI and composite cement systems (30 % PFA & 30 % GGBS). Carbonation behaviour changed compared to ‘idealised’/ 28 day lab cured samples and accelerated carbonation testing. Carbonation of Ca(OH) 2 and C-S-H did not occur simultaneously, with decalcification of C-S-H only beginning once no more Ca(OH) 2 was available. Decalcification and dealumination of the C-S-H phase occurred following exposure to ambient [CO 2], and CaCO 3 microcrystals were observed in the outer product (Op) regions only. A reduction in the Ca/Si ratio of the Ip C-S-H appears to be a result of migration of the Ca ions, driven by a concentration gradient. Furthermore, the rate and extent of carbonation {{and the nature of the}} carbonate species formed is dependent on both the level of replacement and the replacement material...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work {{was to understand the}} evolution of early age properties for successful application of geopolymer as an alternative binder. The early age properties like hardening (stiffening) and setting will determine the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> and thus the time of construction. The study was performed on user-friendly geopolymers obtained by using Class F flyash/slag/K-silicate/H 2 O. This involves the use of low concentration alkaline activators and low-temperature curing. A detailed investigation of microstructural development and hardening rate was presented for flyash and slag based geopolymers. Flyash and slag precursors were treated with potassium hydroxide-silicate activator of modulus 1. 25 keeping SiO 2 /K 2 O = 5. 1. For the first time in this study, ultrasonic wave reflection method along with Proctor penetration were used to determine the stiffening rate of geopolymers and their results correlated well. Microstructural development was investigated using SEM/EDS while the reaction rate was monitored through the use of semi-adiabatic calorimetry. An increase in the stiffening rate was observed with the addition of slag. It was concluded that the calcium dissolving from slag influences the early age properties significantly. Possible hypothesis to explain the role of slag on microstructure development and increased rate of stiffening is presented. Microstructural changes responsible for hardening were studied by characterizing geopolymer solids using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The main drawback of using FT-IR was that Si-O-T (T =Al, Si) vibrations from the initial ash, geopolymer product and calcium silicate hydrate, yields an overlapping spectrum bands resulting in a broad hump which is difficult to interpret. This was resolved by separating the spectrum by selectively dissolving calcium silicate hydrate and geopolymer product. Calcium silicate hydrate and geopolymer product were selectively dissolved by salicylic acid extraction method and hydrochloric acid respectively. These extraction methods revealed the presence of calcium silicate hydrate in the samples supporting the theory. The pore solution extracted from geopolymer at various time intervals was also characterized through inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy for various ions like silicon, aluminum and calcium. As variation in ion concentrations was too high between multiple trials, no correlation could be established between the rate of product formation and change in ion concentration. The work on pore solution analysis will be repeated in the future after validating the test set up with more traditional system like cement paste and comparing data with existing literature...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Designing for {{construction}} safety {{is part of}} standard practice {{in countries such as}} the UK, Australia, and South Africa. Designing the permanent facility in a manner to eliminate or reduce the risks of injury, illness, or fatality of construction workers is defined as designing {{for construction}} safety (DfCS). Although evident through research that design is one of the contributing factors to construction hazards, the US construction industry has been resistant in implementing DfCS. Lack of designers' knowledge about the construction processes and limited availability of DfCS tools are examples of inhibitors to {{the development and implementation of}} DfCS. This thesis describes a research effort to develop a DfCS tool that provides knowledge of the construction processes to the designer and helps the designer evaluate design elements in terms of risk factors. The tool, which focuses on a multistory commercial office building, was developed using results obtained from a comprehensive field survey and analysis program on safety risks associated with constructing different design features. The field survey program included the accumulation of 89 design elements and 473 construction activities from construction literature. Using survey methodology, the average exposure and average frequency of four severity categories were obtained for each construction activity. The inputs were provided by superintendents and/or safety managers of general contracting and trade contracting firms. Together the respondents provided a total of more than 33, 800 ratings. The analytical program included conversion of the ratings obtained from the field survey program into unit risk and cumulative risk factors using appropriate scales and computations. The results of this research include the quantification of the unit risk and cumulative risk factors for the 89 design elements and the 473 construction activities. These were put into a MS Excel® spreadsheet which can be used for designing for construction safety. The data was also used to analyze comparisons between risk perceptions of the respondent groups. Group comparisons were made between general contractor superintendents vs trade contractors, general contractor safety managers vs trade contractors, and general contractors vs trade contractors. Using cast-in-place concrete column as an example, the activity risk factors, the four severity category risk factors, and the total risk factors were individually compared. The results indicate that there is no evidence of a difference in risk perception between general contractor superintendents and general contractor safety managers in terms of risk ratings for the activity risk, severity categories, and total risk comparisons. The construction and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> and pouring of concrete show moderate to suggestive evidence of a difference in the sample mean risk perceptions for the three group comparisons. For the four severity levels and total risk comparisons, there is moderate to suggestive evidence of a difference for medium severity, high severity, and total risk for the three group comparisons. There is no evidence of a difference in the way the groups perceive near miss risks. Additionally, comparison between design elements was analyzed. For steel stud versus concrete masonry unit block partition walls, there is moderate evidence that on an average, the construction of CMU block wall has a larger cumulative risk of medium severity and high severity injuries. There is suggestive evidence that the average near misses are more for CMU block partition walls than for steel stud partition walls. Finally, there is moderate evidence that on an average, the total cumulative risk associated with CMU block wall construction is more than that during steel stud wall construction...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporary}} formwork {{system is}} one of the most important features of construction in terms of safety and economy, especially in multi-storey buildings for which post- tensioned slab structures are very common. However, general practices for formwork systems, including removal times, in both post-tensioned and reinforced concrete buildings, have to comply with the standards established for reinforced concrete structures. Although a recommended formwork removal times for reinforced concrete structures is specified in these standards such as in Table 5. 4. 2 (AS 3610), there is no such table which can be easily put into practice by the industry in post-tensioned structures. Nevertheless, some standards, such as AS 3600 and ACI 347 R, specify certain requirements for removal of the formwork system from under a post-tensioned slab. Post-tensioning causes the negative curvature of a slab segment to increase, which increases its cracking moment capacity in the service load range. This may allow formwork supports to be removed earlier from post-tensioned than from reinforced concrete structures. In order to improve current formwork operating practices in post- tensioned building construction, this study has examined the characteristics of reinforced and post-tensioned slabs during construction by taking extensive on-site measurements. Data was collected from two post-tensioned building constructions in Canberra, Australia  a residential 20 -storey building and a commercial low-rise building. The average slab load distribution on a typical suspended post-tensioned slab was determined by monitoring the prop forces, strains in the slab sections, deflections, and ambient and concrete slab temperatures over the construction period of four suspended floor levels. The slab load distribution is generally represented by the ratio of the applied load to the self-weight of the slab and is referred to as the slab load ratio (SLR). There are several methods for estimating the SLR for the reinforced concrete multi-storey building construction. However, very little work has been conducted in the area of SLR estimation for post-tensioned building construction. These SLR estimation methods are usually applied to all formwork systems adopted by the industry in building construction in order to validate decisions regarding the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> supports during construction. SLR estimation methods originally proposed for reinforced iii concrete structures are not necessarily appropriate to post-tensioned structures as they behave differently at the early age. This work proposes a new SLR estimation method designed specifically for post- tensioned structures. It is based on two methods: the Simplified Method used for reinforced concrete structures; and Kajewski's modified Method which has been proposed for post-tensioning structures (Kajewski 1998). An analysis of the collected data is reported and is used in proposing a new SLR estimation method, which is more suitable for post-tensioned structures. It is then applied to determine the load distributions of the post-tensioned slabs in the five most prominent types of formwork support systems. The fundamental concept of this new method is that, if the maximum applied load obtained from the calculated SLR does not exceed the cracking slab load capacity at the desired removal time, the temporary formwork supports may be removed. However, if it does, the slab needs to be supported longer to achieve sufficient strength. Applying the proposed SLR method in the five most commonly employed formwork systems has enabled suitable formwork removal times for post-tensioned multi-storey construction to be proposed. Under this proposal, the props or backprops at the lowest level of support for a suspended post-tensioned slab may be removed one to three days earlier than they are currently, depending on the type of formwork system used. These proposed removal times are validated by investigating the serviceable limits of the slabs: allowable deflection and cracking moment. The particular significance of this work for the construction industry is its potential for improving the economy and speed of construction. It also encourages the practice of applying more suitable shoring and reshoring removal time to post-tensioned construction. A table of prop removal time is provided for the use of post-tensioned structures to go along with AS 3610  Table 5. 4. 2 which is more suitable for traditional reinforced concrete construction. The proposed new SLR method offers a greater accuracy in determining the slab load distributions of post-tensioned structures in multi- storey building construction...|$|E

Findings. The author found that the structure formation process develops in the hydrating modified cement system as a result of interaction of various macroions. In this process its active parts prevail, which considerably exceed its dissipative part compared to normal conditions of hardening. Originality. There were established the regularities of structure formation of modified cement system, reinforced with synthesized, well crystallized helical filamentary crystals, mechanical grip of which is considered as a principal source of strength in combination with an additional coupling achieved due to cross-germination of crystals. Practical value. In the study the increased binding capacity of cement in high strength concretes and the use of modified cement systems in the special conditions of concreting were considered. The organo-mineral modifying complex that provides the dispersed reinforcement of concrete cement matrix which allows modifying the process of cement matrix structure formation by changing the nature of the surface of binder and modifier was developed. The temperature factor has no negative influence on the hardening concrete and complex modifier provides the improved physico-mechanical characteristics of cement matrix and concrete by means of the primary changes in the system state. In the modified hydrating cement system as a result of interaction of various macroions the structure-forming process with advantage of active parts, which significantly exceed its dissipative part of the normal conditions of hardening are developing. The results of modeling the behavior of modified hydrating cement system show that fluctuations in the concentration of intermediate hydration products are observed in the system.

This paper explores one such approach that, with the help of BIM authoring tool and its Application Programming Interface (API), reduces the efforts expended on formwork design for concrete structures. The paper utilises the concept of using BIM data as input to compute the quantity <b>of</b> <b>formwork,</b> and generate visualisations and schedule <b>of</b> <b>formwork.</b> The developed approach first takes data input from semantic BIM to the API environment for computation and design <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> systems, which is then placed within the BIM model, to generate visualisation and prepare schedules. The research work utilises a structural concrete wall as an example to demonstrate the presented approach. The approach will be influential in streamlining the formwork design process in the BIM environment and reducing efforts required by the designer and the planning engineer. Since the formwork elements are generated as 3 -Dimensional (3 D) solids and smart BIM elements, the generated model <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> can be used for resolving clashes, scheduling, and resource planning...|$|R

40|$|Formwork is {{a common}} system of {{elements}} and details which provides the necessary forms for monolithic structures. Efficiency <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> is constantly increasing and more advanced formwork technologies are discovered; therefore, this improvement may speed up the construction installation time and positively influence the cost of installation. Proper choice <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> systems {{is a key to}} a successful project. The aim of the master thesis is to analyse the appropriateness <b>of</b> sliding <b>formworks</b> compared with an alternative type <b>of</b> movable <b>formwork.</b> The study describes sliding and movable formworks. The study uses the construction indicators of the silo tower installed in the year 2011 in sliding formwork. It is compared with the movable formworks with working platforms system from Doka. After the calculations, installation of a building with different formwork systems is compared. The height from which it is appropriate to use sliding formwork was found.

40|$|With the {{development}} of monolithic construction an issue about improving the efficiency of its use appears. One {{of the ways to}} increase it is expedient use <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> systems. The studies have shown problems in the existing regulatory documentation in relation to progressive shuttering. The paper describes methods and results of computational experiments to study the technical and economic indicators of the construction of monolithic frame in disassembled formwork. It describes the most well-known systems <b>of</b> such <b>formwork</b> in Ukraine, which can be used to concrete buildings under lease or purchase by a contracting organization.

The obtained results suggest that it is reasonable to account a variety <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> systems and their conditions of use at a particular site.

40|$|Concrete {{formwork}} is {{a common}} type of temporary structure used on construction projects. Due to difficulties in considering actual construction site implications during <b>formwork</b> design, assessments <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> integrity are often made in the field by site personnel based on subjective visual inspection. The use and re-use <b>of</b> concrete <b>formwork</b> exposes the workers involved in formwork use to different types of injury. This research study aims at: (i) mapping a general site activity workflow for the use and re-use of vertical formwork; (ii) evaluating onsite safety risks associated with formwork use and re-use activities, and (iii) assessing the reliability associated with formwork use and re-use. Development of the mapped workflow and identification of safety risks associated with each activity were based on interviews of construction site foremen involved in formwork construction and jobsite observations <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> construction activities. Based on results from the survey on 32 carpenters engaged in concrete work, worker risk associated with formwork activities was quantified. Erection, stripping, and assembly <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> {{were found to be}} activities that contribute most to the cumulative risk.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} predict the varying <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> pressure over time, {{it is necessary}} to consider various factors influencing the development <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> pressure. A prediction model has been previously proposed, but that model has some limitations in that only intrinsic material characteristics are taken into account. Extrinsic effects such as wall friction, formwork flexibility, and external temperature are excluded in the model. This study focuses on the wall friction effect as one of the extrinsic factors. First, by incorporating the intrinsic model and friction stress acting on the interface, a method <b>of</b> calculating <b>formwork</b> pressure considering the wall friction effect is suggested. To find out how much friction stress is acting on the interface and how it varies over time, formwork pressure tests were performed with circular column formworks having three different diameters. In these columns, the vertical pressure at the bottom and the lateral pressures were measured. To calibrate parameters of the intrinsic model for the same material as that used in the formwork pressure tests, additional tests were conducted with a specially designed apparatus that can exclude effects of extrinsic factors. From tests and analysis results, it was found that wall friction greatly affects the variation <b>of</b> <b>formwork</b> pressure over time. The newly suggested calculation method can give a good prediction <b>of</b> real <b>formwork</b> pressure. close 5...|$|R
