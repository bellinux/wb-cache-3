5|$|A Chinese study {{published}} in 2001 used the molecular biological technique <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> length polymorphism to analyze the differences in DNA sequence between 23 A.gallica specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere. The results suggest that based on the <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> length polymorphism patterns observed, there are four global A.gallica subpopulations: the Chinese, European, North American–Chinese, and North American–European geographical lineages. A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of Armillaria, using fruit body and pure culture morphology, concluded that there are several unnamed species (Chinese biological species C, F, H, J and L) {{that are similar to}} the common A.gallica.|$|E

Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis as a distinct species. A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct.|$|E

40|$|A novel DNA {{fingerprinting}} {{technique called}} AFLP is described. The AFLP technique {{is based on}} the selective PCR amplification of <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> from a total digest of genomic DNA. The technique involves three steps: (i) restriction of the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters, (ii) selective amplification of sets of <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments,</b> and (iii) gel analysis of the amplified fragments. PCR amplification of <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer annealing. The selective amplification is achieved by the use of primers that extend into the <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments,</b> amplifying only those fragments in which the primer extensions match the nucleotides flanking the restriction sites. Using this method, sets of <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> may be visualized by PCR without knowledge of nucleotide sequence. The method allows the specific co-amplification of high numbers of <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments.</b> The number of fragments that can be analyzed simultaneously, however, is dependent on the resolution of the detection system. Typically 50 - 100 <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> are amplified and detected on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The AFLP technique provides a novel and very powerful DNA fingerprinting technique for DNAs of any origin or complexity...|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} {{a simple and}} accurate method to analyze <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The two complementary strands of <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> are separated through hybridization to a capture probe, which is a single-stranded undigested fragment. Using the biotin–streptavidin linkage, the hybrid is immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. After conditioning the captured <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments,</b> they are eluted from the probe and their molecular weights are determined. The proposed method greatly improves the quality, and reduces {{the complexity of the}} mass spectrum by analyzing only one of the complementary strands of <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments...</b>|$|R
40|$|The genome of Myxococcus xanthus, {{which is}} 9, 454 kbp, {{is one of}} the largest {{bacterial}} genomes. The organization of the DNA and the distribution of genes encoding social and developmental behaviors were examined by using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Intact genomic DNA was digested with AseI into 16 <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments,</b> which were separated by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis, purified, and radiolabeled. Each AseI fragment was hybridized to SpeI-digested DNA and to an M. xanthus genomic library contained in yeast artificial chromosomes. Some SpeI <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> and yeast artificial chromosome clones contained AseI sites and hybridized with two different AseI <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments,</b> providing evidence for the juxtaposition of these AseI <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> in the chromosome. The deduced AseI physical map is circular, suggesting that this bacterium contains a single, circular chromosome. Transposable elements shown by transduction to be in or near genes of interest were located on specific AseI <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> by <b>restriction</b> analysis and Southern hybridization.

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} 16S ribosomal DNA suggest that S.iniae {{is closely related}} to other streptococcal pathogens of humans and animals. Specifically, it is clustered in the pyogenic group, along with other pathogenic streptococci such as S.pyogenes, S.agalactiae, S.uberis, S.canis, S.porcinus, S.phocae, and S.intestinalis. Of these related species, it is most closely related to S. porcinus. Genomic <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> analysis of diverse host and geographical panels of S.iniae isolates has shown common profiles between virulent fish and human strains, though multiple pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns have been identified among human isolates.|$|E
5|$|Rolf Singer's fourth edition (1986) of his {{comprehensive}} Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy included Collybia racemosa {{in section}} Collybia, {{in addition to}} the three species that currently comprise the genus Collybia: C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei. A phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei form a monophyletic group within a larger Lyophyllum–Tricholoma–Collybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum, Tricholoma, Lepista, Hypsizygus and the species C.racemosa. Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia. <b>Restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> length polymorphism analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections, fruit body pigmentation, and macrochemical reactions, they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C.racemosa.|$|E
25|$|A {{genetic map}} is a map {{based on the}} {{frequencies}} of recombination between markers during crossover of homologous chromosomes. The greater the frequency of recombination (segregation) between two genetic markers, the further apart they are assumed to be. Conversely, the lower the frequency of recombination between the markers, the smaller the physical distance between them. Historically, the markers originally used were detectable phenotypes (enzyme production, eye colour) derived from coding DNA sequences; eventually, confirmed or assumed noncoding DNA sequences such as microsatellites or those generating <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been used.|$|E

Stable curvature in the SV 40 and M 13 <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> is due a series of closely spaced A-tracts, runs of 4 to 6 contiguous adenine residues located within 40 or 60 base pair “curvature modules” near the center of each fragment. The M 13 and SV 40 <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> exhibit bends of ~ 45 ° in solutions containing monovalent cations and ~ 58 ° in solutions containing Mg 2 + ions. The curvature is not localized at a single site but is distributed over the various A-tracts in the curvature modules. Thermal denaturation studies indicate that the curvature in the M 13 and SV 40 <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> remains constant up to 30 °C in solutions containing monovalent cations, and up to 40 °C in solutions containing Mg 2 + ions, before beginning to decrease slowly with increasing temperature.

25|$|The total {{population}} of individual clones obtained in a molecular cloning experiment is often termed a DNA library.

25|$|The Iriomote cat's karyotype, the <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> {{length of}} the ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and {{molecular}} phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA and cytochrome b {{have proven to be}} identical, or nearly so, to the leopard cat's. The two cats are assumed to be extremely closely related, their differences being categorized as either intraspecies variations or individual mutations. Also, from the speed of cytochrome b's base-pair substitution and its diversity, it is estimated that the Iriomote cat diverged from the leopard cat around 180,000-200,000 years ago. According to marine geologists, the Ryukyu Islands were connected to mainland Asia via a land bridge from about 20,000 years ago to 240,000 years ago. Scientists believe that the Iriomote cat moved its range to the islands during this period. Because of this, it is assumed that there is little genetic variety within the species.|$|E
25|$|Samples from bloody shoe prints leading {{away from}} the bodies and from the back gate of the {{condominium}} were tested for DNA matches. Initial polymerase chain reaction testing did not rule out Simpson as a suspect. In more precise <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> length polymorphism tests, matches were found between Simpson's blood and blood samples taken {{from the crime scene}} (both the shoe prints in blood and the gate samples). Police criminalist Dennis Fung testified that this DNA evidence put Simpson at Brown's townhouse {{at the time of the}} murders. But defense expert Barry Scheck conducted an eight-day cross-examination, questioning most of the DNA evidence. Dr. Robin Cotton, of Cellmark Diagnostics, testified for six days. Blood evidence had been tested at two separate laboratories, each conducting different tests. At this time, the general population was still unfamiliar with the precision and significance of DNA matching.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} test for the {{occurrence}} of rearrangements in DNA during development and to assess the rate of DNA divergence during evolution, we have compared <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> derived from DNA from four sources: sperm cells and somatic tissues of one strain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, somatic tissues of a second strain of the same species, and whole animals of a closely related species. <b>Restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> were detected by hybridizing radioactive cloned <b>fragments</b> to <b>restriction</b> digests that had been fractionated by size on agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. In this way, approximately 50 BamHI <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> were visualized and compared. Fragments from sperm and somatic DNAs {{were found to be}} identical; 15 % differed in size between the two strains. Little cross homology was found between the two species. We conclude that, if rearrangements occur in C. elegans DNA during development, they must affect fewer than a few percent of the <b>restriction</b> <b>fragments</b> or <b>restriction</b> sites.

25|$|The species Trypanosoma brucei, {{which causes}} the disease, {{has often been}} {{subdivided}} into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans. The trypanosomes infectious to animals and not to humans were named Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Strains that infected humans {{were divided into two}} subspecies based on their different virulences: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense was thought to have a slower onset and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense refers to strains with a more rapid, virulent onset. This characterization has always been problematic but was the best that could be done given the knowledge of the time and the tools available for identification. A recent molecular study using <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> length polymorphism analysis suggests that the three subspecies are polyphyletic, so the elucidation of the strains of T. brucei infective to humans requires a more complex explanation.

25|$|Initially, the DNA of {{interest}} {{needs to be}} isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using restriction enzymes, and incubated with the fragment {{of interest}} under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, electroporation, optical injection and biolistics. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, {{there is a need}} to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of PCR, <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E

In one particular forest stand, Armillaria-infected oak trees had been harvested, and their stumps were left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus, identified as A.gallica (then known as A.bulbosa). Using molecular genetics, they determined that the underground mycelia of one individual fungal colony covered , weighing over , with an estimated age of 1,500 years. The analysis used <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to examine isolates collected from fruit bodies and rhizomorphs (underground aggregations of fungal cells that resemble plant roots) along [...] transects in the forest. The 15-hectare area yielded isolates that had identical mating type alleles and mitochondrial DNA <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> patterns; this degree of genetic similarity indicated that the samples were all derived from a single genetic individual, or clone, that had reached its size through vegetative growth. In their conclusion the authors noted: [...] "This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth." [...] After the Nature paper was published, major media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found; {{as a result of this}} publicity, the individual acquired the common name [...] "humongous fungus". There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other large organisms such as the blue whale or the giant redwood.|$|E
