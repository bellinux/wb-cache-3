The choice of magenta and yellow paint for the jets was a move to offset the city's stereotypical {{overcast}} skies. The choice of jets was a reference to the city's aviation history; its use of a non-aggressive and bird-like arrangement (itself a reference to the city bird, the Blue heron) was a counter to the inherent aggressiveness of jets as a symbol.|$|E

The parish of Avoch lay within Thomas' diocese, but the Abbot of Kinloss claimed the primary right to possess it. A papal mandate was issued on 5 January 1325 to William de Lindores, the Chancellor of Ross, commanding him to judge the dispute. Bishop Thomas was almost certainly alive on that date, but he was dead by 17 April, when Roger, canon of Abernethy, received papal provision to the bishopric of <b>Ross,</b> <b>said</b> to be vacant by Thomas' death.|$|E

In September of that year, she became a Democrat and unsuccessfully sought the governorship in that party's primary.

Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for floatation as a public company from the Capital Issues Committee. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.|$|E

In the following fourteen years, Maryland had two winning seasons and appeared in one bowl game.|$|E
500|$|Other Passions {{cast members}} {{agreed that the}} Russells were not portrayed as racial stereotypes; Tracey <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> her {{character}} Eve is [...] "just a person" [...] and is not purely defined by her race, and Charles Divins, who played Chad Harris-Crane, said the show's treatment of the Russells as [...] "a strong African American family" [...] was [...] "refreshing."

500|$|Critics have {{compared}} Radiohead's statements of political dissatisfaction {{to those of}} earlier rock bands. David Stubbs said that, where punk rock had been a rebellion against a time of deficit and poverty, OK Computer protested the [...] "mechanistic convenience" [...] of contemporary surplus and excess. Alex <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> the album [...] "pictured the onslaught of the Information Age and a young person's panicky embrace of it" [...] and made the band into [...] "the poster boys for {{a certain kind of}} knowing alienation—as Talking Heads and R.E.M. had been before." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times found precedents in the work of Pink Floyd and Madness for Radiohead's concerns [...] "about a culture of numbness, building docile workers and enforced by self-help regimes and anti-depressants." ...|$|E
500|$|Other Passions {{cast members}} {{had a more}} {{uncertain}} understanding of the character. Tracey Ross, who portrayed Eve Russell, responded negatively to Vincent's involvement in her character's storylines. While discussing the filming of the scenes in which Vincent gives birth to his father's child, <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> she felt [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and could only complete them after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of [...] " [...] comedic possibilities". Vincent's manipulation of Eve to incorrectly reattach Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore, ("This {{has got to be}} the worst storyline ever done, what are they doing?"), who cited it as a reason for the show's cancellation. Kim Johnston Ulrich, who played Ivy Winthrop, said she was confused by Vincent's story arcs even though she was a fan of the series' supernatural elements.|$|E
500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} Yorke, are more {{abstract}} compared to his personal, emotional lyrics for The Bends. Critic Alex <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> the lyrics [...] "seemed {{a mixture of}} overheard conversations, techno-speak, and fragments of a harsh diary" [...] with [...] "images of riot police at political rallies, anguished lives in tidy suburbs, yuppies freaking out, sympathetic aliens gliding overhead." [...] Recurring themes include transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism. Yorke said: [...] "On this album, the outside world became all there was... I'm just taking Polaroids of things around me moving too fast." [...] He told Q: [...] "It was like there's a secret camera {{in a room and}} it's watching the character who walks in—a different character for each song. The camera's not quite me. It's neutral, emotionless. But not emotionless at all. In fact, the very opposite." ...|$|E

500|$|Marshall's {{performance}} {{received a}} positive response from Passions cast members, while her exit {{was the subject of}} criticism. Ross felt that Marshall had the most demanding role on the soap opera, and commended her ability to make [...] "Liz want to have sex {{in the middle of the}} tsunami" [...] look believable. During the filming of the show, <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> she used to watch Marshall and take notes on how to improve her own acting. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ross criticized the decision to remove Marshall, and said, [...] "When you're an actress of her caliber and kind to everyone and plan Christmas parties and celebrate everyone's birthday and know your lines and are the most darling girl that ever breathed, of course you're going to be fired!" [...] Rodney Van Johnson, who portrayed T. C. Russell, said that he was disappointed when the show began removing its racially diverse actors, feeling that it was a sign of its imminent cancellation.|$|E
500|$|Hawley {{also brought}} his visual effects {{supervisor}} John Ross from Fargo. Ross coordinated multiple visual effects vendors for Legion, {{which he described}} as [...] "a bit of a crapshoot" [...] because artists were often not able {{to work on the}} same shot week-to-week. He noted that though [...] "hundreds of thousands of dollars" [...] was spent on major visual effect sequences for the show, [...] "we don’t dwell on that aspect. There’s a jeep that gets slammed down , which the characters hide behind before it gets flung back into the building, but we pan off it, just throwing it away, because the destruction isn’t the point of the scene." [...] He compared this mindset to M. Night Shyamalan's approach to superpowers in Unbreakable. When realizing characters' special abilities, <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> it [...] "comes down to tying this fantastic beam coming out to somebody’s hand, and showing how it lights up a face and distorts the air as it travels across frame.

500|$|Columnist Mike Mooneyham of The Post and Courier {{stated that}} it is [...] "an oft-asked question" [...] as to when Chyna will be {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame.

[...] On February 9, 2015, during a WWE Network podcast with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H mentioned that Chyna deserved to be in the Hall of Fame but that problems with children Googling her prohibited it. The day following her death, a post on WWE.com expressed sadness about it and featured a video of her winning the Women's Championship. In an interview with The Daily Mirror shortly after her death, Triple H said that she [...] "definitely warranted" [...] a place in the Hall of Fame. [...] The following month, Stephanie McMahon said she was sure Chyna would be inducted but was not sure what year it would happen. After a long time without the WWE acknowledging anything about Laurer's career, on the April 25 episode of Raw, WWE played a memory posthumous tribute in her honor.|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] finished eighteenth {{in the ratings}} for the week of February 6 to February 12, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 14.9. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Entertainment Weeklys Dalton <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> the episode was both touching and humorous. He added that in the scene where Bart runs a videotape in slow motion to show Lisa how [...] "you can actually pin-point the second when [...] heart rips in half", the audience does not really know [...] "whether you're shedding tears of laughter, empathy, or both—you just know that it's damn good any way you slice it." [...] The Arizona Republics Bill Goodykoontz named the episode one of his five favorites and highlighted Ralph's line [...] "and my doctor said I wouldn't have so many nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of there" [...] {{as one of the}} best lines in the history of the show. In a review of The Simpsons season four, Lyndsey Shinoda of Video Store cited [...] "Brother from the Same Planet" [...] and [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] among her [...] "personal favorites" [...] from the season.|$|E
500|$|Tracey Ross was {{originally}} hesitant {{to audition for}} another soap opera after her stint as Diana Douglas on Ryan's Hope from 1985 to 1987, which she compared to [...] "working in a morgue" [...] because the show was constantly threatened with cancellation. She initially rejected the offer to play Eve Russell, but she was repeatedly contacted by NBC about the role over several months before her agent convinced her to audition for Passions casting director Jackie Briskey. <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> later {{that she did not}} realize that Passions was supposed to be [...] "wacky" [...] until the character Grace Bennett floated out of her bedroom window. Based on the first week's scripts, she described Passions as [...] "my kind of show" [...] owing to the supernatural and fantasy elements. Ross played the role from the series debut on July 5, 1999 to its finale on August 7, 2008. In 2003, actresses Amanda Maiden and Kimberly Kevon Williams played the character in flashbacks to her childhood and her time as a nightclub singer. Ross described Passions as the opposite of Ryan's Hope; Passions, she felt, was [...] "the spring of a soap opera" [...] because of the cast and crew's excitement about future storylines, while Ryan's Hope was [...] "the winter of one" [...] due to the fear of cancellation.|$|E
500|$|Vincent {{was portrayed}} by Phillip Jeanmarie from December 26, 2006– July 18, 2008; Valerie Davis was played by Daphnée Duplaix from December 16, 2004– May 28, 2008 and {{temporarily}} by Siena Goines from January 30, 2007– April 3, 2007. The character received mixed reactions from the show's cast and television critics. Jeanmarie described Vincent as representing {{the way in}} which Passions [...] "pushed the boundaries and limits of what other soap operas didn't dare to do." [...] On the other hand, Tracey <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> the storyline of Vincent giving birth to his father's child made her [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and she could only complete the delivery scenes after the show's acting coach Maria O'Brien convinced her of [...] "the comedic possibilities." [...] Jamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential felt that Jeanmarie deserved an Emmy for making Vincent's outlandish situations believable. Josh Robertson of Complex called Duplaix, who had been a Playboy Playmate, {{one of the most successful}} soap actresses for her performances as Valerie in 34 episodes of Passions, along with her portrayal of Rachel Gannon in 95 episodes of One Life to Live. Herndon L. Davis of Windy City Times criticized the show's representation of Vincent's sexual relationship with Chad as [...] "a down-low storyline which involved an African-American man but eventually turned it into an outrageous intersex serial killer storyline." ...|$|E

500|$|Both Dozier and Yuricon {{president}} Erica Friedman {{wrote about}} the sexual nature of Honey, including the lesbian desire of the Jewel Princess (one of Honey's enemies) {{for her in the}} second episode. Friedman—who had looked for such [...] "implied yuri" [...] in Cutie Honey manga—called the Princess's appearance [...] "*just* what I was hoping for", and praised Honey's change to her S Queen form in response. <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> about the series: [...] "It's seemingly exploitative, it's incredibly sexist, and the female members of my household - you'd expect them to be indignant, but, no, they were laughing their butts off because it was so blatant, and yet Honey was actually never objectified in the whole series." [...] He further writes, [...] "Honey Kisaragi is an extremely strong character who is no damsel in distress. If anyone needs help in this series, it's the guys!" [...] Toole said that Jessica Calvello [...] "gives the character a growling, tough-girl charm that was conspicuously absent from the original version", while Dozier said that Calvello captured [...] "the combination of innocence and bravado [...] that is both so confusing and yet so appropriate". Beveridge said the [...] "fight sequences are pretty well done and provide some fun moments watching Honey battle the various demonic forms", but concluded that Honey main goal is to showcase the lead heroine's changes: [...] "Oh, lets face it. it's all about the half to completely naked transformation sequences.

500|$|Ross {{described}} Eve's {{relationship with}} Julian Crane as an authentic representation of an interracial couple. She felt Eve was written as a fully realized person {{with her own}} story, {{rather than as a}} [...] "walking, living philosophical statement" [...] about race relations. Ross praised [...] "the people who laid the groundwork for [...] " [...] and allowed characters to be played other than [...] "in a minstrel-like way", similar to Ellen DeGeneres paving the way for Will & Grace. Ross and Amelia Marshall, who played Eve's adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne, believed that the relationship emphasized a difference in social classes rather than races. Initially, Ross felt intimidated by playing a part of a supercouple, saying [...] "t means so much to me that I want to do it justice", but following the show's cancelation, she identified it as her favorite storyline. She went on to equate the Julian and Eve's love story to that of Romeo and Juliet. [...] "My Baby's Gone", a song that Eve frequently performs on the show during flashbacks, was used to symbolize Eve's relationship with Julian. Ross recorded the vocals for it, as well as four other songs, without the aid of Auto-Tune. Passions was Ross' first singing role. When asked by a fan about her experiences singing on the show, <b>Ross</b> <b>said</b> she worked with a vocal coach, and described her sound as [...] "sincere, soft, [...] non-grating".|$|E
500|$|THEM Anime Review's Carlos <b>Ross</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The voice-acting is remarkable, the {{directing}} is solid, {{and music}} is quite competent. But the real kicker {{here is the}} animation quality, which actually equals (and sometimes exceeds) that of excellent television series like Vandread and Full Metal Panic...there is a remarkable amount of storyline; the plot is well-written and executed, and never {{gets a chance to}} be too drawn out. And Shinkai gives equal time to the slick action sequences and the well-handled, genuinely touching romance". IGN's [...] A.E. Sparrow said, [...] "While [...] was visually one of the best pieces of eye-candy I have seen in a year or so, it's ultimately a voice track over a sequence of pretty pictures. Don't get me wrong, it was absolutely beautiful, but it left me wanting more". Mania's Chris Beveridge commended ADV Films for obtaining [...] the original computer files that were used to create it. He said, [...] "the transfer here is simply gorgeous. Colors are amazingly lush and deep, saturated without bleeding. Cross coloration is non-existent and only a few very minor areas of aliasing occur. The only real 'flaw' that I could see with this transfer is during some of the panning sequences up and down, there’s a slight stutter that’s simply inherent in the materials". DVDs Worth Watching's Johanna Draper Carlson said, [...] "the character designs are familiar and uninspired, and the cross-cutting choppy".|$|E
