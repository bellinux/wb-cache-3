5|$|Cleveland next faced San Francisco at home, winning 37–14 {{before one}} of the biggest crowds of the season. Chet Adams opened the scoring for the Browns with a 44-yard field goal; he and Lou Saban shared kicking duties in the game after Groza pulled his leg muscle during pre-game warmups. On the ensuing possession, Albert had the ball {{stripped}} by Cleveland's Weldon Humble, and the Browns took over and scored their first touchdown on a Graham pass to Lavelli. San Francisco scored a touchdown near the beginning of the second quarter, but Cleveland dominated the scoring thereafter. Lavelli caught seven passes for a total of three touchdowns, setting an AAFC single-game record. Graham also rushed for a one-yard touchdown and threw for 222 yards. His touchdown passes made him the league leader in that category, with 18 on the season. It was the biggest margin of victory the Browns had ever recorded against the 49ers. Cleveland was helped by an adjustment Paul Brown made in his receivers' routes; the coach had Lavelli and Speedie <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> {{the middle of the field}} instead of trying to get open near the sidelines, as they had done in past games. The victory clinched the AAFC's western division for the Browns and assured the team a spot in the championship game.|$|E
25|$|Just over 30 minutes later, {{at about}} 6:00am, two drivers heading into Wiesbaden town centre {{saw a man}} <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> them on the Berliner Straße (Bundesstraße 455), a four-lane dual carriageway. The spot, near an Aral garage, was around five {{kilometres}} (c.three miles) from the apartment in which Duggan had been staying, and {{not far from the}} LaRouche offices in the Wiesbaden suburb of Erbenheim.|$|E
25|$|Edmonton {{railway station}} {{is served by}} Via Rail trains on their transcontinental service The Canadian. Westbound trains of The Canadian {{continue}} toward Jasper, Alberta, while eastbound trains <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The station is located near the City Centre Airport. Formerly, the Via trains arrived at the CN office tower downtown, in the Old Canadian National rail yard, but the downtown trackage has been abandoned to the LRT and new urban development. The High Level Bridge, formerly CPR's route into the downtown, {{is used in the}} summer for historical streetcars.|$|E

Routes 33, 41, 41b and 41c stop on the west side of the squ{{are on the}}ir way to the {{northern}} suburbs. The square's bus stops are also covered by the hop-on, hop-off city centre 75 cent fare. The 41 bus is almost certainly the cheapest transport link to Dublin Airport from the city at €2.70 (as of 2017) from the square. The main entrance to Dublin Bus' Summerhill Depot is on Mountjoy Place, just off the south-east corner of the square.|$|E
25|$|José Guillén made {{controversial}} {{remarks about}} Royals fans following booing in the June 25 {{game against the}} Rockies which prompted him to apologize days later to the Royals fanbase and team management. Fans booed Guillén {{in the eighth inning}} of the Royals' 4-2 win. He grounded to Colorado Rockies third baseman Garrett Atkins and began a slow <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> first base. Atkins' throw was off target, forcing Todd Helton to leave the bag. If Guillén had been at full speed, he might have been safe. Guillén had been battling several injuries which had caused him to play easier {{in order to avoid the}} disabled list.|$|E
25|$|The {{basement}} proper was {{one hundred}} {{feet long and}} forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sized on either side. The sides of the rooms were stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With {{the exception of the}} two rooms at the West end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each side room rose two steps in height from the basement floor. The rooms were dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down {{to the center of the}} room to allow water to <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> a drain beneath the font.|$|E

25|$|Sheridan, {{who would}} be {{characterized}} in later battles as very aggressive, hesitated to pursue the smaller force, and also refused a request by Daniel McCook to move north {{in support of his}} brother's corps. However, his earlier request for reinforcements bore fruit and the 31st Brigade of Col. William P. Carlin (Mitchell's division) moved up on Sheridan's right. Carlin's men moved aggressively in pursuit of Powel, chasing them {{as fast as they could}} <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> Perryville. As they reached the cemetery on the western outskirts of town, fierce artillery dueling commenced. Carlin pressed forward and was joined by the 21st Brigade of Col. George D. Wagner (Wood's division, II Corps). They were poised to capture the town and the critical crossroads that dominated Braxton Bragg's avenue of withdrawal, but an order from Gilbert to Mitchell curtailed the advance, despite Mitchell's furious protestations.|$|E
25|$|When {{they started}} their return trip, the cavalrymen {{came under fire}} from the woods about three miles from Fairfax Court House. Major Remington sent two squads of four {{dismounted}} men into the woods to investigate. One of the men's horses bolted and started to <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> Fairfax Court House. Lt. Dagwell pursued the runaway horse and met the advanced guard of four men of the detachment just outside their old camp where they found citizens loading wagons with everything of value {{that had not been}} removed or burned by the Union Army in their move north. As Lt. Dagwell found the horse entering the courtyard of the courthouse, he saw that the yard was filled with what he estimated to be about 65 Confederate troops. Believing the Confederates must be some of Major John S. Mosby's partisans, Dagwell turned his horse and fled as the Confederates fired at him.|$|E
500|$|Gunn had a [...] "fantastic {{rapport with}} the Norwich supporters". As a player, he liked [...] "to tease the crowd during the game". Before each half of a match, Gunn would <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> his goal and pretend to attempt to headbutt the crossbar. Gunn {{says this is a}} habit he began as a youngster, and cannot {{remember}} how or why he began to do it. Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, [...] "would wait until I got to about the 18-yard line and then start a small [...] "Wooo..." [...] which would build into a full-blown [...] "WOOOO ... AH!" ... I loved it and came close to smacking my head against the woodwork a couple of times". [...] During play, he would cup his ear, which would prompt shouts of [...] "Bryan, Bryan, give us a wave".|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} were diligent {{in ensuring}} the boys' security. O'Mahoney explained: [...] "They were under very strict security rules {{when they were}} filming. They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> a bombing, knowing {{that there could be a}} secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if they see me with a camera they will take me to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The iron law {{of wages}} is a {{proposed}} law of economics that asserts that real wages always tend, {{in the long}} <b>run,</b> <b>toward</b> the minimum wage necessary to sustain {{the life of the}} worker. [...] The theory was first named by Ferdinand Lassalle in the mid-nineteenth century. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels attribute the doctrine to Lassalle (notably in Marx's 1875 Critique of the Gotha Programme), the idea to Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population, and the terminology to Goethe's [...] "great, eternal iron laws" [...] in Das Göttliche.|$|E

2500|$|The California Golden Bears {{football}} team is the college {{football team}} of the University of California, Berkeley. The team plays its home games at California Memorial Stadium. Memorial Stadium was built to honor Berkeley alumni, students, and other Californians who died in World War I and modeled after the Colosseum in Rome. Memorial Stadium was {{named one of the}} 40 best college football stadiums by the Sporting News. The team also has produced two of the oddest and most memorable plays in college football: Roy [...] "Wrong Way" [...] Riegels' fumble recovery and <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> the California goal line in the 1929 Rose Bowl, and The Play in the 1982 Big Game with the last play five lateral winning kickoff return.|$|E
2500|$|Patterson {{estimated}} he {{was about}} 25ft (7.6 m) away from the creature at his closest. Patterson said that his horse reared upon sensing the figure, and he spent about twenty seconds extricating himself from the saddle, controlling his horse, getting around to its other side, and getting his camera from a saddlebag before he could <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> the figure while operating his camera. He yelled [...] "Cover me" [...] to Gimlin, [...] "meaning to get the gun out". He crossed the creek on horseback after Patterson had run well beyond it, riding on a path somewhat {{to the left of}} Patterson's and somewhat beyond his position. Perez estimates he came within 60–90 feet of [...] "Patty". Then, rifle in hand, he dismounted, but did not point his rifle at the creature.|$|E
2500|$|Newark has a Rail Station (...) located to {{the south}} of {{downtown}} near the University of Delaware campus that is serviced by both SEPTA and Amtrak on the Northeast Corridor. Newark is the last stop on the SEPTA Wilmington/Newark Line, one of the farthest points out on the system. SEPTA service to Newark involves 4 trains in both directions during the morning and evening rush hours, weekdays only. There is limited Amtrak service in Newark with one to two trains per day toward New York, and one train per day toward Washington. Newark is also served by two freight railroads: Norfolk Southern, which provides freight service on the Northeast Corridor line and has a branch that splits {{to the south}} to <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> the Delmarva Peninsula and an interchange with the Delmarva Central Railroad, and CSX, which passes through the northern part of Newark along the Philadelphia Subdivision line.|$|E

2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in my head. That was a mental error there. As soon as I {{realized there was}} no one to hand it to I started to <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> the line and tried to cover it up and just get down and I slid right into Brandon Moore." [...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. I guess (I was) more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E

However, Xiao Feng wakes up soon after. Then, time goes on (and a hermit crab scuttles across the camera) and Xiao Feng and Ah Ken get married. Dressed in their wedding glory, they say you can hear the friends through the whale doll. Suddenly, all of their friends <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> them and congratulate them.
