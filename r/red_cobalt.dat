40|$|The DNA of five {{strains of}} discus (Symphyodon aequifaciata) were {{compared}} by random ampli- fied polymorphic DNA (RAPD PCR) using seven primers. Only two primers (ZG 4 and ZG 8) were suitable. Using primer ZG 8, the red turquoise strain had five bands common {{to at least}} one fish of another strain and two bands common to all the fish in the red turquoise strain. Panda turquoise had one band in common with at least one fish of another strain and seven bands common to all panda turquoise. For royal red, these figures were five and one and for common brown they were three and one. Within the strains, the level of band-sharing was 0. 83 in the red turquoise strain, 0. 13 in the panda turquoise, 0. 83 in the royal red and 0. 75 in the common brown. Specific bands were found only with primer ZG 8 in the common brown and panda turquoise strains. Using primer ZG 4, very low variation was found between the royal <b>red,</b> <b>cobalt</b> blue and red turquoise strains. With both primers, the highest genetic variation was between the common brown strain and the others (0. 33 - 0. 83) ...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis deals with the chemistry of cobalt and its compounds particularly the organic cobalt compounds. The main division {{of the work is}} into two sections Part A and Part B. This division has been made because while both sections discuss work relating to the organo-cobalt compounds there is a very definite difference in the nature of work discussed in the two sections {{as well as in the}} type of approach used and the results obtained. In Part A the problem is concerned with the cobalt complex of 1 -nitroso 2 -naphthol. This problem is of course closely related with metallurgical practice in the production. of zinc by electrolytic methods. The removal of cobalt from electrolyte solutions is essential if satisfactory deposition of the zinc is to occur. This removal of cobalt is usually carried out in acid solution by precipitation with 1 -nitroso 2 -naphthol. A <b>red</b> <b>cobalt</b> complex forms and this is filtered off. The filtrate containing the zinc can then be satisfactorily electrolysed. By igniting the <b>red</b> <b>cobalt</b> precipitate the organic material is removed and a residue of cobalt oxide obtained. This cobalt oxide is a valuable material and finds many applications commercial. The process for obtaining this cobalt oxide has many dis-advantages the most important being the loss of the organic material in the igniting process. This problem was thus considered and some progress made towards its solution. It will be much better appreciated later how the emphasis in this work has been placed more on the immediate commercial requirements than the more fundamental aspects of the problem. In Part B work dealing with efforts to prepare organo- cobalt compounds is considered. This work has been done in order to obtain a better idea of the fundamentals of cobalt chemistry, such as valence, electron distribution in various cobalt compounds etc., and with the hope too that any knowledge so gained might be in further research into the properties of the cobalt complex of 1 -nitroso 2 -naphthol. In this section a series of new compounds are described of the organo-cobalt type and a description of these compounds and some of their reactions is also included. It should be realised too that these studies have a value of their own in so far as cobalt and its various compounds are playing an ever increasing part in such fields as pharmacology, medicine, agriculture etc., and so any knowledge gained of an essentially basic and fundamental nature may affect in some measure studies in related fields. Attention has been placed in this section of the work on the theory and mechanism of various reactions with a view to obtaining fundamental information...|$|E

5000|$|Van Dyck brown, {{known in}} Europe as Cologne earth or Cassel earth, is another natural earth pigment, {{that was made}} up largely of decayed vegetal matter. It made a rich dark brown, and was widely used during the Renaissance to the 19th century It {{takes its name from}} the painter Anthony van Dyck, but it was used by many other artists before him. It was highly {{unstable}} and unreliable, so its use was abandoned by the 20th century, though the name continues to be used for modern synthetic pigments. The color of Van Dyck brown can be recreated by mixing ivory black with mauve or with Venetian red, or mixing cadmium <b>red</b> with <b>cobalt</b> blue.|$|R
50|$|YAG for {{a period}} was used in jewelry as a diamond and other {{gemstone}} simulant. Colored variants and their doping elements include: green (chromium), blue (<b>cobalt),</b> <b>red</b> (manganese), yellow (titanium), purple (neodymium), pink, and orange. As faceted gems they are valued (as synthetics) for their clarity, durability, high refractive index and dispersion. The critical angle of YAG is 33 degrees. YAG cuts similar to natural garnet, with polishing being performed with alumina or diamond (50,000 or 100,000) on common polishing laps. YAG has low heat sensitivity.|$|R

40|$|Glucose provokes {{an initial}} fall {{followed}} by a secondary rise in 45 Ca efflux from prelabeled pancreatic islets. Prior exposure of the islets to calcium-depleted media does not suppress the secondary rise, provided that the extracellular calcium concentration is normalized 2 min before addition of glucose. Such a treatment significantly reduces insulin release. The secondary rise, as distinct from the initial fall, is inhibited under conditions known to interfere with calcium entry into the beta-cell, e. g. {{in the presence of}} ruthenium <b>red</b> or <b>cobalt.</b> Calcium itself in high concentrations provokes a dramatic increase in 45 Ca efflux. The magnitude of this calcium-induced efflux is enhanced by prior exposure of the islets to calcium-depleted media. Imidazole and the theophylline do not modify the effect of glucose on 45 Ca efflux. It is proposed that the glucose-induced secondary rise in 45 Ca efflux corresponds to a calcium-calcium exchange process in which influent 40 Ca displaces 45 Ca from intracellular sites.

40|$|In haplochromine cichlids, female mate choice {{based on}} male nuptial {{coloration}} has {{played an important}} role in speciation. Recent studies suggest that male coloration strongly influences the distribution of these fishes based on male–male aggression; males direct more aggression towards similarly coloured opponents while tolerating differently coloured individuals. We explored the role of male nuptial colour in aggression among the mbuna of Lake Malawi, examining aggression by male Metriaclima mbenjii, the <b>red</b> top <b>cobalt</b> zebra, towards conspecific opponents, similarly coloured heterospecific opponents and differently coloured heterospecifics. In trials in which focal males were offered a single opponent, while the total number of aggressive behaviours did not vary among opponent species, the types of behaviours did; focal males directed more lateral displays towards conspecifics than towards the other opponent species. When focal males were offered two opponents simultaneously, M. mbenjii directed more aggressive behaviours and more lateral displays towards similarly coloured opponents, regardless of species. Furthermore, when offered a conspecific and a similarly coloured opponent simultaneously, there were no differences in behaviour towards either opponent. Thus, nuptial coloration is used by males to identify competitors, and it suggests that male–male aggression may have also been an important diversifying force in speciation in rock-dwelling Lake Malawi cichlids...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} {{enamelled}} and gilded glass objects, coming from Melfi Castle (PZ - Italy) {{from an area}} dated to the period {{between the end of}} the 12 th and {{the last quarter of the}} 13 th century, offered the opportunity to closely investigate this technology with the aim of understanding the raw materials and the procedures employed to realize the objects and their precious decorations. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to observe and analyze the glass, the enamels, the gildings and their mutual relations. The bulk of the objects resulted a soda-lime glass, while the enamels are lead-based 'soft' enamels or soda-lime glass; the palette of pigments employed to obtain their colours included iron III oxide and minium for <b>red,</b> lazurite and/or <b>cobalt</b> for blue, lead-tin-antimony pyrochlore solid solution oxide (yellow) plus cobalt for green, manganese oxides for black and calcium phosphate for white. Results obtained for gilding, in particular stratigraphy and morphology, suggest the use of the so called 'liquid gold'...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDye sensitizers {{loaded on}} TiO 2 {{decrease}} the electron excitation energy, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance by causing {{an increase in}} sensitivity under visible light irradiation. Three dye sensitizer precursors, Mordant Orange 1, N 3 (<b>red</b> dye) and <b>Cobalt</b> (II) Phthalocyanine Tetrasulfonate (CoPcTs), were utilized to load the photocatalyst. The rate of the electron trapping process on platinum is clearly compatible with the migration rate of boundary electrons. Consequently, the migration of boundary electrons from the conduction band towards electron acceptors is increased by loading platinum onto the titanium dioxide. In this research, TiO 2 was synthesized from a titanium isopropoxide precursor using the sol–gel method, and the product was compared with commercial TiO 2 -P 25 (consisting of 80 % anatase and 20 % rutile phases). Evaluation {{of the effect of}} calcination temperature on the formation of the nanosize photocatalyst and the phase formed was performed through the XRD technique. The specific surface area was determined by BET measurement. Ultimately, the absorption of all samples and their efficiencies were compared using the Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) technique under visible light irradiation...|$|R
