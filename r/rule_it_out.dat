5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer up anything more, but to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> completely.|$|E

25|$|Three {{months after}} the split, Byrne said {{that members of the}} group fought with one another more and more often in the latter years leading up to the split and he felt that it was the right time to end their time together. Some media {{predicted}} a possible reunion in the future, but Westlife put an end to that speculation by vowing they would never reunite. However, on 22 July 2016, four years following the split, Filan told Lorriane that while there are currently no plans for a Westlife reunion, he would not <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for the future.|$|E
25|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in 1939, the {{government}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia declared its neutrality, but most of its neighbours joined the Tripartite Pact by the beginning of 1941. Yugoslavia came under heavy pressure to join the Axis and the Yugoslav government signed the Pact on 25 March 1941. However, demonstrations {{broke out in}} Belgrade against the decision and on 27 March, the government was overthrown in a coup d'état. The new Yugoslav government refused to ratify the signing of the Tripartite Pact, though it did not <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Adolf Hitler reacted by launching the invasion of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, together with Italy and Hungary.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{president}} of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Angel Villar, announced in July 2008 that it was Spain's intention to submit an individual World Cup bid, and that positive contacts had already taken place with the government, through the secretary of sports, Jaime Lissavetzky. No specifications were made then regarding a joint bid with Portugal. On 23 November 2008, after his re-election for the RFEF presidency, Villar pledged that one of the fundamental objectives of his term was to bring a World Cup to Spain. While he did not mention whether Spain would present a joint bid with Portugal, he did not <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> when asked about it.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{diagnosis of}} EVD {{is confirmed by}} isolating the virus, detecting its RNA or proteins, or detecting antibodies against the virus in a person's blood. Isolating the virus by cell culture, detecting the viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detecting proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are methods best used {{in the early stages}} of the disease and also for detecting the virus in human remains. Detecting antibodies against the virus is most reliable in the later stages of the disease and in those who recover. IgM antibodies are detectable two days after symptom onset and IgG antibodies can be detected 6 to 18 days after symptom onset. During an outbreak, isolation of the virus via cell culture methods is often not feasible. In field or mobile hospitals, the most common and sensitive diagnostic methods are real-time PCR and ELISA. In 2014, with new mobile testing facilities deployed in parts of Liberia, test results were obtained 3–5 hours after sample submission. In 2015 a rapid antigen test which gives results in 15 minutes was approved for use by WHO. It is able to confirm Ebola in 92% of those affected and <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in 85% of those not affected.|$|E

5000|$|The canal {{proposal}} {{was presented as}} part of Colin Barnett's unsuccessful 2005 state election campaign. As opposition leader, he <b>ruled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> when campaigning for the 2008 election. In 2012, following Perth's driest July on record, Premier Barnett raised the proposal again, saying that [...] "from a technical or engineering point of view, it's not difficult to do".|$|R
500|$|In a January 2010 {{interview}} while {{promoting his}} biography I Am Ozzy, Osbourne stated {{that although he}} would not <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> he was doubtful {{there would be a}} reunion with all four original members of the band. Osbourne stated: [...] "I'm not gonna say I've written it out forever, but right now I don't think there's any chance. But who knows what the future holds for me? If it's my destiny, fine." [...] In July, Butler said {{that there would be no}} reunion in 2011, as Osbourne was already committed to touring with his solo band. However, by that August they had already met up to rehearse together, and continued to do so through the autumn.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the coup, Simović's new {{government}} refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, but did not openly <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Hitler, angered by the coup and anti-German incidents in Belgrade, gathered his senior officers and ordered that Yugoslavia be crushed without delay. On the same day as the coup he issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state. Italy was {{to be included in the}} operations and the directive made specific mention that [...] "fforts will be made to induce Hungary and Bulgaria to take part in operations by offering them the prospect of regaining Banat and Macedonia". Furthermore, the directive stated that [...] "nternal tensions in Yugoslavia will be encouraged by giving political assurances to the Croats".|$|E
500|$|Regina Ip began a {{campaign}} to abolish the levy, and tabled an amendment at LegCo. The government {{said that it would}} attempt to <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of order {{on the grounds that it}} would breach rule 31(1) of the Rules of Procedures, which prohibit amendments impacting government revenue. Ip compared this stance with a 2005 High Court decision that the Employees' Retraining Levy was not a tax. According to the government, a bill to abolish the levy would breach Article 74 of Hong Kong Basic Law and it would take Article 74 to the central government for interpretation. Legislators and commentators called this proposal a [...] "nuclear bomb", and a University of Hong Kong academic said that reinterpretation would be a [...] "totally disproportionate... route to resolve this dispute." ...|$|E
50|$|All {{relevant}} parties have ruled out, {{to form a}} coalition with the Alternative for Germany. The CDU/CSU and the Free Democratic Party have ruled out a coalition with The Left.

5000|$|Halford's {{reunion with}} Judas Priest had been speculated {{about when he}} was no longer in the line-up, at least since the release of the Resurrection album, which some critics claimed sounded more like Judas Priest than the band's {{previous}} album Jugulator (1997). Halford initially <b>ruled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> then reconsidered stating in 2002 that [...] "Gut instinct tells me that at some point it will happen".|$|R
500|$|As the {{election}} of 1852 approached, Fillmore remained undecided whether to run for a full term as president. Secretary Webster had long coveted the presidency and, though past seventy, planned a final attempt to gain the White House. Fillmore was sympathetic to the ambitions of his longtime friend, but though he issued a letter in late 1851 stating {{that he did not}} seek a full term, was reluctant to <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> fearing the party would be captured by the Sewardites. [...] Thus, approaching the [...] national convention in Baltimore, to be held in June 1852, the major candidates were Fillmore, Webster and General Scott. Weed and Seward backed Scott; in late May, the Democrats nominated former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce, who had been out of national politics for nearly a decade before 1852, but whose profile had risen {{as a result of his}} military service in the Mexican War. The nomination of Pierce, a northerner sympathetic to the southern view on slavery, united the Democrats and meant the Whig candidate would face an uphill battle to gain the presidency.|$|E

50|$|In the Visayas leg of {{the presidential}} debate held in Cebu City hosted by TV5, the {{respective}} campaigns were generally more receptive of {{the conduct of the}} debate. The debate proper though was delayed due to a misunderstanding of the rules: Binay was informed by debate moderator Luchi Cruz-Valdez that bringing of notes was allowed, but the commission <b>ruled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> when the Roxas camp objected to it.|$|R
50|$|Almost half {{a century}} later, lethal {{injection}} was revisited, due {{to a series of}} botched executions and the eventual rise of public disapproval in electrocutions. Nazi Germany developed the Action T4 euthanasia program as one of its methods of disposing of Lebensunwertes Leben ("life unworthy of life"). The British Royal Commission on Capital Punishment (1949-53) also considered lethal injection, but eventually <b>ruled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> after pressure from the British Medical Association (BMA).|$|R
2500|$|Genetic testing {{provides}} the ultimate diagnosis in 95% of cases; genetic counseling is usually needed in families where FAP has been diagnosed. Testing may also {{aid in the}} diagnosis of borderline cases in families that are otherwise known to [...] p34.3 and p32.1 (1p34.3–p32.1). Testing can only show if an individual is susceptible to FAP or <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> (i.e., {{whether or not they}} inherited the defective APC gene).

2500|$|On May 18, Adams {{met with}} Russell {{to protest the}} {{declaration}} of neutrality. [...] Adams argued that Great Britain had recognized a state of belligerency [...] "before they [...] had ever showed their capacity to maintain any kind of warfare whatever, except within {{one of their own}} harbors under every possible advantage [...] it considered them a maritime power before they had ever exhibited a single privateer upon the ocean." [...] The major United States concern at this point was that the recognition of belligerency was the first step towards diplomatic recognition. While Russell indicated that recognition was not currently being considered, he would not <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in the future, although he did agree to notify Adams if the government's position changed.|$|E
2500|$|John Bell in 1986, {{interviewed by}} Paul Davies in [...] "The Ghost in the Atom" [...] has {{suggested}} that an Aether theory might help resolve the EPR paradox by allowing a reference frame in which signals go faster than light. He suggests Lorentz contraction is perfectly coherent, not inconsistent with relativity, and could produce an aether theory perfectly consistent with the Michelson-Morley experiment. Bell suggests the aether was wrongly rejected on purely philosophical grounds: [...] "what is unobservable does not exist" [...] Einstein found the non-aether theory simpler and more elegant, but Bell suggests that doesn't <b>rule</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Besides the arguments based on his interpretation of quantum mechanics, Bell also suggests resurrecting the aether {{because it is a}} useful pedagogical device. That is, many problems are solved more easily by imagining the existence of an aether.|$|E
