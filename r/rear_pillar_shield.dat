25|$|It is {{a version}} of Corvette coupe {{designed}} by Giorgetto and Fabrizio Giugiaro of Italdesign, commemorating 50 years of the Chevrolet Corvette. It included 6.0 litre V8 engine, door window half dome, gull wing door hinged to the <b>rear</b> <b>pillar.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The new 1971 hardtop {{featured}} a prominent [...] "tunnelback" [...] rear window design with flowing <b>rear</b> <b>pillars,</b> a {{completion of the}} styling exercise of the outgoing model. Hardtops with 'Grande' trim gained a vinyl roof and Grande badges on the C-pillars.|$|R
50|$|Also {{introduced}} in 1962 was the Landau model, with a vinyl roof and simulated S-bars on the <b>rear</b> <b>pillars.</b> This {{was the beginning}} of the 1960s/1970s fashion for vinyl roof treatments, and a vinyl roof was a popular Thunderbird feature for the next 20 years.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A wind tunnel based investigation into the effects of unsteady yaw angles on the aerodynamics of a simple automotive body {{has been carried out}} to increase the understanding of the effects of unsteady onset conditions similar to those experienced in normal driving conditions. Detailed flow field measurements have been made using surface pressure tappings and PIV around a simple automotive model in steady state conditions and these have been compared to measurements made whilst the model was oscillating in the yaw plane. The oscillating motion was created by a motored crank which was used to produce consistent and repeated motion which produced a reduced frequency that indicated that a quasi-static response should be expected. The PIV data are used to compare the wake flow structures and the surface pressures are used to infer aerodynamic loads and investigate the development of the flow structures across the surfaces of the model. This includes a comprehensive comparison of the surface pressures {{on the sides of the}} model during a transient and quasi-static yaw angel oscillation. These results show differences between the two test conditions with the oscillating model results containing hysteresis and the greatest differences in the flow field occurring on the leeside of the model. Two configurations of the same model with different <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> geometries were used to isolate model specific effects. Square <b>rear</b> <b>pillars</b> create strong and stable trailing vortices which are less affected by the model motion whereas radiused <b>rear</b> <b>pillars</b> created weaker and less steady vortices that mixed with the quasi- 2 D wake behind the model base and were affected to a greater extent by the model motion. The unsteadiness in the trailing vortex separation feeds upstream into the A-pillar vortex demonstrating that small geometry changes at the rear can affect the entire flow field around the model...|$|R
2500|$|The Murciélago Roadster was {{introduced}} in 2004. Primarily designed to be an open top car, it employed a manually attached soft roof as cover from adverse weather, but a warning on the windshield header advises the driver not to exceed [...] with the top in place. The designer used the B-2 stealth bomber, the Wally 118 WallyPower yacht, and architect Santiago Calatrava's Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències in Valencia, Spain as his inspiration for the roadster's revised <b>rear</b> <b>pillars</b> and engine cover.|$|R

25|$|For 1964 Chevrolet {{made only}} {{evolutionary}} {{changes to the}} Corvette. Besides the coupe's backbone window, the two simulated air intakes were eliminated from the hood, though their indentations remained. Also, the decorative air-exhaust vent on the coupe's <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> was made functional, but only on the left side. The car's rocker-panel trim {{lost some of its}} ribs and gained black paint between those ribs that remained; wheel covers were simplified; and the fuel filler/deck emblem gained concentric circles around its crossed-flags insignia. Inside, the original color-keyed steering wheel rim was now done in simulated walnut.|$|R
50|$|The Sigma XL was the {{entry-level}} {{model of the}} range and came with either the 1.6 or 2.0-litre engines. In the SE, velour seats with lumbar control, adjustable headrests and a fold-down rear seat armrest with boot access were fitted. Reading lights incorporated into the roof-mounted dome light and built into the <b>rear</b> <b>pillars</b> were now a stock feature on the SE model Sigma. Power assisted steering was also an option along with electric windows. The SE model Sigma had stock dual line striping around the car, with chrome bonnet indicators.|$|R
5000|$|Released on 26 July 1970, the HG Monaro was {{the last}} of the {{original}} coupé design concept. HG had cleaner lines with brightwork reduced and some re-designed. The HG sported different striping (delete options) which were known as [...] "sidewinder" [...] stripes which ran along the top edge of the fenders, under the windows and finishing just before the <b>rear</b> <b>pillar.</b> The [...] "Monaro" [...] badge on both <b>rear</b> <b>pillars</b> was introduced to all models. For the HG GTS, the [...] "GTS" [...] badges now featured black paint fill, received new black-out paint on rocker panels, with the GTS 350 getting bold treatment with new [...] "sidewinder" [...] stripes and bonnet scoop black-outs. [...] "GTS 350" [...] designations now featured gutsier decals on the fenders and boot lid. Wheel arch moldings were deleted on all models. The [...] "GTS 350" [...] models no longer had the 350 Chevrolet badge on the fender, but rather a bold decal stating [...] "350" [...] as well as blackouts that covered the air-vents on the bonnet. The GTS badge originally above the gills in the fenders would be removed and would now be black instead of red (with the badges being placed on the passenger side of the grille and boot). The taillights had a cleaner look and the grille was redesigned.|$|R
2500|$|Introduced in October 1977 in Australia, {{the first}} 200Bs were all fully {{imported}} in sedan, station wagon and coupe forms, the latter retaining the SSS badge. In January 1978 local assembly began for the sedan, followed shortly by the wagon. The sedan trim levels were GL and GX. While the coupe remained a hardtop, Datsun added an opera {{window in the}} <b>rear</b> <b>pillar.</b> The coupe was discontinued in Australia in 1979.

25|$|In 1970 the car gained {{rear light}} units from the Citroën Ami 6, and also {{standardised}} a third side {{window in the}} <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> on 2CV6 (602cc) models. From 1970, only two series were produced: the 2CV 4 (AZKB) with 435 cc and the 2CV 6 (Azka) with 602 cc displacement. All 2CVs from this date can run on unleaded fuel. 1970s cars featured rectangular headlights, except the Spécial model. In 1971 the front bench seat was replaced with two individual seats. In 1972 2CVs were fitted with standard three-point seat belts. In 1973 new seat covers, a padded single-spoke steering wheel and ashtrays were introduced.|$|R
5000|$|The landau {{term was}} revived during the 1960s. There was a trend for making [...] "fake convertibles" [...] by {{applying}} vinyl roofs on regular cars. Some of these vehicles were called [...] "landaus" [...] by their manufacturers, {{and many were}} fitted with landau bars on the rear quarters (faux cabriolet). Some used the term [...] "Town Landau" [...] such as {{for one of the}} 1967 models in the Ford Thunderbird line. This generally meant a wider <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> with no <b>rear</b> quarter windows, or a partial vinyl roof that was applied only over the rear seat area (and is thus reminiscent of a town car).|$|R
5000|$|The windshield, very convex, is more {{inclined}} {{than the previous}} [...] "sitting room" [...] and slightly more content, {{in order to improve}} its aerodynamic penetration.

The back window is flat and vertical while a [...] "duck tail" [...] rear spoiler adds character to the back, with its very wide wheels. Lots of louvers and vents aid in cooling the heart of the car, the Bandini 1000 Turbo engine.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the vehicle}} never {{underwent}} a generational facelift {{on the scale}} of the GAZ-21 (if one does not count its derivative successors), nonetheless the car was modernised during production. The early stage included removal of bonnet-mounted rear-view mirrors, new ignition and boot locks. The novel belt-speedometer proved too complicated and was replaced by a standard arrow-driven one, as was the fate of the engine cooling coupling that controlled the ventilator fan (proved unreliable, the ventilator would be permanently on, whilst warm air for cold starts would be manually controlled with venetian-type shutter). Additions included external comfort lights were on the <b>rear</b> <b>pillar's</b> chrome element, that turned on upon opening of rear doors.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were other}} {{changes for the}} Mk II; the front bumper was raised (in common with the Spitfire Mk.3) to conform to new crash regulations, necessitating a revised front end, and side vents {{were added to the}} front wings and <b>rear</b> <b>pillars.</b> Under the bonnet, the engine was uprated to develop [...] with a new {{cylinder}} head, camshaft, and manifolds. Performance improved to 107 mph, but perhaps more noteworthy the 0-60 mph time dropped to 10 seconds. The fuel economy was also improved to 25 mpgimp average. The interior was updated with a new dashboard and better ventilation, a two-speed heater fan and a black headlining. Overdrive remained a popular option for the manual transmission.|$|R

40|$|The {{myocardium}} receives its {{arterial blood}} through two arteries, {{right and left}} coronary artery. Atherosclerosis is a chronic condition characterized by endothelial damage, followed by accumulation of lymphocytes, macrophages and lipoproteins, among others, between the intima and media layer. One of the secondary complications of myocardial infarction is valvular insufficiency as result of necrosis of the pillars. Our goal is to color the heart vessels, dissect the pillars of the first order and analyze blood supply from its base.

A definitive version was subsequently published in Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 125, 2014, DOI: 10. 1016 /j. jweia. 2013. 11. 002 The wake of a fastback type passenger vehicle is characterised by trailing vortices from the <b>rear</b> <b>pillars</b> of the vehicle. These vortices strongly influence all the aerodynamic coefficients. Working at model scale, using two configurations of the Davis model with different <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> radii, (sharp edged and 10 mm radius) the flow fields over the rear half of the models were investigated using balance measurements, flow visualisations, surface pressure and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) measurements. For a small geometry change between the two models, the changes to the aerodynamic loads and wake flow structures were unexpectedly large with significant differences to the strength and location of the trailing vortices in both the time averaged and unsteady results. The square edged model produced a flow field similar to that found on an Ahmed model with a sub-critical backlight angle. The round edged model produced a flow structure dominated by trailing vortices that mix with the wake behind the base of the model and is weaker. This flow structure was more unsteady than that of the square edged model. Consequently, although both models can be described as having a wake dominated by trailing vortices, there are significant differences to both the steady state and unsteady flow fields that have not been described previously. This also shows that the fastback wake structure described by Ahmed is not definitive...|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, {{many changes}} {{were made to the}} Discovery. It reached some markets as the [...] "Discovery 2"; the 200Tdi and 3.5 L V8 engines were {{replaced}} with the 2.5 L 300Tdi 4-cylinder and 3.9-litre Rover V8 engines. The 300Tdi introduced a Bosch electronic emissions control for certain models and markets. At around this time a stronger R380 gearbox was fitted to all manual models. The newer models featured larger headlamps and a second set of rear lights in the bumper. The new rear lights had their wiring configuration changed several times to meet real or expected European safety legislation. Some vehicles were left with an arrangement where the vulnerable bumper contains the only working direction-indicator lights; other examples have these lights duplicated in the traditional <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> location.|$|R

The results show that the blowing technique is associated to an increase of vorticity inside the vortex core on the upper part of the rear window and a decrease of vorticity on the lower part of the window. This vorticity drop is related to the onset of a recirculation zone (negative longitudinal velocities) in the vortex core which characterizes the vortex breakdown. The analysis of the azimuthal and longitudinal velocities allows to identify the increase of the Swirl number up to the critical point of vortex breakdown noted for high blowing velocities...|$|R

The rear end of the original well-known Ahmed body has sharp connections between the roof and the rear window as well as squared <b>rear</b> <b>pillars.</b> Similarly to previous studies, rounding the roof/backlight intersection was shown to reduce drag up to 16 %. Surprisingly, additional rear curvature associated with side pillar rounding did not further modify the drag. However, the zero net effect was found to result from opposite drag effects on the slanted and vertical surfaces and to hide strong local modifications on the flow field. The tridimensional organization and vorticity transport in the near wake were analyzed and connected to the observed local increase in the pressure drag on the base.
