40|$|Great tits (Aves: Passeriformes; Parus major) and <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> (Parus caeruleus) nested {{in boxes}} in Wytham Woods near Oxford. The {{breeding}} densities of both species were {{limited by the}} availability of nest sites. The larger great tits were dominant in obtaining nest boxes. This was most important where breeding sites were scarce. The two species did not maintain interspecific territories or interfere with interspecific nest site spacing beyond the immediate vicinity of the nest. <b>Blue</b> and great <b>tit</b> numbers fluctuated in parallel where nest sites were not limiting resources. Annual changes in breeding numbers of great tits were negatively related to <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> breeding density but great tit density {{did not seem to}} affect changes in the <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> population. Overlap in the feeding sites of <b>blue</b> and great <b>tits</b> was greatest during the summer and interference competition was lowest at this time. The nestling diets of the two species were very similar. Despite an apparent abundance of food for nestlings, adults were pressed to feed large broods. Food for nestlings was probably a limiting and depletable resource. The date of clutch initiation of great <b>tits,</b> but not <b>blue</b> <b>tits,</b> was retarded at high densities of <b>blue</b> or great <b>tits.</b> The clutch sizes of both species were probably negatively affected by high breeding densities of congeners but the results were not clear cut.

40|$|Resource {{partitioning}} is {{a central}} issue in ecology because it can establish to which point similar species can coexist in the same habitat. Great <b>tits</b> and <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> have been classical model species in studies of trophic competence. However, most studies on the topic have been conducted at localities where caterpillars {{are by far the}} most relevant prey brought to the nestlings. In Mediterranean mixed forests, nevertheless, the abundance of caterpillars is relatively low and it is spiders that {{play a key role in}} the diet of great tits, at least for nestlings. The aim of this paper was to study nest food provisioning to establish the degree of diet overlap of these two tit species in a Mediterranean forest. Our results showed that <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> feeding rates were higher than those of great tits, probably to compensate for the smaller prey delivered to nestlings by <b>blue</b> <b>tits.</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>tits</b> brought more spiders than great tits, while grey tits brought larger prey and more caterpillars.

Occupation {{rates and the}} reproductive biology of the <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> in sample woodlots outside the distribution area of the common dormouse were used as a control in sample areas where the two species were syntopic. A selection test showed that the two species, when living in syntopy, actively chose the small nest-boxes, thus overlapping {{in the use of}} the same spatial resource. The experimental exclusion of the common dormouse from nest-boxes caused an increase of <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> occupation rate. Once the effect of nest-box density was removed, complementary density changes between the two species clearly appeared. The population cycle of both species in the areas of syntopy showed a swinging pattern, i. e. in areas or during years of common dormouse high abundance few <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> bred and vice versa. The abundance of the <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> was affected not only by common dormouse abundance, but also by some habitat and climate variables. <b>Blue</b> <b>tits</b> had low breeding success and a high percentage of nest failure (38 % in syntopy vs 3 % in control areas), owing to nest destruction and predation by common dormouse, as well as probably also by other rodents (23 %) and Martes martes (15 %).

To assess whether partial migrants differ from regular migrants in {{their responses to}} weather, we compared the migratory intensity of a partial migrant, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Tit</b> (Cyanistes caeruleus), with more regular migrants in relation to weather at a migratory passage site in southern Sweden (Falsterbo) during the years 1993 - 2002.

40|$|On Corsica <b>Blue</b> <b>Tits</b> Parus caeruleus ogliastrae breed late in {{the spring}} when ambient {{temperatures}} are high as a local adaptation to the late occurrence of their food. This means that <b>Blue</b> <b>Tits</b> rear their young when water demand of nestlings for evaporative cooling is high due to elevated temperatures, but the water content of the diet is low. Thus, the local environment may impose a water Limitation on breeding tits. We therefore expected physiological adjustments in <b>Blue</b> <b>Tit</b> nestlings to a hot climate with a low availability of water, such as a reduced metabolic rate. We measured oxy gen consumption and evaporative water loss of 20 full-grown nestling <b>Blue</b> <b>Tits</b> from Corsica in an open-flow respirometry system.

40|$|The feeding {{behavior}} is favored {{by natural selection}} {{in the past and}} is based on getting a high fitness by maximizing net energy intake. Reproductive success among altricial birds is closely related to feeding strategies because nestlings are totally dependent on being fed by their parents from the day they hatch to the day they fledge. We have studied the patterns of {{feeding behavior}} in great tit parents and their ability to adapt to the current feeding situation by adjusting prey size to nestlings size. This has been an experimental study of parental care by great tits of 10 - 14 days old great <b>tit</b> and <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> nestlings in their natural environment. We recorded the feeding behavior inside 30 nest boxes that were divided into three groups.

We found that the ability to adjust prey size would be an important skill in tits reproduction ecology because large prey increases the swallow time for all the nestlings which in time increases the feeding time for the parent. We assumed that the smaller body size of the <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> nestlings would imply a more constrained capacity to swallow larger prey items so that prey size should have more critical consequences for <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> than for great tit nestlings. However we did not find any indication of this since the <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> nestlings were fed with prey of approximately same size as the great tit nestlings and that the proportion of long swallow times did not increase.

40|$|In {{spite of}} strong {{evidence}} for viability-based sexual selection and sex ratio adjustments, the <b>blue</b> <b>tit,</b> Parus caeruleus, {{is regarded as}} nearly sexually monomorphic and no epigamic signals have been found. The plumage coloration has not, however, been studied in relation to bird vision, which extends to the UV-A waveband (320 to 400 nm). Using molecular sex determination and UV/VIS spectrometry, we report here that <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> are sexually dichromatic in UV/blue spectral purity (chroma) of the brilliant crown patch. It is displayed in courtship by horizontal posturing and erected nape feathers. A previously undescribed sexual dimorphism in crown size (controlling for body size) further supports its role as an epigamic ornament. Against grey-brown leaf litter and bark during pair formation in early spring, but also against green vegetation, UV contributes strongly to conspicuousness and sexual dimorphism. This should be further enhanced by the UV/bluish early morning skylight ('woodland shade') in which <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> display. Among 18 breeding pairs, there was strong assortative mating with respect to UV chroma, but not size, of the crown ornament.

40|$|Variation in {{behavioral}} traits may be genetically or environmentally determined, or both. Previous studies on nest building behaviour in captive birds {{have proposed that}} nest building is mainly genetically determined. However, to settle this question, cross-fostering experiments in the wild has been recommended. The focus {{of the present study}} has been nest building behavior in <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major) studied in a woodland near Oslo in Norway, where respectively, 95 and 79 nests of the two species were observed. Both build nests of mosses, lined with hair and wool. <b>Blue</b> <b>tits</b> also often apply feathers, which are only occasionally used by great tits. Some individuals of both species were interspecifically cross-fostered, i. e. <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> nestlings were raised by great tit parents, and great tit nestlings were raised by <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> parents. This provided the opportunity to study, in a natural environment, whether the interspecific variation in use of nest materials is primarily genetically or environmentally determined (due to learning from conspecifics, i. e. cultural transmission). The results show that, with regard to nest building, cross-fostered <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> and great tits resemble members of their own species and not members of their foster species. This held true even when accounting for possible confounding variables such as laying date of first egg, clutch size, egg volume, and age. This implies that the variation in nest building behavior between these species is largely genetically determined. We suggest that nest building is a conservative trait that has evolved differently in <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> and great tits...|$|R

These species are secondary cavity nesters. We monitored 38 forest plots of variable size over 3 years. We found a total of 39 mixed-species clutches in 1285 nests, representing a prevalence of 3. 0 %, but it reached 7. 2 % in small woodlands. Seventeen mixed-species clutches involved <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> facultative interspecific brood parasitism, with {{the same number of}} great tits usurping and directly laying in <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> clutches. The higher the nest-box occupation rate, the greater the prevalence of mixed-species clutches of any origin. However, the two tit species behaved differently when faced with nest-hole shortage, with <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> dumping one or two eggs into clutches incubated by great tits and these taking over the entire <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> clutch. Nest takeovers were more frequent {{at the end of the}} season. These differences in behaviour are likely mediated by differing dominance status, with great tits being larger. The difference in size could also explain why great tit chicks presented larger hatching and fledging rates than their <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> broodmates.

40|$|Birdsong is a species-specific {{signal that}} is used in mate {{attraction}} and intrasexual competition. This thesis concerns song acquisition in two oscine songbird species, the great tit Parus major and the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. It addresses questions such as how free-living songbirds choose their song tutors and whether learning of foreign songs can take place in adult birds, and it looks into the relationship between song learning and sexual imprinting. This was done using a method of experimental, interspecific cross-fostering, in which eggs were swapped between nests of different species. Great tits were cross-fostered to <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> Cyanistes caeruleus, and pied flycatchers were cross-fostered to great <b>tits</b> and <b>blue</b> <b>tits.</b> In oscine songbirds, young males have to learn their song from adult conspecifics, and a mechanism is needed {{to ensure that they}} choose song tutors of the right species. Early laboratory studies proposed the existence of an innate auditory template facilitating the recognition and memorization of conspecific song. However, in a number of species, males reared by heterospecifics have been found to copy songs of the foster species and thereby become mixed singers. To account for such heterospecific song learning, {{it has been suggested that}} familiarization with the social father before independence guides the choice of song tutors. However, under natural conditions, young males may grow up without a social father. A study on captive zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata has demonstrated effects of the social mother on song learning. Based on this finding, I propose a mechanism of mothermediated tutor choice, suggesting that experience with the social mother as well as the father guides the choice of song tutor in oscine songbirds. Great <b>tits</b> cross-fostered to <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> include <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> song in their repertoires. They also get sexually misimprinted, and occasional heterospecific pairs are formed between cross-fostered great <b>tits</b> and cross-fostered <b>blue</b> <b>tits.</b> I tested the hypothesis of mother-mediated tutor choice by letting great tits grow up with a <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> foster mother and a great tit foster father. Males of this treatment included <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> song in their repertoires. To control for the possibility that the males had learned the <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> song directly from their cross-fostered fathers, we also recorded song from great tit males that were reared by conspecifics, but whose fathers had been cross-fostered to <b>blue</b> <b>tits.</b> None of these males sang <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> song, suggesting an effect of the social mother. However, cross-fostered great tit males mated to <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> may sing more <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> song than those mated to great tits. Our samples were too small to separate between heterospecific song learning resulting from mother-mediated tutor choice and from exposure to <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> song in the repertoire of the father. Song learning shares a number of characteristics with sexual imprinting. I investigated the relationship between these two processes in great tits. I exposed cross-fostered great tit males to playback of great <b>tit</b> song and <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> song inside their territory. Males that showed sexual interest in <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> females were more likely to respond with <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> song to playback than males that showed interest only in conspecific females. This suggests that different degrees of misimprinting may have parallel effects on song learning and sexual preferences in cross-fostered great tit males. Furthermore, the response to territorial intruders seemed to be affected by social interactions: Cross-fostered males currently associated with <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> increased their response to playback of <b>blue</b> <b>tit</b> song whereas males currently associated with great tits increased their response to playback of great tit song through the season. I also studied the effect of social rearing condition on song learning in pied flycatchers. Cross-fostered pied flycatchers do not seem to get sexually misimprinted. However, I found that pied flycatcher males reared by <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> or great tits became mixed singers, uttering a combination of pied flycatcher song and the foster species’ song. Furthermore, males reared with nest mates of the foster species included tit song in a higher proportion of strophes than did cross-fostered males reared with conspecific nest mates. Hence, in pied flycatchers, growing up with heterospecific foster parents and nest mates caused a mixed choice of song tutors without affecting their mate preferences. Some songbird species are open-ended learners and retain the ability to learn new songs throughout their lives. However, to demonstrate that a species is a true open-ended learner, it is necessary to make sure that the elements learned as adults have not been heard and possibly memorized by the birds at an early age. I performed a playback experiment to test whether the pied flycatcher is a true open-ended learner. I exposed pied flycatcher males to playback of song containing syllables that were unknown to the study area. Among the 20 subjects, one yearling and two older males had learned a foreign syllable type, supporting the hypothesis that pied flycatchers are true open-ended learners. Pied flycatcher song is believed to serve mostly for mate attraction, and possible functions of adult song learning are to increase the repertoire size and to increase syllable sharing with neighbours. The subjects showed no increase in either of these parameters after the treatment. An alternative adaptive value of adult song learning in pied flycatchers may rather be to pick up particularly attractive song elements...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{research}} on the foraging ecology and breeding biology of <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits(Parus major) has mainly concentrated on populations in woodland. However increasing urbanisation means much of the suitable tit habitat is represented by fragmented areas, not large woodlands, and {{little is known about}} factors that may affect reproductive success in urban environments. Using General and Generalised Linear Models this study compared reproductive performance in four habitat types with differing levels of habitat modification: the Cambridge University Botanic Garden (CUBG) with an abundance of non-native vegetation and structural fragmentation, two marginal sites with native scrubby vegetation and structural fragmentation and small fragments and large fragments of native woodland. Compositional analysis was used in a study focused on how foraging <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> used the heterogeneous habitat of the CUBG. Additionally frequency tests were used to compare foraging preferences and foraging behaviours of both species in the CUBG. Productivity was poor in the CUBG compared to all of the other habitats, with great tits appearing to do worse than <b>blue</b> <b>tits,</b> rearing lower quality chicks (significantly lower mean mass than in other habitats). Within the CUBG, positive relationships were found between the abundance of native trees and shrubs and breeding success for both <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> and great tits. A positive relationship was found between breeding success in <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> and the abundance of Quercus and Betula. However, habitat and year interactions showed that habitat and reproductive relationships were complicated by annual variation. The two species differed in their foraging preferences in the CUBG; <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> were observed feeding in native deciduous trees significantly more than in non-native species and had a preference for birch trees over other taxa. Great tits however showed no strong preferences for any of the habitat types. With regards to foraging behaviours, great tits used a wider range of foraging heights and different foraging locations and capture techniques than <b>blue</b> <b>tits.</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>tits</b> were observed‘hanging’ from twigs more frequently, and appeared to be more effective at foraging in the wider variety of plants available in the heterogeneous vegetation of the garden. The data presented in this thesis suggest that <b>blue</b> <b>tits</b> have adopted a better foraging strategy by preferentially choosing native deciduous trees over the abundance of non-natives available in the CUBG. However, despite the apparent better foraging strategy of <b>blue</b> <b>tits,</b> reproductive performance of both species is poor in this urban garden compared to marginal sites and woodland. Urbanisation and the associated loss of optimal tit habitat are likely to continue. It is therefore important to offset urbanisation by the addition of appropriate foraging habitats that are likely to improve reproductive success, such as native trees and shrubs...|$|R
