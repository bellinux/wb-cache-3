40|$|Abstract: Full face rock {{tunnel boring}} machine {{is one of the}} main {{machineries}} and equipments for underground engineering, and the failure of its <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> is the main failure form of this machinery. In order to find out the factors of wear of <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> and improve the rock breaking efficiency, a lot of research has been done. In this paper, the methods of theoretical research, simulation analysis and engineering application are used. The laws of wear of <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> on the cutter head are researched at the process of cutting migmatitic gneiss, and its influence factors are analyzed. The results show that the wear on the edge of <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> is serious. The main factor for the wear of <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> is its stress from the rocks, and its variance is continual. And wear rate of the <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> is proportional to the integrality index of the rocks. With the increase of the amount of wear, the area of contact between a <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> and the rock gets bigger, and their extrusion strength gets lower on the contrary. These results are very helpful to the structure optimization of the <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> and the improvement of working efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Objective: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> spacing on rock fragmentation efficiency and optimize cutter layout and improve the efficiency of <b>disc</b> <b>cutter.</b> Method: ANSYS, a finite element software was used to simulate double <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> cutting process. Result: Find a good corresponding relationship between penetration and cutter spacing. At the process of sandstone, if <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> spacing as 54 ~ 55 mm, rock crushing as the largest and rock fragmentation efficiency is the highest; with the penetration of 10 mm. If <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> spacing as 66 ~ 68. 5 mm, rock crushing as the largest and rock fragmentation efficiency is the highest with the penetration of 15 mm. Changing the cutter spacing and penetration, rock stress and broken degree will also change. Conclusion: Double <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> change {{within the range of}} best cutter spacing, cutter spacing is proportional to the rock crushing. If the cutter distance is greater than the best cutter spacing, the ledge will be appeared. For one type of rocks, the penetration would have some effects on the optimal cutter spacing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rolling <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> are the {{business}} end of hard rock and mixed face tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Since their first successful employment on a TBM over fifty years ago, <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> technology has constantly evolved, allowing modern TBMs to excavate very hard and abrasive rock efficiently. <b>Disc</b> <b>cutters</b> have also been employed successfully on earth pressure balance (EPB) and slurry machines, cutting rock under water and ground pressure. The range of materials excavated by machines today is broader, excavation rates higher and cutter costs lower than ever before, proving the value of investment in cutter development. This paper describes recent improvements in <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> components including cutter ring materials and processing, as well as improvements in lubricants, bearings, seals and cutter condition monitoring. These developments have resulted in more reliable cutters capable of operating {{in a wide range of}} geological condi-tions. Ultimately these improvements result in a better value for both contractors and project owners...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to develop a {{calculation}} module {{for use in the}} simulation software Adams. The calculation module is based on equations found in the literature. A <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> is the tool in contact with the mount for example in tunnel boring machines. A <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> is a circular disc, made of high strength steel. A literary study was made where equations determining the forces acting on the <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> were found. The equations used in the module are based on the <b>disc</b> <b>cutter’s</b> penetration into the rock, the spacing between two cuts and the rock properties, such as the compressive and Brazilian tensile strength. The simulation module was made and used in the simulation software Adams where the forces and moments acting on the <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> while cutting rock can be simulated. The advantage of the simulation model is that it is built {{in such a way that}} many <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> can be linked together and the forces from each of them can work together. A test was made on the simulation model and compared to a real test from the literature, made in a Linear Cutting Machine, and the theoretical calculated force from the model for the given rock penetration and spacing between the two cuts. The simulation model showed a clear correlation to the theoretical calculated normal force, the normal force from the LCM test was higher. The rolling force from the theoretical model correlated well to the rolling force from the LCM test while the simulation generated a higher rolling force.

40|$|Tunnel boring {{machines}} (TBM) utilize <b>cutter</b> <b>discs</b> {{as a primary}} tool for cutting through hard rock. The discs are mounted on a rotating, circular cutter head which is pressed against the rock. A microscopical examination of worn <b>cutter</b> <b>discs</b> has been carried out. The goal was to map fracture mechanisms on TBM cutters with different reason of change, position on the cutter head and rock mass involved. Testing was performed on samples from a full scale TBM and from a novel test method for cutter wear assessments on hard rock tunnel boring recently developed by NTNU. This method is called the Rolling Indentation Abrasion Test (RIAT). The mode of contact for TBM cutters {{was found to be}} rolling, while RIAT mini-cutters cutters also experienced a minor sliding component. Abrasive wear was dominant in both sample types. An increase in fatigue wear was seen in TBM cutters as rock abrasivity decreased. This was credited longer cutter life and larger fluctuation in load. The presence of nanocrystalline deformation layers of comparable thickness in both sample types indicate similar deformation in the two processes. A furnace test on undeformed TBM cutter material was performed to correlate temperature and holding time with the sample hardness profiles. Comparison of hardness measurements and tempering results indicate a surface temperature in excess of 620 C in three TBM cutters. This temperature is given a holding time of one hour. The temperature gradient was seen to correlate with depth of deformation in the material. A high deformation rate is believed to account for steep hardness gradients found. No estimate for surface temperature was found for the RIAT mini-cutters...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{estimate}} the TBM <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> performance on Hwandeung Granite, one of the representative rock types in Korea by the Linear Cutting Machine. In the Linear Cutting test, the digital photogrammetric technique was newly adopted to measure three-dimensional cutting volumes and to apply them to the derivation of design parameters of TBM cutterhead. In this study, a series of linear cutting tests by a TBM <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> with the diameter of 17 inches were carried out by varying cutter spacing as well as cutter penetration conditions. From the tests, the optimum ratio of cutter spacing and penetration depth was derived for Hwandeung Granite. However, experimental results showed that three-dimensional cutting volumes measured by the photogrammetrical technique were not very close to those that were simply calculated from mechanical set-up values of each linear cutting test. Considering that the cutting procedure of a TBM <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> is not one-dimensional but three-dimensional failure mechanism, the use of three-dimensional cutting volumes as a performance parameter of a TBM <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> is indispensable to design a more accurate and reliable TBM cutterhead. 1...|$|R
40|$|The project {{continued}} in this reporting period with focus on three issues: (1) failure {{analysis of the}} FM inserts tested in the field, (2) continued study of confinement burn-out, and (3) <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> manufacturing. The failure analysis concludes that the main reason causing early failure of FM inserts is its low hardness, or in the other words, the FM inserts contained too much cobalt.

CABE milling cutters are widely used in three-axis numerical control (NC) machines for producing dies and moulds of complicated surface features. Evaluation of the contour quality of the CABE milling cutter is crucial in enhancing machining accuracy and eciency. In order adequately to describe {{the shape of the}} clamped cutter, the centre-line axis of the minimum circumscribed cylinder of the cylinder shank is taken as the referenced datum axis. The minimum circumscribed concave-arc revolving surface and the minimum circumscribed spherical surface are carefully derived in sequence. The pro®le errors and tolerances are estimated.

40|$|Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) {{are used}} to bore tunnels, a {{specific}} area of interest for TBMs is their cutter heads, which is a massive steel structure with hardened steel <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> attached. The <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> can encounter all types of geology (i. e. from soft clays, slits, sands etc., to soft rock and extremely hard rock) and environments (i. e. dry, wet, seawater or chemical additives). These geologies and environments cause the <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> to be continuously exposed to degradation in form of wear/abrasion, corrosion and fatigue, being abrasion the dominant mechanism. Replacing the <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> is a considerable part of the total tunnelling costs. Therefore, {{a better understanding of}} the degradation mechanisms occurring during tunnel boring in different geology and environments can contribute to reducing the <b>disc</b> <b>cutter</b> wear and consequently, reducing the tunnelling costs by enlarging their lifetimes. In this project, the tribological performance of steels used in the <b>disc</b> <b>cutters</b> of Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) has been assessed using different tests and environments close to the TBM working conditions in order to find the best way of predicting on-site wear mechanisms. Rock and soil tunnelling processes have been assessed. Rock/soil and water samples were obtained from field (i. e. active tunnel boring projects) in order to reproduce more realistic results. Three different tribological tests, reciprocal ball-on-plate, rubber wheel and hyperbaric soil ground abrasion tests have been used in this work. The reciprocal tests were done by rubbing steel balls onto the rock obtained from tunnel boring sites. The tests were performed in dry conditions, water (from the same site), and a mixture of water and conditioning additives designed for use in hard rock tunnel boring. After the tests no measurable weight loss was observed on the steel balls, however the liquid environment and the conditioning additives changed the wear mechanism on the steel surface as compared to the dry conditions. The water and additives also provided some lubrication, being the additives the best lubricant. The rubber wheel tests were performed in different combinations of water, sand and conditioning additives. The tests showed that adding the additives to the sand and water mixture significantly reduced the weight loss however some additives caused pitting. The hyperbaric soil ground abrasion tests were performed in dry and wet conditions and showed similar weight loss. However, SEM pictures revealed that in the test with sand saturated in water, both abrasion and corrosion occurred. While in the dry test, only abrasion occurred. This indicates that in this test the hardness of the steel and abrasiveness of the sand is more decisive for the weight loss than the corrosivity of the solution...|$|R
