25|$|In 1951, Rawalpindi saw the {{assassination}} of the first elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan in Company Bagh, now known as Liaquat Bagh Park (also called Liaquat Garden.) On 27 December 2007, Liaquat Bagh Park's <b>rear</b> <b>gate</b> in Rawalpindi was the site of {{the assassination}} of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Her father, former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged in Rawalpindi in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Planning their {{invasion}} of Yunkai, Daario tells Daenerys and her knights about a <b>rear</b> <b>gate</b> to the city, {{through which they}} can sneak in and open the main gate for her army. Ser Jorah is suspicious of Daario and his plan, but comes around when Daenerys seeks Grey Worm's opinion. When night falls, Daario, Jorah, and Grey Worm arrive at the gate. Daario enters ahead of them, posing as a still loyal Second Son commander. Shortly after being let inside the city, he signals Jorah and Grey Worm to follow him. Soon, they are ambushed {{by a group of}} Yunkai's slave soldiers, and though largely outnumbered, manage to kill them and accomplish the mission. The group returns to Daenerys, and tells her that she is now in control of the city.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting new Kei car rules, in July 1976 {{the length}} of the Hatch was {{extended}} to 3190mm (wheelbase to 2100mm), all ahead of the firewall. The new front and new large bumpers made what was an already odd-looking car even stranger. Now the Suzuki Fronte Hatch 55 (or 550), it received the three-cylinder 539cc LJ50 engine, which was a de-smogged L50 engine with an extra cylinder tacked on: it was also known as the T5A/T5B in other applications. The new model code was SH10. The inside remained nearly unchanged and the only differences at the rear was a new, larger bumper, and the change to a single strut for the <b>rear</b> <b>gate</b> for increased access. Power remained 25PS as per late 360 Hatches, but torque was up considerably. The lineup was again restricted to B, D, and T models, with the T receiving chromed rather than painted bumpers.|$|E
500|$|The {{primary access}} to the complex was from a tree-lined drive from Princess Street (now known as [...] "Main Drive") {{culminating}} in an elliptical carriageway {{in front of the}} main building.

25|$|Chevrolet's {{design for}} the year fared better than its other GM offerings, and lacked the overabundance of chrome found on Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs. Complementing Chevrolet's front design was a broad grille and quad {{headlights}} that helped simulate a 'Baby Cadillac'; the tail received a fan-shaped alcove on both side panels, which housed dual tail lights. Despite being a recession year, consumers made Chevrolet the No. 1 make of automobile (beating Ford, which held the title in 1957) and the Bel Air was {{at the core of}} Chevrolet's popularity. With its wide variety of body styles and models, Bel Airs could be optioned with almost every conceivable luxury within the Chevrolet line. The Nomad station wagon name also reappeared in 1958 when the vehicle bowed as the premium four-door Chevrolet station wagon, lacking the unique styling of the 1955-57 Nomads. Most Chevrolet station wagon models had two tail lights (one {{on each side of the}} body) housed in abbreviated alcoves, which were made smaller to accommodate the <b>rear</b> <b>gate.</b> A new dash was used.|$|E

2500|$|The castle {{itself was}} {{described}} as having a long causeway which wound up to the great gate of the fortress itself. [...] Inside the keep there were stables and an armoury, {{as well as a}} great hall in the rear which was dug out of the mountainside. [...] There also was a great tower (the Hornburg) the top of which consisted of the great horn of Helm Hammerhand. [...] The Deep, which {{was described as}} standing next to the fortress, was barred by the long Deeping Wall, which was described as consisting of solid rock except for a small culvert which allowed water from the Deeping Stream to enter; this rendered a fresh supply in sieges of great length. The Deeping Wall itself is described as standing 20 feet tall; and also being wide enough for four men to stand side by side. Access to the fortress from within the Deep was made possible by a long stair which led to the Hornburg's <b>rear</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{excavated}} in 1969 and 1980. The 1969 excavations revealed the turf rampart, and an entrance {{at the rear}} rampart. There were traces of floor timbers and many nails indicating internal buildings of wood. The 1980 excavations revealed the fortlet's front and <b>rear</b> <b>gates</b> and an oven. The fortlet underwent three phases of occupation during the second century; {{at the end of}} which it was abandoned. There is evidence that it was in use during the fourth century possibly as a watch post.|$|R
50|$|The third {{generation}} Cavalier had two facelifts: a minor one in 2000 {{and a major}} one in 2003. 2003's refresh included a new front end and a different <b>rear</b> lift <b>gate</b> design.|$|R
5000|$|In 1837 Nicholas I of Russia {{identified}} former Izmaylovo Court as {{the site}} of future almshouse for the veterans of Napoleonic Wars and assigned Konstantin Thon to manage the rehabilitation project. Thon initially planned to retain and repair the buildings of the old Court perimeter and add two-story residential wings to the cathedral. However, the plans changed and the perimeter buildings were demolished, with the exception of front and <b>rear</b> <b>gates</b> and church of Saint Joasaph. Instead, Thon rebuilt parts of the perimeter with single-story [...] "historical style" [...] buildings; parts were simply replaced with a fence.|$|R
2500|$|Much of the 124's {{engineering}} {{and many of}} its features were advanced automotive technology at its introduction, incorporating innovations that have been adopted throughout the industry. It had one of the lowest coefficient of drag (Cd) of any vehicle of the time (0.28 for the 200/200D model for the European market with 185/65 R15 tires) due to its aerodynamic body, that included plastic molding for the undercarriage to streamline airflow beneath the car, reducing fuel consumption and wind noise. It had a single windscreen wiper that had an eccentric mechanism at its base that extended the wiper's reach to the top corners of the windscreen (more than if it had traveled in a simple arc). The saloon/sedan, coupés and convertibles had optional rear headrests that would fold down remotely to improve rearward visibility when required. This feature was not available for the T-model because of its specific layout (no space to store the retractable headrests), but the estate serially came with a [...] "neighbour-friendly" [...] rear door that was pulled in the shut-position silently and automatically by a sensor-controlled servomotor. This allowed the use of a tighter fitting <b>rear</b> <b>gate,</b> minimizing the cabin noise in the T-model - sometimes an area of concern for station wagons.|$|E
60|$|Meantime Kenneth {{had reached}} the stable, thrown a bridle {{over the head of}} a fine sorrel mare, and scorning to use a saddle leaped upon her back and dashed down the lane and out at the <b>rear</b> <b>gate</b> upon the old turnpike road.|$|E

5000|$|Many TCRT streetcars were {{converted}} to one-man/two-man operation in the 1930s by adding double-stream folding front doors and replacing the <b>rear</b> <b>gates</b> with similar doors. This gave TCRT the option to operate the car with only a motorman ("one man" [...] operation), or, on busier routes, with a conductor and a motorman ("two man" [...] operation). Because streetcar ridership remained high on many routes {{until the end of}} service in 1954, many [...] "gate cars" [...] with single-stream front folding doors remained in service until the end. TCRT No. 1239 returned to service in September 2004.|$|R

25|$|The Ilmatars {{original}} {{interior layout}} was {{a compromise between}} the traditional two-class passenger liner and the new ro-ro car/passenger ferry. In order to transport cars she was fitted with a gate on the port side, from where cars were driven inside the ship and then lifted mechanically to the actual car deck. This arrangement was already out of date when the ship was delivered, as Finland SS Co.'s subsidiary Siljavarustamo had taken the delivery of the first ro-ro ferry with bow and <b>rear</b> <b>gates</b> on the North Baltic already in 1961. An extra cardeck was added on the ship coinciding with the 1973 lengthening, but that too was served by the side gate and a lift.|$|R
6000|$|But the Honorable Erastus had no {{intention}} of [...] "taking chances," [...] or [...] "monkeying with fate," [...] as he tersely expressed it. Every scheme known to politicians must be worked, and none knew the intricate game better than Hopkins. This was why he held several long conferences with his friend Marshall, the manager at the mill. And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy. Mr. Hopkins had picked her up from the path leading from the <b>rear</b> <b>gate</b> of the Elmhurst grounds, and she had given him accurate information concerning the movements of the girl campaigners. The description she gave of the coming reception to the Woman's Political League was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them, and thus Mr. Hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were.|$|E

25|$|In 310, Maximian {{rebelled against}} Constantine while the emperor was on {{campaign}} against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with part of Constantine's army to defend against attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. In Arles, Maximian announced that Constantine was dead and took up the imperial purple. Despite offering bribes to any who would support him as emperor, most of Constantine's army remained loyal, and Maximian was compelled to leave. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his {{campaign against the}} Franks, and moved quickly to southern Gaul, where he confronted the fleeing Maximian at Massilia (Marseille). The town was better able to withstand a longer siege than Arles, but it made little difference as loyal citizens opened the <b>rear</b> <b>gates</b> to Constantine. Maximian was captured, reproved for his crimes, and stripped of his title for the third and last time. Constantine granted Maximian some clemency but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310, Maximian hanged himself.|$|R

5|$|The {{entrance}} {{road was}} constructed from Military Road to the fort's <b>rear</b> <b>gates.</b> Its path is largely {{followed by the}} modern Queen Elizabeth II walk, though the former road was slightly to the south. This walk links the conservation park's visitor centre to the fort gates; {{some of the old}} road can still be seen close to the gates. What was the muster ground is partly taken up by the caravan and camping park and a car park. It was levelled and filled in the 1950s for this use. What remains of this ground, north of the caravan park, was returned to its 1880s profile in 1993 funded by a Federal Government grant. In the 19th century, the muster ground was used for training of the Volunteer Military Force including artillery, who camped on the site. As designed the fort's rear was protected with a wooden palisade or stockade. In 1881 a masonry wall was added, greatly strengthening defence. Most of the stockade was reconstructed in the 1970s; some of the original wooden structure is visible in the fort's north.|$|R
