40|$|In {{almost all}} {{domestic}} refrigerators-freezers all components are {{assembled in the}} same relative position since several years ago. It is also known that the condenser releases heat at high temperatures (first law of thermodynamics) {{as well as the}} compressor. This heat is rejected to the environment in almost all practical situations partially by natural air convection. However, part of it is due to thermal radiation that causes an overheating of the refrigerator-freezer surfaces adjacent to those equipments. As a consequence there are more heat gains to the refrigerator-freezer through these surfaces and hence higher air temperatures inside. This paper describes how a simple technique can be very useful in order to minimize that part of heat transfer by radiation. The improvement is achieved by placing a <b>radiation</b> <b>shield</b> - a <b>sheet</b> of aluminium foil - over the surfaces close to the condenser and the compressor. For validating this technique a refrigerator-freezer was monitored with thermocouples for the measurements of the inside air temperatures in two situations: with and without the <b>radiation</b> <b>shield.</b> Results show that with this practice the average inside air temperatures in the refrigerator-freezer could decrease to about 2 K. An available commercial code was used in order to simulate the air temperature distribution and air velocities inside the refrigerator cabinet in both situations. Results from the experimental apparatus and from simulations show that there is a good agreement between them which validates the experiments carried out. Also an available commercial code, the Fluent, was used to simulate the internal air temperature in both situations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: High hydrogen-content {{aliphatic}} polymers {{have been}} identified as good for shielding against galactic cosmic radiation. However, their utility in structural elements is limited to modest temperatures where desirable mechanical properties are maintained. On the other hand, aromatic polymers generally have a broader range of operating temperatures but are less effective as <b>radiation</b> <b>shields.</b> The <b>radiation</b> <b>shielding</b> properties of aromatic polymers is enhanced by the incorporation of hydrogen-rich aliphatic groups appended to aromatic units in the macromolecular structure. It is envisioned that functionally graded polymer structures using aliphatic/aromatic hybrids can be used to meet the requirements of the service environment with beneficial <b>radiation</b> <b>shielding</b> properties in future space structural applications.

In this work a simplifying approach for calculating the radiant energy is achieved using the concept of net radiation transfer and provides an easy way for solving a variety of situations. To be more precise, the objective {{of this paper is to}} calculate the net radiation heat transfer between two concentric spheres with and without <b>radiation</b> <b>shield</b> between them. Moreover, using this method the percentage reduction in heat transfer between two surfaces was calculated and therefore optimization was done. It is concluded that when two <b>radiation</b> <b>shields</b> with different materials have been applied to reduce heat transfer, the shield with lower emissivity should be closer to the surface with higher temperature to increase reduction in heat transfer.

This shielding material could be grown onboard and applied as needed prior to different radiation landscapes (commonly seen during missions involving gravitational assists). The material is a bioplastic material. Bioplastics are any combination of a biopolymer and a plasticizer. In this case, the biopolymer is a starch-based material and a commonly accessible plasticizer. Starch molecules are composed of two major polymers: amylase and amylopectin. The biopolymer phenolic compounds are common to the ablative thermal protection system family of materials. With similar constituents come similar chemical ablation processes, {{with the potential to}} have comparable, if not better, ablation characteristics. It can also be used as a flame-resistant barrier for commercial applications in buildings, homes, cars, and heater firewall material. The biopolymer is observed to undergo chemical transformations (oxidative and structural degradation) at radiation doses that are 1, 000 times the maximum dose of an unmanned mission (10 - 25 Mrad), indicating {{that it would be a}} viable candidate for robust <b>radiation</b> <b>shielding.</b> As a comparison, the total integrated radiation dose for a three-year manned mission to Mars is 0. 1 krad, far below the radiation limit at which starch molecules degrade.
