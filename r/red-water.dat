I doubt whether you could beg, borrow or steal a team of oxen this side of Pretoria, except {{from some of the}} Dutchmen who won't part." ...|$|E

If the cattle had <b>red-water</b> and would bring disease into your herd, or wild bulls that would gore you, and the wives were skinny old widows with evil tongues, then I {{think you would}} look as do those men, Hans." ...|$|E

[...] "Indeed, I thought I remembered your telling me in Africa that the only big game you had ever shot was an ox sick with the <b>red-water.</b> Anyway, {{shooting}} is a business with me, not an amusement, as it is to you, and I do not talk shop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Narrative of an Expedition to Explore the River Zaire" [...] (London, John Murray, 1818), {{published}} {{by permission of}} the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, was necessarily a posthumous work. The Introduction of eighty-two pages and the General Observations (fifty-three pages) are by anonymous hands; follow Captain Tuckey's Narrative, Professor Smith's Journal, and an Appendix with seven items; 1, vocabularies of the Malemba and Embomma (Fiote or Congo) languages; 2, 3, and 4, Zoology; 5, Botany; 6, Geology; and 7, Hydrography. The most valuable is No. 5, an admirable paper entitled [...] "Observations, Systematical and Geographical, on Professor Christian Smith's Collection of Plants from the Vicinity of the River Congo, by Robert Brown, F.R.S." [...] The [...] "Geology," [...] by Mr. Charles Konig, of the British Museum, is based upon very scanty materials. The folio must not be severely criticized; had the writers lived, they might have worked up their unfinished logs into interesting and instructive matter. But evidently they had not prepared themselves for the work; no one knew the periods of rain at the equator; there was no linguist to avoid mistakes in the vocabulary; moreover, Professor Smith's notes, being kept in small and ill-formed Danish characters, caused such misprints as [...] "poppies" [...] for papaws. Some few of the mistakes should be noticed for the benefit of students. The expedition appears to have confused São Salvador, the capital, with St. Antonio placed seven days from the river mouth (p. 277). It calls Santo Antão (Cape Verds) [...] "San Antonio;" [...] the Ilha das Rôlas (of turtle doves) Rolle's Island; [...] "morfil" [...] bristles of the elephant's tail, and manafili ivory, both being from the Portuguese marfim; moudela for mondele or mondelle, a white man; malava, [...] "presents," [...] for mulavu (s. s. as msámbá, not maluvi, Douville), palm wine, which in the form mulavu m'putu (Portuguese) applies to wine and spirits. We have also [...] "Leimba" [...] for Lyámba or Dyámba (Cannabis saliva); [...] "Macasso, a nut chewed by great people only," [...] for Makazo, the bean of the Kola (Sterculia); [...] "Hyphæa" [...] and [...] "Dom" [...] for Palmyra Flabelliformis, whose [...] "fruit hangs down in bunched clusters;" [...] "Raphia" [...] for Raphia Vinifera, commonly called the bamboo or wine palm, and [...] "casa," [...] a purgative legumen, for nkasa, [...] "sass," [...] or poison wood, identified with the <b>red-water</b> tree of Sierra Leone, the erythropheum of Professor Afzelius, of the order Cæalpineae, which gave a name to the Brazil.|$|E
5000|$|New {{flood records}} were {{set on the}} Fitzroy in 1914 when the manager at Yeeda {{reported}} that [...] "the Fitzroy River already in flood, was augmented by a farther large body of water, causing the highest previous flood marks to be exceeded". Large numbers of stock were washed away and near the homestead the water was 6 mi wide for a length of over 20 mi. Yeeda had recorded 15 in of rain over the previous week with other nearby stations recording even more. Cattle ticks first appeared at Yeeda, Kimberley Downs and Obagama in 1916 causing outbreaks of <b>red-water</b> fever in the herds.|$|E

Drought {{followed}} the next year with the station's bores also running dry despite being sunk {{to a depth of}} 400 ft The cattle king, Sidney Kidman, announced in 1907 that he would be purchasing all the male cattle produced on the station for the next three years. Kidman expected a total of between 9,000 and 10,000 head of cattle to be acquired. Stock had to be quarantined in an area of 10 sq mi around Borrodo waterhole in 1918 following an outbreak of <b>red-water</b> amongst cattle that were travelling to Brunette Downs Station.|$|E

40|$|Most {{coloring}} agents used {{in older}} markers, signals and smoke munitions are carcinogenic or suspected carcinogens, {{but are still}} abundant in the military inventory. Confirmation of acceptable alternatives and development of safe disposal methods are thus important. Formulations for new items are chosen to minimize risks. Two successful methods are reported here for combustive destruction of colored smokes and many other military items. See the project reports for additional details and a literature summary on hydrothermal methods used 1, 2 for treatment of propellants, explosives and pyrotechnics (PEP). Reaction temperature, feed rates, and etc., have been established for successful destruction of signal devices and bulk colored filler mixes, by incineration in the APE- 1236 M 1 military kiln. This method has been successful also for bulk explosives and several types of munitions. High pressure hydrothermal oxidation in the supercritical range also gave over 99 % destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) for bulk colored smoke mixes, <b>red-water,</b> common explosives and a nerve agent simulant containing the toxic organic phosphate moiety...|$|E
