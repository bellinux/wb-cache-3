5|$|The second verse has Suzuki in {{the dark}} blue <b>room</b> <b>again.</b> By the pre-chorus, It then uses neon effects to immolate white objects; as a result, Suzuki's {{sunglasses}} and hoodie lights up. The final chorus finishes with transitions of different scenes from the video, including Suzuki in the silver room, standing inside of circles, and inside the dark blue room. The video ends with a close-up of Suzuki {{standing next to a}} large circle, and pans out.|$|E
25|$|The countess {{entered the}} <b>room</b> <b>again</b> to find Elisabeth distraught and weeping uncontrollably. At this point, the Emperor {{appeared}} outside her apartments, {{and was forced}} to wait there with Nopcsa, who was controlling himself only with great effort. The Empress broke the news to her husband in private; he left the room a broken man.|$|E
25|$|Rooms in Wilton House {{appear as}} rooms of Windsor Castle in The Madness of King George (1994). The {{concert with the}} bell-ringers, and two later scenes with the Prince of Wales, were shot in the Double Cube Room. Scenes from Mrs. Brown (1997) were filmed in the Double Cube <b>Room,</b> <b>again</b> portraying the {{interior}} of Windsor Castle.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, Israel {{instructed}} {{its citizens}} to ready their sealed <b>rooms</b> <b>again</b> and to carry gas masks at all times, though it assessed {{the likelihood of}} chemical attack as low.|$|R
60|$|He {{left his}} <b>rooms</b> <b>again</b> about three o'clock, and at {{precisely}} the hour at which Densham had rung the bell of Mrs. Thorpe-Satchell's house in Mayfair he experienced a very great piece of good fortune.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floor}} of Tighnabruaich {{has a number}} of smaller <b>rooms,</b> <b>again</b> opening off the central stair hall and off halls {{radiating}} from this. Some of the upper floor rooms have partially raked ceilings of plasterboard, following the line of the roof trusses.|$|R
25|$|There was {{a little}} bit of drama for the club when in December, Rick Titus left the team without {{permission}} to try out for a team in Hong Kong.

25|$|In 1981, Harry B. Macklowe, the {{developer}} of the Metropolitan Tower, planned a large office tower {{that would have}} included not only his own site at the Metropolitan Tower, but also the restaurant's and the lot on which Carnegie Hall Tower was erected. There was an agreement with Carnegie Hall about their lot, but Stewart-Gordon, who owned the lot dividing the project, refused to sell. Macklowe also offered to buy the air rights only and to give room for her restaurant inside the new tower building, but Stewart-Gordon declined. No matter what she was offered, Stewart-Gordon refused to sell the lot. During the planning of the Carnegie Hall Tower at 152 W. 57th St., {{on the other side}} of the Russian Tea <b>Room,</b> <b>again</b> Stewart-Gordon declined to sell its site or its air rights. The result is the narrow twenty-foot gap, separating the Metropolitan and Carnegie Hall towers.|$|E
500|$|Other presidents, {{as well as}} First Ladies, {{are also}} said to haunt the White House. Witnesses {{in the past two}} centuries have {{reported}} that Thomas Jefferson can be heard playing his violin in the Yellow Oval Room. President Andrew Jackson is said to be seen lying on what is thought to be his old bed [...] in the Queens' Bedroom (also known as the Rose Room), and his guttural laugh has been heard in the White House {{since the beginning of the}} 1860s. First Lady press secretary Liz Carpenter heard the laugh and swore it was Jackson's, and Mary Todd Lincoln claimed to have heard the stomping and swearing of an invisible presence which she claimed was the uncouth Jackson. White House seamstress Lillian Rogers Parks said she was sewing in the Queen's Bedroom and felt a presence, cold air, and then a hand on the back of her chair. She quickly left the room, and for the rest of her time in the White House she refused to enter the <b>room</b> <b>again</b> without at least one other person accompanying her. The spirit of William Henry Harrison, it is claimed, haunts the attic, and President John Tyler allegedly haunts the Blue Room. First Lady Frances Folsom Cleveland, who was married to President Grover Cleveland in the White House's Blue Room in 1886, is widely claimed to haunt the room where she was married and was seen there after her death in 1947.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} was renamed as [...] "Dissanayaka Building". The primary school {{children who were}} studying in the afternoon session for lack of accommodation {{had the privilege of}} having the best of facilities in modern class <b>rooms</b> <b>again</b> in the morning from 1984.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} a long way," [...] she {{reminded}} him. [...] "I am {{down at my}} old <b>rooms</b> <b>again.</b> The house in Russell Square is full of workmen, after the fire." [...] "It does not matter how far," [...] he said simply.|$|R
50|$|A second {{building}} {{opened in}} 1971, with a ceremony performed by Margaret Thatcher, then education minister. This building was largely open-plan {{with the exception}} of the music and art/craft rooms. A new science section on the northern side of the first floor had three <b>rooms,</b> <b>again</b> open-plan. The school roll at the time was 350.|$|R
2500|$|Bradfield {{commented that}} Journal for Plague Lovers {{was an attempt}} to finally secure the legacy of their former member Richey Edwards and the result was that, during the {{recording}} process, it was as close to feeling his presence since his disappearance: [...] "There was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice. That was part of the whole thing of letting enough time lapse. Once we actually got into the studio, it almost felt as if we were a full band; it [...] as close to him being in the <b>room</b> <b>again</b> as possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I want {{to explain}} what happened. Sunday night when you {{requested}} to have someone over I didn't realize you wanted the room in private. I went to Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access it from anywhere. I turned on my camera and saw you {{in the corner of}} the screen and I immediately closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the <b>room</b> <b>again</b> I wanted to make sure what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, I turned my camera away and put my computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E
60|$|Knight began {{pacing the}} <b>room</b> <b>again,</b> and uttered this at further end.|$|E

50|$|The {{hotel has}} twice been ravaged by bushfires. First in 1899; a fire {{destroyed}} {{all of the}} old hotel {{with the exception of}} two <b>rooms.</b> <b>Again</b> on Ash Wednesday (16 February 1983) the hotel suffered, with it being completely destroyed. It was rebuilt and operated with much success until its closure after the construction of the new freeway route.|$|R
6000|$|When Lennan {{reached his}} <b>rooms</b> <b>again</b> after that {{encounter}} with the Ercotts, he found in his letterbox a visiting card: [...] "Mrs. Doone" [...] "Miss Sylvia Doone," [...] and on it pencilled the words: [...] "Do come and see us before we go down to Hayle--Sylvia." [...] He stared blankly at the round handwriting he knew so well.|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} pace the <b>room</b> <b>again,</b> as was my habit when overwrought.|$|E
60|$|Ere his pen {{had touched}} the paper, James {{was in the}} <b>room</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

50|$|At Tom and Angieâ€™s house, Isabel and Jamie {{discover}} {{that they have been}} given adjoining <b>rooms.</b> <b>Again</b> Angie flirts with Jamie and Isabel is sure that she does not love Tom. That evening, Isabel summons up the courage to ask Jamie if he wants to sleep with her. He admits that he does, and they return to their rooms and make love.|$|R
60|$|He {{kicked the}} fire into a blaze. A roaring flame made the <b>room</b> light <b>again.</b>|$|R

60|$|He {{began to}} pace the <b>room</b> <b>again,</b> casting at her shrewd and {{uncertain}} glances.|$|E

60|$|Alan {{was in his}} own <b>room</b> <b>again,</b> though how he {{got there}} he did not recollect.|$|E

50|$|Scenes from Mrs. Brown (1997) were {{filmed in}} the Double Cube <b>Room,</b> once <b>again</b> portraying the {{interior}} of Windsor Castle.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first thing}} Charles did on {{receiving}} this strange communication was to bolt downstairs and inquire for the dispatch-box. It {{had just arrived}} by Eagle Express Company. Charles rushed up to our <b>rooms</b> <b>again,</b> opened it feverishly, and counted his documents. When he found them all safe, {{he turned to me}} with a hard smile. [...] "This letter," [...] he said, with quivering lips, [...] "I consider still more insulting than all his previous ones." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{a little}} while, {{when he entered}} the smaller <b>room</b> <b>again,</b> the Marchesa looked full into his face.|$|E
60|$|I {{was about}} to make some reply in defence of my friend when he entered the <b>room</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|He looked {{round the}} <b>room</b> <b>again,</b> where all those books {{gave him a}} feeling of {{something}} incomprehensible and hostile.|$|E
60|$|He left her. His hands {{went back}} into his pockets, and his {{monotonous}} march {{up and down the}} <b>room</b> began <b>again.</b>|$|R
500|$|After Smith's death, Lennon {{insisted on}} wearing a large {{overcoat}} {{that had belonged}} to Smith, and even though it became worn and threadbare, Lennon wore it throughout his art college years. [...] Mimi never used the downstairs sitting <b>rooms</b> <b>again</b> after Smith's death (only using the breakfast room and the kitchen) and never replaced the furniture, which became old and faded. Lennon continued to live at Mendips (and also for a time with his first wife Cynthia Lennon) until his early 20s, before moving to London.|$|R
2500|$|Before long {{enrolments}} again {{increased and}} additional accommodation became an urgent need. A wooden building was hastily erected, housing classrooms and study hall {{until it was}} replaced in 1907-1908 by a three-storeyed brick building later known as the [...] "Junior School". As student numbers increased, additional <b>rooms</b> <b>again</b> became necessary and in 1913-1914 a new wing was constructed {{on the eastern side}} of the original residence. The site has been continually developed since, with significant redevelopment occurring in 1961 and most recently over the period 1979â€“81.|$|R
