5|$|Over the Rainbow is {{the debut}} {{album of the}} child singer Connie Talbot, and was {{released}} 26 November 2007 by Rainbow Recording Company. Talbot, who had entered the public eye after her appearance on the first series of Britain's Got Talent at age six, signed with Rainbow, an independent label, after briefly recording with Sony BMG. Over the Rainbow consists entirely of covers of pop and Christmas songs, and was recorded primarily in a spare <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of Talbot's aunt, in an attempt not to interrupt Talbot's childhood by disrupting her regular activities. Although public appearances were initially kept to a minimum, Talbot did make appearances to promote the album, and performed in public several times after the British release.|$|E
5|$|The {{central and}} largest <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{is the great}} hall which was the {{original}} dining room and the accompanying screens passage which gave access to the hall from the service rooms. The staircase {{to the north of}} the hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates the front of the house. The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.|$|E

5|$|The {{politician}} Lord Granville {{was offered}} the post of Lord Warden by the new Prime Minister, John Russell in 1865. Russell noted that the role would be expensive for Granville to perform — the salary had been abolished in 1828 — but that it would provide him with a property by the sea, which Granville had been seeking to acquire for a while. Granville took over Walmer in 1865. He expanded the gardens, built new kennels for a hunting pack and spent many years reassembling the furniture and other objects that Pitt and Wellington had used at the castle. He received large numbers of visitors, many of whom stopped off while travelling to or from France. The diplomat Baron de Malortie visited Granville and his family at Walmer, and later praised the homely atmosphere in the castle. He described how, after breakfast, the family and guests would all gather in the drawing room, which was the only large <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and Granville would answer government correspondence amid the daily life {{of the rest of}} the household.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the hospital on 12 July for a tetanus injection, Behan was arrested by five policemen and taken to their Arcidosso barracks for questioning. He {{did not know what}} was happening at first as the police had no interpreter in the barracks. He was only provided with a lawyer and interpreter 15 hours later when a magistrate from Grosseto came. Behan exercised his right not to answer questions. He was released, but was formally informed that he was under suspicion. As of 15 July 2008 he was the only suspect in the case. The police subsequently seized his car and a knife from his home, and secured a <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in which traces of blood were allegedly found. In addition, shoe prints found were said to have matched his footwear. Custody of his car and home (except for the cellar) were returned to him on 14 July by the judge overseeing the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Delta Psi's new {{facility}} was a magnificent Queen Anne structure built in 1882 by deceased Burlington businessman Edward Wells. Each <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was constructed {{of a different}} wood; the entry was built in white oak, the dining room in mahogany, and the conservatory in sycamore. During the 83 years of Delta Psi's occupancy of the Wells Mansion it became famous for the 100-keg Oktoberfest parties the fraternity would host.|$|E

25|$|According to his {{sister-in-law}} Christine, Josef {{went into the}} basement every morning at 09:00, ostensibly to draw plans for machines which he sold to firms. Often he stayed down there for the night and did not allow his wife to bring him coffee.

This night he wrote two letters, one addressed to his father, the other one to his brother Richard, telling them {{that he was going to}} shoot himself.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Camarillo Ranch House’s ideal {{location}} in Southern California, {{back in the}} early 1900s the home struggled to stay warm. Almost every <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> has a fireplace in it. Adolfo looked to technology as a way to remedy problems that would arise on the ranch. He was the first farmer to ever purchase a refrigerator, which at that time, would take up an entire <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> However, he was able to safely store perishables {{for the first time in}} his life. He also had multiple heaters installed throughout the house in hopes of providing more warmth to his family. The most beautiful room in the Camarillo Ranch house belonged to Adolfo's middle daughter Carmen. Carmen was an avid equestrian who learned how to care for and maintain the horses from the Ranch Manager, Meliton Ortiz. Up until Meliton Ortiz’ death in 2010, he would visit the Camarillo Ranch House frequently to provide stories and details about his life growing up on the ranch. The home was remodeled in 1914, when the oldest daughter Carmen married. They opened many rooms by taking down walls and changing the stair design. The grand parlor had the greatest changes from this, causing it to go from multiple to rooms to one giant open grand parlor. This was in the hopes that it would open up the house more.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> include <b>the</b> {{breakfast room}} and upstairs bedrooms. The {{attached}} servants' wing held the pantry, kitchens, laundry, woodshed, and a refrigerated <b>room.</b> <b>Rooms</b> <b>in</b> this wing {{are used as}} offices for staff.|$|R

25|$|To adapt The Circular Staircase for the stage, Rinehart and Hopwood made {{changes to}} the {{characters}} and plot; the most significant was {{the addition of the}} flamboyant criminal whose pseudonym became the play's title. The primary villains in the novel were an embezzling banker and a doctor who helped the banker fake his death. The character names were all changed (Rachel Innes in the novel became Cornelia Van Gorder in the play, her niece Gertrude became Dale, etc.), and some significant characters from the novel were omitted from the play. Despite the changes, the play retained many elements from the novel, including the elderly spinster heroine and her niece staying at a summer house, the hidden <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> the conspiracy between the banker and his doctor, and the bank clerk who disguises himself as a gardener.|$|E
25|$|Not able to {{live with}} the guilt anymore and with {{encouragement}} from Stuart's ghost, Kendall refuses to bargain and confesses to the murder, being sentenced to live in prison. Zach is able to get Kendall out of prison by paying a Kendall lookalike a large sum of money (according to Jesse) in order to pose as her in prison. He is able to give Kendall a <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> where she is to remain, not to come out for any reason, even to check on Ian and Spike. When asking Zach why she cannot stay in his room with him, Kendall concludes that it is because she slept with Ryan and that Zach has not forgiven her, which he confirms. He tells her that he will not forgive anyone anymore, not even Kendall. He does tell her that she is his wife and that he will protect her and his children no matter what.|$|E
25|$|The rooms {{within the}} {{elongation}} are accessed through a 48-foot long, 6-foot wide gallery. The gallery is enclosed in its full length {{through the use}} of an original row of wooden balustrade, supporting operable wooden transoms, movable wooden louvers and wooden shutters, simultaneously providing shade and air, two important local design considerations, as Ponce is known for its hot weather and its implacable sun. Another significant design in Casa Vives related to Ponce's climate is the treatment given to the air circulation within the living quarters. The house has high ceilings, ranging from 14 to 15 feet, to give hot air more space to rise. Adorned ventilation holes are strategically located at the four corners of every room's ceiling, allowing for the heat to exit through the roof and letting the cool air circulate throughout the entire house. The fresh air is captured at the roof through a set of brick and masonry ventilation structures, oriented in an east-to-west direction (the usual direction of the wind currents), and channelized to the house interior. Every single <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> connects to the adjacent room through wooden double doors (some with louvers and shutters, other of solid construction), allowing air to circulate from one space to another. Furthermore, many of the interior doors are crowned with wooden transoms, facilitating the air conduit even with the doors closed. In addition, every single room has, at least, one wooden double door that open toward the exterior.|$|E

500|$|In 1961 and 1962, Aspinall {{had become}} {{good friends with}} Pete Best and {{subsequently}} rented a <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> where Best lived with his parents. During one of the extended business trips of Best's father, the 19-year-old Aspinall became romantically involved with Best's mother, Mona Best, who was 17 years his senior. As a result, during this period, Aspinall fathered a child by Mona: Vincent [...] "Roag" [...] Best. Roag Best was born in late July 1962, and just three weeks later, on 16 August 1962, Best was dismissed from the Beatles.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{reception}} rooms have painted ceilings copied from Italian palazzi, most notably from the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. The largest <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is the Music Room, which opens onto the east portico. The ceiling fresco {{in this room}} depicts the [...] "Banquet of the Gods" [...] and was copied from the Villa Farnesina. The Saloon, which occupies {{the centre of the}} north front, contains many marbles, including statuettes of the four seasons. The ceiling depicting [...] "The Council of the Gods and the Admission of Psyche" [...] is also a copy from Villa Farnesina.|$|E
500|$|When William Acton ran {{the jail}} in the 1720s, the income from charities, {{collected}} {{to buy food}} for inmates on the common side, was directed instead {{to a group of}} trusted prisoners who policed the prison on Acton's behalf. The same group swore during Acton's trial in 1729 for murder that the strong room was the best <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Ginger writes that Acton and his wife, who lived in a comfortable apartment near the lodge, knew they were sitting on a powder keg: [...] "When each morning the smell of freshly baked bread filled... the yard... only brutal suppression could prevent the Common Side from erupting." ...|$|E

Towards the end of the video, Berrabah, Buchanan and Range are shown standing outside in the dark. A car stops next to the trio and they enter it. In the last scene, an elderly man watches by as the car drives off. Avril Cadden from the Sunday Mail praised the video as [...] "great". Former group member Buena expressed her dissatisfaction with it, saying: [...] "I just saw a bunch of perverted men and paedophile guys". The video reached number eight on the UK TV airplay chart.|$|E
500|$|Best {{had been}} good friends with Neil Aspinall since 1961 when he rented a <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> where Best lived with his parents. Best asked Aspinall to become the band's road manager and {{personal}} assistant; accepting the job, he bought an old Commer van for £80 (equivalent to £ in [...] ).. Aspinall was waiting for Best downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop after the dismissal meeting. The two went to the Grapes pub on Mathew Street, the same street as the Cavern Club where the group had played. Aspinall was furious at the news, insisting to Best that he would also resign from the Beatles. Best strongly advised him to remain with the group. Aspinall's relationship with Mona Best (and their three-week-old baby, Roag) was ended. At the next concert Aspinall asked Lennon why they had fired Best, to which he replied [...] "It's {{got nothing to do}} with you, you're only the driver." ...|$|E
500|$|Earning a small wage, Mandela {{rented a}} <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of the Xhoma {{family in the}} Alexandra township; despite being rife with poverty, crime and pollution, Alexandra always {{remained}} a special place for him. Although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly dated a Swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting his landlord's daughter. To save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs, he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland. In late 1941, Jongintaba visited Johannesburg—there forgiving Mandela for running away—before returning to Thembuland, where {{he died in the}} winter of 1942. Mandela and Justice arrived a day late for the funeral. After he passed his BA exams in early 1943, Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland. He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he [...] "simply found [...] doing so, and could not do otherwise." ...|$|E
