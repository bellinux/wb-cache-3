40|$|Abstract. In this research, high {{efficiency}} machining tool path design of die cavities were developed using CAD/CAM and plunge <b>roughing</b> technology. The algorithms of cutting tool path design for ideal and non-ideal rouging area were {{proposed to improve}} the material removal rate (MRR). The proposed tool path design methods {{are based on the}} minimum numbers of rectangular or triangular patterns to cover the <b>roughing</b> areas. The cutting results of the traditional Z-plane and the plunge <b>roughing</b> were compared to show the improvement of the cutting efficiency with the proposed methods. Design of experiments (DOE) method was adopted to optimize the tool path designs and cutting conditions. Cutting experiments were carried out to verify the proposed cutting path design methods. The better material removal rate was obtained using the proposed plunge <b>roughing</b> method compared to the traditional Z-plane <b>roughing.</b> Both of the cutting simulations and the cutting experiments also showed the cutting efficiency of plunge <b>roughing</b> is increased with increase of cutting depth. The proposed hybrid tool path design method can further improve the cutting efficiency of plunge <b>roughing</b> process...|$|R

30|$|The {{light output}} is {{detected}} by calibrating an integrating sphere with Si photodiode {{on the package}} device. The intensity-current (L-I) characteristics of the LEDs with and without PQC structure are shown in Figure  4 b. At an injection current of 20 mA and peak wavelength of 460 nm for TO (transistor outline) can package, the light output powers of conventional LED, LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side <b>roughing,</b> and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side <b>roughing</b> on TO can are given by 11.6, 13.5, 15.1, and 16.5 mW, respectively. Hence, the enhancement percentages of LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side <b>roughing,</b> and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side <b>roughing</b> were 16 %, 30 %, and 42 %, respectively, {{compared to that of}} the conventional LED. The higher enhancement of LED with both PQC structures was scattering and guiding light from LED top surface and n-side <b>roughing</b> onto the LED top direction [14, 21, 24] to increase more light output power. In addition, the corresponding wall-plug efficiencies (WPE) of conventional LED, LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side <b>roughing,</b> and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side <b>roughing</b> were 19 %, 22 %, 24 %, and 26 %, respectively, which addresses a substantial improvement by the PQC structures on top surface and n-side <b>roughing</b> as well at a driving current of 20 mA. Comparing with the conventional LED, the WPEs of LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side <b>roughing,</b> and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side <b>roughing</b> were increased by 15.8 %, 26.3 %, and 36.8 %, respectively, at an injection current of 20 mA, The enhancement of WPE of LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side <b>roughing</b> is relatively high comparing with other researches [10, 13, 14, 24, 25], which is because the light emitted from LED scattered by top PQC pattern and guided onto the LED top direction by n-side <b>roughing</b> [22, 23, 26], therefore resulting in the enhancement of WPE.|$|R
