25|$|Rugby {{union has}} a number of heartlands, notably South Wales, the Scottish Borders, the English West Country, London and the Midlands. Rugby union is {{generally}} regarded as the national sport of Wales. England organises its own league, and also a cup competition whose current identity as the Anglo-Welsh Cup reflects its expansion in 2005 from an England-only competition to one also involving teams from Wales. The other Home Nations now have a single professional league, currently known as the Guinness Pro14, that also includes teams from Italy and South Africa. Attendances at club rugby in England have risen strongly since the sport went professional; by contrast, the professional era has had a traumatic effect on the traditional structure of club rugby in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Following the <b>regional</b> <b>model</b> of Wales and Ireland, Scotland also originally established four regional teams for North, East, South and West Scotland. Due to the demographics of the country, the Northern region was too vast for a single club to serve (over twice the size of Wales but with only a quarter the population) and the 5% of the population who happened to live in the rugby-loving borders were not enough to sustain the Southern franchise, leaving just West and East. There was some talk of the regions being redrawn, with the North being divided in two and the South being absorbed into the West and East regions, but two Italian sides have instead taken the vacated places.|$|E
500|$|The {{horizontal}} {{domain of}} a model is either global, covering the entire Earth, or regional, covering {{only part of the}} Earth.
