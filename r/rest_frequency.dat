40|$|Geographic {{variation}} in sensory traits is usually influenced by adaptive processes because these traits {{are involved in}} crucial life-history aspects including orientation, communication, lineage recognition and mate choice. Studying this variation can therefore provide insights into lineage diversification. According to the Sensory Drive Hypothesis, lineage diversification may be driven by adaptation of sensory systems to local environments. It predicts that acoustic signals vary in association with local climatic conditions so that atmospheric attenuation is minimized and transmission of the signals maximized. To test this prediction, we investigated the influence of climatic factors (specifically relative humidity and temperature) on geographic {{variation in}} the <b>resting</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the echolocation pulses of Geoffroy's horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus clivosus. If the evolution of phenotypic variation in this lineage tracks climate variation, human induced climate change may lead to decreases in detection volumes {{and a reduction in}} foraging efficiency. A complex non-linear interaction between relative humidity and temperature affects atmospheric attenuation of sound and principal components composed of these correlated variables were, therefore, used in a linear mixed effects model to assess their contribution to observed variation in <b>resting</b> <b>frequencies.</b> A principal component composed predominantly of mean annual temperature (factor loading of - 0. 8455) significantly explained a proportion of the variation in <b>resting</b> <b>frequency</b> across sites (P < 0. 05). Specifically, at higher relative humidity (around 60 %) prevalent across the distribution of R. clivosus, increasing temperature had a strong negative effect on <b>resting</b> <b>frequency.</b> Climatic factors thus strongly influence acoustic signal divergence in this lineage, supporting the prediction of the Sensory Drive Hypothesis. The predicted future increase in temperature due to climate change is likely to decrease the detection volume in echolocating bats and adversely impact their foraging efficiency...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Rhinolophus euryale and R. mehelyi are morphologically {{very similar}} species and their {{distributions}} overlap {{extensively in the}} Mediterranean basin. We modelled their foraging behaviour using echolocation calls and wing morphology and, assuming niche seg-regation occurs between the two species, we explored how it is shaped by these factors. <b>Resting</b> <b>frequency</b> of echolocation calls was recorded and weight, forearm length, wing loading, aspect ratio and wing tip shape index were measured. R. mehelyi showed a signif-icantly higher <b>resting</b> <b>frequency</b> than R. euryale, but differences are deemed insufficient for dietary niche segregation. Weight and forearm length were significantly larger in R. mehe-lyi. The higher values of aspect ratio and wing loading and a lower value of wing tip shape index in R. melehyi restrict its flight manoeuvrability and agility. Therefore, the flight abil-ity of R. mehelyi may decrease as habitat complexity increases.

40|$|Bovine {{mesenteric}} lymphatics of 8 cm length were cannulated {{and arranged}} so that pressure changes produced by spontaneous contractions and accompanying flow could be measured. The mean frequency of spontaneous contractions, although constant {{for any one}} vessel, varied between vessels from 0. 5 to 5. 2 beats/min (mean 2. 6, S. D. 1. 6, n = 33). Noradrenaline (100 ng/ml.) invariably increased frequency of contractions but flow was increased only in those vessels which had a low <b>resting</b> <b>frequency.</b> In those vessels which had a higher <b>resting</b> <b>frequency,</b> flow was decreased despite the increase in frequency because stroke volume decreased. This {{may have been due}} to increased pace-maker activity causing desynchronization of the contractile activity in the vessel wall and thus decreased effectiveness of pumping. High doses (greater than 1 microgram/ml.) of noradrenaline invariably depressed flow. Isoprenaline slowed the frequency of spontaneous contractions and this either had little effect on flow (due to an increased filling time and thus stroke volume) or depressed it, finally abolishing it entirely at higher doses. It is concluded that in suitable dosage (which varies for different vessels) noradrenaline is capable of enhancing flow and this might, at least in part, explain the increase in lymph flow resulting from noradrenaline infusion in living animals...|$|R
40|$|For centuries, rocking {{has been}} used to promote sleep in babies or toddlers. Recent {{research}} suggested that relaxation could play a role in facilitating the transition from waking to sleep during rocking. Breathing techniques are often used to promote relaxation. However, studies investigating head motions and body rotations showed that vestibular stimulation might elicit a vestibulo-respiratory response, leading to an increase in respiration frequency. An increase in respiration frequency would not be considered to promote relaxation in the first place. On the other hand, a coordination of respiration to rhythmic vestibular stimulation has been observed. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of different movement frequencies and amplitudes on respiration frequency. Furthermore, we tested whether subjects adapt their respiration to movement frequencies below their spontaneous respiration <b>frequency</b> at <b>rest,</b> which could be beneficial for relaxation. Twenty-one healthy subjects (24 - 42 years, 12 males) were investigated using an actuated bed, moving along a lateral translation. Following movement frequencies were applied: + 30 %, + 15 %, - 15 %, and - 30 % of subjects' <b>rest</b> respiration <b>frequency</b> during baseline (no movement). Furthermore, two different movement amplitudes were tested (Amplitudes: 15 cm, 7. 5 cm; movement frequency: 0. 3 Hz). In addition, five subjects (25 - 28 years, 2 males) were stimulated with their individual <b>rest</b> respiration <b>frequency.</b> Rocking movements along a lateral translation caused a vestibulo-respiratory adaptation leading to an increase in respiration frequency. The increase was independent of the applied movement frequencies or amplitudes but did not occur when stimulating with subjects' <b>rest</b> respiration <b>frequency.</b> Furthermore, no synchronization of the respiration frequency to the movement frequency was observed. In particular, subjects did not lower their respiration <b>frequency</b> below their <b>resting</b> <b>frequency.</b> Hence, it was not feasible to influence respiration in a manner that might be considered beneficial for relaxation...|$|R
40|$|Divergence in {{phenotypic}} traits {{may arise}} from the interaction of different evolutionary forces, including different kinds of selection (e. g., ecological), genetic drift, and phenotypic plasticity. Sensory systems {{play an important role}} in survival and reproduction, and divergent selection on such systems may result in lineage diversification. Such diversification could be largely influenced by selection in different environments as a result of isolation by environment (IbE). We investigated this process using geographic variation in the <b>resting</b> echolocation <b>frequency</b> of the horseshoe bat species, Rhinolophus damarensis, as a test case. Bats were sampled along a latitudinal gradient ranging from 16 °S to 32 °S in the arid western half of southern Africa. We measured body size and peak <b>resting</b> <b>frequencies</b> (RF) from handheld individual bats. Three hypotheses for the divergence in RF were tested: (1) James’ Rule, (2) IbE, and (3) genetic drift through isolation by distance (IbD) to isolate the effects of body size, local climatic conditions, and geographic distance, respectively, on the <b>resting</b> <b>frequency</b> of R. damarensis. Our results did not support genetic drift because there was no correlation between RF variation and geographic distance. Our results also did not support James’ Rule because there was no significant relationship between (1) geographic distances and RF, (2) body size and RF, or (3) body size and climatic variables. Instead, we found support for IbE in the form of a correlation between RF and both region and annual mean temperature, suggesting that RF variation may be the result of environmental discontinuities. The environmental discontinuities coincided with previously reported genetic divergence. Climatic gradients in conjunction with environmental discontinuities could lead to local adaptation in sensory signals and directed dispersal such that gene flow is restricted, allowing lineages to diverge. However, our study cannot exclude the role of processes like phenotypic plasticity in phenotypic variation...|$|R

40|$|In 5 {{roosting}} bats the <b>resting</b> <b>frequency,</b> that is {{the mean}} frequency of the cf-portion of consecutive sounds, is kept constant {{with a standard deviation}} which varies between 30 120 Hz in different bats and at different days. In 15 bats the emitted sounds were electronically shifted in frequency and played back as artificial echoes. Upward frequency shifts were responded by a decrease of the emission frequency. This frequency compensation occurred at frequency shifts of up to 4400 Hz in all bats and up to 6000 ttz in a few bats. The frequency decrease in different bats over the whole compensation range was 50 - 300 tIz smaller than the frequency shifts in the echoes. The echoes, therefore, returned at a frequency, called the reference frequency, which was by this compensation offset higher than the <b>resting</b> <b>frequency.</b> The standard deviations of the emission frequency in compensating bats were only slightly larger than in roosting bats and the same in the whole compensation range. All bats started to compensate frequency shifts when they were slightly larger than the compensation offset. Downward frequency shifts were not responded by a change of the emission frequency, but the accuracy with which the emission frequency was kept decreased somewhat. From these results it is concluded that the Doppler shift compensation system of the Horseshoe bats compares the echo frequency with the reference frequency and compensates deviations of upward frequency shifts. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{software}} processes the flyby {{spectra of}} the Chirp Transform Spectrometer (CTS) of the Microwave Instrument for Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO). The tool corrects {{the effect of}} Doppler shift and local-oscillator (LO) frequency shift during the flyby mode of MIRO operations. The frequency correction for CTS flyby spectra is performed and is integrated with multiple spectra into a high signal-to-noise averaged spectrum at the rest-frame RF frequency. This innovation also generates the 8 molecular line spectra by dividing continuous 4, 096 -channel CTS spectra. The 8 line spectra can then be readily used for scientific investigations. A spectral line that is at its <b>rest</b> <b>frequency</b> {{in the frame of}} the Earth or an asteroid will be observed with a time-varying Doppler shift as seen by MIRO. The frequency shift is toward the higher RF frequencies on approach, and toward lower RF frequencies on departure. The magnitude of the shift depends on the flyby velocity. The result of time-varying Doppler shift is that of an observed spectral line will be seen to move from channel to channel in the CTS spectrometer. The direction (higher or lower frequency) in the spectrometer depends on the spectral line frequency under consideration. In order to analyze the flyby spectra, two steps are required. First, individual spectra must be corrected for the Doppler shift so that individual spectra can be superimposed at the same <b>rest</b> <b>frequency</b> for integration purposes. Second, a correction needs to be applied to the CTS spectra to account for the LO frequency shifts that are applied to asteroid mode...|$|E

40|$|Doppler shift {{compensation}} behaviour in horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus rouxi, {{was used}} to test the interference of pure tones and narrow band noise with compensation performance. The distortions in Doppler shift compensation to sinusoidally frequency shifted echoes (modulation frequency: 0. 1 Hz, maximum frequency shift: 3 kHz) consisted of a reduced compensation amplitude and/or a shift of the emitted frequency to lower frequencies (Fig. 1). Pure tones at frequencies between 200 and 900 Hz above the bat's <b>resting</b> <b>frequency</b> (RF) disturbed the Doppler shift compensation, with a maximum of intererence between 400 and 550 Hz (Fig. 2). Minimum duration of pure tones for interference was 20 ms and durations above 40 ms were most effective (Fig. 3). Interfering pure tones arriving later than about 10 ms after the onset of the echolocation call showed markedly reduced interference (Fig. 4). Doppler shift compensation was affected by pure tones at the optimum interfering frequency with sound pressure levels down to – 48 dB rel the intensity level of the emitted call (Figs. 5, 6). Narrow bandwidth noise (bandwidth from ± 100 Hz to ± 800 Hz) disturbed Doppler shift compensation at carrier frequencies between – 250 Hz below and 800 Hz above RF with a maximum of interference between 250 and 500 Hz above <b>resting</b> <b>frequency</b> (Fig. 7). The duration and delay of the noise had similar influences on interference with Doppler shift compensation as did pure tones (Figs. 8, 9). Intensity dependence for noise interference was more variable than for pure tones (- 32 dB to - 45 dB rel emitted sound pressure level, Fig. 10). The temporal and spectral gating in Doppler shift compensation behaviour is discussed as an effective mechanism for clutter rejection by improving the processing of frequency and amplitude transients in the echoes of horseshoe bats. ...|$|R
