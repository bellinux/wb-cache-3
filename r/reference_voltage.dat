This means that the op-amp is set up as a comparator to detect a positive voltage. If the voltage to be sensed, Ei, is applied to op amp's (+) input, the result is a noninverting positive-level detector: when Ei is above Vref, VO equals +Vsat; when Ei is below Vref, VO equals −Vsat. If Ei is applied to the inverting input, the circuit is an inverting positive-level detector: When Ei is above Vref, VO equals −Vsat.|$|E

We provide novel analyt-ical {{understanding of the}} solutions to the classic nonlinear polynomial equations describing the decoupled reactive power flow. As of today, solutions to these equations can be found only via numerical methods. Yet an analytical understanding would enable rigorous design of future electrical grids. This paper has two main contributions. First, for sufficiently-high <b>reference</b> <b>voltages,</b> we guarantee {{the existence of a}} high-voltage solution for the reactive power flow equations and provide its approximate analytical expression. The approximation error is bounded in terms of network topology and parameters. Second, we consider a recently-proposed droop control strategy for voltage stabilization in a microgrid equipped with inverters. For sufficiently-high <b>reference</b> <b>voltages,</b> we prove the existence and the exponential stability of a high-voltage fixed point of the closed-loop dynamics. We provide an approximate expression for this fixed point and find the limiting value of the approxima-tion error for high <b>reference</b> <b>voltages.</b> Finally, we validate the accuracy of our approximations through numerical simulation of the IEEE 37 standard test case.

2500|$|Computers use two-value Boolean {{circuits}} for {{the above}} reasons. The most common computer architectures use ordered sequences of Boolean values, called bits, of 32 or 64 values, e.g. 01101000110101100101010101001011. When programming in machine code, assembly language, and certain other programming languages, programmers {{work with the}} low-level digital structure of the data registers. These registers operate on voltages, where zero volts represents Boolean 0, and a <b>reference</b> <b>voltage</b> (often +5V, +3.3V, +1.8V) represents Boolean 1. Such languages support both numeric operations and logical operations. In this context, [...] "numeric" [...] means that the computer treats sequences of bits as binary numbers (base two numbers) and executes arithmetic operations like add, subtract, multiply, or divide. [...] "Logical" [...] refers to the Boolean logical operations of disjunction, conjunction, and negation between two sequences of bits, in which each bit in one sequence is simply compared to its counterpart in the other sequence.

2500|$|Feedback voltage {{regulators}} operate {{by comparing the}} actual output voltage to some fixed <b>reference</b> <b>voltage.</b> Any difference is amplified and used to control the regulation element {{in such a way}} as to reduce the voltage error. This forms a negative feedback control loop; increasing the open-loop gain tends to increase regulation accuracy but reduce stability. (Stability is avoidance of oscillation, or ringing, during step changes.) There will also be a trade-off between stability and the speed of the response to changes. [...] If the output voltage is too low (perhaps due to input voltage reducing or load current increasing), the regulation element is commanded, up to a point, to produce a higher output voltage–by dropping less of the input voltage (for linear series regulators and buck switching regulators), or to draw input current for longer periods (boost-type switching regulators); if the output voltage is too high, the regulation element will normally be commanded to produce a lower voltage. However, many regulators have over-current protection, so that they will entirely stop sourcing current (or limit the current in some way) if the output current is too high, and some regulators may also shut down if the input voltage is outside a given range (see also: crowbar circuits).|$|E
