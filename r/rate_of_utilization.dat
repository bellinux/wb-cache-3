40|$|The {{metabolism}} of glutamine in resting and concanavalin-A-stimulated lymphocytes was investigated. In incubated lymphocytes {{isolated from}} rat mesenteric lymph nodes, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> oxygen and glutamine <b>utilization</b> and that <b>of</b> aspartate production were approximately linear {{with respect to}} time for 60 min, and the concentrations of adenine nucleotides plus the ATP/ADP or ATP/AMP concentration ratios remained approximately constant for 90 min. The major end products of glutamine metabolism were glutamate, aspartate and ammonia: the carbon from glutamine may contribute about 30 % to respiration. When both glucose and glutamine were presented to the cells, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> both substances increased. Evidence was obtained that the stimulation of glycolysis by glutamine could be due, in part, to an activation of 6 -phosphofructokinase.

Labelled triglycerides coated on Celite 545 were shaken with rat serum at 0 — 2 °C for 22 — 24 hr and the centrifugal supernatant was injected intravenously into rats.

The major route for the utilization of triglyceride fatty acids as acyl donors for esterification in vivo appeared to proceed via intermolecular transfer of the fatty acids from triglyceride to phospholipids, possibly to the 2 -position of lecithin. The possible significance of other lipid component(s) as a donor of palmitic acid for the reaction was suggested.
