5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> forms {{a number}} of oxides when exposed to air, {{including}} <b>rubidium</b> monoxide (Rb2O), Rb6O, and Rb9O2; <b>rubidium</b> in excess oxygen gives the superoxide RbO2. <b>Rubidium</b> forms salts with halides, producing <b>rubidium</b> fluoride, <b>rubidium</b> chloride, <b>rubidium</b> bromide, and <b>rubidium</b> iodide.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>rubidium</b> is more {{abundant}} in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications {{and the lack}} of a mineral rich in <b>rubidium</b> limits the production of <b>rubidium</b> compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, <b>rubidium,</b> and caesium. The fractional crystallization of a <b>rubidium</b> and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure <b>rubidium</b> alum. Two other methods are reported, the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a {{by-product}} of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for <b>rubidium.</b> Alkarb contained 21% <b>rubidium</b> while the rest was potassium and {{a small fraction of}} caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the Tanco Mine in Manitoba, Canada, produce <b>rubidium</b> as by-product from pollucite. Today, a common method for separating <b>rubidium</b> from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallisation of a <b>rubidium</b> and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O, which yields pure <b>rubidium</b> alum after approximately 30 recrystallisations. The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in <b>rubidium</b> limit the production of <b>rubidium</b> compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Caesium, however, is not produced from the above reaction. Instead, the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium, extracted from the ore mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction. Both metals are produced as by-products of lithium production: after 1958, when interest in lithium's thermonuclear properties increased sharply, the production of <b>rubidium</b> and caesium also increased correspondingly. Pure <b>rubidium</b> and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at 750°C and low pressure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> {{was tested}} for the {{influence}} on manic depression and depression. Dialysis patients suffering from depression show a depletion in <b>rubidium</b> and therefore a supplementation may help during depression. In some tests the <b>rubidium</b> was administered as <b>rubidium</b> chloride with up to 720mg per day for 60 days.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, <b>rubidium</b> and caesium {{in the body}} mimic {{potassium}} and are taken up similarly. <b>Rubidium</b> has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency. Partial substitution is quite possible and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of <b>rubidium,</b> {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by <b>rubidium.</b> <b>Rubidium</b> (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while <b>rubidium</b> can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for <b>rubidium</b> being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.|$|E

5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> and caesium {{were the}} first {{elements}} to be discovered using the spectroscope, invented in 1859 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff. The next year, they discovered caesium in the mineral water from Bad Dürkheim, Germany. Their discovery of <b>rubidium</b> came the following year in Heidelberg, Germany, finding it in the mineral lepidolite. The names of <b>rubidium</b> and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra: a bright red line for <b>rubidium</b> (from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue line for caesium (derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue).|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> has a {{very low}} {{ionization}} energy of only 406kJ/mol. <b>Rubidium</b> and potassium show a very similar purple color in the flame test, and distinguishing the two elements requires something more sophisticated, such as spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37. <b>Rubidium</b> is a soft, silvery-white metallic {{element of the}} alkali metal group, with a standard atomic weight of 85.4678. Elemental <b>rubidium</b> is highly reactive, with properties {{similar to those of}} other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air. On Earth, natural <b>rubidium</b> comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope, 85Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive 87Rb, with a half-life of 49billion years—more than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, {{although none of}} these contain only <b>rubidium</b> and no other alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than <b>rubidium.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> {{is not a}} known {{nutrient}} for any living organisms. However, <b>rubidium</b> ions {{have the}} same charge as potassium ions, and are actively taken up and treated by animal cells in similar ways.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% <b>rubidium</b> oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% <b>rubidium,</b> and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium,</b> like {{sodium and}} potassium, almost always has +1 {{oxidation}} state when dissolved in water, even in biological contexts. The human body tends to treat Rb+ ions {{as if they}} were potassium ions, and therefore concentrates <b>rubidium</b> in the body's intracellular fluid (i.e., inside cells). The ions are not particularly toxic; a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of <b>rubidium,</b> and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. The biological half-life of <b>rubidium</b> in humans measures 31–46days. Although a partial substitution of potassium by <b>rubidium</b> is possible, when more than 50% of the potassium in the muscle tissue of rats was replaced with <b>rubidium,</b> the rats died.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive <b>rubidium</b> beams can be {{produced}} since 2015 at CERN's HIE-ISOLDE apparatus with sufficient intensity to consider the production of element 120 in the reaction of <b>rubidium</b> beams with a bismuth-209 target in a cold fusion reaction. In particular, the use of 95Rb would allow the neutron shell at N = 184 to be reached.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. <b>Rubidium</b> has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where <b>rubidium</b> ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. <b>Rubidium,</b> particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> had minimal {{industrial}} value {{before the}} 1920s. Since then, {{the most important}} use of <b>rubidium</b> is research and development, primarily in chemical and electronic applications. In 1995, rubidium-87 was used to produce a Bose–Einstein condensate, for which the discoverers, Eric Allin Cornell, Carl Edwin Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle, won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> reacts violently {{with water}} and can cause fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or sealed in glass {{ampoules}} in an inert atmosphere. <b>Rubidium</b> forms peroxides on exposure even to small amount of air diffused into the oil, and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium.|$|E
5|$|Two notable {{sources of}} <b>rubidium</b> are the rich {{deposits}} of pollucite at Bernic Lake, Manitoba, Canada, and the rubicline ((Rb,K)AlSi3O8) found as impurities in pollucite on the Italian island of Elba, with a <b>rubidium</b> content of 17.5%. Both of those deposits are also sources of caesium.|$|E
5|$|German chemists Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff {{discovered}} <b>rubidium</b> in 1861 by {{the newly}} developed technique, flame spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{or current}} uses of <b>rubidium</b> include a working fluid in vapor turbines, as a getter in vacuum tubes, {{and as a}} photocell component. <b>Rubidium</b> is also used as an ingredient in special types of glass, {{in the production of}} superoxide by burning in oxygen, in the study of potassium ion channels in biology, and as the vapor in atomic magnetometers. In particular, 87Rb is used with other alkali metals in the development of spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been made {{at the time of}} the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second. <b>Rubidium</b> ions {{are often used}} in purple fireworks, and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> and caesium {{can form}} {{a great variety}} of suboxides with the metals in formal {{oxidation}} states below +1. <b>Rubidium</b> can form Rb6O and Rb9O2 (copper-coloured) upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the ozonide CsO3 and several brightly coloured suboxides, such as Cs7O (bronze), Cs4O (red-violet), Cs11O3 (violet), Cs3O (dark green), CsO, Cs3O2, as well as Cs7O2. The last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate Cs2O.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rubidium</b> {{has been}} used for {{polarizing}} 3He, producing volumes of magnetized 3He gas, with the nuclear spins aligned rather than random. <b>Rubidium</b> vapor is optically pumped by a laser and the polarized Rb polarizes 3He through the hyperfine interaction.He spin filters for slow neutron physics| volume=110 |pages=299–304 |first1 = T.

5|$|Rubidium's {{compounds}} have various {{chemical and}} electronic applications. <b>Rubidium</b> metal is easily vaporized {{and has a}} convenient spectral absorption range, making it a frequent target for laser manipulation of atoms.|$|E
5|$|Seawater {{contains}} {{an average of}} 125µg/L of <b>rubidium</b> compared to the much higher value for potassium of 408mg/L and the much lower value of 0.3µg/L for caesium.|$|E
5|$|Twenty four {{additional}} <b>rubidium</b> isotopes {{have been}} synthesized with half-lives {{of less than}} 3months; most are highly radioactive and have few uses.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, a gas of <b>rubidium</b> atoms cooled {{down to a}} {{temperature}} of 170 nK was used to experimentally realize the Bose–Einstein condensate, a novel state of matter originally predicted by S. N. Bose and Albert Einstein, wherein {{a large number of}} atoms occupy one quantum state.|$|E
5|$|The International System of Units {{standardized}} its unit of time, the second, on {{the properties}} of cesium in 1967. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. The cesium atomic clock, maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is accurate to 30billionths of a second per year. Atomic clocks have employed other elements, such as hydrogen and <b>rubidium</b> vapor, offering greater stability—in the case of hydrogen clocks—and smaller size, lower power consumption, and thus lower cost (in the case of <b>rubidium</b> clocks).|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} occur in {{water in the}} Black Creek watershed, with sodium being considerably more common than potassium. Potassium concentrations are around 20 milligrams per liter, while sodium concentrations are less than 10 milligrams per liter. Lithium and <b>rubidium</b> also have been observed in the watershed, with concentrations of 0.02 to 0.2 and 0.04 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{content in}} bulk may be {{determined}} by treating with a large excess of uranyl zinc acetate; the hexahydrate (UO2)2ZnNa(CH3CO2)·6H2O precipitates and can be weighed. Caesium and <b>rubidium</b> do not interfere with this reaction, but potassium and lithium do. Lower concentrations of sodium may {{be determined by}} atomic absorption spectrophotometry or by potentiometry using ion-selective electrodes.|$|E
5|$|The alkali metals, due {{to their}} high reactivity, do not occur {{naturally}} in pure form in nature. They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, <b>rubidium</b> and caesium are also incompatible elements {{due to their}} large ionic radii.|$|E
5|$|The slight {{radioactivity}} of <b>rubidium</b> {{was discovered}} in 1908, {{but that was before}} the theory of isotopes was established in 1910, and the low level of activity (half-life greater than 1010years) made interpretation complicated. The now proven decay of 87Rb to stable 87Sr through beta decay was still under discussion in the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The {{stabilisation}} of ununennium's {{valence electron}} {{and thus the}} contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240pm, very close to that of <b>rubidium</b> (247pm), so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of <b>rubidium</b> than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkali metal, {{in addition to the}} +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected. Indeed, many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding.|$|E
5|$|Ununennium is {{the element}} with the {{smallest}} atomic number {{that has not yet}} been synthesized. Multiple attempts have been made by American, German, and Russian teams to synthesize this element: they have all been unsuccessful, as experimental evidence has shown that the synthesis of ununennium will likely be far more difficult than that of the previous elements, and it may even be the penultimate element that can be synthesized with current technology. Planned attempts by Japanese and Russian teams are scheduled for 2019–2020. Its position as the seventh alkali metal suggests that it would have similar properties to its lighter congeners: lithium, sodium, potassium, <b>rubidium,</b> caesium, and francium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, ununennium is expected to be less reactive than caesium and francium and to be closer in behavior to potassium or <b>rubidium,</b> and while it should show the characteristic +1 oxidation state of the alkali metals, it is also predicted to show the +3 oxidation state unknown in any other alkali metal.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, <b>rubidium,</b> caesium, and francium. Each of these elements has one valence electron in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns1), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements. Ununennium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.|$|E
5|$|Francium coprecipitates {{with several}} caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, {{which results in}} small amounts of {{francium}} perchlorate. This coprecipitation {{can be used to}} isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also <b>rubidium</b> tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which provides other methods of separation. Nearly all francium salts are water-soluble.|$|E
