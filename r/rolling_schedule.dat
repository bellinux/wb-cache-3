Consequently, according to lots of theory research and spot experiment, taking relative balance of rolling force, flatness well of finished sheet and minimal rolling power as the control goal, the multi-object model for high strength sheet is built. Simultaneously, considering that PSO algorithm has shortcomings of initial randomness and premature convergence, the ACPSO algorithm is proposed which takes advantage of periodicity of the chaos motion and the inertial weight is adjust according to premature convergence extent of particle swarm and accommodate value of individual.

30|$|Guimaraes (2013) uses a {{hierarchical}} approach similar to an APS to solve production planning {{problems in the}} beverage industry. The HPPS is structured in a short–medium-term planning (lot-sizing and scheduling) problem and a long-term planning (capacity coordination) problem. While each of the decision levels is studied separately, a holistic analysis of the HPPS is omitted. The short–medium-term planning problem, including sequence-dependent setup costs, is tackled through a newly formulated model of the capacitated lot-sizing and scheduling problem, with sequencing decisions (CLSD) implemented in <b>rolling</b> <b>schedules</b> with period-based frozen horizons. The model integrates short- and medium-term production planning in a single problem with a detailed plan {{at the beginning of}} the planning interval and a raw estimation of capacity utilization and costs in later periods.

While the top-level planning tasks have already been addressed in Meistering and Stadtler (2017) {{in the context of the}} CLSP with <b>rolling</b> <b>schedules,</b> it is not clear if the stabilized-cycle strategy also works in a hierarchical setting.

Literature evaluates various algorithmic approaches for solving the joint replenishment {{problem in a}} static environment, but their relative performance in a dynamic rolling horizon system is unknown. This research experimentally evaluates nine joint replenishment lot-sizing heuristics and policy design variables when implemented in a dynamic <b>rolling</b> <b>schedule</b> environment. The findings indicate that a single algorithm does excel on both dimensions of schedule cost and stability. Hence, management must trade off these two performance metrics when choosing the best approach for their specific problem. Generally, metaheuristics provide the best cost replenishment schedule, but forward pass based heuristics yield the most stable schedules. The results also indicate that the choice of lot-sizing heuristic is the major cost performance driver in rolling planning systems, with policy design variables (frozen interval and planning horizon length) having little impact.
