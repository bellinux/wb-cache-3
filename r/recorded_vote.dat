5|$|Wheeler {{presented}} the {{bill on the}} floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more questions, and the House approved the bill without a <b>recorded</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E

Both sides accused one another of subservience to the banking industry, the Social Credit League's sworn enemy. Baker, the board's sole Aberhart loyalist, travelled the province defending his premier; at one 4,000person meeting in Calgary, he was shouted down by angry supporters of the insurgency. A petition calling for Aberhart's resignation circulated among backbenchers, and {{proved to be a}} plant by the cabinet to test MLAs' loyalty. Outwardly, however, the Social Crediters showed a united front as they awaited the promised experts; in the first <b>recorded</b> <b>vote</b> after the legislature reconvened June7, all insurgents present voted with the government, though 13 were absent.|$|E

500|$|The House {{notified}} the Senate {{that it had}} passed S. 2080. [...] The Senate, considering the bill on July 15, could either agree to the House amendments or go to a conference committee, and after disgruntlement {{at some of the}} House amendments—the House had greatly expanded the membership of the Joint Commission on the Coinage, which was to make recommendations on useful changes—the Senate passed the House's version without a <b>recorded</b> <b>vote,</b> though Washington's Warren Magnuson requested that the record show him as voting against the bill. President Johnson enacted S. 2080 as the Coinage Act of 1965 with his signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E
500|$|The {{resolution}} {{was brought to}} the House floor on June7, 1924, when Luce asked that the House pass the legislation. [...] He had alluded in his report to the well-known Ralph Waldo Emerson poem [...] "Concord Hymn" [...] by including the phrase [...] "embattled farmers", a reference which Arkansas's Otis Wingo used as an excuse to deliver a lengthy speech on tariffs, accusing the Republican majority of harming the farmer. [...] Once Wingo had finished to applause from the Democratic side, the House passed the bill without a <b>recorded</b> <b>vote,</b> with Rogers presiding over the House {{in the absence of the}} Speaker. The {{resolution was}} transmitted to the Senate the same day and was referred to the Senate Appropriations Committee. On January5, 1925, the resolution was reported back to the Senate by Wyoming's Francis Warren, unamended, with the recommendation that it pass. Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas asked for the amount of the appropriation being made in the bill, and when told it was $15,000, had no additional questions. [...] The bill passed without opposition, and was enacted with the signature of President Coolidge on January14, 1925.|$|E
500|$|The bill, as amended, {{passed the}} Senate without <b>recorded</b> <b>vote</b> on March 27, 1936. [...] The House of Representatives {{received}} the bill on April 1, and referred {{it to the}} Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported back to the House on April 16, having been amended to require the Cleveland committee to purchase not less than 25,000 coins at one time, eliminating {{the possibility that the}} committee could order an initial 5,000 and then fail to purchase any more. The full House considered the bill on April 23, 1936, with the bill reported by John Joseph Cochran of Missouri as an emergency measure. When he asked for unanimous consent to pass the amended bill, Pennsylvania's Robert F. Rich asked how many coinage bills were going to be considered and if it would not be possible to consolidate a dozen of them into one bill. [...] Cochran replied that he had consulted with Ohio's Robert Crosser and been informed that [...] "if we do not get the authority to print the coins now it will be useless". The following day, Bulkley moved that the Senate concur in the House amendments, which it did, and the bill was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 5, 1936.|$|E

500|$|One {{topic of}} {{discussion}} was the bill's requirement that an eagle appear on larger U.S. coins. Linderman had requested an amendment to require that gold and silver coins bear a statement of their weight and fineness, which would mean sacrificing the eagle. California's Eugene Casserly opposed the amendment, which was sponsored by Sherman, stating [...] "it will hardly be possible {{to think of a}} half dollar or a quarter dollar as being such a coin without the eagle upon it". The eagle was saved when the amendment failed, 24 in favor and 26 against. Casserly was less successful with an amendment to remove entirely the reduced coinage charge of [...]2 percent, which failed. Sherman moved the bill along as quickly as he could, and it passed without a <b>recorded</b> <b>vote.</b> [...] The House initially refused to agree to the Trade dollar; representatives of both houses, led by Sherman and Potter, met in a conference committee, and the House acceded to the Senate amendment for the Trade dollar. The bill passed both houses without further debate, and was signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on February 12, 1873. At no point in its almost three-year journey through the legislative process did the bill provide for the retention of the standard silver dollar, into which depositors could have their bullion coined.|$|E
500|$|The House of Representatives {{debated the}} bill on July 13 and 14, 1965. The {{discussion}} was wide-ranging. Idaho Congressman Compton I. White opposed the bill, having prepared a chart showing the debasement of the Roman denarius between the years 1 and 300, though stating {{that he did}} not expect that coinage debasement would cause a government to fall. Nevada's Walter S. Baring noted that the Treasury was selling silver to the makers of cutlery and stated, [...] "I would rather eat with chopsticks than take the silver out of our coinage". Massachusetts' Silvio Conte denigrated Sir Thomas Gresham for illicit profits when the Royal Exchange in London was established, but conceded that Gresham's Law would nevertheless cause base metal coins to drive the silver ones from circulation. Iowa's Harold Gross asked Conte that if the U.S. was going to debase its coinage, why not go back to wampum. Minor amendments, including removing the mint mark from coinage for up to five years, were agreed to. There was objection to the committee amendment removing silver entirely from the half dollar; it was defeated 48—94, leaving the half dollar at 40 percent silver. Congressman James F. Battin of Montana offered an amendment to make the dime and quarter out of 40 percent silver; although Patman objected that the committee had rejected the idea, it initially passed 122—112. However, this was at the Committee of the Whole stage, and Patman got the House to reject the Battin amendment, 197—218. After other attempts were made in vain to derail the bill, the House Minority Leader, Michigan's Gerald R. Ford, asked that there be a <b>recorded</b> <b>vote</b> on H.R. 8926, and the bill passed, 255—151, Ford voting in favor. Patman then had the House amend the Senate bill, S. 2080, to reflect the House-passed language, and pass it.|$|E
2500|$|Voting within Congress {{can take}} many forms, {{including}} systems using lights and bells and electronic voting. Both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout [...] "aye" [...] or [...] "no" [...] and the presiding officer announces the result. The Constitution, however, requires a <b>recorded</b> <b>vote</b> if demanded by one-fifth of the members present. If the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial, a <b>recorded</b> <b>vote</b> usually happens. The Senate uses roll-call voting, in which a clerk calls out {{the names of all}} the senators, each senator stating [...] "aye" [...] or [...] "no" [...] when their name is announced. In the Senate, the vice president may cast the tie-breaking vote if present.|$|E

2500|$|When debate concludes, {{the motion}} in {{question}} is put to a vote. The Senate often votes by voice vote. The presiding officer puts the question, and Members respond either [...] "Yea/Aye" [...] (in favor of the motion) or [...] "Nay" [...] (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces {{the result of the}} voice vote. A senator, however, may challenge the presiding officer's assessment and request a <b>recorded</b> <b>vote.</b> The request may be granted only if it is seconded by one-fifth of the senators present. In practice, however, senators second requests for recorded votes as a matter of courtesy. When a <b>recorded</b> <b>vote</b> is held, the clerk calls the roll of the Senate in alphabetical order; senators respond when their name is called. Senators who were not in the chamber when their name was called may still cast a vote so long as the voting remains open. The vote is closed at the discretion of the presiding officer, but must remain open for a minimum of 15 minutes. If the vote is tied, the vice president, if present, is entitled to cast a tie-breaking vote. If the vice president is not present, the motion fails.|$|E

2500|$|A vote is held {{to resolve}} a {{question}} when it is put to the House of Representatives. The House first votes by voice vote; the Speaker or Deputy Speaker puts the question, and members respond either [...] "Aye" [...] (in favour of the motion) or [...] "No" [...] (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces {{the result of the}} voice vote, but if his or her assessment is challenged by any Member, a <b>recorded</b> <b>vote</b> known as a division follows. If a division does occur, members enter one of two lobbies (the [...] "Aye" [...] lobby or the [...] "No" [...] lobby) {{on either side of the}} chamber, where their names are recorded by clerks. At each lobby are two tellers (themselves members of Parliament) who count the votes of the Members. Once the division concludes, the tellers provide the results to the Speaker or Deputy Speaker, who then announces them to the House. If there is an equality of votes, the Speaker or Deputy Speaker has a casting vote.|$|E
2500|$|The {{budget was}} met with dissent by the Liberal and New Democratic parties and mostly {{positive}} reception from the Bloc.

[...] Because there were no speakers for the Opposition, the budget was declared passed with unanimous support and no <b>recorded</b> <b>vote</b> and thus forwarded to the Senate for approval.

2500|$|After {{receiving}} the proposal, the General Assembly enacted House Bill 3202 introduced by State Delegate William J.

However, the authority's taxing authority was short-lived. On February 28, 2008, the State Supreme Court ruled in Marshall v. Northern Virginia Transportation Authority [...] that the taxation authority granted to these non-elected bodies violated the Constitution of Virginia: The General Assembly also may not accomplish through Chapter 896 , indirectly, that which it is not empowered to do directly, namely, impose taxes on the citizenry {{in the absence of an}} affirmative, <b>recorded</b> <b>vote</b> of a majority of all members elected to each body of the General Assembly. Thus, by enacting Chapter 896 , the General Assembly has failed to adhere to the mandates of accountability and transparency that the Constitution requires when the General Assembly exercises the legislative taxing authority permitted by the Constitution. If payment of the regional taxes and fees is to be required by a general law, it is the prerogative and the function of the General Assembly, as provided by Article IV, Section 1 of the Constitution, to make that decision, in a manner which complies with the requirements of Article IV, Section 11 of the Constitution. The opinion did not find the existence of the HRTA (or the NVTA for that matter) to be unconstitutional, nor did it strike the authority of the regional authorities to impose tolling on the roadways.|$|E
