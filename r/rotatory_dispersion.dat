50|$|Optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> is the {{variation}} in the optical rotation of a substance with {{a change in the}} wavelength of light. Optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> can be used to find the absolute configuration of metal complexes. For example, when plane-polarized white light from an overhead projector is passed through a cylinder of sucrose solution, a spiral rainbow is observed perpendicular to the cylinder.|$|E

50|$|In {{order for}} a {{molecule}} (or crystal) to exhibit circular birefringence and circular dichroism, it must be distinguishable from its mirror image. An object that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image {{is said to be}} chiral, and optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> and circular dichroism are known as chiroptical properties. Most biological molecules have one or more chiral centers and undergo enzyme-catalyzed transformations that either maintain or invert the chirality at {{one or more of these}} centers. Still other enzymes produce new chiral centers, always with a high specificity. These properties account for the fact that optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> and circular dichroism are widely used in organic and inorganic chemistry and in biochemistry. In the absence of magnetic fields, only chiral substances exhibit optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> and circular dichroism. In a magnetic field, even substances that lack chirality rotate the plane of polarized light, as shown by Michael Faraday. Magnetic optical rotation is known as the Faraday effect, and its wavelength dependence is known as magnetic optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion.</b> In regions of absorption, magnetic circular dichroism is observable.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{techniques}} are Optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion,</b> vibrational circular dichroism {{and the use}} of chiral shift reagents in proton NMR and Coulomb Explosion Imaging.|$|E
50|$|The {{variation}} of specific rotation with wavelength is called optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD). ORD {{can be used}} in conjunction with computational methods to determine the absolute configuration of certain compounds.|$|E
50|$|When {{white light}} {{passes through a}} polarizer, the extent of {{rotation}} of light depends on its wavelength. Short wavelengths are rotated more than longer wavelengths, per unit of distance. Because the wavelength of light determines its color, the variation of color with distance through the tube is observed. This dependence of specific rotation on wavelength is called optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion.</b> In all materials the rotation varies with wavelength. The variation is caused by two quite different phenomena. The first accounts in most cases {{for the majority of}} the variation in rotation and should not strictly be termed <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion.</b> It depends on the fact that optical activity is actually circular birefringence. In other words, a substance which is optically active transmits right circularly polarized light with a different velocity from left circularly polarized light. In addition to this pseudodispersion which depends on the material thickness, there is a true <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> which depends on the variation with wavelength of the indices of refraction for right and left circularly polarized light. For wavelengths that are absorbed by the optically active sample, the two circularly polarized components will be absorbed to differing extents. This unequal absorption is known as circular dichroism. Circular dichroism causes incident linearly polarized light to become elliptically polarized. The two phenomena are closely related, just as are ordinary absorption and dispersion. If the entire optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> spectrum is known, the circular dichroism spectrum can be calculated, and vice versa.|$|E
5000|$|In general, the {{refractive}} index depends on wavelength (see dispersion) and the differential {{refractive index}} [...] {{will also be}} wavelength dependent. The resulting variation in rotation with the wavelength of the light is called optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD). ORD spectra and circular dichroism spectra are related through the Kramers-Kronig relations. Complete knowledge of one spectrum allows the calculation of the other.|$|E
5000|$|Aimé Auguste Cotton (9 October 1869 [...] - [...] 16 April 1951) was a French {{physicist}} {{known for}} his studies of the interaction of light with chiral molecules. In the absorption bands of these molecules, he discovered large values of optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD), or variation of optical rotation {{as a function of}} wavelength (Cotton effect), as well as circular dichroism or differences of absorption between left and right circularly polarized light.|$|E
5000|$|Extensive VCD {{studies have}} been {{reported}} for both polypeptides and several proteins in solution; several recent reviews were also compiled. An extensive but not comprehensive VCD publications list is also provided in the [...] "References" [...] section. The published reports over the last 22 years have established VCD as a powerful technique with improved results over those previously obtained by visible/UV circular dichroism (CD) or optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD) for proteins and nucleic acids.|$|E
50|$|The Cotton {{effect is}} the {{characteristic}} change in optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> and/or circular dichroism {{in the vicinity}} of an absorption band of a substance.In a wavelength region where the light is absorbed, the absolute magnitude of the optical rotation at first varies rapidly with wavelength, crosses zero at absorption maxima and then again varies rapidly with wavelength but in the opposite direction. This phenomenon was discovered in 1895 by the French physicist Aimé Cotton (1869 - 1951).|$|E
50|$|He {{supervised}} the thesis work of Georges Bruhat on circular dichroïsm and optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (1914). In 1917 {{he helped to}} found the Institut d'optique théorique et appliquée, now the École supérieure d'optique. In 1914, he proposed construction of a large electromagnet capable of producing intense magnetic fields. Work on the magnet finally started in 1924 in the Service des recherches et inventions at Bellevue, later the Laboratoire du magnétisme at Meudon-Bellevue, and finally the Laboratoire Aimé Cotton in his honour. Magnetic fields as high as to 7 teslas were attained.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of betaenone B was determined via {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (NMR), CD and optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD) measurements. While it was also shown that betaenone B could be converted to betaenone A by oxidation by PCC followed by exposure to base, it wasn't until 1988 that a semi-complete total synthesis was reported. Using 1,3-butadiene as a starting material, a stereoselective synthesis of (+/-)-4-de(3'-hydroxypropionyl) betanenone B was achieved in a 24-step synthesis. Bioactivity of this synthetic product was not tested and no further work on total synthesis of betaenones has been published since.|$|E
50|$|CD {{is closely}} related to the optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD) technique, and is {{generally}} considered to be more advanced. CD is measured in or near the absorption bands of the molecule of interest, while ORD can be measured far from these bands. CD's advantage is apparent in the data analysis. Structural elements are more clearly distinguished since their recorded bands do not overlap extensively at particular wavelengths as they do in ORD. In principle these two spectral measurements can be interconverted through an integral transform (Kramers-Kronig relation), if all the absorptions are included in the measurements.|$|E
50|$|As a {{graduate}} student at the physics laboratory of the École normale supérieure, he then prepared his doctoral thesis in physical sciences. In this thesis he studied the interactions of polarized light with optically active substances containing chiral molecules. In absorption bands of these substances, he found large variations of optical rotation as a function of wavelength, now known as optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD) or as the Cotton effect.He also discovered the related phenomenon of circular dichroism, or unequal absorption of left and right circularly polarized light. These two phenomena were later used to determine the stereochemistries of chiral molecules in organic chemistry and in biochemistry.|$|E

50|$|Although {{there is}} much overlap in the {{requirements}} and use of instruments, ordinary CD instruments are usually optimized for operation in the ultraviolet, approximately 170-300 nm, while MCD instruments are typically required {{to operate in the}} visible to near infrared, approximately 300-2000 nm. The physical processes that lead to MCD are substantively different from those of CD. However, like CD, it is dependent on the differential absorption of left and right hand circularly polarized light. MCD will only exist at a given wavelength if the studied sample has an optical absorption at that wavelength. This is distinctly different from the related phenomenon of optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD), which can be observed at wavelengths far from any absorption band.|$|E

50|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1919, Perucca reported an experiment which produced optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD) {{as a result}} of passing linearly polarized light through colored crystals of sodium chlorate. Perucca was attempting to replicate a nineteenth-century experiment (1860) in which amethyst exhibited optical activity in the visible light spectrum. He used a readily-available substitute for the amethyst. Sodium chlorate is chiral as a crystal, but in its natural (undyed) state is transparent and does not exhibit enhanced optical activity, so Perucca added an organic dye (an equilibrium racemic mixture of a triarylmethane textile dye then known as extra China blue). His goal was to see if addition of the organic dye on the crystalline structure would induce enhanced optical activity (rotation) of light in the 500-600 nm absorption band on the otherwise optically inactive dye.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} shown by Faraday that optical {{activity}} (the Faraday effect) could be induced in matter by a longitudinal magnetic field (a {{field in the}} direction of light propagation). The development of MCD really began in the 1930s when a quantum mechanical theory of MOR (magnetic optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion)</b> in regions outside absorption bands was formulated. The expansion of the theory to include MCD and MOR effects in the region of absorptions, which were referred to as “anomalous dispersions” was developed soon thereafter. There was, however, little effort made to refine MCD as a modern spectroscopic technique until the early 1960s. Since that time there have been numerous studies of MCD spectra for a very large variety of samples, including stable molecules in solutions, in isotropic solids, and in the gas phase, as well as unstable molecules entrapped in noble gas matrices. More recently, MCD has found useful application in the study of biologically important systems including metalloenzymes and proteins containing metal centers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961 {{he joined}} the faculty at University of California, San Diego as a Professor in the Department (now Division) of Biology. He {{initiated}} the landmark work on the conformation of membrane proteins in 1965, resulting in the publication of two foundational papers (Lenard, John and Singer, S.J. Protein conformation in cell membrane preparations as studied by optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> and circular dichroism. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 56, 1828-1835, 1966; Lenard, John and Singer, S. J. Structure of membranes: Reaction of red cell membranes with phospholipase C.

His seminal work on membrane proteins resulted {{in the development of}} the [...] "Fluid Mosaic Model" [...] of the cell membrane, published as [...] "The Fluid Mosaic Model of the Structure of Cell Membranes", in Science in 1972. He later made important discoveries on the interaction between the cytoskeleton and the cell membrane, resulting in, among other things, the identification of the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin and talin.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 2 ′- 5 ′-oligoguanylic acids are {{prepared}} by reacting G(cyclic) p with takadiastase T 1 ribonuclease and separating the products chromatographically. The 3 ′- 5 ′-oligoguanylic acids are obtained by separating {{the products of}} alkaline degradation of 3 ′- 5 ′-poly(G). The optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> and hypochromism of both 2 ′- 5 ′- and 3 ′- 5 ′-oligoguanylic acids are studied at two different pH. The optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> spectrum of 2 ′- 5 ′-GpG is significantly {{different from that of}} 3 ′- 5 ′-GpG. The magnitude of rotation of the long-wavelength peak of 2 ′- 5 ′-GpG is larger than that of 3 ′- 5 ′-GpG. This finding contradicts the explanation that the extra stability and more intense circular dichroism band of other 3 ′- 5 ′-dinucleoside monophosphates is due to H-bond formation between 2 ′-OH and either the base or the phosphate oxygen. The end phosphate group has a marked effect on the spectrum of GpG between 230 and 250 mμ. In addition the optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> spectra of 2 ′- 5 ′ exhibit strong pH, temperature, and solvent dependence between 230 and 250 mμ. ΔH and AS for order ⇌ disorder transition is estimated to be 9. 7 kcal/mole and 35. 2 eu, respectively. The optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> spectra of guanine-rich oligoribonucleotides, GpGpC, GpGpU, GpGpGpC, and GpGpGpU are compared to the calculated optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> from the semiempirical expression of Cantor and Tinoco, using measured optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> of dimers. Contrary to previous studies, agreement is found not at all satisfactory. However, optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> of 3 ′- 5 ′-GpGpGpC and GpGpGpU can be estimated from the semiempirical expression, if a next-nearest interaction parameter is introduced empirically. Such interaction parameter can be calculated from the measured properties of trinucleotide sequences like GpGpG, GpGpC, and GpGpU, assuming that only the nearest-neighbor interaction is important. The optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> of single-stranded poly(G) is also predicted. The importance of syn-anti equilibrium and next-nearest-neighbor interaction in oligoguanylic acids is suggested as a probable explanation...|$|E

Both TMV and the protein rods show anomalous <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The RNA shows a Cotton effect with an inflection point around 260 mμ, which is shifted to 272 mμ in concentrated urea solution. A suggested interpretation of the RNA <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> is given. The <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> of the protein subunits shows an incipient Cotton effect with an inflection point around 293 mμ and the beginnings of a large negative Cotton effect with a trough at 232 mμ. The dispersion data from the protein subunits can be interpreted to indicate that they contain between 25 and 35 per cent α-helix. On the basis of recent sequence investigations and the relationship between amino acid composition and polypeptide structure, the helical portion of the protein subunits can be located in the central section of the protein chain...|$|E

The optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> of glycide phenyl other has also been examined in some fourteen solvents in the visible region, and in othereal solution in the ultra-violet region. It is suggested that the effect temperature on the <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> of glycide phenyl other, both in the homogeneous state and in solution in n-butyl other, may be due to its existence {{in the form of a}} cyclic structure which is readily destroyed on raising the temperature...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{with the}} {{expression}} for optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> in the absorption region that was arrived at by Condon, two series were {{considered for the}} purpose of achieving the experimentally observed, steeper wavelength dependence in the absorption region while retaining the established 1 /λ 2 law in regions removed from absorption. The first two terms of one series in which the second term exhibits a 1 /λ 6 wavelength dependence were found to calculate satisfactorily the optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> curve of d-camphor- 10 -sulfonate from 400 mμ to 190 mμ when only three bands were considered. Evaluated at the extrema, the two-term expression can be approximated by a simple equation which allows calculation of the rotational strength of a nonoverlapping band by using only the wavelength and molar rotation of the extrema and the index of refraction of the solution. The rotational strengths calculated from optical <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> data in this manner closely agree with those calculated from corresponding circular dichroism data. Thus when position and magnitude of <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> extrema alone are reported for carbonyls, it is suggested that such published data may be converted to approximate rotational strengths...|$|E
