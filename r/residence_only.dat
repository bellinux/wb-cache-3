25|$|As part of {{immigration}} reform under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), {{as well as}} further reform enacted in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA), persons who are eligible and properly apply for permanent residence based on either a recent marriage to a U.S. citizen or as an investor are granted permanent <b>residence</b> <b>only</b> on a conditional basis, for two years. An exception to this rule {{is the case of}} a U.S. citizen legally sponsoring a spouse in which the marriage {{at the time of the}} adjustment of status (I-485) is more than two years old. In this case, the conditional status is waived and a 10-year Permanent Resident Card is issued upon USCIS approval of the case. A permanent resident under the conditional clause may receive an I-551 stamp as well as a Permanent Resident Card. The expiration date of the conditional period is two years from the approval date. The immigrant visa category is CR (conditional resident).|$|E

He shares the building with the Indiana General Assembly and the Supreme Court of Indiana. [...] The other elected executive officers, including the attorney general and the lieutenant governor, are also located in the statehouse, but most of the state's bureaus are located in the state office building. Traditionally, the governor lives in the Indiana Governor's Residence, also located in Indianapolis; however, former governor Mitchell Daniels' family maintained their private home, using the Governor's <b>Residence</b> <b>only</b> for official functions.|$|E
2500|$|Concerning {{the form}} and plan of the first monastery built near the chapel we have no information, nor is the exact form of the loggia or {{platforms}} built round the chapel itself, or of the choir for the brothers built behind it, known. Shortly after 1290, the chapel, which measured only about 5.5 by 3.2m, became entirely inadequate to accommodate the throngs of pilgrims. The altar piece, an Annunciation, was painted by the priest Hilarius of Viterbo in 1393. The monastery was at most the <b>residence,</b> <b>only</b> for a short time, of the ministers-general of the order after St. Francis. In 1415 it first became associated with the Regular Observance, {{in the care of}} which it remains to the present day.|$|E

2500|$|The American Civil War {{arrived in}} 1861 and Carlisle {{continued}} to have success in his many business ventures. [...] One of his cotton trading firms, Carlisle and Humphries, actually saw profits increase during the Union blockade. [...] His fortunes abruptly changed after the war, however, and his taxable property was valued at less than $20,000. [...] The Kenworthy Hall property itself was valued at only $9000 in 1867. [...] He entered into a business relationship in nearby Selma with his son, Edward Carlisle, Jr., and his son-in-law, Alexander Jones. [...] They went on to found the City National Bank in 1871. [...] Carlisle then died in 1873, leaving [...] the property to his wife, Lucinda, who divided her time between it and a home in Selma. [...] She increasingly used Kenworthy as a summer <b>residence</b> <b>only</b> {{and gave it to}} her only surviving child, Augusta Carlisle Jones, in 1899.|$|E

The Beloved of this one man, then, has had many incarnations--too many to describe in detail. Each shape, or embodiment, has been a temporary <b>residence</b> <b>only,</b> which she has entered, lived in awhile, and made her exit from, leaving the substance, so far as I have been concerned, a corpse, worse luck! Now, there is no spiritualistic nonsense in this--it is simple fact, put in the plain form that the conventional public are afraid of. So much for the principle.' ...|$|E
60|$|Some days since, {{the yacht}} had again {{appeared}} in the bay. Captain Bennydeck had landed, to all appearance in fairly good health; and had left by an early train for London. The sailing-master {{announced that he had}} orders to take the vessel back to her port--with no other explanation than that the cruise was over. This alternative in the Captain's plans (terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated) puzzled Randal. He called at his friend's private <b>residence,</b> <b>only</b> to hear from the servants that they had seen nothing of their master. Randal waited a while in London, on the chance that Bennydeck might pay him a visit.|$|E

6000|$|But I {{must go on}} with my story. I went {{straight}} to General Grant's headquarters,--just a plain, rough slat house such as a contractor might build for a temporary <b>residence.</b> <b>Only</b> the high flagstaff and the Stars and Stripes distinguish it from many others of the same kind. A group of officers stood chatting outside of it, {{and they told me}} that the General had walked over to get his mail. He is just as unassuming and democratic as [...] "my general." [...] General Rankin took me into the office, a rude room, and we sat down at the long table there. Presently the door opened, and a man came in with a slouch hat on and his coat unbuttoned. He was smoking a cigar. We rose to our feet, and I saluted.|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} render the minutes shorter, and, {{possibly}} in indulgence to a powerful propensity to talk, of which he who wielded the needle was somewhat the subject, but few of the passing moments were suffered to escape without a word from {{one or the other}} of the parties. As the subject of their discourse had a direct reference to the principal matter of our tale, we shall take leave to give such portions of it to the reader as we deem most relevant to a clear exposition of that which is to follow. The latter will always bear in mind, that he who worked was a man drawing into the wane of life; that he bore about him the appearance of one who, either from incompetency or from some fatality of fortune, had been doomed to struggle through the world, keeping poverty from his <b>residence</b> <b>only</b> by the aid of great industry and rigid frugality; and that the idler was a youth of an age and condition that the acquisition of an entire set of habiliments formed to him a sort of era in his adventures.|$|E
60|$|Three {{years after}} their return to England they {{received}} the news that Kate Mitford had changed her name, and was installed as mistress at The Glade. Every five years Wilfrid and his wife, and {{as time went on}} his family, paid a visit to England. He became one of the leading men of the colony. A few years after his marriage Mr. and Mrs. Mitford had returned to England for good, and James Allen and Wilfrid succeeded to his business as a trader, and carried it on with energy and success, Mr. Atherton advancing Wilfrid sufficient capital to enable them to extend their business largely. In time The Glade became Wilfrid's summer <b>residence</b> <b>only,</b> the head-quarters of the firm being established at Napier. It is now conducted by his sons, he himself having returned home with his wife and daughters with a fortune amply sufficient to enable them to live at ease. Marion was pleased when, two years after her arrival in England, she heard from Wilfrid that Bob Allen had married the daughter of an officer settled on the Mohaka. The Grimstones both did well, and became prosperous farmers. Jack remained in Wilfrid's service until he left the colony, and is now a trusted agent of his sons in their dealings with the natives.|$|E
