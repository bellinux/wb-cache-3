5|$|Should {{a patient}} be {{transferred}} to an assisted living facility, nursing home, or hospital, the hospice would continue to provide care to the patient which is on par with the services provided under the routine home care benefit. In this way, {{the only difference between}} <b>respite</b> and routine care is that the hospice pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a patient receive <b>respite</b> in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to what other patients of the hospice unit receive. <b>Respite</b> is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E
5|$|A <b>respite</b> was {{provided}} in the early 1970s, when Margaret Thatcher, the Conservative Education Secretary, raised the level of grant, which had been lowered by the Labour government.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius {{notes that}} this event marked the {{beginning}} of a temporary <b>respite</b> from persecution. Although the precise dating of this <b>respite</b> is not specifically noted by Eusebius, the text of the Martyrs records no Palestinian martyrs between July 25, 308 and November 13, 309. The political climate probably impinged on persecutory policy here: This was the period of the conference of Carnuntum, which met in November 308. Maximinus probably spent the next few months in discussion with Galerius over his role in the imperial government, and did not have the time to deal with the Christians.|$|E

40|$|The {{needs of}} {{families}} carying for seniors suffering by dementia. The needs of families carying for old persons with dementia are serious social issue. The goal of my bachelor s {{work is to}} describe those needs {{with respect to their}} fulfilment by the field <b>respiting</b> care of Czech alzheimer society (later ČALS). I try to investigate if carying families know their needs and how are their needs fulfilled by the field <b>respiting</b> care. I ve chosen the field <b>respiting</b> care provided by ČALS. I ve organised four personal sessions with families members carying for the senior with dementia. On the basis of sessions I have established specific needs of families members carying for this kind of seniors and I have described how were their needs fulfilled by the field <b>respiting</b> care by ČALS. There are enclosures {{at the end of my}} work containing literal transcritions of all four sessions, description and characteristic of involved persons. My work discovery allows another point of view of carying persons needs by care providers...|$|R
5|$|Van Gogh found <b>respite</b> {{and relief}} in {{interaction}} with nature. When {{the series of}} olive tree paintings was made in 1889 he was subject to illness and emotional turmoil, yet the paintings {{are considered to be}} among his finest works.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of U.S. naval interdiction efforts in coastal waters, known as Operation Market Time, the trail had to do double duty. Materiel sent from the north was stored in caches in the border regions that were soon retitled Base Areas, which, in turn, became sanctuaries for NLF and PAVN forces seeking <b>respite</b> and resupply after conducting operations within South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The 2016–2017 season {{provided}} some much-needed <b>respite</b> for beleaguered BWFC fans, as the club successfully achieved promotion from League One {{at the first}} attempt. New manager Phil Parkinson was instrumental in this, working despite an ongoing transfer embargo, emerging youth star Zach Clough being sold, and ownership disputes between Holdsworth and Ken Anderson.|$|E

50|$|According to the Office of the Pardon Attorney (U.S. Department of Justice), {{presidents have}} {{utilized}} <b>respites</b> {{to varying degrees}} although, {{as is the case}} with every other form of executive clemency, there has been something like a general decline since 1900. The Pardon Attorney has posted data for <b>respites</b> for some administrations.Most recently, Bill Clinton delayed the execution of Juan Garza in order that an ongoing study of bias in the federal death-penalty system might be completed.|$|R

5|$|The British thus {{gained a}} <b>respite,</b> and peace lasted {{at least until}} the time Gildas was writing: that is, for perhaps forty or fifty years, from around the end of the 5th century until midway through the sixth. Shortly after Gildas's time the Anglo-Saxon advance was resumed, and by the late 6th century nearly all of {{southern}} England was {{under the control of the}} continental invaders.|$|E
5|$|The Wolverines {{recorded}} 15 sides for Gennett Records between February and October 1924. The titles {{revealed a}} tough and well-formed cornet talent. His lip had toughened from earlier, more tentative years; on {{nine of the}} Wolverines' recorded titles he proceeds commandingly from lead to opening solo without any need for a <b>respite</b> from playing.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and <b>respite</b> care, if needed. (<b>Respite</b> care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E

5|$|Ender, now {{ten years}} old, is {{promoted}} to Command School on Eros {{after a brief}} <b>respite</b> on Earth. After some preliminary battles in the simulator, he is introduced to a former war hero, Mazer Rackham. From now on, Ender participates in simulations created and controlled by Mazer. As the skirmishes become harder, he is joined by {{some of his friends}} from the Battle School as sub-commanders. Despite this, Ender becomes depressed by the battles, his isolation, and by the way Mazer treats him.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small <b>respite</b> not capitalized as much as it could have been.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{tensions}} {{were growing}} between the North and South over various issues including slavery. The Wilmot Proviso, introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, {{it would have}} banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 brought a temporary <b>respite,</b> but the Dred Scott case, decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1857, spurred public debate. Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that African Americans had no standing as citizens under the constitution. Northerners were outraged and there was increasing talk in the South of secession from the Union.|$|E

5|$|Ladd's group {{soon found}} their {{business}} expertise {{in other areas}} did not apply as well to the iron industry. Their lack of experience, coupled with a dispute over water rights, caused the company to close in 1869. After a brief <b>respite</b> in which they filled an order for iron wheels for the Central Pacific Railroad from 1874 to 1876, the company closed for good in 1878 and the assets were sold off at a sheriff's auction.|$|E
5|$|Ridership on the Mountaineer {{over its}} two-year {{probationary}} period was disappointing: 58,991 in 1975 and 53,400 in 1976. Averaged over a 365-day year, this was 161 passengers {{per day in}} 1975 and 146 in 1976. By 1977 daily ridership had dwindled to 35. Monetary losses were far higher than expected: $5.7 million in FY1975 and $14.9 million in FY1976. After a brief <b>respite,</b> Amtrak discontinued the Mountaineer on May 31, 1977. A new train, the Hilltopper, operated {{over much of the}} same route until 1979.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Redding's departure, Hendrix began lodging at the eight-bedroom Ashokan House, in {{the hamlet}} of Boiceville near Woodstock in upstate New York, {{where he had}} spent some time vacationing in mid-1969. Manager Michael Jeffery {{arranged}} the accommodations {{in the hope that}} the <b>respite</b> might encourage Hendrix to write material for a new album. During this time, Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery, which included Hendrix's first appearance on U.S. TV—on The Dick Cavett Show—where he was backed by the studio orchestra, and an appearance on The Tonight Show where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy.|$|E

5|$|St Dunstan's—the charity that {{provides}} support, rehabilitation, and <b>respite</b> care to blind ex-service personnel of the British Armed Forces—is named after him, as are many churches {{all over the}} world. St Dunstan's, Mayfield, St Dunstan's, Stepney, St Dunstan-in-the-East, London, and St Dunstan-in-the-West, London are four of the more well known in Britain. The church at the junction of London Road and Whitstable Road gives {{its name to the}} neighbourhood of Canterbury on the north bank of the River Stour.|$|E
5|$|The {{final month}} of the war offered little <b>respite</b> to the battalion. In {{the days leading up}} to the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the Liverpool Scottish helped to secure {{numerous}} villages without opposition and crossed the River Scheldt on 9 November. On the day of the Armistice, the Liverpool Scottish was situated at Villers-Notre-Dame. With the 165th and 166th brigades, the battalion had been readied to assault German positions obstructing passage into the town of Ath. Such a prospect was averted, however, when the 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers attacked and seized one of the bridges before it could be demolished.|$|E
5|$|With its putting green, skeet range, {{and view}} of South Mountain and the Gettysburg Battlefield, it offered President Eisenhower a much-needed <b>respite</b> from the {{pressures}} of Washington. It was also a successful cattle operation, with a show herd of black Angus cattle. Some of the more notable of Eisenhower's guests were Premier Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, President Charles de Gaulle of France, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Britain, and Governor Ronald Reagan of California.|$|E
5000|$|The pardon {{power of}} the United States Constitution has been broadly {{interpreted}} to include a variety of specific powers.

5000|$|Barrow and Greenwood were {{returned}} to the Clink in 1593. It was resolved to proceed on a capital charge of [...] "devising and circulating seditious books." [...] As the law then stood, {{it was easy to}} secure a conviction. They were tried and sentenced to death on 23 March 1593. The day after sentence they were brought out as if for execution and <b>respited.</b> On 31 March they were taken to the gallows, and after the ropes had been placed about their necks were again <b>respited.</b> Finally they were hanged early on the morning of 6 April. There is some evidence that the Lord Treasurer Burghley endeavoured to save their lives, and was frustrated by Whitgift and other bishops.|$|R
