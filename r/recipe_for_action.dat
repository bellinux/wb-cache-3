This work examines a series of mining-related dream narratives {{as a means of}} gauging how a community of New Guinean artisanal and small-scale gold miners understands the nature of minerals and their place in the cosmos, and how this cosmological outlook informs the ways they operate qua resource extractors. Through a "structural-metaphorical" analysis of the symbolic themes and ethnographic context of Hamtai-Anga "gold dreaming, " my thesis demonstrates that the miners of Kaindi conceptualise resource extraction in terms of a set of collaborative, procreative, and nurturing relations of "marriage" and of "affinity" between themselves, their spirit familiars, and the masalai (or guardian spirits) of the mines. According to this complex "holography of meaning", the miners are able to "generate”, “exercise, " and "make apparent" their extractive efficacy through a relational and elicitive engagement with their gendered "other"- or, in other words, by means of their capacity to make their female spirit familiars "fall in love" with them, "procreate" minerals like women procreate children, procure gold as wives provide garden food, and link them to the spirits of the mines as women link men to their in-laws. In order to secure and maintain their elicitive power, however, the miners must "enact" this metaphor by "behaving like" "good husbands" and "good affines" towards their familiars and the spirits of the mines. In turn, this means that the tropic conceptualisation of mining as conjugality and affinity with the masalai is a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> imbued with its own intrinsic morality. This morality, moreover, is itself of an essentially holographic nature. Indeed, not only does it entail analogous normative structures at different "orders" of scale (that is both at the "microcosmic" "level" of interaction between the miners and their human spouses and affines, and in the "macrocosmic" plane of exchange between humans, spirit familiars, and spirits of the mines) but, as is revealed in my thesis, the two "orders" at which it unfolds are actually part of a single whole, so that the flow of analogy at the "macrocosmic" "level" has crucial implications for its "microcosmic" counter-flow, and vice-versa. Funding was obtained from Brunel University and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) ...|$|E

40|$|The models, schemas, {{recipes and}} mantras, which leaders of change {{bring to the}} {{projects}} they manage, are relatively little understood. Here {{the nature of these}} structures is explored from the perspective of mental model theory. The positive potential of simplified representations of business problems is contrasted with the negative value of certain long-cherished and counterproductive <b>recipes</b> <b>for</b> <b>action.</b> It is suggested that many managers, when initially questioned {{about the nature of the}} cognitive structures they bring to their work, tend to make excessive claims for the stability and internal consistency of their personal repertoire of available material. The popular distinction between tacit models, as “undiscussable and indescribable” phenomena (Argyris and Schön 1996), is compared with a more dialogic view of managers as men and women subject to frequent changes of stance as they engage with significant colleagues. Simple links between personality types or cognitive style and mental models in use are challenged and it is suggested that a leader’s repertoire of models and heuristics is often extended well beyond the zones of comfort that ma...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Multi-agent {{activities}} {{often require}} negotiation. We propose {{a way to}} construct exible negotiation protocols, based on dialogue games, originally developed for the description of human dialogue [1]. The rules of a dialogue game function as a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> joint <b>action.</b> A particular type of a dialogue game, an initiative-response pair, denes minimal well-formed interactions [6]. From such basic exchanges larger dialogues can be constructed coherently. The notion of `uptake' [2] is crucial in this respect. By making an initiative, an agent invites other participants to respond in a particular way. An initiative is often ambiguous. There are dierent ways the responder can take up the challenge. Thus the interaction is jointly determined by the participants. 2. FLEXIBLE NEGOTIATION For each agent a negotiation is dened by a protocol { the rules of interaction { and a strategy { a directive for deciding between diere...|$|R
40|$|The alleged {{opposition}} between dialogue games and plans and goals as {{approaches to the}} study of natural language dialogue is false; the two approaches are complementary. On the one hand, plans and goals may function as a semantics to interaction patterns studied as dialogue games. On the other hand, dialogue games are `compiled-out' <b>recipes</b> <b>for</b> joint <b>action.</b> This claim is illustrated by a dialogue model for inquiry and transaction that uses aspects of both approaches. 1. Introduction Dialogue models of a more or less formal nature are needed for the design and evaluation of natural language dialogue systems. With respect to such models `dialogue engineers' can design a system for a particular application and later assess its performance with respect to the specifications (Hulstijn, 2000; Bernsen et al., 1998). Three aspects need to be modeled: the information structure of the objects and attributes that {{play a role in the}} application domain, the task structure of the available action [...] ...|$|R
