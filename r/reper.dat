40|$|AbstractOver {{the recent}} years, {{the region of}} Ouargle has {{registered}} remarkable entropic and natural anarchy. This drastic evolution produced an important contamination of the shallow aquifer by pollutants. This region was being subjected {{to a large degree}} of vulnerability favorized by waste water discharges (domestic and irrigation). These factors expose the shallow aquifer water to a severe pollution. To assess this pollution, regular monitoring of water quality was conducted (February 2009, 2010, 2011 period). The obtained results show that the groundwater is non-potable for human consumption. Consequently a severe irrigation risk threatening plants and soil is then established. The determination of organic pollution index (OPI) has been evaluated by plotting its evolution map over the region of Ouargla.

40|$|Summary. We shall {{describe}} n-dimensional spaces {{with the}} <b>reper</b> operation [7, pages 72 – 79]. An inspiration to such approach {{comes from the}} monograph [9] and so-called Leibniz program. Let us recall that the Leibniz program is a program of algebraization of geometry using purely geometric notions. Leibniz formulated his program in opposition to algebraization method developed by Descartes. The Euclidean geometry in Szmielew’s approach [9] is a theory of structures 〈S; �,⊕,O〉, where 〈S; �,⊕,O 〉 is Desarguesian midpoint plane and O ⊆ S × S × S is the relation of equi-orthogonal basis. Points o, p,q are in relation O if they form an isosceles triangle with the right angle in vertex a. If we fix vertices a, p, then there exist exactly two points q,q ′ such that O(apq), O(apq ′). Moreover q ⊕ q ′ = a. In accordance with the Leibniz program we replace the relation of equi-orthogonal basis by a binary operation ∗ : S ×S → S, called the <b>reper</b> operation. A standard model for the Euclidean geometry in the above sense is the oriented plane over the field of real numbers with the <b>reper</b> operations ∗ defined by the condition: a∗b = q iff the point q {{is the result of}} rotating of p about right angle around the center a...|$|E

40|$|Invasive {{fungal infections}} are devastating. Despite {{state-of-the-art}} antifungal therapy, the mortality rates for invasive infections {{with the three}} most common species of human fungal pathogens are Candida albicans, 20 %– 40 % [1]; Aspergillus fumigatus, 50 %– 90 % [1]; and Cryptococcus neoformans, 20 %– 70 % [2]. Although invasive fungal infections can affect people with intact immune systems, {{the vast majority of}} disease occurs in the setting of an immunocom-promised host. As discussed recently, the dismal outcomes for invasive fungal infections cannot be completely attributed to a lack of efficacious antifungal drugs [3]. However, because most patients with invasive fungal infections are immunocompromised, the immune system cannot effectively assist in the clearance of the infection, and consequently, the success of treatment is more dependent on the efficacy of the antifungal agent than in the setting of an immunocompetent host.

This continuum of flow and the homeostasis of brain perfusion balanced by collaterals may be captured with serial imaging.

40|$|Production ofautoantibodies {{specific}} for the Fc region ofautolo-gous IgG, called rheumatoid factors (RF), is {{a characteristic}} finding {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To study the requirements regulating the synthesis of these autoantibodies, we have cloned human helper T cells and co-cultured them with purified B cells. To mimic cognate T-B cell interaction, we have used bacterial superantigens that function by cross-linking HLA molecules on the B cell with selected T cell receptor (TCR) molecules expressing a particular polymorphism of the Vfl gene segment. Data presented here demonstrate that the staphylococcal enterotoxin D (SE D), but not other bacterial superantigens, exhibits an ability to induce IgM, IgG, and espe-cially RF production, in B cells from RA patients and normal individuals. Comparison with the polyclonal antibody produc-tion in B cell cultures driven by anti-CD 3 -stimulated T cell clones confirmed that SE D shifted the repertoire of secreted antibodies toward immunoglobulins with Fc binding specificity, suggesting that SE D preferentially stimulates RF+ B lympho-cytes. B cells {{with the potential to}} secrete RF were highly fre-quent in RA patients, requiring as few as 150 peripheral B cells/culture to detect RF in the culture supernatants. SE D-in-duced RF synthesis was strictly dependent on the presence of selected CD 4 +T helper cells and required a direct membrane contact between B cells and T helper cells.

To understand the mechanism, we determined the early signaling events of oxidative stress. With 200 M H 2 O 2, {{the activity of}} p 70 S 6 kinase- 1 (p 70 S 6 K 1) increased at 30 min and reached a plateau at 90 min. Dose-response studies at the 60 min time point show that p 70 S 6 K 1 activity reached its highest level with 150 M H 2 O 2. Increased p 70 S 6 K 1 activity correlated with phosphorylation of Thr 389 and Thr 421 /Ser 424 residues, sug-gesting the involvement of an upstream kinase. Phosphoinosi-tide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) activity was elevated by 5 min, reached a plateau at 10 min, and remained more than 6 -fold induced for at least 60 min after 200 M H 2 O 2 exposure. The dose-re-sponse studies at 10 min found that 150 M H 2 O 2 induced the highest PI 3 K activity. Increased PI 3 K activity correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the 85 -kDa regulatory subunit. In-activating PI 3 K with wortmannin prevented H 2 O 2 from inducing Thr 389 phosphorylation and p 70 S 6 K 1 activation. Wortmannin and rapamycin prevented H 2 O 2 from inducing increases in cell volume and protein content. The antineoplastic drugs doxoru-bicin and daunorubicin also induced significant enlargement of cardiomyocytes at 10 to 100 nM dose range. Although the glutathione synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine potenti-ated the effect of doxorubicin and H 2 O 2, the antioxidant N-ace-tylcysteine prevented induction of cell enlargement. Our data suggest that oxidative stress induces activation of PI 3 K, which leads to p 70 S 6 K 1 activation and enlargement of cell size.

The analysis of TG 5 genotype frequency in the examined populations reveals that the animals have significant (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05) potential for increased taste and nutritional qualities of beef associated with a high proportion of desirable TT genotype, probably related to the foreign origin of the cattle. There were no carriers of the BB genotype of LEP genes in the examined populations. Significant (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05) dependence between the studied SNP in TG 5 and the rates of total body fat, the proportion of adipose tissue in the morphological carcass composition (or meat composition), and the content of intramuscular fat in the longissimus, as well as the correlation between the studied SNP in LEP and the rates of raw visceral fat, and fat outcome, were established.

During reconnaissance of a wide area of the Majic hillfort, in its northern part with isolated artificial plateau a variety of fragments of pottery vessels were found. Most of the collected fragments are atypical, without elements that would serve their accurate cultural and chronological attribution. But one fragment stands out above all by its ornamental characteristics, a vessel neck fragment decorated with impressed complex textile pattern. Its macroscopic analysis shows a decorating technique which includes impression of twisted double cords (newer version of decorating schnur technique). The motifs include a combination of corrugated and horizontally laid prints. In the observed cultural region, such decorations are closely related to Litzen technique of decoration. In the analysis of primarily ornamental features of the observed fragments we find its closest analogy to the Posusje culture, precisely its Sovici phase (the site known as a Triple hillfort). Chronologically, it refers to {{the second half of the}} Early and the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age (Reinecke: Br. A 2 - Br. B 1). Further evidence that favors the setting of a relative chronological frame was obtained in the exploration of multilayer sites Pod A 2 and Varvara A 3. Original basic Litzen decorating technique cannot be verified within the cultural space of the region. It is therefore assumed that it was brought from the north, i. e. from its indigenous space. As the most likely direction of the Litzen decoration spreading to the south is the north-south direction, while we currently do not have enough reliable data on the reconstruction of the mechanisms and the nature of the Litzen decoration spread, due to a find is without stratigraphic confirmation.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of PAF antagonist on reperfusion injury of warm ischemic lung after autotransplantation. Twenty-four mongrel dogs were subjected to this experiment in which left thoracotomy and complete left hilar stripping and autotransplantation of the left lung were performed. The dogs were divided into two groups. In group A (n= 12), the left lung with complete hilar stripping and autotransplantation was kept in a warm ischemic condition for 90 min. Group B (n= 12) underwent the same manipulation as group A, but was administered PAF antagonist (CV- 6209, 0. 1 mg/kg) before reperfusion. To evaluate {{the function of}} the left lung, arterial blood gas, aortic pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, cardiac output, left extravascular lung water (lt-EVLW), and left pulmonary arteriolar resistance were measured under the occlusion of the right pulmonary artery before operation and 15 min, 60 min, 120 min after reperfusion. Lipoperoxide (LPO) and PAF concentration in the left atrium were measured under the occlusion of the right pulmonary artery before operation and 120 min after reperfusion. The measurement of EVLW was performed by the thermal sodium double indicator dilution technique. The results obtained were as follows. 1) PaO? was 116. 0 ± 49. 2 mmHg with 100 %Fio? 120 min after reperfusion in group A, whereas it was maintained at as high as 441. 1 ± 105. 6 mmHg in group B. 2) The values of lt-EVLW measured in right pulmonary arterial occlusion were extremely well correlated with those of both lung EVLW (r= 0. 701, p< 0. 002). 3) The left pulmonary arteriolar resistance was almost normal throughout the experiment in group B, but they gradually elevated in group A during the experiments. 4) The PAF concentration of group B was significantly lower than that of group A at 120 min after <b>reper</b> fusion. 5) Histologically, group B lungs clearly appeared in better condition than group A lungs. In these experimental studies, the following conclusions were made. These data indicate that one of the most important factors of reimplantation response at the time of this acute phase was PAF-in- duced lung injury. PAF produced by many stimuli (hilar stripping, ischemic and reperfusion injury, and surgical trauma) is also an important factor of reimplantation response. PAF also shows vari ous bioactions, such as hypotension, constriction of smooth muscle, cardiac effects and an increase of vascular permeability.
