40|$|ABSTRACT: Structural {{analysis}} for a base isolated four storied moment resisting frame with elastomeric seismic isolation bearing {{has been studied}} using SAP 2000 software. Dynamic analysis was performed for the moment resisting frame with base isolation {{and the results were}} compared with the results obtained for moment resisting frame without base isolation. The isolating elastomer is a rubber and its total stiffness is calculated to be 3169 kN/m. The spectral displacement for the first mode suffered by the isolated building was calculated using the response spectrum curve, and found to be 0. 121 m/sec 2. The thickness of required rubber material is calculated to be 0. 121 m, assuming 100 % maximum shear strain. The analysis showed that the displacement in the frame has decreased when the base isolator is added. This means that the force transferred to the building is reduced due to the presence of base isolator. The frame with base isolator produced a shear of 71. 79 kN – a significant shear reduction of around 88 %. Thus, using <b>rubber</b> <b>elastomer</b> for base isolation, it is possible to avoid large plastic deformation of moment resisting frame and reduce shear resulting from large scale earthquake...|$|E

To analyze the RME construction work need to know elastomer mechanical modules. In work it is offered to define factor of Poisson's ratio from experiments on axial compression of multilayered packages from thin-layer elastomer layer. To exclude influence of ruggedness of experimental installation on the indication of devices, it is offered to select number of layers in a package and geometrical parameters elastomer layers so that deposit of a layer at the expense of change of its form and compressibility elastomer, were one order. For processing of experimental data it is offered to use analytical decisions ("force-settlement") for a package from thin elastomer layers.

40|$|In recent years, {{exploratory}} research on soft materials and their mechanism {{has been gaining}} in popularity. The investigations on soft materials are mostly done for two reasons: (a) to develop an anthropomorphic/prosthetic hand or soft hand with human skin-like material to perform soft manipulations and (b) to develop soft actuators. This paper presented a comprehensive investigation into researches on soft materials for robotic applications. The primary interest of using soft materials is not to leave any marks or damage to objects during the manipulation. The other advantage would be stable grasping due to an area contact. Natural rubber, synthetic <b>rubber,</b> <b>elastomer,</b> polymer composite and nanoparticulated polymer composite are some existing soft materials. Extensive research is required to prepare a highstrength but lighter soft material for robotic soft manipulation. Human skin and its mechanical properties are initially discussed. In addition, the need of soft material for soft manipulations and observations from previous researches {{over the past few}} decades, modelling of non-linear hyperelastic/ viscoelastic materials and characterization are discussed.

40|$|Purpose: The current {{vitreous}} substitutes such as silicone oil, heavy silicone oil, and polymeric gels {{that are}} directly injected into vitreous cavity frequently cause severe intraocular complications. There {{is a very}} urgent {{need to find a}} more suitable artificial vitreous substitute for pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) surgery. Methods: We have devised a novel capsular artificial vitreous using tailor-made silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>elastomer.</b> The novel device was implanted into the vitreous cavity of rabbit after PPV and the eye was examined by ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, and tonometry during an 8 -week treatment period. B-scan ultrasonography, electroretinogram (ERG), and histological studies by light microscopy were also performed at the end of 8 weeks. Results: The novel artificial vitreous body consists of a thin vitreous-like capsule with a silicone tube-valve system. The capsule can be folded and implanted into vitreous cavity through 1. 5 mm incision on sclera. Physiological balanced solution (PBS) was then injected into the capsule and inflated to support retina and control intraocular pressure (IOP) through the tube-valve system subsequently fixed under the conjunctiva. Experiments using rabbits showed that the novel vitreous body could effectively support the retina and apparently induced no significant pathological changes in the eye over 8 weeks. Conclusion: This approach may provide a new research strategy in the vitreous replacement technology. The novel artificial vitreous body device can effectively support retina, control IOP, and has good biocompatibility. It may be a good alternative to injecting artificial vitreous although its tamponade properties and usefulness still have to be proven in complex vitreoretinal diseases. School of Optometr...|$|E

40|$|Acrylonitrile-butadiene <b>rubber</b> <b>elastomers</b> {{are widely}} used in seal and tire industries. Physiochemical, surface and {{tribological}} properties of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exposed to a lubricant in a sealed mechanical contact may gradually change, in particular, at elevated temperatures. In this study, industrial-grade acrylonitrile-butadiene <b>rubber</b> <b>elastomers</b> were aged in two model non-additivated base oils, namely non-polar hexadecane and polar diethylene glycol dibutyl ether at both ambient (298 [*]K) and elevated (398 [*]K) temperatures from 1 to 168 [*]h. Mass changes of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber before and after ageing indicated that acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber had distinct ageing dynamics in different model base oils and at different temperatures. For acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber aged in nonpolar hexadecane, the rate of weight loss of the rubber was larger at 398 [*]K compared to that at 298 [*]K. On the contrary, distinct weight-gaining (swelling) dynamics were observed for acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber aged in polar diethylene glycol dibutyl ether at 298 and 398 [*]K. Based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, liquid and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses, {{it was found that}} aldehydes and sulfur- and zinc-containing compounds were leached out from acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber aged in both hexadecane and diethylene glycol dibutyl ether. The results of tribological studies showed that the non-aged acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber has a good wear-resistance. Acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber samples had a very similar surface topography before and after tribo-tests. However, the worn surfaces of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber samples were characterized by fine scoring (abrasion) marks after ageing in both model base oils. This has been attributed to changes in the steel–rubber contact environment during the sliding process and degradation of mechanical properties of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber after ageing. For one acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber sample (after ageing in hexadecane at 398 [*]K), very stable friction in the steel–rubber contact was observed...|$|R
