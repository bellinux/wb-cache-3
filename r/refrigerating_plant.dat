Unfortunately, this conversion proved to be impracticable and too expensive and they were modified exclusively for service as tenders at a cost of between $41,022 to $110,963.

40|$|The {{entry into}} force of the EU F-Gas Regulation 2014 pushes European Countries to use natural refrigerants. Carbon dioxide (R 744) {{is one of the}} most {{promising}} long-term alternatives to the currently employed refrigerants in commercial refrigeration. On the other hand, the use of CO 2 supermarket refrigeration systems in warm climates requires specific technical solutions to make them competitive with conventional HFC-based plants. In the European market, different layouts have been currently proposed, which have been mainly derived from the basic booster configuration. In this paper, the performance of a commercial CO 2 refrigeration solution employing medium temperature (MT) overfed evaporators, a CO 2 refrigeration configuration using parallel compression and the system which combines both of the previously technologies were theoretically compared. Three different warm climate locations were selected, i. e. Rome (Italy), Valencia (Spain) and Seville (Spain). The results showed that the benefits deriving from a higher evaporating temperature in the MT display counters, allowed by overfed evaporators, outweighed those related to parallel compression.
