5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E

5|$|Some {{birds have}} also {{demonstrated}} {{the capacity to}} fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative {{to the outside of}} the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals. Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.|$|E

5|$|The health <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> {{with nuclear}} {{materials}} have also featured prominently in Australian anti-nuclear campaigns.

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

5|$|Health {{issues in}} American {{football}} comprise {{a large number}} of health <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with participating in the sport. Injuries are relatively common in American football, due to its nature as a full-contact game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players can be at a greater risk, while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include strains, sprains, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of mental illnesses like dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In individual leagues like the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a public injury report is published containing all injured players on a team, their injury and the game-day status of each player.|$|E
5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2â€“20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E
5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood.

Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies tend to be the need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E

5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> to them.|$|E
5|$|There are {{side effects}} and <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with the {{smallpox}} vaccine.

Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time. Based on past experience, it is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198 percent) who receive the vaccine may die as a result, most often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or severe necrosis in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia).|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes AlfvÃ©n identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As AlfvÃ©n suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E

5|$|Brendan Finucane {{was born}} on 16 October 1920, the first child of Thomas and Florence Finucane of 13 Rathmines Road, Rathmines, Dublin, Ireland. His mother was English, {{originally}} from Leicester. Her mother had travelled across Canada {{at a young age}} and Florence moved to Dublin to seek her own adventure. She accepted the <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with living in the city. In 1919, she met Thomas Andrew Finucane, who had been involved in the Irish Rebellion. Thomas Finucane had been taught mathematics at college by Ã‰amon de Valera, leader of the Irish opposition. As a member of the Irish Volunteers, he served under de Valera's command in the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. Thomas' fatherâ€”Brendan Finucane's grandfatherâ€” was an Englishman who had served in the King's Own Scottish Borderers on the North-West Frontier Province. Thomas Finucane had ceased his political activism shortly before the couple married in October 1919, and after Florence had converted to Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left {{with nothing to do}} other than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop if it was not either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E
5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the <b>risks</b> <b>associated</b> with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E
