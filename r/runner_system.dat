40|$|The {{influence}} of oxide film defects {{generated from the}} filling process on the mechanical strength of aluminium alloy castings has been investigated. Using numerical simulation and experimental validation, the investigation aims to reveal the relationships among the liquid aluminium flow behaviour in the filling, the likely oxide film defect distribution caused by surface turbulence and the final mechanical strength of the castings. CFD modelling was used to investigate the liquid metal flow behaviour and the likely oxide film defect distribution in the filling at different ingate velocities. In particular, a numerical algorithm - Oxide Film Entrainment Tracking (OFET, 2 -D) has been proposed and developed for predicting such oxide film defect distribution in the liquid aluminium throughout the filling. Also, light microscopic and SEM techniques were used to identify the microstructures of oxide film casting defects. The Weibull statistics method was employed to quantify the effects of oxide film distributions on the mechanical strength and reliability of the acquired aluminium alloy castings for different <b>runner</b> <b>systems.</b> It was found from the numerical simulations that the ingate velocities acquired using different <b>runner</b> <b>systems</b> have significant influence {{on the distribution of}} oxide film defects generated by surface turbulence in the filling process, which results in the disparities of the final mechanical strength of the castings.

This paper examines the rheological and thermal behaviour of a PA 66 during freeze-off and melt flow activation. Numerical simulations were carried out according to the Finite Volume Method as implemented in the Ansys CFX® code. Rheological and thermal data were obtained from a careful material characterization conducted on a capillary rheometer and a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The analyses indicated that relatively small changes in melt temperature and injection pressure can substantially increase the flow conductance and dynamically control both the gate freezing and the onset of melt flow in the subsequent cycle. Therefore, simple gate thermal actuators were designed and numerically implemented to active control the plastic melt flow. This numerical approach can be used to design and optimize the active control of hot runners gate when the use of mechanical actuation (i. e. valve gates) is not suitable due to excessive cost, critical maintenance or miniaturization of the entire system...|$|R

40|$|A 356 {{is one of}} {{the widely}} used {{aluminium}} casting alloy that has been used in both sand and die casting processes. Large amounts of scrap metal can be generated from the <b>runner</b> <b>systems</b> and feeders. In addition, chips are generated in the machined parts. The surface area with regard to weight of chips is so high that it makes these scraps difficult to melt. Although there are several techniques evolved to remedy this problem, yet the problem lies in the quality of the recycled raw material. Since recycling of these scrap is quite important due to the advantages like energy saving and cost reduction in the final product, in this work, the recycling efficiency and casting quality were investigated. Three types of charges were prepared for casting: % 100 primary ingot, % 100 scrap aluminium and fifty-fifty scrap aluminium and primary ingot mixture were used. Melt quality was determined by calculating bifilm index by using reduced pressure test. Tensile test samples were produced by casting both from sand and die moulds. Relationship between bifilm index and tensile strength were determined as an indication of correlation of melt quality. It was found that untreated chips decrease the casting quality significantly. Therefore, prior to charging the chips into the furnace for melting, a series of cleaning processes has to be used in order to achieve good quality products...|$|R

Numerical modelling using ProCAST casting simulation software was performed. A statistical improvement in the as-cast tensile strength was observed with the 1 -tree casting method compared to the established casting method.

The paper addresses the use of ultrasonically activated injection for fabrication of polymeric parts with thin wall features. In the experiment, a part with six different geometric features has been created. The design-of-experiments approach is applied to correlate the quality of the parts with the processing parameters. Four processing parameters are investigated using a screening factorial experimentation plan to determine their possible effect on the filling quality of the moulded parts. The experiments have been conducted on a hot runner mould with two nests in which the final (nest) nozzle has been modified to host, as the central element, the ultrasonic horn of a sonic system. It has been found that the ultrasonic activation applied on the active part of the mould does not play an important role as a stand-alone factor but could amplify or strengthen the effect of classical setting parameters (and influence factors) of the process: the melt temperature and injection pressure.

Predictions of weld lines, Fill pattern and temperature distributions allow to layout and optimize the gate and <b>runner</b> <b>systems,</b> all before the mold geometry is finalized. The goal of mold filling analysis is to optimize tool design so as to maximize processing latitude and part quality. An analysis performed before the tool is made can often reduce or eliminate any tooling modification due to filling problems. Tooling parameters such as gate size and location can be designed to facilitate even, low pressure filling of the part. Mold filling analysis is carried out for gate optimization study, which investigates various, practical gate locations and numbers to assure that part within an acceptable quality range. With the knowledge of what gate locations form an acceptable part, the most economical location can be chosen before the tool is built. Normally, outputs from mold filling analysis are; Melt front advancement, Pressure contours, Temperature distribution. This paper verifies the mold filling analysis experimentally. A minimal mold is considered for this analysis. This mold is made up of two pieces with provision for alignment. This mold is used on a hand injection molding machine. The material is injected into the mold as a series of Short Shots to visualize the actual melt flow pattern inside the mold.
