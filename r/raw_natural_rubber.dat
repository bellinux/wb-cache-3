The test for each condition lasted for 30 days at 40 °C. The results showed that SBR and NR had poor chemical resistance leading to formation of amides on their surfaces and resulting in high mass change. In contrast, EPDM and IIR had insignificant mass and chemical structure changes. The performance of commercial EPDM and IIR were then further studied and compared against PTFE, using aqueous 5 M MEA and with 0. 5 mol CO 2 /mol MEA at 40 and 120 °C each for 30 days. Resistance was measured in terms of mass, hardness, and tensile strength changes. The results showed that PTFE was compatible with the solution at both temperatures. For EPDM and IIR at 40 °C, the changes in mass, hardness, and tensile strength were negligible while at 120 °C, these changes were very significant.

We examined whether repeated application of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex on mouse skin causes sensitization to <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex and dermatitis.

The number of degranulated mast cells in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex-sensitized skin sites was significantly higher compared with control sites treated with phosphate-buffered saline. The expression of interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 4 mRNA was markedly increased in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex-sensitized skin sites.

It is known that degradation features of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> are cleavage of C=C double bonds and changes of 3 D cross-link structure. The degradation mechanism is investigated by many spectroscopic methods, for example, FT-IR and NMR. By using Raman spectroscopy, some information about C=C double bonds, characteristic to <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> can be obtained.

40|$|The {{fluctuation}} of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> {{price has}} raise major concern among the industry player {{and the consumer}} itself. The instability {{in the price of}} <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> last few years is influence by several factors. <b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is a vitally important source of commodity for all sectors of the economy in the world. There are several factors that influence the price of natural rubber; the crude oil price, synthetics rubber price, consumption and production of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to verify the factors that influence the price of the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> Furthermore, it is also conduct in order to identify the effect of the factors to the price of the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> The study is intended to explore the solutions for the volatile price of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> This study will be using descriptive research design. Moreover, the study will be using secondary data instead of primary data. Secondary data will be used due to the difficulty in gathering primary data. The study will be using internet, newspaper, magazines and past research in understanding the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> prices. The study is done in order to find the determinants that influence the fluctuations in the world price of rubber. Beside that, the study is also expected to explain the trend that occurs in world price of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> from year 2004 until 2006...|$|R
40|$|VystarTM Corporation has {{developed}} a novel, patented method for the deactivation of the antigenic proteins (AP) in liquid <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex that involves the denaturing of proteins. Vytex ™ <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex {{is the result of}} intensive work as research and development commenced in 1998 and has resulted in the issuance of two patents, with additional patent filings submitted and pending. Initial laboratory and production test data reveal that products made from Vytex ™ <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex have equal or improved chemical and physical properties when compared to <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex thus allowing a seamless transition for manufacturers using current commercially available product. Vytex ™ <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex production utilizes existing field latex as the starting feedstock and will be produced commercially using existing local processors in South East Asia. Products made from Vytex ™ <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex in the laboratory and certain production lines achieve low protein levels without the need for extensive washing and post leaching with chlorine. Applications for Vytex ™ <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex include gloves, condoms, catheters, tubing, breather bags, as well as many non-medical products across a wide industry scope. Based on pricing for products currently made from <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex, or most synthetic materials, Vytex ™ <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex is cost effective and is easily integrated into existing manufacturing schemes...|$|R
40|$|Although poly(lactic acid) (PLA) {{is among}} widely used {{biodegradable}} polymers, it has limited applications {{due to its}} inherent brittleness, low elongation at break and toughness. Blending with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (NR) and epoxidised <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (ENR) {{seems to be a}} promising alternative, as both materials are derived from renewable resources. <b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> was melt-blended with poly(lactic acid) in an internal mixer, Haake Rheomix, with a rotor speed of 50 r. p. m. at 180 ºC. Liquid epoxidised <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (LENR) was used as a compatibiliser in the binary blending system of thermoplastic <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (TPNR). Results indicate that the mixing torque value and stabilisation torque value in LENR blends are lower than in blends without the compatibiliser. Various compositions of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> epoxidised <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> and compatibiliser were investigated with respect to the stress-strain behaviour. It was found that the addition of LENR compatibiliser improved the stress at break and Young’s modulus in the blend system of 40 / 60 PLA/rubber compositions. The increase in stress at break and Young’s modulus were associated with the ability of LENR to compatibilise the PLA/NR binary blends...|$|R

In this work, the {{crosslink}} density of uncured <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> with different initial moisture contents, 3. 80 %, 10. 05 %, 19. 76 %, 23. 68 %, respectively, dried by microwave at frequency of 2450 MHz was studied using {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectrometer. Seen from the results, the effect of initial moisture content of wet <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> on {{crosslink density}} and processability were obvious. With the increment of initial moisture content of wet <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> the crosslink density of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> after microwave dried with the frequency of 2450 MHz decreased gradually. The crosslink density and A(Mc) of natural with the lower initial moisture content was bigger compared with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> with the higher initial moisture content...|$|R

[...]Because of the low production and high demand for <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in China, a unique process has been developed to manufacture elastic materials with Eucommia ulmoides gum (EUG) as substitutes for <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> products. Unlike the latex used to produce <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> the EUG is the polymer trans-1,4-polyisoprene. Thus materials made from EUG may demonstrate characteristics other than those of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> such as higher elastics, lower thermoplastic temperature, etc.|$|R
