40|$|International audienceThe {{decomposition}} of experimental data into dynamic modes using a data-based algorithm {{is applied to}} Schlieren snapshots of a helium jet and to time-resolved PIV-measurements of an unforced and harmonically forced jet. The algorithm relies on the reconstruction of a low-dimensional inter-snapshot map from the available flow field data. The spectral {{decomposition of}} this map results in an eigenvalue and eigenvector representation (referred to as dynamic modes) of the underlying fluid behavior contained in the processed flow fields. This dynamic mode decomposition allows the breakdown of a fluid process into dynamically <b>revelant</b> and coherent structures and thus aids in the characterization and quantification of physical mechanisms in fluid flow. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to show {{constructions of}} scale {{dependence}} and interaction on some probabilistic models {{which may be}} <b>revelant</b> for renormalization theory in Quantum Field Theory. We begin with {{a review of the}} convolution product’s use in the Kreimer-Connes formalism of perturbative renormalization. We show that the Wilson effective action can be obtained from a convolution product propriety of regularized Gaussian measures on the space of fields. Then, we propose a natural C*-algebraic framework for scale dependent field theories which may enhance the conceptual approach to renormalization theory. In the same spirit, we introduce a probabilistic construction of interacting theories for simple models and apply it for quantum field theory by defining a partition function in this setting. ...|$|E

We present in this paper a coupled system, based on a fish-eye lens CCD camera and a laser range scanner, aimed at capturing color and geometry in this context. To use this system, a <b>revelant</b> model and a accurate calibration method are presented. The calibration method uses a simplified fish-eye model; the method uses only one image for fish-eye parameters, and avoids the use of large calibration pattern as required in others methods. The validity and precision of the method are assessed and example of colored 3 D points produced by the system is presented...|$|E

40|$|What is optimal {{depends on}} {{computational}} tasks. Many recent works base optimality on information theoretical {{terms such as}} information transmission rates. This can be particularly <b>revelant</b> {{in the early stages}} of vision which are mainly concerned with transmitting information indiscriminately. We focus on the better known visual system to discuss optimal sensory coding, although coding in other sensory systems are expected to address similar concerns. Consider a simplified visual input model, with, say, 1000 x 1000 pixels arranged in a regular grid at one byte per pixel and 20 images per second. It provides many megabytes/second of raw data. Given the information bottleneck in the long optic nerve from retina to thalamus and the limited firing rates (thus limited data capacity) of cortical neurons (see article SENSORY CODING AND INFORMATION TRANSMISSION), early vision can greatly benefit from a data encoding that reduces the data rate without significant information loss. ...|$|E

The indirect economic losses {{can be calculated}} by the input-output method in term of the economic effect of short-term close on <b>revelant</b> regions and industries. The direct economic losses comes mainly from airport agencies and can be obtained in accordance with Civil Airport Charge Reform Scheme(2007). The Weihai International Airport of China is a study case chosen to estimate the economic effects of short-term close.

40|$|Abstract. The {{macroscopic}} transport {{properties in}} a disordered potential, namely diffusion and weak/strong localization, closely {{depend on the}} microscopic and statistical properties of the disorder itself. This dependence is rich of counter-intuitive consequences. It can be particularly exploited in matter wave experiments, where the disordered potential can be tailored and controlled, and anisotropies are naturally present. In this work, we apply a perturbative microscopic transport theory and the self-consistent theory of Anderson localization to study the transport properties of ultracold atoms in anisotropic 2 D and 3 D speckle potentials. In particular, we discuss the anisotropy of singlescattering, diffusion and localization. We also calculate a disorder-induced shift of the energy states and propose a method to include it, which amounts to renormalize energies in the standard on-shell approximation. We show that the renormalization of energies strongly affects the prediction for the 3 D localization threshold (mobility edge). We illustrate the theoretical findings with examples which are <b>revelant</b> for current matter wave experiments, where the disorde...|$|E

Her condition was diagnosed as scombroid poisoning based on temporality, normal serum tryptase levels (2. 7 ng/mL) at 2. 5 hours and at her baseline (2. 5 ng/mL, 60 hours), as well as negative results on skin-prick test and re-challenging one can of the same branded-tuna orally. The <b>revelant</b> public health authorities were notified and a restaurant-visit was made, although the tuna can from which the patient’s dish was prepared had been discarded, hence a histamine analysis of the tuna was unavailable.

Dilution effects are particularly <b>revelant</b> to the so-called sparse sampling strategy.

We use three synthetic samples as references to perform our analysis: a fractal generated by a Rayleigh-Levy random walk with approximately 3 x 10 (exp 4) objects, a sample dominated by a spherical power-law cluster with approximately 3 x 10 (exp 4) objects and a cold dark matter (CDM) universe involving approximately 3 x 10 (exp 5) matter particles...|$|E
40|$|The 6 DOF {{motion system}} was {{employed}} for closed loop simulation of the contact dynamics {{involved in the}} docking of two satellites. Under most initial conditions the system gives inaccurate results. It {{is well known that}} the presence of a time lag can generate instability in closed loop systems. In order to see if the time lag (about 200 ms.) in the 6 DOF system can can satisfactorily account for its errors, a simple computer model of the system incorporating this lag and other <b>revelant</b> parameters was implemented. The model in fact does predict all the observed rebound errors with reasonable precision. Also, since it is probable that the time delay can only be reduced but not eliminated, various compensation schemes were devised. Two give adequate correction for delays under 100 ms for a non preloaded probe. More powerful schemes may be adequate for the present 200 ms. environment and the presence of a preload...|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Although {{the degree to}} which ERTS- 1 imagery can satisfy regional land use planning data needs is not yet known, it appears to offer means by which the data acquisition process can be immeasurably improved. The initial experiences of an interdisciplinary group attempting to formulate ways of analyzing the effectiveness of ERTS- 1 imagery as a base for environmental monitoring and the resolution of regional land allocation problems are documented. Application of imagery to the regional planning process consists of utilizing representative geographical regions within the state of Wisconsin. Because of the need to describe and depict regional resource complexity in an interrelatable state, certain resources within the geographical regions have been inventoried and stored in a two-dimensional computer-based map form. Computer oriented processes were developed to provide for the economical storage, analysis, and spatial display of natural and cultural data for regional land use planning purposes. The authors are optimistic that the imagery will provide <b>revelant</b> data for land use decision making at regional levels...|$|E
40|$|Although the 1991 farm {{value for}} mango sales {{reported}} by the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service was only $ 46, 000, mango {{is one of the}} most widely grown fruit trees in home gardens. Quarantine regulations prevent the export of mango fruit to the U. S. mainland. However, the fact is little known that mangos are being exported from Hawaii to Canada and Europe, and that Mexican mangos are imported to the Honolulu market via California. Because of the mango's popularity and potential, it is regarded as an important component of Hawaii's specialty fruits industry and merits attention for further development. This conference was organized to discuss a wide and comprehensive range of subjects related to mango.

ASCs have been proposed to control the increasing numbers of infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms, but their efficacy and cost-effectiveness are unproven. We conducted a system-atic {{review of the literature}} pertaining to the use of ASCs and control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We searched <b>revelant</b> journals and the PubMed Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases. No randomized, controlled trials were identified. Sixteen observational studies and 4 economic analyses were reviewed. Only 2 of the observational studies had a control group. None of the studies were of good quality. Thus, we identified important gaps in the literature, including a need for a clear definition of ASCs, a clear implementation protocol, and rigorous economic evaluations. Existing evidence may favor the use of ASCs, but the evidence is of poor quality, and definitive recommendations cannot be made.

40|$|Social {{isolation}} in male rats at weaning results in reduced basal {{levels of the}} neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone (AP) {{in the brain and}} plasma as well as in increased anxiety-like behavior. We now show that socially isolated female rats also manifest a reduced basal cerebrocortical concentration of AP as well as an anxiety-like profile in the elevated plus-maze and Vogel’s conflict tests compared with group-housed (GH) con trols. In contrast, {{despite the fact that they}} were raised under normal conditions, adult male offspring of male and female rats subjected to social isolation before mating exhibited an increased basal cerebrocortical level of AP but no difference in emotional reactivity compared with the offspring of GH parents. These animals also showed a blunted AP release induced by foot-shock stress compared to GH offspring. In order to understand this mechanism of resilience to stress, in socially isolated dams we next evaluated the pattern of maternal care and hormonal plasmatic levels of oxytocin, vasopressin and estradiol during pregnancy and after delivery. The results indicate that socially isolated dams did not differ either in the total frequency of licking-grooming and arched-back nursing from GH dams during the first 8 days post partum than in hormonal pattern measured during pregnancy, 3 and 8 days after delivery. Our results suggest that dams hormonal levels and their behavior may be not <b>revelant</b> for stress responsiveness in their offspring. ...|$|E
