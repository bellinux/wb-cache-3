5|$|To {{supplement}} their income, {{the inhabitants of}} Milnrow entered the domestic system, producing flannel and woollen cloth in purpose-built weavers' cottages, some of which from the Early Modern period have survived as listed buildings. Coalmining and metalworking also flourished in this period, but the Industrial Revolution supplanted the domestic industries and converted Milnrow into an urban mill town that mass-produced textile goods in cotton mills, such as Ellenroad <b>Ring</b> <b>Mill</b> (now a museum). The Milnrow Urban District was established in 1894 and was governed thereafter by its own district council until its abolition in 1974.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Different {{from the}} {{conventional}} <b>ring</b> rolling <b>mill,</b> the combined <b>ring</b> rolling <b>mill</b> {{has not only}} one main roll and one mandrel to enlarge the ring blank, but also two assistant rolls to deform the ring blank with the main roll continuous feeding. The novel ring rolling process can have three working modes: 1) conventional ring rolling; 2) cross rolling with three rolls surrounding the ring blank; 3) conventional ring rolling with cross rolling. Moreover, the new ring rolling process allows the transferring from one working mode to another. The process and the mill provide more flexibility for manufacturing different ring products. The stiffness condition at different working modes and the smoothly transferring conditions are first studied carefully. Then the combined ring rolling model for deep groove ring is established and evaluated. 1...|$|R

50|$|Coppull {{expanded}} greatly {{along with}} the rest of Lancashire during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century. As well as the Cotton industry the town is situated on the Lancashire Coalfield. There were several major collieries located in the town during this era with notable collieries being Chisnall Hall and Ellerbeck. Coppull Mill was built in 1906, with elaborate decoration. It was a <b>ring</b> <b>mill,</b> and was used to spin 10's to 24's counts for general manufacture.|$|E

50|$|As the 18th century progressed each town {{developed}} a different specialism. Oldham was a spinning town producing fine counts while Wigan did coarse.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} mainly focus {{on the study of}} self-organized systems, from {{different}} level of descriptions. We develop efficient numerical methods based on Direct Simulation Monte Carlo techniques, to solve the kinetic approximation of these systems, with a considerable save in the computational cost. We study the stability and instability of flock <b>ring</b> and <b>mill</b> <b>ring</b> solutions of second order swarming models, determining the stable regions of parameters and obtaining a spectral equivalence between first order and second order model in the case of flock solutions. In the second part we embed classical swarming models with control dynamics. We first present a general framework for swarming model interacting with few individuals, seen as external point source forces, giving a microscopic, a mesoscopic and a macroscopic description. Later we focus on optimal control problems for self-organized systems and inspired by model predictive control strategy, we obtain a kinetic description of the initial optimal control problem. In the end we report an asymptotic preserving scheme or optimal control problems of boundary problems governed by the hyperbolic relaxed systems...|$|R

50|$|The {{power was}} {{provided}} by a Manhattan type steam engine by George Saxon & Co. Transmission was by rope drives. The mill had 137,312 mule spindles which remained until the 1950s when they were replaced by 33,636 <b>ring</b> spindles, the <b>mill</b> being electrified at the same time.

50|$|The {{industry}} {{peaked in}} 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914-18 halted {{the supply of}} raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Royton <b>Ring</b> <b>Mill,</b> Royton was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, {{and one of the}} 53 mills that survived through to 1950.|$|E
50|$|Ring {{spinning}} technology {{had successfully}} replaced the spinning mule, with mills having been converted mules to rings. However in the 1970s, the depleted industry was challenged {{by a new}} technology open-end or break spinning. In 1978 Carrington Viyella opened a factory to do open-end spinning in Atherton. This was the first new textile production facility in Lancashire since 1929. Immediately Pear Mill, Stockport and Alder Mill, Leigh were closed. These were both Edwardian mills designed by Stott and Sons.The mill built in 1978 {{was built on the}} Howe Bridge mills site and was named Unit One. It was not an open end mill but a combed cotton <b>ring</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{large-scale}} pellet mills: flat die <b>mills</b> and <b>ring</b> die <b>mills.</b> Flat die mills use a flat die with slots. The powder is {{introduced to the}} top of the die and as the die rotates a roller presses the powder through the holes in the die. A cutter on the other side of the die cuts the exposed pellet free from the die. In the ring die there are radial slot throughout the die. Powder is fed into the inside of the die and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through the die holes. Two cutters are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of the die.|$|R
40|$|The hole-drilling and ring-core {{techniques}} are two well-known approaches to residual stress measurement. They apparently are complementary: in the former, {{a small hole}} is drilled in the specimen and residual stresses are estimated from the displacement/strain field around the hole; in the latter a small <b>ring</b> is <b>milled</b> and residual stresses are computed from the displacement/strain field inside the ring. However, owing to the different stiffness of the constraining region, their sensitivity and depth range are somewhat different. Although both {{techniques are}} implemented using strain gauges, the use of optical methods is nowadays largely accepted. As optical methods allow acquisition of data from {{both inside and outside}} the ring, in this work, we will try to exploit the different displacement release rates of the two regions to optimize residual stress measurement...|$|R
