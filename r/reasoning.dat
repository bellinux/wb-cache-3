5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven <b>reasoning</b> (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven <b>reasoning</b> (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral <b>reasoning.</b> Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral <b>reasoning</b> involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral <b>reasoning</b> since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E

5|$|Kohlberg's theory {{centers on}} the notion that justice is the {{essential}} characteristic of moral <b>reasoning.</b> Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound <b>reasoning</b> based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.|$|E

50|$|Besides the {{technical}} definitions, the {{styles of the}} different approaches are notable. Svatantrika style approaches have a more structured syllogistic form, making assertions with argumentation, whereas the Prasangika approach may make assertions, but with significantly less <b>reasonings</b> for those assertions. Instead they mainly point out errors resulting from taking <b>reasonings</b> to logical extremes.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that some Mohist <b>reasonings</b> {{of the final}} portion of the Xiao qu 〈小取〉 are paradoxical: “a robber is a man, but to kill a robber is not to kill a man”. In this paper, we analyze and formalize the different groups of Mohist <b>reasonings</b> using concepts of contemporary western logic: classes, sorts, structured sorts as they appear in the mathematical theory of categories. We solve those paradoxes by using sorts and more generally arrive at the conclusion that those <b>reasonings</b> are based on structured sorts, a notion which, in our opinion, is fundamental to clarify the notion of lei (類) ...|$|R
5|$|Other {{psychologists have}} {{questioned}} the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal <b>reasoning.</b> Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral <b>reasoning</b> may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.|$|E

5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable <b>reasoning</b> faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable <b>reasoning</b> faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever <b>reasoning</b> one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E

25|$|Early {{forms of}} analogical <b>reasoning,</b> {{inductive}} <b>reasoning</b> and categorical syllogism {{were introduced in}} Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Sharia (Islamic law) and Kalam (Islamic theology) from the 7th century {{with the process of}} Qiyas, before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later during the Islamic Golden Age, there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term Qiyas refers to analogical <b>reasoning,</b> inductive <b>reasoning</b> or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that Qiyas refers to inductive <b>reasoning,</b> which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that Qiyas does not refer to inductive <b>reasoning,</b> but refers to categorical syllogism in a real sense and analogical <b>reasoning</b> in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that Qiyas refers to analogical <b>reasoning</b> in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term Qiyas refers to both analogical <b>reasoning</b> and categorical syllogism in a real sense.|$|E

25|$|Looking at logical categorizations of {{different}} types of <b>reasoning</b> the traditional main division made in philosophy is between deductive <b>reasoning</b> and inductive <b>reasoning.</b> Formal logic has been described as the science of deduction.

25|$|Inductive <b>reasoning</b> {{contrasts}} {{strongly with}} deductive <b>reasoning</b> in that, {{even in the}} best, or strongest, cases of inductive <b>reasoning,</b> {{the truth of the}} premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.

Relatedly, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of <b>reasoning</b> is ampliative.|$|E
