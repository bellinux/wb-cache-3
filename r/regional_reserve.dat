25|$|The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) {{consists}} of 12 members, seven from the Board of Governors and 5 {{of the regional}} Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The FOMC oversees and sets policy on open market operations, the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; {{the presidents of the}} other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All <b>Regional</b> <b>Reserve</b> Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the Chair of the Board of Governors as its chair {{and the president of the}} Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed.|$|E

[...] Glass, a southern Democrat with a marked antipathy to centralized power, intended {{his proposal to}} be differentiated from the (similarly private sector-dominated) Aldrich Plan largely {{by the absence of}} a central institution, but to Glass's horror, Wilson told him to add a central agency (in Wilson's own word, a [...] "capstone") to his model.|$|E
