40|$|The authors {{deal with}} ethic {{problems}} in qualitative research. They argue that ethic dimension in {{research in the}} field of human sciences is constantly marginalized.

The argumentation is focused on responsibility of researchers. The results of underestimation of ethic issues in research could lead to politization of scietific resarch, to political and economic influence on research orientation, to the way, how the research question is raised, to choice of research methods, etc...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the program, after the Korean War, the CHA had little means to operate.

The first items to be inscribed on the intangible heritage list were thus taken from Yae's articles. Others were added based on the opinions of <b>researchers</b> <b>and</b> also included winners of the annual folk tradition competitions. The recommendation of local administrations was also sought.|$|E

5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century.

Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E

He also laid the foundations of the Australian Biological Resources Study. When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the Burnet Lecture and Medal, which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.|$|E
