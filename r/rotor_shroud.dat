In this research, a <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> conguration is studied and implemented, {{that has the potential}} to oer two key operational benets: enhanced system thrust for a given input power, and improved structural rigidity and crashworthiness of an MAV platform. The main challenges involved in realising such a system for a lightweight craft are: design of a lightweight and stiff shroud, and increased sensitivity to external flow disturbances that can affect flight stability. These key aspects are addressed and studied in order to assess the capability of the <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> as a platform of choice for MAV applications. A fully functional <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> vehicle (disk loading 60 N/m 2) was designed and constructed with key shroud design variables derived from previous studies on micro <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotors.</b> The vehicle weighed about 280 g (244 mm <b>rotor</b> diameter). The <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> had a 30 % increase in power loading in hover compared to an unshrouded rotor. Due to the stiff, lightweight shroud construction, a net payload benefit of 20 - 30 g was achieved. The different components such as the rotor, stabilizer bar, yaw control vanes and the shroud were systematically studied for system efficiency and overall aerodynamic improvements. Analysis of the data showed that the chosen shroud dimensions was close to optimum for a design payload of 250 g. Risk reduction prototypes were built to sequentially arrive at the nal conguration. In order to prevent periodic oscillations in flight, a hingeless rotor was incorporated in the shroud. The vehicle was successfully flight tested in hover with a proportional-integral-derivative feedback controller. A flybarless rotor was incorporated for efficiency and control moment improvements. Time domain system identification of the attitude dynamics of the flybar and flybarless rotor vehicle was conducted about hover. Controllability metrics were extracted based on controllability gramian treatment for the flybar and flybarless rotor. In edgewise gusts, the <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> generated up to 3 times greater pitching moment and 80 % greater drag than an equivalent unshrouded rotor. In order to improve gust tolerance and control moments, rotor design optimizations were made by varying solidity, collective, operating RPM and planform. A rectangular planform rotor at a collective of 18 deg was seen to offer the highest control moments. The <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> produced 100 % higher control moments due to pressure asymmetry arising from cyclic control of the rotor. It was seen that the control margin of the <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> increased as the disk loading increased, which is however deleterious in terms of hover performance.

A standard table fan and an open jet wind tunnel setup was used for bench top setup.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} experimental {{investigation of the}} effects of varying the shroud profile shape on the performance of MAV (Micro Air Vehicle) -scale <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotors.</b> Hover tests were performed on seventeen models with a rotor diameter of 16 cm (6. 3 in) and various values of diffuser expansion angle, diffuser length, inlet lip radius and blade tip clearance, at various rotor collective angles. Compared to the baseline open <b>rotor,</b> the <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotors</b> showed increases in thrust by up to 94 %, at the same power consumption, or reductions in power by up to 62 % at the same thrust. These improvements surpass those predicted by momentum theory, due to the additional effect of the shrouds in reducing the non-ideal power losses of the rotor. The uniformity of the rotor wake was improved by the presence of the shrouds and by decreasing the blade tip clearance, resulting in lower induced power losses. Strong suction pressures were observed on the shroud inlet surface, at the blade passage region; taking advantage of this phenomenon could enable further increases in thrust. However, trade studies showed that, for a given overall aircraft size limitation, and ignoring considerations of the safety benefits of a shroud, a larger-diameter open rotor is more likely to give better performance than a smaller-diameter <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor.</b> A single shrouded-rotor model was subsequently tested in translational flight at various angles of attack. In axial flow, at the same collective, the net thrust and the power consumption of the <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> were lower than those of the open rotor; in edgewise flow, the <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> produced greater thrust than the open rotor, while consuming less power. Measurements of the shroud surface pressure distributions illustrated the extreme asymmetry of the flow around the shroud, with consequent pitch moments much greater than those experienced by the open rotor. Except at low airspeeds and high angles of attack, the static pressure in the wake did not reach ambient atmospheric values at the diffuser exit plane; this challenges the validity of the fundamental assumption of the simple-momentum-theory flow model for short-chord shrouds in translational flight...|$|R
40|$|Performance of an axial exhaust {{diffuser}} downstream of an un-shrouded turbine rotor is computationally analyzed. Three-dimensional analysis of two turbine stage-{{exhaust diffuser}} configurations has been performed. In one case, the turbine <b>rotor</b> is <b>shrouded</b> {{and in the}} second case, the rotor is un-shrouded. The static pressure recovery coefficient in the exhaust diffuser is used as the diffuser performance parameter. It has been found that the over the tip leakage flow in the un-shrouded rotor emerges as a swirling wall jet at the upper wall of the diffuser. The case of the <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> produced no wall jet {{at the entrance to the}} diffuser and the turbine exit flow was “quasi-uniform”. The presence of the wall jet allowed the annular diffuser outer wall angle at stall point to increase from 12 ° (in the <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> case) to 18 ° in the un-shrouded turbine. By changing the angular speed of the rotor, the effect of the swirl in the turbine exit plane on the performance of the diffuser was explored. In the <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor</b> case, the diffuser recovers higher static pressure when the inlet is swirl-free. In this case, the performance of the diffuser is independent of whether the turbine exit flow has co- or counter-swirl.

Geometrical details {{of an existing}} two stage turbine facility with low reaction blades is used for this purpose. For validation of the numerical results, experimental measurements of one partial admission configuration at design point was used. The partial admission turbine with single blockage had unsymmetrical shape; therefore the full annulus of the turbine had to be modeled numerically. The numerical grid included the full annulus geometry together with the disc gaps and rotor shrouds. Importance of various parameters in accurate modeling of the unsteady flow field of partial admission turbines was assessed. Two simpler models were selected to study the effect of accurate modeling of radial distribution of flow parameters. In the first numerical model, the computational grid was two dimensional and the radial distribution of flow parameters was neglected. The second case was three-dimensional and full blades’ span height was modeled but the leakage flows at disc cavity and <b>rotor</b> <b>shroud</b> were neglected. Detailed validation of the results from various computational models with the experimental data showed that modeling of the leakage flow at disc cavities and <b>rotor</b> <b>shroud</b> of partial admission turbines has substantial importance in accuracy of numerical computations. Comparison of the results from two computational models with varying inlet extension showed that modeling of the inlet cone has considerable importance in accuracy of results but with increased computational cost. Partial admission turbine with admission degree of  ε = 0. 524 in one blocked arc and two opposing blocked arcs were tested. Results showed that blocking the inlet annulus in one single arc produce better overall efficiency compared to the two blocked arc model. Effect of varying axial gap distance between the first stage stator and rotor rows was also tested numerically for the partial admission turbine with admission degree of  ε = 0. 726. Results showed higher efficiency for the reduced axial gap model. Computations showed that the main flow leave the blade path down to the disc cavity and re-enter into the flow channel downstream the blockage, this flow would pass the rotor with very low efficiency. First stage rotor blades are subject to large unsteady forces due to the non-uniform inlet flow. Plotting the unsteady forces of first stage rotor blades for partial admission turbine with single blockage showed that the blades experience large changes in magnitude and direction while traveling along the circumference. Unsteady forces of first stage rotor blades were plotted in frequency domain using Fourier transform. The largest amplitudes caused by partial admission were at first and second multiples of rotational frequency due {{to the existence of}} single blockage and change in the force direction. Results obtained from the numerical computations showed that the discs have nonuniform pressure distribution especially in the first stage of partial admission turbines.

A review of the published work concerning radial turbines and closely related to mixed flow turbines is presented. A 1 -D design method was developed. It is used to define the over all turbine dimensions and to analyse its performance at the off design conditions. The method is applicable to both radial and mixed flow turbines. A series of designs had been produced and then analysed by the off design performance prediction method. The effects of several geometrical parameters on the performance of the designs were investigated. This had led to the selection of an optimum rotor design for further analysis. An analytical method based on the Bezier polynomials is used to define the three dimensional blade geometry. The rotor geometry is optimised by means of a quasi­ three-dimensional method for the flow analysis.

In particular, the high and low pressure turbine components have a great impact into the engine overall performance, and improvements in the turbine efficiencies can only be achieved through detailed research on the three-dimensional unsteady aerodynamics and heat transfer. The present thesis presents an experimental study of the aerothermodynamics in one and a half turbine stage, focusing on: the aero-thermal flow in the overtip region of a transonic highly loaded high pressure (HP) rotor, and the aerodynamics and heat transfer of an innovative low pressure (LP) stator with a multi-profile configuration placed downstream of the high pressure turbine, within an s-shaped duct.

40|$|One {{option to}} improve the cycle {{efficiency}} of current state-of-the-art aero engines {{is to increase the}} turbine inlet temperature. Since this temperature is above the melting temperature for the alloys utilised in the turbine component already today, efficient cooling methods must be developed that consider both aerodynamic and aerothermal aspects of cooling. Here, the goal is to extract as little as possible secondary air from the main hot gas cycle for cooling and to use this coolant then aerodynamically and aerothermally as efficient as possible. The paper to be presented documents a CFD based design approach that lead to a new passive shroud cooling concept and the definition of its operational parameters. By using a simple one dimensional method [10] for predicting the aerodynamic losses resulting from such a cooling configuration in connection with 3 d Navier-Stokes solvers (RANS) for predicting film cooling effectiveness contours on the <b>rotor</b> <b>shroud</b> surfaces, the new cooling configuration was developed. The concept was then tested and confirmed experimentally as documented in more detail in Part 2 of this paper. It is noted that only 70 % of the coolant mass flow required for the current configuration was used for the new concept whereas the aerodynamic efficiency measured remained nearly constant. Improving upon existing passive shroud cooling systems where the coolant is injected directly into the labyrinth of the shroud, the new approach comprises cooling holes that inject the coolant upstream of the labyrinth and through the stator platform into the main passage flow. Here, {{it is important that the}} bulk of the coolant is placed below the dividing streamlines between main passage flow and labyrinth flow. Thereby, it can be achieved that the major part of the coolant indeed reaches the thermally loaded target surfaces on the shroud bottom at various axial gaps due to different operating points of the turbine. Besides the improved film-cooling effectiveness measured, the second important aspect of the new concept is the achievement of as small as possible additional aerodynamic losses due to coolant ejection into a high speed flow region. It will be shown that both goals can be achieved by the new concept. Furthermore, CFD results on film-cooling performance and aerodynamic losses will be shown and compared with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the leakage flow over a {{shrouded}} turbine stage, its interaction with the main passage flow, and the associated losses. The study addressed these topics by providing an analytical correlation loss model and detailed CFD simulations. An analytical model of leakage flow loss over a shrouded turbine stage has been developed. The analytical model uses directly measurable flow quantities to predict the effect {{of some of the}} over-shroud design parameters on stage performance. The model displays good predictive ability for the mass leakage fraction and the mixing losses. The model resolves the negative incidence angle induced by mixing the leakage flow with the main stream and predicts the increment in the total mixing loss coefficient at increasing leakage jet injection angles. The main contributions of this model to the leakage jet models documented in the open literature are the effect of the leakage jet injection angle on the mixing loss and the accounting of the effect of the number of fins on the leakage mass fraction in an explicit way. The present model exhibits a good qualitative and quantitative agreement with comparative benchmark data. An in-house three-dimensional turbomachinery CFD code was developed and validated against six test cases, showing its ability to capture the salient flow features in each test case. This work makes an innovative use of Detached Eddy Simulation as an advanced Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model. A detailed leakage flow structure over the <b>rotor</b> <b>shroud</b> and its interaction with the main passage flow were modeled for seven test cases to investigate the effect of the number of fins, the clearance gap ratio, and the leakage jet injection angle on the flow.

In the present study, {{the use of the}} lime-slotting technique, with slots 0 - 15 m wide and 02 ̆ 78 m deep, for providing long-term improvements of the adverse soil chemical and physical characteristics of an acid, clay soil was investigated. Lime-slotting using a rotary slotter resulted in a uniform increase in soil pH to the full depth of the slot (0 - 8 m), indicating a thorough mixing of the lime with the small soil fragments produced by slotting, as they are thrown up into the <b>rotor</b> <b>shroud</b> and redeposited in the slot. In contrast, ripping to l- 0 m depth and delve ploughing to 0 - 8 m depth only changed the soil pH close to the soil surface. The saturated hydraulic conductivity, total porosity and air-filled porosity at a potential of — 10 kPa measured on soil cores was significantly (P < 0 - 05) increased within the slot, compared to the undisturbed soil. Values of unsaturated hydraulic conductivities K(9) and diffusivities D(9), calculated from the saturated conductivity and water potential-water content relationships, also showed increases in the slot, at high water contents. Although a polishing of sections of the slot wall due to rubbing of the rotors was observed in the field, the saturated conductivities of the cores taken across the slot walls did not show significant (P < 0 - 05) differences compared with the undisturbed soil adjacent to the slot. The extent of protection of the loosened soil in the slots from recompaction during subsequent farm trafficking was evaluated in a vineyard. Soil strength measurement showed distinct differences between field plots which were non-ameliorated, lime-slotted or deep ripped. Soil strength was estimated using penetrometer cone index measurements, which were made when the soils were at similar water contents. Zones of high soil strength observed in the non-ameliorated soils, were reduced in the ripped and slotted soil. However, {{the upper part of the}} ripped soil had soil strengths higher than the lower part, indicating repacking under trafficking. In contrast in the slotted soil, the slotted area had low soil strength to depth, indicating greater protection of the loosened soil during trafficking. This could be due to bridging of the tractor wheels and implements across the slot on to the stronger undisturbed soil on either side. Thus, lime-slotting is an effective technique for long-term amelioration of the adverse physical and chemical properties of dense clay soils with subsoil acidity. This should encourage root growth to depth within the slots, and use of the water stored in the subsoil...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical investigations {{undertaken to}} analyze the turbulent flow produced {{in the wake of}} a micro air vehicle rotor interacting with the ground. Two configurations are investigated: a free <b>rotor</b> and a <b>shrouded</b> <b>rotor.</b> The Reynolds number based on the chord and tip speed is Retip = 0. 86 × 105, which corresponds to a challenging flow where leading-edge separations are commonly observed. The numerical simulations are performed with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach and a large-eddy simulation (by means of a lattice-Boltzmannmethod), combinedwith an immersed boundary approach. The comparison of numerical data with measurements shows that the mean flow and the turbulent shear stresses are accurately predicted close to the ground and in the rotor wake. However, some discrepancies remain in the prediction of the rotor torque and thrust, mainly due to the difficulty to reproduce the flow near the rotor walls. An analysis is conducted to identify and understand the different sources of turbulent production. The numerical simulations show also that the presence of a shroud contributes, at a given thrust, to reduce the velocity and the turbulent intensity at the ground...|$|R

40|$|A 50. 8 -cm-tip-diameter turbine {{equipped}} with a <b>rotor</b> tip <b>shroud</b> of hexagonal cell (or honeycomb) cross section has been tested in warm air (416 K) {{for a range of}} shroud coolant to primary flow rates. Test results were also obtained for the same turbine operated with a solid shroud for comparison. The results showed that the combined effect of the honeycomb shroud and the coolant flow was to cause a reduction of 2. 8 points in efficiency at design speed, pressure ratio, and coolant flow rate. With the coolant system inactivated, the honeycomb shroud caused a decrease in efficiency of 2. 3 points. These results and those obtained from a small reference turbine indicate that the dominant factor governing honeycomb tip shroud loss is the ratio of honeycomb depth to blade span. The loss results of the two shrouds could be correlated on this basis. The same honeycomb and coolant effects are expected to occur for the hot (2200 K) version of this turbine...|$|R
