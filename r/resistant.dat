5|$|Chloroquine-resistant {{forms of}} P. falciparum emerged only 19 years later. The first <b>resistant</b> strains were {{detected}} around the Cambodia‐Thailand border and in Colombia, in the 1950s. In 1989, chloroquine resistance in P. vivax {{was reported in}} Papua New Guinea. These <b>resistant</b> strains spread rapidly, producing a large mortality increase, particularly in Africa during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Complicating the use {{of aspirin}} for {{prevention}} is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance. For people who are <b>resistant,</b> aspirin's efficacy is reduced. Some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are <b>resistant</b> to aspirin.|$|E
50|$|Some time later, Mutant Force {{became the}} <b>Resistants,</b> a mutant {{terrorist}} group {{in opposition to}} the Mutant Registration Act, and mutant rights activists. Burner changed his name to Crucible during his time with the <b>Resistants.</b> The <b>Resistants</b> rescued the mutant Quill from the custody of then-current fifth Captain America and Bucky. The <b>Resistants</b> then rescued Mentallo from the Guardsmen's custody, and battled Captain America and Bucky again. During the battle, Crucible was accidentally non-fatally shot by Mentallo (who had taken the name Think-Tank). Crucible was later seen trying to bring down Captain America {{at the behest of the}} Red Skull, but was severely injured in the fight. Apparently recovered, he was later among the <b>Resistants</b> protesting in Washington for mutant rights, where he encountered the original Captain America.|$|R

During this time, Slither wasn't part of the team, but many mutants joined the team {{including}} Mist Mistress and Mentallo (now calling himself Think Tank). As the <b>Resistants,</b> the team would fight against several superheroes, including their original enemy Captain America. Eventually most members would leave. Slither rejoined and the team retook the name Mutant Force. The team disbanded shortly afterwards, most members going their own way.|$|R
5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most <b>resistant,</b> while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as the poison has been successfully used to control their populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less <b>resistant</b> than mainland Western tammars but are more <b>resistant</b> than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{resistance}} poses {{a growing}} problem in 21st-century malaria treatment. Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of <b>resistant</b> strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are <b>resistant</b> to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable. Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years {{and the availability of}} substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the <b>resistant</b> phenotype. Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.|$|E
5|$|For some people, aspirin {{does not}} have as strong an effect on {{platelets}} as for others, an effect known as aspirin-resistance or insensitivity.

5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more <b>resistant</b> to demineralization and thus more <b>resistant</b> to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
