40|$|Tree species {{regeneration}} determines future forest {{composition and}} dynamics, but is often severely hampered in forest <b>relicts.</b> To study succession, long-term studies or simulation models are used but data, knowledge or resources to run such models are often scarce {{in remote areas}} or developing countries. We propose and implement a regional and a local species accounting equation which parameters {{can be derived from}} a single inventory and include the co-occurring events extinction, colonization and recruitment. To parameterize the species accounting equations, we compared the tree species presence among the seedling, sapling and mature tree layer of 82 plots in 12 remaining Afromontane cloud forest <b>relicts</b> in Taita Hills, Kenya. A simultaneous ordination of the seedling, sapling and mature tree layer data revealed that species extinctions, colonizations and recruitments initiated species shifts. A potential extinction debt of 9 % of the species pool was found in all the remaining forest <b>relicts.</b> Surprisingly, the smallest forest <b>relicts</b> harboured {{an important component of the}} tree species diversity, but rather in the regeneration layer than in the mature tree layer. In some forest <b>relicts,</b> up to 30 % of the species pool was only present as persistent seedling or sapling, which we defined as potential recruitment credit. The extinction rates were larger than the recruitment rates, which could result in a future species richness decline of 17 % and 34 % of the small and large forest <b>relicts,</b> respectively. The regional and the local species accounting equations provide a time and resource effective tool and give an improved understanding of the conservation status and possible future succession dynamics of forest <b>relicts,</b> which can be particularly useful in a context of participatory monitoring. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{vegetation}} of Strandzha evolved {{before the}} formation of the Bosphorus Strait when the whole southern Black Sea coast was linked and represents the westernmost extension of the Euxine-Colchic ecoregion.

5|$|The genus Gymnogyps is {{an example}} of a <b>relict</b> distribution. During the Pleistocene epoch, this genus was {{widespread}} across the Americas. From fossils, the Floridan Gymnogyps kofordi from the Early Pleistocene and the Peruvian Gymnogyps howardae from the Late Pleistocene have been described. A condor found in Late Pleistocene deposits on Cuba was initially described as Antillovultur varonai, but has since been recognized as another member of Gymnogyps, Gymnogyps varonai. It may even have derived from a founder population of California condors.|$|E
5|$|The ichthyofauna of {{the park}} is among the richest in Europe with 41 {{freshwater}} and brackish water species of fish, as well as 70 marine fish species. There are nine Ponto-Caspian and five boreal <b>relict</b> species. The Ponto-Caspian dates from the ancient Sarmatian Sea. The boreal dates from the epoch of Quaternary cooling. There are several species restricted to the Black Sea basin (vyrezub, mushroom goby, bighead goby, toad goby, tubenose goby, western tubenose goby and racer goby). The round goby and estuarine perch {{are found in the}} Caspian and Black Sea basins.|$|E
5|$|The river martins are in {{some ways}} {{intermediate}} between typical swallows and other passerines: they have stout bills, large feet and relatively strong legs, which is unusual in aerial feeders. They also have a large syrinx (vocal organ) and a different bronchial structure. The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of these two martins suggest that they are <b>relict</b> populations {{of a group of}} species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolutionary history, and they may be the most primitive of the swallows. Like other early hirundine lineages, they nest in burrows, rather than adopted nest holes or mud nests.|$|E

5|$|Cave and archeological remains {{indicate}} that {{the range of the}} marsh rice rat has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene, into central Texas, eastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, central Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, West Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000CE and are associated with corn cultivation, but in some older cave sites the rice rat is found with the extinct giant armadillo Dasypus bellus, suggesting warm climatic conditions. Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled the rice rat to disperse northward and when the climate cooled, <b>relict</b> populations were able to survive in the north as commensals in corn-cultivating Native American communities. Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats, possibly because environmental constraints were relaxed in commensal populations.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas {{are large}} insects made {{conspicuous}} by the courtship calls of the males. They are characterised by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and {{three to six}} segments, including a seta at the tip. The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on {{the rear of the}} forewing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hindwing. Cicadas lack the ability to jump as exhibited by other members of the Auchenorrhyncha. Another defining characteristic is the adaptations of the forelimbs of nymphs for underground life. The <b>relict</b> family Tettigarctidae differ from the Cicadidae in having the prothorax extending as far as the scutellum, and by lacking the tympanal apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Remains of Nesomys narindaensis {{have been}} found at the sites of Antsingiavo, Ambongonambakoa, and Ambatomainty in northwestern Madagascar, which are late Pleistocene (126,000 to 10,000 years ago) and Holocene (less than 10,000 years ago) in age. Nesomys is a rare element of the rodent fauna, which is {{dominated}} by multiple species of Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Modern Nesomys live {{on the ground in}} eastern (N.audeberti and N.rufus) and western (N.lambertoni) Madagascar. The only surviving western species, N.lambertoni, is restricted to a <b>relict</b> humid karst area; the presence of N.narindaensis and Brachyuromys mahajambaensis suggests that the past environment in northwestern Madagascar was also more humid. Subfossil remains of Nesomys have been recorded from some other localities in northwestern Madagascar, but these have not been described.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} palynological research of peat <b>relicts,</b> found in the Westerkoggepolder (North-Holland, The Netherlands). In general, such <b>relicts</b> of peat in the actual landscape point to an extensive peat cover {{in the past that}} disappeared due to land reclamation and agricultural management. Improvement of the drainage in historical time resulted in shrinkage and bio-oxidation of peat. This caused a land surface lowering of at least 3 m and a transformation of Histosols in original peat deposits into eluvial clay covers with Mollic Gleysols. Similar processes occur in other regions in the world were people settled in areas with histosols and reclaimed land for food production.
