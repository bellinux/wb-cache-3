30|$|In this section, {{we present}} the study site in Ecuador (ridge <b>forest</b> and <b>ravine</b> <b>forest)</b> {{and the forest}} model FORMIND. For this study, the model was {{extended}} by a carbon balance module and parameterized for the <b>ravine</b> <b>forest.</b> The model parametrization for <b>ravine</b> <b>forest</b> was compared with an already existing parametrization of the ridge forest.|$|R

50|$|Many of the {{calcareous}} <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> on {{the east}} coast of the United States have been logged, and the Virginia Department of Conservation listed this ecosystem as a conservation priority. The Crow's Nest site is one of Virginia's best remaining examples of this rare habitat and associated vegetation types. These communities are rare in the coastal plain ecosystem. The principal rich forest associated with ravines down-cutting into lime sands and localized shell concretions is currently classified as the Northern Coastal Plain/Piedmont Basic Mesic Hardwood Forest and is found on two dry, very steep slopes facing Potomac Creek.|$|E
50|$|Today, shell-marl/calcareous <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> such {{as those}} at Crow's Nest are not common {{anywhere}} in the mid-Atlantic region. These plant communities are rare to this coastal plain ecosystem. There are two nutrient-rich plant communities associated with lime sands and localized shell concretions at Crow's Nest. One can be broadly classified as Basic Mesic Forests (G2, globally imperiled). Another rare community found at Crow's Nest that is typically associated with the shell-marl/calcareous environments is the Basic Oak-Hickory Forest (G2, globally imperiled). These are found on two very steep slopes facing Potomac Creek and represent this plant community.|$|E

A second {{branch of the}} eastern Don, known as German Mills Creek, {{parallels}} the main eastern branch and joins it at Steeles Avenue, the northern boundary of Toronto. South of Lawrence Avenue the river passes through the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve. This area is mostly undeveloped parkland. The reserve occupies the valley south to the forks of the Don. It was at one time home of a Maple sugar shack and tapline, which was visited yearly by students from across East York. Charles Sauriol was a historic protector of the Don.|$|E
50|$|This bird {{is found}} {{typically}} at altitudes between 500 and 2000 m in the undergrowth and thickets of <b>ravines,</b> <b>forest</b> edge, and other semi-open woodland including second growth and large gardens.

40|$|This paper {{deal with}} the coenological {{features}} and the distributional pattern of the broad-leaved <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> in southern Europe (Apennine-Balkan biogeographical province). The initial data set of 2189 relevés was stratified geographically and phytosociologically; 614 relevés remaining after stratification were classified with a TWINSPAN and cluster analysis, wich resulted in four clusters and eight subclusters. Average Pignatti indicator values for relevés of each subcluster were subjected to PCA to show ecological relationships among the clusters. The spectra of geoelements and sociological species groups of individual subclusters were calculated to show phytogeographical and sociological relationships between them. The diagnostic species combination was calculated by a fidelity measure (?-coefficient) and presented in a synoptic table. The results {{have shown that the}} broad-leaved <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> in southeastern Europe form a separate group within the European broad-leaved <b>ravine</b> <b>forests.</b> They are well differentiated by the species with a southeast European distribution, as well as by many other species that reflect their different ecological affinities. The phytosociological and phytogeographical relationships between the Apennines and the Balkan peninsula that have already been recognized for other vegetation types have been confirmed for broad-leaved <b>ravine</b> <b>forests.</b> According to the numerical analysis, two suballiances of broad-leaved <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> in southeastern Europe are proposed, both belonging to the alliance Tilio-Acerion: an amphi-Adriatic xerothermophilous suballiance Ostryo-Tilienion platyphylli suball. nova and a mesophilous suballiance Lamio orvalae-Acerenion suball. nova, the latter appearing only on the Balkan Peninsula...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the forest {{vegetation}} of {{the lower part of}} the dolines in Mecsek Mts. (South Hungary). In order to char acterize this vegetation type, samples were compared to the 6 plant communities occurring in the neighbourhood of the dolines. Considering the vegetation texture and species com position, the vegetation of the dolines resembles mainly the extrazonal beechwoods (Helleboro odori-fagetum) and local <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> (Scutellario altissimae-Aceretum) that preserve several mountain, subatlantic relict species in this area. Our study revealed that the plant communities characteristic of the karst surface of Western Mecsek are arranged along a moisture and nutrient gradient. In this system, the habitat conditions of the dolines are similar to those of the beech forests and the lo cal <b>ravine</b> <b>forests,</b> fresh and relatively rich in nutrients. In the karst, dominated by oak-hornbeam and beech forests, effects of the thermal inversion are the most spectacular where beech forests follow turkey oak-sessile oak forests and oak-hornbeam forests on {{the lower part of the}} doline slopes. The described vegetation type of these depressions is developed by edafic fac tors; its identification as a separate association is not supported by the analyses. ...|$|E

The simulation results showed a good reproduction of basal area and stem number when compared to field data. The estimated aboveground biomass (233.6 [*]±[*] 11.6 tODM∙ha− 1) for mature <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> also agreed well with field values (271.0 [*]±[*] 165.0 tODM∙ha− 1) (Werner and Homeier 2015).|$|E
40|$|Laufkäfer werden in ökologischen Studien zur Lebensraumbewertung sehr häufig als Bioindikatoren hinzugezogen (PLATEN & KOWARIK 1995, PLATNER et al. 1996, POSPISCHIL 1981), denn ihre Ökologie und die daraus resultierenden ökologischen Ansprüche sind durch zahlreiche Studien eingehend untersucht (u. a. BAEHR 1980, LINDROTH 1945, THIELE 1977). Unterschiede in der Artengemeinschaft bzw. Änderungen in der Abundanz der Carabiden lassen Rückschlüsse über Habitatqualität, Standortsfaktoren, Minimalareal- Fragen, Habitattradition und Vernetzung von Lebensräumen zu. Diese Tatsachen wurden ausgenutzt, um die Bestandstradition und die Naturnähe der Bestockung der Probeflächen zu untersuchen. Diese sind weitgehend naturnahe Wälder im südbayerischen Tertiärhügelland, einem insgesamt wenig naturnahen, forstlich durch Fichtenforste geprägten Landschaftsraum. The role of {{isolated}} near natural broadleaved forests {{in a landscape}} dominated by manmade coniferous plantations was investigated using ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) as indicator species. Natural beech and <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> as well as near-natural secondary oak forests, and a pure spruce stand were researched using pitfall traps. The results were ordinated using CCA including 76 additional sites in similar forest associations. The carabid faunas of these associations group together rather well. Wet forests are most distinct, including natural oak-hornbeam forests and wet <b>ravine</b> <b>forests.</b> Dry <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> on calcareous slopes overlap with beech forests on calcareous sites to a certain degree, while acidic beech forests are distinct. The investigated isolated sites do not group with the natural reference sites well, the main reason being „size of forest“ and „size of broadleaved forest“, according to the CCA. These factors {{are to blame for}} an apparent loss of species that could be expected for these sites according to data from similar sites under different circumstances. Especially one investigation area with only about 5 hectares of completely isolated forest and a historical record of large-scale deforestation (for use as a vineyard and as a coppice-with-standards stand) is deprived of many species. In the other investigated area, Carabus purpurascens, absent from the entire tertiary hill land of southern Bavaria, was rediscovered after approximately 100 years in an oak forest. In this site, circumstances are apparently better, albeit not good, again due largely to habitat fragmentation, though not habitat tradition. The species lost on these sites are foremost stenotopic forest species with preference to broadleaved forests, species with a montane distribution and large species (several species of the genus Carabus) with accordingly large requirements for contiguous habitat. The results stress the importance of the protection of forests with a habitat tradition on a sufficient area...|$|E
