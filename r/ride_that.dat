25|$|Business slumped with General Motors {{after the}} second {{sponsorship}} deal ended for World of Motion in 1992, and as a result, GM started signing 1-year contracts for the ride. However, a suggested idea to gut the building {{and turn it into}} a new attraction stuck with Disney representatives and GM businessmen. It would take World of Motion, close it down, and refurbish it into a new <b>ride</b> <b>that</b> focused only on cars. Thus, World of Motion was shut down to the public while a new attraction, called Test Track, was taking its place. Scheduled to open 19 months after World of Motion's closing, this new ride would put guests in a test car against vehicle tests that were needed to deem the car safe for road travel.|$|E

In 1914 the riding was abolished and reformed into two new ridings called Toronto Northeast and Toronto Northwest.|$|R
