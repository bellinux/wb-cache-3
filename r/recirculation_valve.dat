40|$|International audience— Legislation {{concerning}} {{pollutant emissions}} of diesel passenger cars {{is becoming increasingly}} restrictive, especially for nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). This article proposes to apply a CRONE control design methodology on a diesel engine in order to adapt the air-path and fuel-path of the engine and minimize NOx emissions. As the multivariable CRONE control strategies need a nominal transfer function and some frequency response of the system (G(s)), several test-bench experiments and a linear identification of the system were performed. The aim of this approach {{was to find a}} decoupling and stabilizing controller for the combustion engine that minimized NOx emissions at each operating point considered and during transient of torque/engine speed. The system is a square multivariable system with three inputs: Exhaust gas <b>recirculation</b> <b>valve</b> (EGR), variable geometry turbine (VGT), and start of injection (SOI); and three outputs: mass air flow (MAF), boost pressure (Pboost) and NOx level (NOx). The CRONE control approach developed for multivariable square plants is based on the third generation scalar CRONE methodology. Fractional order transfer functions were used to define all the components of the diagonal open-loop transfer matrix, β. Optimisation gave the best fractional open-loop transfer matrix and finally, frequency domain system identification was used to find a robust controller. Performances of the proposed control structure were tested and validated with a number of experiments on a high dynamic test bed (NEDC driving cycle) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{recirculating}} engine-out gases into the intake manifold {{on the cold}} start of direct-injection diesel engines is investigated. Two types of recirculation are examined. The first is low-pressure recirculation of engine-out gases into the intake manifold where their rate is controlled by a gas <b>recirculation</b> (GR) <b>valve</b> installed between the exhaust and intake mani-fold. The second is high-pressure recirculation by restricting {{the flow of the}} engine-out gases using a butterfly (BF) valve, installed in the exhaust system after the turbocharger to increase the back pressure and the rate of recirculated gases. Since there is no combustion during cranking, these gases contain evaporated hydrocarbons and partial oxidation products, mostly formaldehyde (HCHO). Experimental investigations on a four-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine indicated that high rates of cranking gas recirculation (CGR) increase the ignition delay and lengthen the cranking period. Since higher concentrations of hydrocarbons (HC) are expected to enhance the autoignition process, it is suspected that the recirculated HCHO would have an opposite effect. These opposing effects are investigated using the ChemKin die-sel cycle simulation model. The model results demonstrated the effect of HCHO on slowing the autoignition and combustion reactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{powertrain}} controllers {{relies on the}} availability of data-driven models of the emissions formation from internal-combustion engines. Typically these are in the form of tables or statistical regression models based on data obtained from stabilised experiments. However, as the complexity of engine systems increases, the number of experiments required to obtain the effects of each actuator becomes large. In addition, the models are only valid under stable operating conditions and do not give any information as to dynamic behaviour. In this paper, the use of the Volterra series (dynamic polynomial models) calculated from dynamic measurements is presented {{as an alternative to the}} steady-state models.

Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Turbocharging {{is used as a}} means to downsize petrol engines, thereby, producing more power for a lower engine size, when compared with a naturally aspirated engine. Due to the presence of a throttle valve in the intake system in petrol engines, flow is restricted at the outlet pipe of the compressor during low load engine operation. For example, during transient tip out tip in maneuvers. Hence, there is a chance of the turbocharger operating in near surge or surge conditions and, thus, generating surge noise. This Thesis describes an experimental and simulation method to predict and measure the turbocharger surge noise. Initially, experimental transient tip-in and tip-out maneuver was performed on a non turbocharged car with a petrol engine. The measured noise level in the intake manifold, at a low frequency of up to 1200 Hz, was analysed and was shown not to represent surge noise. Next, a one dimensional simulation method was applied to simulate the noise of the engine and this demonstrated an increase in the acoustic pressure level in the intake manifold during the tip in and tip out maneuver. However, a surge noise pattern was not observed in the analysis of acoustic pressure signals in the intake system using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The simulation procedure was also used to inform the design of an experimental rig to recreate the surge noise under laboratory conditions. An experimental turbocharger noise rig, designed and built for this purpose, is explained in the Thesis. Important component parts likely {{to be involved in the}} surge noise generation such as the intake system, compressor, throttle body, compressor <b>recirculation</b> <b>valve</b> and measurement and control systems were integrated into the test rig. Background noise contributions from the electric motor, AC mains, supercharger pulley, throttle body, inverter fan, throttle body gearing and structural vibration of the supporting structure were identified from the analysed frequency components of the signals from surface microphone measurements taken at the intake system. This helped to clearly identify the surge noise frequency components (3250 Hz) in the STFT analysis. The fundamental mechanism of noise generation was identified using an analysis of the experimental results and a frequency calculation for vortex shedding and the radial acoustic resonances. One of the main conclusions of the Thesis is that the compressor <b>recirculation</b> <b>valve</b> (CRV) open or close position, the CRV delay time and the throttle position are major contributing factors to the cause of the surge noise. Another major conclusion is that the radial acoustic resonance may be a mechanism of surge noise generation. Finally, a passive solution to reduce the surge noise is proposed. A pipe with cross ribs is designed as a passive solution using the radial acoustic resonance calculation and the corresponding nodal patterns. This solution demonstrated a measured intake system noise reduction of up to 10 dB under compressor surge conditions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT OPPOSING EFFECTS OF RECIRCULATED GASES DURING CRANKING ON COLD START OF DIESEL ENGINES by RAFIK ROFAIL August 2011 Advisor: Dr. Naeim Henein Major: Mechanical Engineering Degree: Doctor of Philosophy Enhancing {{cold start}} of DI diesel engines is the {{motivation}} behind this study. A new control strategy is proposed {{to reduce the}} cranking period and the white smoke emissions. In the strategy, the gases leaving the cylinder during the cranking period are recycled back into the intake manifold using two different methods. In the first method the engine-out gases during cranking are recirculated into the intake manifold and their rate is controlled by a CGR (Cranking Gases <b>Recirculation)</b> <b>valve,</b> without applying any back pressure on the engine. In the second method a butterfly valve is installed in the exhaust system after the turbocharger to increase the back pressure {{and the rate of}} recirculated gases. Since there is no combustion during cranking, these gases contain evaporated hydrocarbons (HCs) and partial oxidation products such as formaldehyde (HCHO). HCs and HCHO have two opposing effects. HCs enhance the autoignition process, while the HCHO has an opposite effect. These opposing effects are being investigated by three different approaches. The first is experimentally in a multi-cylinder proto-type engine. The second is using high speed imaging in an optically accessible engine. The third is by using CFD and chemical kinetic simulation {{to gain a better understanding}} of the effect of the recirculated gases on the autoignition process during cold starting of a direct injection diesel engine. Cold start experiments are conducted on a 1. 2 L Ford DIATA 4 -cylinder, 16 -valve, 70 mm bore, 78 mm stroke and 19. 5 compression ratio, water cooled, turbocharged and intercooled diesel engine. The engine is equipped with a common rail injection system, EGR system and a swirl control mechanism. The engine is installed in a cold room and the ambient temperature is electronically controlled. Before starting, the engine is soaked at the desired room temperature for at least eight hours. The analysis of the data demonstrated the effect of two CGR methods on reducing the cranking period and HCs emissions. The images showed the effect of aldehydes on hindering the autoignition and combustion processes. The simulation covered a wide range of the hydrocarbons and aldehydes concentrations and their effect on the ignition delay. The simulation results agreed with the experimental findings. The results of this work will help in developing strategies to reduce the cranking period, fuel consumption and white smoke emitted during cold starting of diesel engines. In addition, a more understanding will be developed of the role of aldehydes in combustion instability and misfiring after first firing experienced in cold starting of diesel engines...|$|E
40|$|With {{reference}} to a solar field of small-scale Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTC) which must supply heat at given load inlet and outlet temperatures, this work addresses the issue of annual output losses caused by {{the limitations of the}} admitted flow within the collectors. These limitations make it not possible to maintain the required load temperatures in case of too low or too high solar irradiation. During low irradiation periods, due to the flow rate limits of collectors, a solar field has to work far from the optimal conditions and this can introduce temperature oscillations in the entire system. These oscillations may affect the performance of a power generation systems or prevent the achievement of specific process requirements. To avoid these drawbacks, I have analyzed configurations and control strategies that can keep the desired temperature unchanged even with large variations of available radiation. In particular, I have explored two solar field configurations designed to solve this issue in order to find the one which maximizes the amount of energy provided at a given set of temperatures. These two configurations are: FLEXY: flexible configurations in which the hydraulic loops can be modified during the day to allow 1 or 2 or 4 collectors per loop at different times of the day depending on the available solar radiation; REC: configurations which include <b>recirculation</b> <b>valves</b> to allow for different flows and temperatures in the solar field and in the served load. These two configurations have been compared with a standard static configuration (STD), in which 1, 2 or 4 collectors are arranged in series in a single hydraulic loop. This comparison has been performed for two different locations, such as Bolzano (Italy) and Seville (Spain) over a broad range of operating temperatures. During this work, a fast and lean lumped-parameter model has been developed and validated versus a more detailed TRANSYS-based one. Validation results of TRNSYS-based and lumped-parameter models were in agreement both on daily and annual basis. As final result, REC configurations have been found to provide the best thermal annual performance in the entire considered temperature range. FLEXY configurations have been found to reduce electrical pumping consumption. Through a comparison on harvested primary energy, REC configurations have been found to provide better performance in a wider temperature range.

An Arrhenius integral is then used to model the start of combustion, θsoc. A series of simple algebraic relations that captures the combustion duration and heat release is finally used to model the state of charge after the HCCI combustion and the Location of Peak Pressure (LPP). The model is parameterized and validated using steady-state test data from an experimental engine at the General Motors Corporation. The simple model captures the temperature, pressure, air-to-fuel ratio, and inert gas fraction of the exhausted mass flow. This characterization is important for the overall HCCI dynamics because the thermodynamic state (pressure, tem-perature) and concentration (oxygen and inert gas) of the exhausted mass flow affect the next combustion event. The high dilution level in HCCI engines increases the significance of this internal feedback that generally exists to a smaller extent in conventional spark-ignition and compression-ignition internal combustion engines.
