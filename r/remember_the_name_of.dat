[...] A restaurant in St. Louis named a milkshake the [...] "Wacha Wacha" [...] following his 2013 NLCS MVP honors. [...] The milkshake's ingredients included vanilla with chocolate chips and Cracker Jacks.

500|$|... "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] {{was one of}} {{the very}} first {{psychedelic}} instrumental improvisations recorded by a rock band. It was seen as Pink Floyd's first foray into space rock (along with [...] "Astronomy Domine"), although band members would later disparage this term. [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] originated when early Pink Floyd manager Peter Jenner was trying to hum a song he could not <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> (most commonly identified as Love's cover of [...] "My Little Red Book").

Around the time the song was written, Barrett was also inspired by AMM and their guitarist Keith Rowe, who had a pattern of moving pieces of metal along his guitar's fretboard.

They mostly ignore him, despite his eagerness to talk about his acting experiences and his requests for a drink. Terry is irritable and impatient, unwilling to talk to Tina or Gemma about a prank with him dressed up as a gorilla. This prank led to a young boy wetting himself and a previous cancellation of Scaredy Cam. The programme is due to return on a different channel, and Terry has chosen a different prank to be announced as the winner of a [...] "public" [...] vote for the programme's best. The extra confronts Terry about the fact he was originally cast as [...] "Spirit of Little Boy", but Terry does not care, and the extra is sent back into a chest to wait for the next member of the public.|$|E

Linda Barnier and Ben Doherty of The Newcastle Herald summed Frank up as [...] "the bloke who married tomboy Bobby after he left Roo at the altar, after he recovered from a serious car accident that left him in a coma at a general hospital and before he ran off to the States for a sea change."

2500|$|Further, Pallett writes, in the song's bridge, Perry adds more {{complexity}} to the song—and {{makes it more}} memorable, in his opinion—by taking the simple step of singing the [...] "let you {{put your hands on}} me in my skintight jeans" [...] lyrics entirely on beat, including the reiteration of the song's title. [...] "How brilliant. The title of the song is rhythmically weighted two ways—it's like a flank attack. Two sides of the same face.
