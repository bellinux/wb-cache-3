50|$|Additional {{types of}} loop {{signaling}} are {{signals to the}} central office that the subscriber intends to initiate a second simultaneous call, a three-way conference call, or answer a second incoming call. This signal is called flashing or hook flash, and is performed by interrupting the loop {{for a fraction of}} a second, typically at least 300 ms. The flash signal is longer than a <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> pulse, sometimes <b>called</b> a short flash, and is shorter than the time required for the on-hook condition.|$|R
50|$|Speed dialing is also {{available}} via Custom Calling features from the Telephone Company's Central Office. The numbers are programmed by the subscriber through the standard telephone dial, and speed <b>dial</b> <b>calls</b> are placed by dialing simply the digit and waiting a few seconds on a standard <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> phone and an older 10 key Touch Tone phone, or by dialing the number and the # key to instantly connect the call on a modern 12 key Touch Tone phone.|$|R
25|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> is {{a device}} mounted on or in a {{telephone}} or switchboard {{that is designed to}} send electrical pulses, known as pulse dialing, corresponding to the number dialed. The early form of the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> used lugs on a finger plate instead of holes. The <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. Strowger filed U.S. patent#486,909 on December 21, 1891 that was later issued on November 29, 1892.|$|R

50|$|A {{vertical}} {{service code}} (VSC) is {{a sequence of}} digits and the signals star (*) and number sign (#) dialed on a telephone keypad or <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> to enable or disable certain telephony service features. Some vertical service codes require the dialing of a Telephone number after the code sequence. On a touch tone telephone, the codes are usually initiated with the star key, resulting in the commonly used name star codes. On <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> telephones the star is replaced by dialing 11.|$|R
50|$|Starting in the 1930s, {{the base}} of the {{telephone}} also enclosed its bell and induction coil, obviating a separate ringer box. Power was supplied to each subscriber line by central office batteries instead of the user's local battery which required periodic service. For the next half century, the network behind the telephone grew progressively larger and much more efficient, and after the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> was added the instrument itself changed little until Touch-Tone signaling started replacing the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> in the 1960s.|$|R

50|$|Possibly one of {{the first}} {{phreaking}} methods was switch-hooking, which allows placing calls from a phone where the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> or keypad has been disabled by a key lock or other means to prevent unauthorized calls from that phone. It is done by rapidly pressing and releasing the switch hook to open and close the subscriber circuit, simulating the pulses generated by the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial.</b> Even most current telephone exchanges support this method, as they need to be backward compatible with old subscriber hardware.|$|R
40|$|This paper details a {{user study}} to {{investigate}} serial digit entry on analogue and digital input platforms and the errors associated with them.

The telephone {{is used as a}} platform for comparison, due to its clear evolution from a <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> to a pushbutton keypad and more recently, touch-based input. Thirty participants took part in a user study, which concluded that the touch interface was four times less accurate than the pushbutton and <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> interfaces. The latter two interfaces performed with similar accuracy; however, users were more than three times faster on the pushbutton keypad and recognized almost twice as many errors on the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial.</b> We have extended previous error taxonomies to include some errors relevant to sequences of numbers and built upon task-based guidelines found in the literature to suggest context-based design consideration...|$|R
