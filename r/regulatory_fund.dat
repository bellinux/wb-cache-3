It also has in place quality assurance and consumer protection programmes.   The Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act) and associated Aged Care Principles (the Principles) provide {{the legislative}} framework for the <b>regulatory,</b> <b>funding</b> and quality foundation of Australia’s aged care system and are based on the set of objectives set out in the Act, namely to:   • provide funding that takes account of the quality, type and level of care; • promote a high quality of care and accommodation; • protect {{the health and well-being of}} residents; • ensure that aged care services and funding are targeted towards people and areas with the greatest needs; • ensure that care is accessible and affordable for all residents; • provide respite for families and others who care for older people; • encourage services that are diverse, flexible and responsive to individual needs; • help residents enjoy the same rights as all other people in Australia; • plan effectively for the delivery of aged care services; and • promote ageing in place through the linking of care and support services to the places where older people prefer to live.        ...|$|R

Commonly explained by diverging economic performances, corruption levels or government ideologies, this paper suggest another potential reason for cross-national differences in market reforms: given the high financial dependence of regulatory actors on public funding both {{in the past and}} nowadays, we expect regulators to increasingly refrain from [foster] the implementation of liberalization steps, the more such measures reduce [raise] the revenues of a tax; this prevents [aims at realizing] substantial decreases [increases] in public revenues (being a major source of <b>regulatory</b> <b>funds)</b> and thus most likely also in the regulators' budgets.

The article also seeks to trace the impact of macro and meso influences on micro rural contexts. While many very positive attributes of small rural schools are evident, this article speaks to principalship engagement with contextual problems - issues concerning work intensification, role multiplicity, school viability, new <b>regulatory</b> <b>funding</b> requirements and the abandonment of equity policies in education - since there is a dearth of information in Australia at this time about how school principals confront these challenges in small rural locations.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in the area of infrastructure investment is the provision of funding to finance activities. This paper presents an auction design which can reduce the financing cost of infrastructure investments by allowing the length of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>funding</b> period to be determined via an auction. The auction allows bidders to submit bids against a payment for periods of varying length. Thus instead of, for example, a fixed 20 -year contract period, some bidders might want to bid for financing over a longer period, say 25 or 30 years. This can be desirable in terms of securing more favourable terms in the financial markets. Our auction design can secure efficiency and lower financing costs. Our auction is motivated by the auctions currently being undertaken by the UK energy regulator (Ofgem) for financing offshore transmission assets. Although the auction was designed with electricity transmission in mind, the auction could be used in other areas of infrastructure investment...|$|R
