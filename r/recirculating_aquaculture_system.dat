50|$|Recirculating {{aquaculture}} systems often involve intensive, high-density {{culture of}} a species with limited water usage and extensive filtration. In a typical <b>recirculating</b> <b>aquaculture</b> <b>system,</b> a series of filtration steps maintains {{a high level of}} water quality that promotes rapid fish growth. Steps include solids removal, biofiltration, oxygenation, and pumping, with each one requiring different equipment and engineering considerations.

Using a metagenomics approach, we characterized the ammonia-oxidizing microbiological community of biofilters in a commercial <b>recirculating</b> marine <b>aquaculture</b> <b>system</b> producing hybrid grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus × E. fuscoguttatus). Cloning and sequencing of the amoA gene showed that nitrifying bacteria included Nitrosomonas europea, N. stercoris, N. cryotolerans, N. eutropha, N. estuarii, eight strains of N. marina, and 15 strains not associated with described species. Nitrifying archaea included eight strains of Nitrosopumilus maritimus, N. koreensis, N. piranensis, N. adriaticus, undescribed congeners, and other undescribed archaea. The species composition of the bacterial and especially the archaeal communities was beyond that yet reported for aquaculture biofilters.

50|$|<b>Recirculating</b> <b>aquaculture</b> <b>systems</b> (RAS) {{are used}} in home aquaria and for fish {{production}} where water exchange is limited {{and the use of}} biofiltration is required to reduce ammonia toxicity. Other types of filtration and environmental control are often also necessary to maintain clean water and provide a suitable habitat for fish.

5000|$|The use of biofilters {{is common}} in closed <b>aquaculture</b> <b>systems,</b> such as <b>recirculating</b> <b>aquaculture</b> <b>systems</b> (RAS). Many designs are used, with {{different}} benefits and drawbacks, however the function is the same: reducing water exchanges by converting ammonia to nitrate. Ammonia (NH4+ and NH3) originates from the brachial excretion from the gills of aquatic animals and from the decomposition of organic matter. As ammonia-N is highly toxic, this is converted to a less toxic form of nitrite (by Nitrosomonas sp.) and then to an even less toxic form of nitrate (by Nitrobacter sp.). This [...] "nitrification" [...] process requires oxygen (aerobic conditions), without which the biofilter can crash. Furthermore, as this nitrification cycle produces H+, the pH can decrease which necessitates the use of buffers such as lime.|$|R
