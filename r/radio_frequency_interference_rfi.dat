If the inductance is large enough, the energy may generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark {{may not be enough}} to damage the switch but may still radiate undesirable <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>interference</b> (<b>RFI),</b> which a filter capacitor absorbs.

However, SAR echoes are often contaminated by <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>interferences</b> (<b>RFI)</b> from multiple broadcasting stations.

This article proposed a novel RFI suppression algorithm based on singular spectral analysis (SSA) from a linear invariant systems perspective. It can be seen that SSA algorithm has an equivalence relation with finite impulse response (FIR) filter banks. Besides, this article first introduce two approximated methods which can remarkably speed up spectral decomposition--Nyström method and Column-Sampling approximation--to obtain the coefficients of above SSA-FIR-filter.

They are also occupied by other services like radio and television stations, as well as telecommunication purposes. When the carrier platform passes over these broadcasting stations, the receiver of SAR picks up the signals from these stations also. These interfere signals are called <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>interferences</b> (<b>RFIs)</b> which will overlay the SAR information and become visible in the SAR image [1].
