5|$|After unsuccessfully {{shopping}} {{the album}} to record companies, Chesnutt released it {{himself on his}} website in September 2002 before releasing it on September 24 through his own label <b>Ready,</b> <b>Set,</b> Go!. The album charted for one week on the Billboard 200 and had sold 25,000 copies by March 30, 2003, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly, rearrange the drums, and rerecord his vocals. He {{said in an interview}} for Vibe at the time, [...] "I refuse to re-record it-that defeats the purpose. What about the experience I had in my bedroom? To go back to the studio, I'd be chasing something. If you're listening to it and you love it, then it's already done what it's supposed to do." [...] In September 2002, Chesnutt made the album available through his website, and released it on September 24 on his own label <b>Ready,</b> <b>Set,</b> Go! ...|$|E
