5|$|In September 1216 John began a fresh, {{vigorous}} attack. He marched {{from the}} Cotswolds, feigned an offensive to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> besieged Windsor Castle, and attacked eastwards around London to Cambridge {{to separate the}} rebel-held areas of Lincolnshire and East Anglia. From there he travelled north to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> rebel siege at Lincoln and back east to King's Lynn, probably to order further supplies from the continent. In King's Lynn, John contracted dysentery, which would ultimately prove fatal. Meanwhile, Alexander II invaded northern England again, taking Carlisle in August and then marching south to give homage to Prince Louis for his English possessions; John narrowly missed intercepting Alexander along the way. Tensions between Louis and the English barons began to increase, prompting a wave of desertions, including William Marshal's son William and William Longesp√©e, who both returned to John's faction.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the {{division}} {{had been moved}} to Flanders in February 1917. Initially based at Steenwerck, the following month it shifted north to the Messines area, which was south of Ypres, to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> 36th Division.|$|E

5|$|As the Norse era {{drew to a}} {{close the}} Norse-speaking princes were {{gradually}} replaced by Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods of Lewis and Harris, the MacDonalds of the Uists and MacNeil of Barra. This transition did little to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> islands of internecine strife although by the early 14th century the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, based on Islay, were in theory these chiefs' feudal superiors and managed to exert some control.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Cicero, the Senate {{inducted}} Octavian as senator on 1 January 43BC, yet he also was given the power to vote alongside the former consuls. In addition, Octavian was granted propraetor imperium (commanding power) which legalized his command of troops, sending him to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> siege along with Hirtius and Pansa (the consuls for 43BC). In April 43BC, Antony's forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, forcing Antony to retreat to Transalpine Gaul. Both consuls were killed, however, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.|$|E

5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> suffering of the wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand {{made it impossible to}} use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> pressure inside the muscle compartment {{and reduce the}} risk of compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E

Dawson eventually became independent of McGill and evolved into the first English CEGEP in Quebec. Another CEGEP, John Abbott College, was established in 1971 at the campus of McGill's Macdonald College.|$|E
