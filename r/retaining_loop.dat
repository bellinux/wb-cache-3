40|$|Breaking {{left-right}} symmetry in bilateria is a {{major event}} during embryo development that is required for asymmetric organ position, directional organ looping and lateralized organ function in the adult. Asymmetric expression of Nodal-related genes is hypothesized to be {{the driving force behind}} regulation of organ laterality. Here we identify a Nodal-independent mechanism that drives asymmetric heart looping in zebrafish embryos. In a unique mutant defective for the Nodal-related southpaw gene, preferential dextral looping in the heart is maintained, whereas gut and brain asymmetries are randomized. As genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Nodal signalling does not abolish heart asymmetry, a yet undiscovered mechanism controls heart chirality. This mechanism is tissue intrinsic, as explanted hearts maintain ex vivo <b>retain</b> chiral <b>looping</b> behaviour and require actin polymerization and myosin II activity.

We present evidence that glycoside hydrolase family 70 (GH 70) glucansucrases from lactobacilli, synthesizing α-glucan-type extracellular polysaccharides from sucrose, likely evolved from GH 13 starch-acting α-amylases, via GH 70 4, 6 -α-glucanotransferases.

40|$|AbstractUAP 56 is an {{essential}} eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing factor and mRNA export factor. The mechanisms of its functions are not well understood. We determined the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains of human UAP 56 (comprising 90 % of the full-length UAP 56) at 1. 9 Å resolution. The two domains each have a RecA-like fold and are connected by a flexible linker. The overall fold of each domain is highly similar to the corresponding domains of eIF 4 A (a prototypic DExD/H-box protein), with differences at the loops and termini. This structural similarity suggests that UAP 56 is likely to possess ATPase and helicase activity similar to eIF 4 A. The NTP binding pocket of UAP 56 is occupied by a citrate ion, mimicking the phosphates of NTP and <b>retaining</b> the P <b>loop</b> in an open conformation.

In this paper, we focus on the robust dispatch of generators to overcome the uncertainty of renewable power predictions.

40|$|The Bacillus subtilis ResD-ResE two-component {{regulatory}} system activates genes involved in nitrate respiration {{in response to}} oxygen limitation or nitric oxide (NO). The sensor kinase ResE activates the response regulator ResD through phosphorylation, which then binds to the regulatory region of genes involved in anaerobiosis to activate their transcription. ResE is composed of an N-terminal signal input domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The N-terminal domain contains two transmembrane subdomains and a large extracytoplasmic loop. It also has a cytoplasmic PAS subdomain between the HAMP linker and C-terminal kinase domain.

Loop-like structures characterized by locally lower values of the expansion factor are embedded in a smooth background. These loop-like flux-tubes have squashed cross-sections and expand with height. The distribution of the expansion factors show overall increase with height, allowing an active region core characterized by low values of the expansion factor to be distinguished. The area expansion factors obtained from extrapolation of the SOT magnetogram are compared to those obtained from an approximation of the observed magnetogram {{by a series of}} 134 submerged charges.

40|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{to what extent}} midgut {{rotation}} determines human intestinal topography and pathology. We reinvestigated the midgut during its looping and herniation phases of development, using novel 3 D visualization techniques. We distinguished 3 generations of midgut loops. The topography of primary and secondary loops was constant, but that of tertiary loops not. The orientation of the primary loop changed from sagittal to transverse due to the descent of ventral structures in a body with a still helical body axis. The 1 st secondary loop (duodenum, proximal jejunum) developed intraabdominally towards a left-sided position. The 2 nd secondary loop (distal jejunum) assumed a left-sided position inside the hernia before returning, while the 3 rd and 4 th secondary <b>loops</b> <b>retained</b> near-midline positions. Intestinal return into the abdomen resembled a backward sliding movement. Only after return, the 4 th secondary loop (distal ileum, cecum) rapidly "slid" into the right lower abdomen. The seemingly random position of the tertiary small-intestinal loops may have a biomechanical origin. The interpretation of "intestinal rotation" as a mechanistic rather than a descriptive concept underlies much of the confusion accompanying the physiological herniation. We argue, instead, {{that the concept of}} "en-bloc rotation" of the developing midgut is a fallacy of schematic drawings. Primary, secondary and tertiary loops arise in a hierarchical fashion. The predictable position and growth of secondary loops is pre-patterned and determines adult intestinal topography.
