Using the UK Labor Force Survey, the authors estimate the causal effect of national minimum wage (NMW) increases on the probability of <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> and <b>job</b> exit {{by means of a}} non-parametric Bayesian modelling approach known as Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). The application of this methodology has the important advantage that it does not require ad-hoc assumptions about model fitting, number of covariates and how they interact. They find that the NMW exerts a positive and significant impact on both the probability of <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> and <b>job</b> exit. Although the magnitude of the effect on <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> is higher, the overall effect of NMW is ambiguous as there are many more employed workers. The causal effect of NMW is higher for young workers and in periods of high unemployment and they have a stronger impact on <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> decisions.

40|$|From the 1990 s onward, {{employment}} mismatching was {{a conspicuous}} problem in Japan {{and the development}} of an external labor market to enable the smooth allocation of the labor force became a pressing issue in order to promote structural reform and economic recovery. In that context, we examined job-switching trends, focusing particularly on the effects of <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> methods, which play an intermediary role in labor force allocation. In order to identify the effects of <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> methods, this paper analyzed the relationship between <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> methods and labor market outcomes for job switchers, based on a special aggregation of the Survey on Employment Trends published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and its regression analysis. Labor market outcomes were measured by the length of time required to find a new job ("no-job duration") and the change in wages between the previous and current jobs. The results of the analysis showed that the role played by information intermediation of the <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> methods is an important one, since "friends and relatives" and "introduction by the former employer" were more effective in producing favorable labor market outcomes than "public employment security offices"; that there is potential for "public employment security offices" to achieve better labor market outcomes by strengthening their information intermediation function; and that although "private employment agencies" are effective in producing favorable labor market outcomes and are expected to develop further, they cannot meet the needs of those who have difficulty finding employment, nor is their effect significant in provincial areas, so other <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> methods will continue to be important. ...|$|R
