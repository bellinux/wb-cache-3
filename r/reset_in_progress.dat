40|$|Continuous Commissioning? (CC?) was {{performed}} on a 24, 446 square foot institutional building used primarily to house offices and conference rooms. The building was constructed in 1950, and then had a complete Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) retrofit in 2001 to include new equipment and Direct Digital Control (DDC). Following the retrofit, CC {{was carried out in}} this building, mainly implementing outside air temperature (OAT) based temperature and static pressure <b>reset</b> strategies. <b>In</b> 2008, a second round of CC {{was performed}} (and is still <b>in</b> <b>progress),</b> which has focused on incorporating demand based <b>reset</b> strategies <b>in</b> addition to the <b>reset</b> strategies already <b>in</b> place. This paper examines the advantages of demand based <b>reset</b> strategies used <b>in</b> conjunction with outside air based reset strategies, with this building serving as a case study. In a more general sense, the building also serves as a case study of the benefits of performing multiple rounds of CC in a facility over time. Predicted energy savings from the second round of CC over the first round were reported. Since the second round of CC was still <b>in</b> <b>progress</b> as of completion of this paper, savings were predicted using simulation models developed in Energy Plus, a commercial simulation software package. Actual savings achieved from CC will be determined and presented in a 2 nd paper when sufficient post-CC data have been obtained. This paper also mentions two specific challenges that were encountered and addressed during the second round of CC, including: 1) control of terminal boxes with inline electric reheat, and 2) control of a constant speed multi-zone air handling unit with zone temperature control. Recommendations were made to optimize control relative to these and other issues, in order to improve comfort and energy efficiency in the facility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Building on {{the celebrated}} Krohn-Rhodes Theorem we {{characterize}} classes of regular languages {{in terms of}} the cascade decompositions of minimal DFA of languages in those classes. More precisely we provide characterizations for the classes of piecewise testable languages and commutative languages. To this end we use biased resets, which are <b>resets</b> <b>in</b> the classical sense, that can change their state at most once. Next, we introduce the concept of the scope of a cascade product of <b>reset</b> automata <b>in</b> order to capture a notion of locality inside a cascade product and show that there exist constant bounds on the scope for certain classes of languages. Finally we investigate the impact of biased <b>resets</b> <b>in</b> a product of resets on the dot-depth of languages recognized by this product. This investigation allows us to refine an upper bound on the dot-depth of a language, given by Cohen and Brzozowski. ...|$|R
