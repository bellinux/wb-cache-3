These rites also serve as identity practices which mark the adherents out as Heathens. Strmiska noted that in Iceland, Ásatrú rituals had been deliberately constructed {{in an attempt to}} recreate or pay tribute to the ritual practices of pre-Christian Icelanders, although there was also space in which these rituals could reflect innovation, changing {{in order to}} suit the tastes and needs of contemporary practitioners.|$|E
5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated about as {{frequently}} as boys on surviving Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up to twice as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{children}} of the king could be born inside the Inner Court. Every detail of the birth of the royal child was recorded, including the time of birth, which was to be used later by court astrologers to cast his or her horoscope. Ceremonies concerning the birth and the <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> of the child was performed within the walls of the Inner Court. The birth of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court's streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If the child was a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. The children would live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.|$|E

50|$|The Harita Dharmasutra, a later era Hindu text states {{there are}} two kind of women: sadhyavadhu who marry without going to school, and the brahmavadini who go to school first to study the Vedas and speak of Brahman. The Hindu Sastras and Smritis {{describe}} varying number <b>of</b> Sanskara (<b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage).</b> Upanayana <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> symbolized the start of education process. Like the Vedas, the ancient Sutras and Shastra Sanskrit texts extended education right to women, and the girls who underwent this <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> then pursued studies were called Brahmavadini.

40|$|Contact {{between the}} Western culture and African {{indigenous}} cultures, during the Colonial era, resulted in directional cultural changes in these cultural systems. One of the Gikuyu customs {{most affected by}} this change was the <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> from childhood into adulthood. This study, which was carried out through the standard anthropological technique of participant - observation and focused interviews, examined the form of change that this rite underwent {{and the effect of}} this change on the Gikuyu society. Through the cross-sectional method I traced this change in three generations based upon descent from a living Gikuyu elder. The study shows that the age-grading system, the ceremonies and functions associated with the traditional <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> into adulthood has virtually vanished. Female clitoridectomy has been replaced by the onset of menarche as the <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> into adulthood. Male circumcision has lost its significance as a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> from childhood to adulthood, and is mainly practised as a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> from primary school to secondary school due to peer-pressure. The disappearance of the functions associated with the traditional <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> into adulthood has resulted in an inadequate preparation for the adult roles. The consequence has been a high rate of social problems and a widespread dissatisfaction with the current social life among the Aa-Gikuyu. Department of AnthropologyThesis (M. A. ...|$|R

25|$|Major life stage {{milestones}} are {{celebrated as}} sanskara (saṃskāra, <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage)</b> in Hinduism. The <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> are not mandatory, and vary in details by gender, community and regionally. Gautama Dharmasutras composed {{in about the}} middle of 1st millennium BCE lists 48 sanskaras, while Gryhasutra and other texts composed centuries later list between 12 and 16 sanskaras. The list of sanskaras in Hinduism include both external rituals such as those marking a baby's birth and a baby's name giving ceremony, as well as inner rites of resolutions and ethics such as compassion towards all living beings and positive attitude.|$|E
25|$|The major {{traditional}} <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> in Hinduism include Garbhadhana (pregnancy), Pumsavana (rite {{before the}} fetus begins moving and kicking in womb), Simantonnayana (parting of pregnant woman's hair, baby shower), Jatakarman (rite celebrating the new born baby), Namakarana (naming the child), Nishkramana (baby's first outing from home into the world), Annaprashana (baby's first feeding of solid food), Chudakarana (baby's first haircut, tonsure), Karnavedha (ear piercing), Vidyarambha (baby's start with knowledge), Upanayana (entry into a school rite), Keshanta and Ritusuddhi (first shave for boys, menarche for girls), Samavartana (graduation ceremony), Vivaha (wedding), Vratas (fasting, spiritual studies) and Antyeshti (cremation for an adult, burial for a child).

25|$|Many other <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> are {{practiced by}} Shinto believers, {{and there are}} also many other festivals.

Ceremonies and festivals are long and complex because they need to be perfect to satisfy the kami. If the kami are not pleased with these ceremonies, they will not grant a Shinto believer magokoro.|$|E

25|$|In Ancient Rome, {{the word}} persona meant 'a mask'; it also {{referred}} to an individual who had full Roman citizenship. A citizen could demonstrate his or her lineage through imagines, death masks of the ancestors. These were wax casts kept in a lararium, the family shrine. <b>Rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> such as initiation of young members of the family, or funerals, were carried out at the shrine under the watch of the ancestral masks. At funerals, professional actors would wear these masks to perform deeds {{of the lives of}} the ancestors, thus linking the role of mask as a ritual object and in theatre.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these festivals, ceremonies marking <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> are also performed within the shrines. Two such ceremonies are {{the birth of a}} child and the Shichi-Go-San. When a child is born they are brought to a shrine so that they can be initiated as a new believer and the kami can bless them and their future life. The Shichi-Go-San (the Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three- or seven-year-old girls. It is a time for these young children to personally offer thanks for the kami’s protection and to pray for continued health.|$|E

It is performed at about three months and has godparents of the ceremony. The child is offered implements appropriate to its gender, tools for boys and cloth or thread for girls. If the children grasp them, this is considered a foretelling. All children are offered pencils and paper.|$|E

50|$|Simantonnayana {{ritual is}} {{described}} in many Gryhasutra texts, but Kane states that there is great divergence in details, which may be because the <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> emerged in more a recent era, before it receded into the background. The texts do not agree on whether this <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> was to be celebrated before or after pumsavana, early or late stage of pregnancy, or the nature of ritual celebrations. The texts also disagree whether Simantonnayana was a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the baby or of the pregnant woman, the former implying it must be repeated for every baby while the latter implying {{it was to be}} observed once for the woman with her first pregnancy.|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} Grhyasutras {{differ in}} their point of view, whether the garbhadhana is to be performed only once, before the first conception, or every time before the couple plan to have additional children. To answer this question, the medieval era texts of various schools discussed and offered diverse views on whether the ritual is a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> for the baby's anticipation in the womb (garbha), or for the wife (kshetra). A <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the baby would imply that Garbhadhana sanskara is necessary for each baby and therefore every time the couple intend {{to have a new}} baby, while a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the wife would imply a one time ritual suffices.|$|R
