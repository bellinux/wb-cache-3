25|$|The {{operation}} and maintenance of state run irrigation systems is paid for with fees based on surface area irrigated and not by how much water is used. Generally, the collected fees do not cover the <b>real</b> <b>costs</b> of energy needed to irrigate the land.

Especially for the irrigation sector they advise a shift in policies from supply-focused to demand-focused approach which might reflect the nature of water service products more effectively. Furthermore, they recommend the (re)implementation of fees, duties and tax policies. These are supposed to reflect the <b>real</b> <b>costs</b> of a water unit in order to ensure the security and sustainability of water services.|$|E
25|$|President Carlos Salinas, {{elected in}} 1988, began a {{significant}} sector reform, creating the National Water Commission or Comisión Nacional del Agua (CONAGUA) in 1989, which today remains {{a key player}} in Mexican water supply and sanitation (see below). At the beginning, it was given the task of defining federal policies to strengthen service providers through technical assistance and financial resources. CONAGUA, among other suggestions soon recommended to strengthen the decentralization process, improve the transparency of tariffs and introduce tariff autonomy, based on <b>real</b> <b>costs</b> for the service provision and free of political influence. Consequently, many water laws were introduced or amended, partly following CONAGUA's guidelines. In 1996, 21 states had transferred service provision to municipal service providers.|$|E

This study examined exposure to The <b>Real</b> <b>Cost</b> campaign, including ad and slogan recall, and associations with attitudes and risk perceptions among U. S. adolescents. We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 13 to 17 years (n = 1125) surveyed by phone from October 2014 to June 2015. We assessed aided recall of and attitudes toward four campaign ads and the one slogan. Logistic regression models assessed whether aided recall of The <b>Real</b> <b>Cost</b> ads or slogan was associated with perceived likelihood of serious health consequences of cigarette smoking. Most (88 %) adolescents reported seeing or hearing {{at least one of}} four ads for The <b>Real</b> <b>Cost,</b> and 54 % recalled The <b>Real</b> <b>Cost</b> slogan. The majority of adolescents reported more negative attitudes toward tobacco products after seeing or hearing the ads. Recall of any The <b>Real</b> <b>Cost</b> ad was significantly associated with greater perceptions of serious health consequences of cigarette smoking (Adjusted Odd Ratios (AOR) = 5. 58, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) = 1. 20 – 25. 90).

25|$|The JG thus fulfils an {{absorption}} {{function to}} minimise the <b>real</b> <b>costs</b> {{associated with the}} flux of the private sector. When private sector employment declines, public sector employment will automatically react and increase its payrolls. So in a recession, the increase in public employment will increase net government spending, and stimulate aggregate demand and the economy. Conversely, in a boom, the decline of public sector employment and spending caused by workers leaving their JG jobs for higher paid private sector employment will lessen stimulation, so the JG functions as an automatic stabilizer controlling inflation. The nation always remains fully employed, with a changing mix between private and public sector employment. Since the JG wage is open to everyone, it will functionally become the national minimum wage.|$|E
25|$|Discounting {{began in}} the 1970s and was {{dramatically}} expanded in the 1990s, according to one report. Discrepancy between sticker and average net prices can vary substantially. Estimates vary, but show a consistent pattern of sticker prices being much greater than <b>real</b> <b>costs,</b> sometimes more than double, sometimes only {{one and a half}} times as high. Estimates are that 88% or 67% get some form of discount. One estimate in 2015 was that at private nonprofit four-year colleges, the average first-year student pays 48% less than the sticker price. Generally, the sticker-to-net price discrepancy is greater at private colleges than public universities. For example, in 2011–2012, the average sticker price for tuition, fees and living expenses at private colleges, was $38,590 while the average actual cost was $23,060; at public colleges, the average sticker price was $17,130 and the average actual cost was $11,380. Another estimate was that the average full-time undergraduate gets $6,500 in grant aid along with $1,000 in tax-based aid to offset tuition and fees. There is widespread consensus that the most cost-effective college option is community colleges, which charge on average only $3,000 for full-time tuition.|$|E
25|$|When {{accounting}} for the costs (both <b>real</b> <b>costs,</b> such as time taken to select and recruit a replacement, and also opportunity costs, such as lost productivity), the cost of employee turnover to for-profit organizations has been estimated to be between 30% (the figure used by the American Management Association) to upwards of 150% of the employees' remuneration package. There are both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs relate to the leaving costs, replacement costs and transitions costs, and indirect costs relate {{to the loss of}} production, reduced performance levels, unnecessary overtime and low morale. The true cost of turnover is going to depend on a number of variables including ease or difficulty in filling the position {{and the nature of the}} job itself. Estimating the costs of turnover within an organization can be a worthwhile exercise, especially since “turnover costs” are unlikely to appear in an organization’s balance sheets. Some of the direct costs can be readily calculated, while the indirect costs can often be more difficult to determine and may require “educated guesses.” Nevertheless, calculating even a rough idea of the total expenses relating to turnover can spur action planning within an organization to improve the work environment and reduce turnover. Surveying employees at the time they leave an organization can also be an effective approach to understanding the drivers of turnover within a particular organization.|$|E

500|$|The {{locomotives}} were unreliable at first. Soon after opening, Locomotion No. 1 broke a wheel, {{and it was}} {{not ready}} for traffic until 12 or 13 October; Hope, the second locomotive, arrived in November 1825 but needed a week to ready it for the line– the cast-iron wheels were a source of trouble. Two more locomotives of a similar design arrived in 1826; that August 16s 9d was spent on ale to motivate the men maintaining the engines. By the end of 1827 the company had also bought Chittaprat from Robert Wilson and Experiment from Stephenson. Timothy Hackworth, locomotive superintendent, used the boiler from the unsuccessful Chittaprat to build the Royal George in the works at Shildon; it started work at the end of November. John Wesley Hackworth later published an account stating that locomotives would have been abandoned {{were it not for the}} fact that Pease and Thomas Richardson were partners with Stephenson in the Newcastle works, and that when Timothy Hackworth was commissioned to rebuild Chittaprat it was [...] "as a last experiment" [...] to [...] "make an engine in his own way". Both Tomlinson and Rolt state this claim was unfounded and the company had shown earlier that locomotives were superior to horses, Tomlinson showing that coal was being moved using locomotives at half the cost of horses. Robert Young states that the company was unsure as to the <b>real</b> <b>costs</b> as they reported to shareholders in 1828 that the saving using locomotives was 30 per cent. Young also showed that Pease and Richardson were both concerned about their investment in the Newcastle works and Pease unsuccessfully tried to sell his share to George Stephenson.|$|E

2500|$|The paradox {{was criticized}} by the Austrian School {{economist}} Friedrich Hayek in a 1929 article, [...] "The 'Paradox' of Savings", questioning the paradox as proposed by Foster and Catchings. Hayek, and later Austrian School economists agree that if a population saves more money, total revenues for companies will decline, but they deny the assertion that lower revenues lead to lower economic growth, understanding that the additional savings are used to create more capital to increase production. [...] Once the new, more productive structure of capital has reorganized inside of the current structure, the <b>real</b> <b>costs</b> of production is reduced for most firms. However, critics of the Austrian school argue that using accumulated capital to increase production is an act which requires spending, and therefore the Austrian argument does not disprove the paradox.|$|E

2500|$|The {{individual}} {{opportunity of}} cost is an often overlooked {{cause of the}} rebound effect. Just as improved workplace tools result in an increased expectation of productivity, so does the increased availability of time result {{in an increase in}} demand for a service. Research articles often examine increasingly convenient and more rapid modes of transportation to determine the rebound effect in energy demand. Because time cost forms {{a major part of the}} total cost of commuter transport, rapid modes will reduce <b>real</b> <b>costs,</b> but will also encourage longer commuting distances which will in turn increase energy consumption. While important, it is almost impossible to estimate empirically the scale of such effects due to the subjective nature of the value of time. Time saved can either be used towards additional work or leisure which may have differing degrees of rebound effect. [...] Labor time saved at work due to the increased labour productivity is likely to be spent on further labor time at higher productive rates. [...] For leisure time saving, this may simply encourage people to diversify their leisure interests to fill their generally fixed period of leisure time.|$|E

This study describes The <b>Real</b> <b>Cost</b> message strategy, implementation, and initial evaluation findings. The campaign was designed to encourage youth who had never smoked but are susceptible to trying cigarettes (susceptible nonsmokers) and youth who have previously experimented with smoking (experimenters) to reassess {{what they know about}} the "costs" of tobacco use to their body and mind. The <b>Real</b> <b>Cost</b> aired on national television, online, radio, and other media channels, resulting in high awareness levels. Overall, 89. 0 % of U. S. youth were aware of at least one advertisement 6 to 8 months after campaign launch, and high levels of awareness were attained within the campaign's two targeted audiences: susceptible nonsmokers (90. 5 %) and experimenters (94. 6 %). Most youth consider The <b>Real</b> <b>Cost</b> advertising to be effective, based on assessments of ad perceived effectiveness (mean = 4. 0 on a scale from 1. 0 to 5. 0). High levels of awareness and positive ad reactions are requisite proximal indicators of health behavioral change.

Current findings demonstrate that The <b>Real</b> <b>Cost</b> has attained high levels of ad awareness which is a critical first step in achieving positive changes in tobacco-related attitudes and behaviors.
