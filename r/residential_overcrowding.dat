2500|$|After World War II, <b>residential</b> <b>overcrowding</b> and {{an influx}} of married {{students}} prompted Yale to build temporary quonset huts on undeveloped areas of Pierson-Sage Square. The advent of the [...] "atomic age" [...] prompted a second period of laboratory building. University president A. Whitney Griswold relied on modernist architects for these facilities, breaking with pre-war gothic fervor. He commissioned Paul Schweikher to design Gibbs Laboratory, and Eero Saarinen for Ingalls Rink, and Philip Johnson for the Kline Biology Tower, Chemistry Laboratory, and Geology Building. Like Olmsted and Rogers, Saarinen and Johnson were also called upon to improve the site plan; Saarinen's vision contributed modestly to the configuration, while Johnson's buildings gave Science Hill a central courtyard.|$|E
40|$|Purpose– Residential {{crowding}} {{and underlying}} causes of crowding have been changing across the globe over time. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine the dynamics of housing consumption and residential crowding in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach– While the two‐step Engle‐Granger co‐integration approach based on an error correction model (ECM) is used to test for long‐run relation and short‐run dynamics of housing consumption, the study also uses a multivariate regression model to analyze the factors affecting residential crowding. Along with other variables in previous literature, the study introduces a new institutional factor, i. e. land supply, into the model that analyzes these two issues over a time span of 25 years. Findings– The study's results suggest that many households in Hong Kong still have inadequate housing, and <b>residential</b> <b>overcrowding</b> is a serious issue. Coupled with market forces (e. g. income, housing price, household size), the new land supply factor noticeably has exerted significant influence on the two subject issues under investigation. Practical implications– The paper provides policy implications that to address such deficiencies, the government should change its current land supply policy. A policy shift is recommended away from its "high‐land price" policy towards comprehensive developments in outer urban areas. This institutional change should help improve housing consumption in the territory overall. Originality/value– This study adds knowledge to previous works in analyzing residential crowding and its underlying causes over the years, rather than in a particular point in time. It is also the first of its kind in Hong Kong. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E
40|$|The Gran Chaco ecoregion, a hotspot for Chagas {{and other}} {{neglected}} tropical diseases, {{is home to}} > 20 indigenous peoples. Our objective was to identify the main ecological and sociodemographic determinants of house infestation and abundance of Triatoma infestans in traditional Qom populations including a Creole minority in Pampa del Indio, northeastern Argentina. A cross-sectional survey determined house infestation by timed-manual searches with a dislodging aerosol in 386 inhabited houses and administered questionnaires on selected variables before full-coverage insecticide spraying and annual vector surveillance. We fitted generalized linear models to two global models of domestic infestation and bug abundance, and estimated coefficients via multimodel inference with model averaging. Most Qom households were larger and lived in small-sized, recently-built, precarious houses with fewer peridomestic structures, and fewer livestock and poultry than Creoles'. Qom households had lower educational level and unexpectedly high residential mobility. House infestation (31. 9 %) was much lower than expected from lack of recent insecticide spraying campaigns and was spatially aggregated. Nearly half of the infested houses examined had infected vectors. Qom households had higher prevalence of domestic infestation (29. 2 %) than Creoles' (10. 0 %), although there is large uncertainty around the adjusted OR. Factors with high relative importance for domestic infestation and/or bug abundance were refuge availability, distance to the nearest infested house, domestic insecticide use, indoor presence of poultry, <b>residential</b> <b>overcrowding,</b> and household educational level. Our study {{highlights the importance of}} sociodemographic determinants of domestic infestation such as overcrowding, education and proximity to the nearest infested house, and corroborates the role of refuge availability, domestic use of insecticides and household size. These factors may be used for designing improved interventions for sustainable disease control and risk stratification. Housing instability, household mobility and migration patterns are key to understanding the process of house (re) infestation in the Gran Chaco...|$|E
50|$|Preparation of {{construction}} began in 1997, but the Asian Financial Crisis {{that started in}} the same year postponed the development of Kualanamu Airport. Demand for the new airport resumed after the Mandala Airlines Flight 091 accident in September 2005 that occurred shortly after taking off from Polonia. The accident that took the life of North Sumatra Governor Tengku Rizal Nurdin also caused ground casualties, as the airport is very close to <b>overcrowded</b> <b>residential</b> areas.|$|R
40|$|Background Tuberculosis (TB) in is {{children}} {{different from}} TB in adults {{in terms of}} the difficulty in making prompt diagnosis, the more progressive course of disease and the high-risk for the occurrence of disseminated TB. Transmission of TB in children mostly originates from adults, which the biggest risk is the index case with positive sputum smear. Objective To find out the incidence of TB in children who have close contact with adult TB patients and to determine some risk factors for the development of childhood TB. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted between March to July 2009. We studied children aged less than 5 years old with close contact, living in the same house with adult TB patients. The diagnosis of TB was made based on National TB scoring system for children. Results Of the 50 children, we obtained 17 (34 %) positive children with TB after going through with national TB scoring system for children. There was a significant relationship between AFB positive sputum, passive smokers and <b>residential</b> density (<b>overcrowding),</b> but there was no significant relationship between age, nutritional status, gender of the contact source, and family income per month. Conclusion Only the positive sputum smear has a significant correlation associated with the occurrence of TB in children who have close contact with adult TB patients...|$|R
40|$|Child maltreatment touches almost 700, 000 {{children}} annually. The {{effects of}} child maltreatment range from micro-level consequences, such as behavior problems {{and mental health}} issues, to mezzo-level consequences, such as increased child welfare worker caseloads and <b>overcrowding</b> <b>residential</b> facilities, to macro-level consequences, such as increased costs and policy implications. Data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) were analyzed to examine the factors that impact child behavior in {{children who have been}} reported to child protective services (CPS) as a result of child maltreatment. The model investigated the influence of child, caregiver, and environmental factors on child behavior problems over six years among a nationally representative sample of children age 2 - 18. Methods: A longitudinal multivariate multilevel model was estimated utilizing MLwiN with a three-level nested structure. The model examined individual differences in 4, 997 child behavior problems over six years, testing both time-variant and time-invariant predictors measured during four time periods. Results: Following the estimation of six multivariate multilevel models, results indicated several statistically significant predictors at the child level (i. e., gender, race, age, social skills, maltreatment type, exposure to violence, physical and cognitive health), caregiver level (i. e., age, education, marital status, number of children in the home, number of changes in caregivers, permanent caregiver, physical health, domestic violence, social support, and perception of neighborhood), and environmental-level (i. e., percentage of single parents, access to social services, percentage of white population) on {{at least one of the}} dependent variables. Additionally, interaction effects were tested and a few proved to be statistically significant predictors of child behavior problems as well. Conclusions: Children differ in terms of how they respond to maltreatment and other life events or situations. It is imperative that interventions be individualized to target specific issues and reduce specific behavior problems. Results indicated that improving child social skills and increasing caregiver social support may be key in reducing child behavior problems. Both practice and policy implications are discussed as well as recommendations for future research...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] To {{test the}} {{relationship}} between social class and preventive health behaviour in a British national sample and identify which set of more specific socioeconomic factors best "explained" any observed relationship(s). DESIGN [...] Secondary analysis from a national cross sectional survey of the health attitudes and health behaviour {{of men and women}} aged 18 years and over living in private households in England, Scotland, and Wales. A selection of addresses was made randomly from the electoral register using a three stage design, and then one individual in each household was sampled. A total of 12, 254 addresses yielded interviews with 9003 individuals, a response rate of 73. 5 %. Compared with the census population, the single and divorced/separated are slightly under-represented but otherwise sources of bias are small. PARTICIPANTS [...] The subset selected was 1671 women and 1026 men aged between 20 - 45 years with at least one child under 17 living at home. MAIN RESULTS [...] Social class was strongly associated with the health practices index (HPI, used as a measure of health behaviour) both for women and men (p < 0. 001). The set of factors identified for both sexes as having an impact on this relationship were education, tenure, <b>residential</b> <b>overcrowding</b> index, and salience of lifestyle. In addition, their partner's employment status and household income were relevant for women only. These groups of factors did not totally explain the observed relationship but the proportion of variance in HPI attributable to social class was considerably reduced. CONCLUSIONS [...] Descriptions of the association between social class and health behaviour(s) are of little use to those wishing to mount more effective interventions in health promotion. Multivariable analysis can indicate which specific factors account for much of the social class effect on health behaviour and thereby assist better understanding and targeting of resources...|$|E
