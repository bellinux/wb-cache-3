After eight postponements, the case against Felt and Miller went to trial in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 18, 1980. On October 29, former President Richard M. Nixon appeared as a <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witness</b> for the defense, and testified that Presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt had authorized the Bureau to engage in break-ins while conducting foreign intelligence and counterespionage investigations. It was Nixon's first courtroom appearance since his resignation in 1974. Nixon also contributed money to Felt's defense fund, since Felt's legal expenses were running over $600,000 by then. Also testifying were former Attorneys General Herbert Brownell Jr., Nicholas Katzenbach, Ramsey Clark, John N. Mitchell, and Richard G. Kleindienst, all of whom said warrantless searches in national security matters were commonplace and understood not to be illegal, but Mitchell and Kleindienst denied they had authorized any of the break-ins at issue in the trial. (The Bureau used a national security justification for the searches because it alleged the Weather Underground was in the employ of Cuba.) ...|$|E

50|$|Hauptmann's defense lawyer, Edward J. Reilly, called Hauptmann's wife Anna as {{the next}} witness to corroborate the Fisch story. But upon {{cross-examination}} by chief prosecutor David T. Wilentz, {{she was forced to}} admit that while she hung her apron every day on a hook higher than the top shelf, she could not remember seeing any shoe box there. Later, <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witnesses</b> testified that Fisch could not have been {{at the scene of the}} crime, and that he had no money for medical treatments when he died in Germany of tuberculosis. Fisch's landlady testified that he could barely afford his $3.50-a-week room. Various witnesses called by Reilly to put Fisch near the Lindbergh house on the night of the kidnapping were discredited in cross-examination with incidents from their pasts, which included criminal records or mental instability.|$|R
50|$|At trial, Cheever {{asserted}} {{a voluntary}} intoxication defense {{and argued that}} the methamphetamine use rendered him mentally incapable of the premeditation required for murder. During {{the course of the}} trial, the judge ordered Cheever to undergo a psychiatric examination conducted by a psychiatrist hired by the government. The prosecution sought to bring the transcript of the interview into evidence to impeach Cheever’s testimony regarding the order of events at the Coopers’ residence, which the court allowed. After the defense rested their case, the prosecution called the psychiatrist to the stand as a <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witness</b> to respond to the defense’s claims regarding Cheever’s mental capacity {{at the time of the}} crime. The trial court allowed the psychiatrist’s testimony as a <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witness.</b> The jury found Cheever guilty and, at a separate sentencing hearing, sentenced him to death. The Kansas Supreme Court held that the admission of the government psychiatrist’s testimony into evidence violated Cheever’s Fifth Amendment rights.|$|E

After the trial and Bryan's death, Straton challenged defense attorneys Clarence Darrow and Dudley Field Malone to debate, but was rebuffed.|$|E
50|$|The {{prosecution}} {{then decided}} to call General Smith as a <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witness.</b> On April 7, 1902, in sworn testimony, Smith denied that he had given any special verbal orders to Waller. Waller then produced three officers who corroborated Waller's version of the Smith-Waller conversation, and copies of every written order he had received from Smith, Waller informed the court he had been directed to take no prisoners and to kill every male Filipino over age 10.|$|E
50|$|In law, {{special rules}} apply to {{rebuttal}}; rebuttal evidence or <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witnesses</b> must be confined {{solely to the}} subject matter of the evidence rebutted. New evidence on other subjects may not be brought in rebuttal. However, rebuttal is one of the few vehicles whereby a party may introduce surprise evidence or witnesses. The basic process is as follows: both sides of a controversy are obliged to declare in advance of trial what witnesses they plan to call, and what each witness is expected to testify to. When either a plaintiff (or prosecutor) or defendant brings direct evidence or testimony which was not anticipated, the other side may be granted a specific opportunity to rebut it. In rebuttal, the rebutting party may generally bring witnesses and evidence which were never before declared, so long as they serve to rebut the prior evidence.|$|R

When she asked why, he said he was sad because his mother had left two weeks ago and he hadn't had a chance to say goodbye. A Chicago lawyer who was appointed the children's guardian ad litem in the custody case there said Samson told her that on the night his mother disappeared, he heard his parents arguing from his bedroom, and when he woke up, his mother was gone. Carolyn Levine was recalled and testified that not only had the boy never told her about his mother driving away, he {{would not have been able}} to see anything but a vehicle's roof from his bedroom window.|$|R

50|$|To {{rehabilitate}} a witness, the proponent {{is confined}} to using the same techniques used by the opponent to impeach the witness.

That is a different consideration from the ever-present right to cross-examine any witness, including character witnesses.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first of}} four <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witnesses</b> was Menas Gregory, the former manager of the Bellevue {{psychiatric}} hospital, where Fish was treated during 1930. He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane. Under cross examination, Dempsey asked if coprophilia, urophilia and pedophilia indicated a sane or insane person. Gregory replied that such a person was not [...] "mentally sick" [...] and that these were common perversions that were [...] "socially perfectly alright" [...] and that Fish was [...] "no different from millions of other people", some very prominent and successful, who suffered from the [...] "very same" [...] perversions. The next witness was the resident physician at The Tombs, Perry Lichtenstein. Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying {{on the issue of}} sanity, but Justice Close overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor. When asked whether Fish's causing himself pain indicated a mental condition, Lichtenstein replied, [...] "That is not masochism", as he was only [...] "punishing himself to get sexual gratification". The next witness, Charles Lambert, testified that coprophilia was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but [...] "was a matter of taste" [...] and not evidence of a psychosis. The last witness, James Vavasour, repeated Lambert's opinion. Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish's 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation.|$|R
25|$|Counsel for the Public Prosecutor {{opens his}} or her case by stating shortly {{the nature of the}} offence charged and the {{evidence}} by which the accused's guilt is proposed to be proved. The prosecution witnesses are then examined, cross-examined for the defence and, if necessary, re-examined by the prosecution. When the case for the prosecution is concluded, the defence may invite the Court to dismiss the case on the basis that there is no case to answer. The Court must decide whether there is evidence against the accused which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies every element of the charge against him or her. If there is no such evidence, the accused must be acquitted. If the Court finds that a case against the accused has been made out, it must call on the accused to give {{his or her}} defence. It is up to the accused {{to decide whether or not}} to offer a defence. If the accused elects to do so, he or she, or his or her advocate, may open the case for the defence, stating the facts or law on which the accused intends to rely and commenting on the evidence for the prosecution. The accused may then examine his or her witnesses, and after their cross-examination by the prosecution and re-examination by the defence, may sum up his or her case. The prosecution may then call persons as witnesses or recall persons already examined for re-examination for rebuttal purposes, and such <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witnesses</b> may be cross-examined by the defence and re-examined by the prosecution.

50|$|The {{judge ruled}} against the {{introduction}} of the prosecution's star witness, one of John Bennett's relatives, because the prosecution had called him as a <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witness,</b> instead of a witness offering direct testimony. Page had wanted to surprise Reed by introducing Byrd Rice, John Bennett's nephew, during rebuttal, but Judge Latshaw excoriated the prosecutor for failing to place Rice on his original list of witnesses, which denied the defense its right to hear Rice's testimony before the trial. Latshaw was adamant that Rice could not testify at trial. Later, Rice told reporters what he had intended to testify that his aunt Myrtle Bennett had walked him through her apartment six weeks after the killing and narrated how Myrtle had chased John through the rooms of the apartment with a pistol in her hand. She told Rice that she had fired at him twice from the den and twice more in the living room, the last bullet striking him in the back as he reached for the front door. But the jury never heard this account.|$|E

40|$|This case {{involves}} allegations regarding {{fraudulent use}} of a credit card and identity theft. Appellant Michael Jezdik (“Jezdik”) and the victim in this case, Anna Behran (“Behran”), met in Las Vegas in early 1997. They enjoyed a brief romantic relationship but soon parted ways. Approximately three years later, however, Jezdik and Behran rekindled their friendship. Behran told Jezdik {{that she wanted to}} purchase a home but {{did not know how to}} do so. Jezdik offered to help Behran complete an online mortgage application at his residence. Behran agreed. Throughout the mortgage applicatiosn process, Jezdik acquired access to Behran’s social security number and other confidential information. Approximately one month after Jezdik assisted Behran with her mortgage application, Citibank received an online application for a MasterCard naming Behran as the primary cardholder and Jezdik as the secondary cardholder. As the primary cardholder, the credit card application required Behran’s social security number and date of birth. The application, however, provided Jezdik’s address and stated that Behran was employed by Southwest Advertising, Jezdik’s employer. At trial, Behran denied any responsibility for the credit card application. She also testified that she never authorized Jezdik to use her personal information to apply for a credit card, never used Jezdik’s address to receive mail, and never worked for Southwest Advertising. Citibank approved the application and sent two cards to Jezdik’s address. Citibank’s statements went unpaid. Upon discovering the credit card account in her name, Behran testified that she directed Citibank to close the account. As part of the ensuing fraud investigation, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Detective John Woosnam (“Woosnam”) contacted Citibank and learned that Citibank lost money on the account. Woosnam obtained copies of three credit card receipts and billing statements revealing seventeen purchases made during a two-week period. At trial, Woosnam made a lay comparison of Jezdik’s signature on a copy of a voluntary statement with the signature on the Citibank receipts. While not an expert, Woosnam testified that in his opinion, the signatures were the same. 2 At trial, Jezdik theorized that Behran opened the credit card account and used his address and computer to complete the application in his absence. Jezdik testified that he and Behran had renewed their romantic relationship and that Behran had complete access to his residence. Additionally, Jezdik testified that he and Behran were indeed coworkers at Southwest Advertising. In an attempt to establish Jezdik’s credibility and good character, Jezdik’s attorney asked him during direct examination “Have you ever been accused of anything prior to these current charges?” 3 Jezdik answered “No. ” Later, in the jury’s absence, the State argued that Jezdik’s “no accusation” testimony “opened the door” to specific rebuttal evidence regarding misconduct similar to that alleged in this case. 4 The district court agreed with the state and allowed two <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witnesses</b> to testify. A Detective Olewinski testified regarding an unrelated ongoing investigation of Jezdik. The other witness was Jezdik’s father-in-law, who testified that Jezdik once admitted to using his personal information to open a credit card account without his knowledge or consent. The jury found Jezdik guilty on one count of obtaining and using the personal identification of another, three counts of fraudulent {{use of a}} credit card and two counts of burglary. Jezdik appealed. On appeal Jezdik contends that Detective Olewinski’s and his father-in-law’s testimony constitutes improper character evidence under NRS 48. 045 and inappropriate impeachment evidence under NRS 50. 085. The State argues, however, that neither NRS 48. 045 nor NRS 50. 085 applies because the State elicited the testimony to rebut Jezdik’s own testimony on direct examination...|$|R

5000|$|During the 1990 {{obscenity}} {{trial of}} Dennis Barrie, then {{director of the}} Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, for displaying controversial photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, Reisman was called as the only expert witness for the prosecution. In the previous year, Reisman had authored an editorial in The Washington Times entitled [...] "Promoting Child Abuse as Art" [...] which [...] "accused Mapplethorpe of being both a Nazi and a child molester". The defense argued {{that she was not}} qualified as an art expert, but the judge allowed her to testify as a <b>rebuttal</b> <b>witness.</b> Among her credentials as a media specialist she listed: [...] "preparation of educational videotapes and slide presentations for the Smithsonian Institution as well as having worked for Scholastic magazine, created audio-visual segments for television's Captain Kangaroo show, and did research for Attorney General Edwin Meese's commission on pornography and for the conservative American Family Association." [...] During her testimony, Reisman did not discuss the sexually explicit content of Mapplethorpe's work, but rather she argued that the five photographs were not works of art because they either did not display a human face, or, in the case of Self-Portrait, the face [...] "...displayed no discernible emotion" [...] and absent emotion, the placement of the photographs in a museum implied that the activities displayed were appropriate. During cross-examination by the defense on her views of homosexuality, Reisman testified that [...] "anal sodomy is traumatically dysfunctional and is definitely associated with AIDS." [...] She also claimed that the pictures of nude children legitimized pedophilia. The defense emphasized that Reisman's experience with art was limited to her work as a songwriter.|$|E

[...] According to Fox News, DeMartino's account of subsequent events and conversations was contradicted by [...] "a string of witnesses ... many of them Navy SEALs", who depicted him as [...] "unstable" [...] and [...] "an unreliable witness." [...] Sullivan wrote that [...] "DeMartino's testimony was probably the most important portion of the court-martial" [...] and that most of the conflicts between his testimony and that of other witnesses [...] "aren't {{the kind of thing that}} two people might have different honest recollections about. Rather, to convict, the members would have to believe that a number of officers and petty officers - SEALS and non-SEALs - are lying."

5000|$|Whether a {{statement}} is material or immaterial {{seems to be}} a recondite point. Even as the questions relative to the credibility of a witness, a clear illustration of its operation seems not to be an easy point to determine. Smith argues that questions put to a witness under cross-examination which goes solely to his credit and, he denies it, the general rule is that his answer is final and evidence is not admissible to rebut his denial. [...] Based on this reasoning, the court held in Murray that the accused was not indictable for false statement made when he was permitted to testify in <b>rebuttal</b> of a <b>witness’s</b> denial under cross-examination. In Gibbons the court took a contrary view. [...] In that case, decided by eleven judges (with Martin B. and Cropton J. dissenting), it was held that the accused was guilty, notwithstanding that his statement is inadmissible in law, but logically relevant to the question to be decided, that is the witness’s credibility. The court relied upon Hawkins [...] "…though the evidence signify nothing to the merits of the cause and is immaterial, yet, if it has a direct tendency to material, it is equally criminal in its own nature, and equally tends to abuse the administration of justice, and there {{does not seem to be}} any reason why it should not be equally punishable".|$|R
