50|$|Small <b>red</b> <b>scorpionfish</b> (Scorpaena notata) is a venomous Scorpionfish, {{common in}} marine {{subtropical}} waters. It is {{widespread in the}} Eastern Atlantic from the Bay of Biscay to Senegal, Madeira, Azores and the Canary Islands, including the Mediterranean (rare in northern Adriatic) and the Black Sea.|$|E
50|$|Scorpaena sumptuosa is {{also known}} as the Western <b>red</b> <b>scorpionfish,</b> or scorpioncod. The species is endemic to the coast of Southwest Australia, in a range {{extending}} from Esperance, Western Australia to Point Quobba. Scorpaena sumptuosa is not as toxic to humans as the stonefish of the same region, but able to cause a painful sting.|$|E
5000|$|Scorpaena sumptuosa, the Western <b>red</b> <b>scorpionfish,</b> is {{a deadly}} species of marine fish {{of the family}} Scorpaenidae. It is colored bright red to pale brown, around 400 {{millimeters}} in length, and has tassel-like appendages that aid its camouflage. This species lies in ambush, motionless and disguised amongst corals, where it awaits prey which it sucks into its large and quick mouth. A row of poisonous spines are found along the dorsal region which {{it is able to}} make erect when threatened.|$|E
50|$|The small <b>red</b> <b>scorpionfish</b> is {{native to}} the {{subtropical}} eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Its range extends southwards from the Bay of Biscay to Madeira, the Azores, the Canary Islands and the northwestern coast of Africa {{as far south as}} Senegal. It is found throughout the Mediterranean Sea but is uncommon in the Adriatic Sea. It is present in the Black Sea as the subspecies Scorpaena notata afimbria. It is usually a littoral species but also occurs in deeper water down to a depth of about 700 m.|$|E
50|$|The small <b>red</b> <b>scorpionfish</b> has {{a maximum}} length of about 20 cm {{but a more}} normal adult length is around 15 cm. The head is broad with a short snout and {{upwardly}} angled mouth. There is a short tentacle just above the eye and various other shorter tentacles, spines and flaps of skin decorating the head. The dorsal fin has twelve spines and nine soft rays and the anal fin has two spines and six soft rays. The pectoral fins are large and oval and have seventeen to nineteen rays. There are about forty-four vertical rows of scales on the body but the head, chest and {{the base of the}} pectoral fins are naked. The colour of this fish is generally reddish-brown and there is a large, semicircular pigmented spot between the sixth and tenth dorsal spines. The fins are spotted with brown and the caudal fin is unbarred.|$|E
50|$|The Adriatic Sea fishery's {{production}} is distributed among {{countries in the}} basin. In 2000, the nominal—on a live weight basis—total landings of all Adriatic fisheries reached 110000 t. Overfishing is a recognised problem—450 species of fish live in the Adriatic Sea, including 120 species threatened by excessive commercial fishing, a problem exacerbated by pollution and global warming. Overexploited species include common dentex, <b>red</b> <b>scorpionfish,</b> monkfish, John Dory, blue shark, spiny dogfish, mullet, red mullet, Norway lobster, as well as European hake, and sardines. Turtles and common bottlenose dolphins are also being killed by fishing nets. The depleted fish stock, and Croatia's Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone (ZERP) contributed to accusations of overfishing exchanged between Italian and Croatian fishermen. ZERP was introduced in 2003, but its application to EU member states was suspended in 2004. The depleted stocks of fish are being addressed through a new proposed EU fisheries policy that was scheduled to take effect in 2013, when Croatia acceded to the EU, and restore the stocks to sustainable levels by 2015.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFish protein {{hydrolysate}} was prepared from muscle of small <b>red</b> <b>scorpionfish</b> (Scorpaena notata) by treatment with a protease from the fungus Penicillium digitatum. Protein hydrolysate {{was found to}} strongly inhibit the angiotensin I converting enzyme and exhibited high antioxidative activity through 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging assay. After ultrafiltration, peptides were isolated by a two-step procedure: size exclusion chromatography on a Toyopearl HW- 40 followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a high purification yield of 2. 5 mg of peptide per gram of initial protein. Two major peptides were then identified by nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS), corresponding to the following sequences: Leu-Val-Thr-Gly-Asp-Asp-Lys-Thr-Asn-Leu-Lys (1, 204. 665 Da) and Asp-Thr-Gly-Ser-Asp-Lys-Lys-Gln-Leu (992. 511 Da). These peptides, mainly composed of hydrophilic amino acids, showed high antioxidative and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activities. These {{data suggest that the}} two novel peptides isolated from the muscle hydrolysate of small <b>red</b> <b>scorpionfish</b> can be a beneficial ingredient for functional foods or pharmaceuticals against hypertension and oxidative stress.

40|$|The {{identification}} of three scorpionfish species, the black scorpionfish (Scorpaena porcus Linnaeus, 1758), the large-scaled scorpionfish (S. scrofa Linnaeus, 1758) {{and the small}} <b>red</b> <b>scorpionfish</b> (S. notata Rafinesque, 1810) is possible in adults by morphometry, but often problematic in juveniles due to their similar phenotypes. To develop a molecular species identification tool, first, we have analyzed the genetic similarity of the three species by a PCR-based ‘blind method’ that amplified bands from various locations of the genome. We found high levels of nucleotide similarity between S. porcus and S. scrofa, whereas S. notata showed {{a higher level of}} divergence from the other two species. Then, we have searched these patterns for differences between the genomes of Adriatic specimen of these three species and identified several species-specific products in two of them. For the third one a species-specific primer pair amplifying from the 16 S ribosomal DNA was designed. One marker for each species was cloned, sequenced and converted into Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) markers amplified by specific primer pairs. The SCAR markers amplified robust bands of limited variability from the target species, while no or only occasional weak products were obtained from the other two, proving that they can be used for molecular {{identification of}} these three species. These markers can help the conservation and future analysis of these three species as well as their possible selection programs for aquaculture purposes...|$|E
40|$|Biogenic {{detritic}} beds with {{accumulation of}} free-living calcareous algae, known as “maërl” or “rhodoliths”, {{are one of}} the most biodiversity-rich habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. Rhodoliths form a perennial, heterogeneous habitat that houses a complex structural and functional community, helping to create an ecosystem with high species diversity, as well as a nursery area, food and shelter for many species of commercial interest. The importance of this habitat has determined its designation as habitat of Community importance of the Barcelona Convention and the inclusion of some of its constituent species in Annex V of the Habitats Directive (92 / 43) of the European Union. Maërl/rhodolith beds are threatened by human impacts; among them, bottom trawl fishing is a major cause of disturbance. However other fisheries may also produce impacts. The trammel-net, one of the most traditional fishing gears in the Mediterranean, is widely used by artisanal fleets to catch various species of high commercial value, including the European spiny lobster Palinurus elephas (Fabricius, 1787) and the <b>red</b> <b>scorpionfish</b> Scorpaena scrofa Linnaeus, 1758, and its impacts on maërl habitats are poorly known. The ubiquity of fishing activities over maërl beds has hampered research on their impacts for lack of reference values of a pristine state. Maërl / rhodoliths beds are characteristic of the Marine Reserve Columbretes Islands (NW Mediterranean). The reserve, 30 miles away from the coast and with an extension of 55 km, is protected from extractive activities since its creation in 1990, while both bottom trawl and artisanal fisheries continue to operate in its surroundings. This study examines maërl species composition and structure within the marine reserve and in open fishing grounds adjacent to it to assess the cumulative impacts of fishing. The results of the first sampling survey are presentedPeer Reviewe...|$|E
