50|$|The next year, <b>Rasse</b> {{teamed up}} with the {{recently}} turned face Kagetora to win the Tohoku Tag Team Championship against Kei and Shu Sato, eventually unifying it with the Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship from Hideyoshi and Masamune at the Pro Wrestling Summit 2007 independent event. They retained it successfully {{for the rest of}} 2007, even winning the next tag league while having the titles, but they finally lost the two titles against Osaka Pro representatives Gaina and Zero and MPW homologues Great Sasuke and Yoshitsune. The same year, <b>Rasse</b> competed individually at the prestigious Fukumen World League, but was eliminated at the first round by another Osaka Pro wrestler, Tigers Mask. Now titleless, <b>Rasse</b> struggled through 2008, but despite a good performance at the Iron Man and another tag team with Kagetora, he was frustrated. After a failed title shot against Hayato Fujita, now leader of the Kowloon heel stable, <b>Rasse</b> shockingly turned heel and joined them, later pledging his alliance to who revealed as the true leader of the group, their master Último Dragón.|$|E

50|$|Starting 2005, <b>Rasse</b> {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with GARUDA, first at the Michinoku Trios League (completing the trio with Maguro Ooma) {{and then in the}} Futaritabi Tag Team Tournament, but they were unsuccessful, getting eliminated at the latter by the eventual winning team of Shanao and Kagetora. <b>Rasse</b> spent the year as a low-ranked member of the Michinoku Seikigun against the heel stable Los Salseros Japoneses, though he had some victories, upsetting Kagetora and Gamma during the Iron Man Tournament. However, he ascended the scale in 2006, reaching the finals of a tournament for the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight title before LSJ leader Takeshi Minamino and actually winning the next Iron Man after pinning Hayato Fujita with the Mabataki. Doing this, he won a title short against the next junior heavyweight champion, Osaka Pro Wrestling's Super Delfín, but was defeated. <b>Rasse</b> then returned to the midcard, teaming up with Yoshitsune until end of 2006.|$|E

50|$|In midst 2006, Hayato {{returned}} to Japan and started ascending the scale, standing {{out for his}} hard shoot-style wrestling style, which differed from the acrobatic, complex lucharesu predominantly practised in Michinoku Pro. He gave a good performance at the Tetsujin Tournament, defeating the likes of Banana Senga, Ken45º and Osaka Pro Wrestling representative Tigers Mask before being pinned by <b>Rasse</b> at the finals. He also was sent to Osaka Pro {{to compete in the}} Tennozan Tournament, getting eliminated by Tigers Mask. Fujita initially competed as a face, opposing the heel faction STONED led by Kagetora, but after the disbandment of STONED, he eventually turned heel and created the Kowloon stable with its remants, among them Kei and Shu Sato and Maguro Ooma. Through 2008, Hayato wrestled against the top faces, namely Yoshitsune, <b>Rasse</b> and Kagetora, and went to defeat the first of them in December 2008 to win the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship. He retained the title before <b>Rasse</b> and MPW founder The Great Sasuke, until that he lost it in September 2009 against the debuting Kenou. Fujita and Kenou got into a heated feud, helped by Kenou's stiff wrestling style being highly similar to Hayato's own. Kenou frustrated Fujita's attempts to win the Michinoku Tag League 2009 and regain the championship, while Hayato focused in commanding Kowloon until he got injured starting 2010.|$|E

50|$|Kagetora and he {{eventually}} kept their alliance {{and participated in}} the Futaritabi Tag Team Tournament 2005, winning the league after beating Los Salseros Japoneses again, but Kagetora suddenly turned heel and attacked Shanao, going to form the villainous stable Stoned. Now back with <b>Rasse,</b> Shanao {{and he had a}} shot for the Tohoku Tag Team Championship held by The Great Sasuke and Dick Togo, but despite their effort, they were beaten. Days after, Shanao announced he was going to perform a genpuku ceremony in order to advance in his career, which was officiated by Jinsei Shinzaki. Shanao then changed his name to Yoshitsune (Yoshitsune), openly showing his identity, and changed his outfit to a samurai-like attire in purple, red and golden.

Ended the league, Yoshitsune returned to his alliance with the home army and joined The Great Sasuke for the Futaritabi Tag Team League; although Sasuke and him eliminated the team of <b>Rasse</b> and Kagetora, an injury to Sasuke obliged them to exit the tournament and allow their opponents to advance round. Stardom finally came to Yoshitsune on November, however, when defeated Osaka Pro Wrestling representative Gaina in a match for the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship.
