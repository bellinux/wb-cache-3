5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, <b>retinol,</b> tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. <b>Retinol</b> is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, <b>retinol</b> or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E
5|$|Nonpolar {{antioxidants}} such as eugenol—a {{major component}} of oil of cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted essential oils. Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and <b>Retinol</b> Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|Phototrophic archaea use {{light to}} produce {{chemical}} {{energy in the}} form of ATP. In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes in the structure of a <b>retinol</b> cofactor buried {{in the center of the}} protein.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{production}} of <b>retinol</b> typically requires retinal synthesis through reduction of a pentadiene derivative and subsequent acidification/hydrolysis {{of the resulting}} isomer to produce <b>retinol.</b> Pure <b>retinol</b> is extremely sensitive to oxidization and is prepared and transported at low temperatures and oxygen free atmospheres. When prepared as a dietary supplement, <b>retinol</b> is stabilized as the ester derivatives retinyl acetate or retinyl palmitate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinol</b> is {{synthesized}} {{from the}} breakdown of β-carotene. First the β-carotene 15-15’-monooxygenase cleaves β-carotene at the central double bond, creating an epoxide. This epoxide is then attacked by water creating two hydroxyl groups {{in the center of}} the structure. The cleavage occurs when these alcohols are reduced to the aldehydes using NADH. This compound is called retinal. Retinal is then reduced to <b>retinol</b> by the enzyme <b>retinol</b> dehydrogenase. <b>Retinol</b> dehydrogenase is an enzyme that is dependent on NADH.|$|E
25|$|Bracketed {{values are}} <b>retinol</b> {{activity}} equivalences (RAEs) {{and percentage of}} the adult male RDA, per 100 grams of the foodstuff (average). Conversion of carotene to <b>retinol</b> varies {{from person to person}} and bioavailability of carotene in food varies.|$|E
25|$|A sample {{vegan diet}} {{for one day}} that {{provides}} sufficient vitamin A has been published by the Food and Nutrition Board (page 120). On the other hand, reference values for <b>retinol</b> or its equivalents, provided by the National Academy of Sciences, have decreased. The RDA (for men) established in 1968 was 5000 IU (1500 μg <b>retinol).</b> In 1974 the RDA was revised to 1000 RE (1000 μg <b>retinol).</b> As of 2001 the RDA for adult males is now 900 RAE (900 μg or 3000 IU <b>retinol).</b> This is equivalent to 1800 μg of β-carotene supplement (3000 IU) or 10800 μg of β-carotene in food (18000 IU).|$|E
25|$|When {{referring}} to dietary allowances or nutritional science, <b>retinol</b> is usually measured in international units (IU). IU refers to biological activity and therefore {{is unique to}} each individual compound, however 1 IU of <b>retinol</b> is equivalent to approximately 0.3 micrograms (300 nanograms).|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinol</b> is used {{to treat}} vitamin A deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Transthyretin (TTR) is a {{transport}} protein in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid {{that carries the}} thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) and retinol-binding protein bound to <b>retinol.</b> This is how transthyretin gained its name: transports thyroxine and <b>retinol.</b> The liver secretes transthyretin into the blood, and the choroid plexus secretes TTR into the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
25|$|In {{foods of}} animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, {{primarily}} retinyl palmitate, which {{is converted to}} <b>retinol</b> (chemically an alcohol) in the small intestine. The <b>retinol</b> form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and {{can be converted to}} and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A {{deprived}} rats {{can be kept}} in good {{general health}} with supplementation of retinoic acid. This reverses the growth-stunting effects of vitamin A deficiency, as well as early stages of xerophthalmia. However, such rats show infertility (in both male and females) and continued degeneration of the retina, showing that these functions require retinal or <b>retinol,</b> which are interconvertible but which cannot be recovered from the oxidized retinoic acid. The requirement of <b>retinol</b> to rescue reproduction in vitamin A deficient rats is now known {{to be due to}} a requirement for local synthesis of retinoic acid from <b>retinol</b> in testis and embryos.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two sources}} of dietary vitamin A. Active forms, which are {{immediately}} {{available to the}} body are obtained from animal products. These are known as retinoids and include retinaldehyde and <b>retinol.</b> Precursors, also known as provitamins, which must be converted to active forms by the body, are obtained from fruits and vegetables containing yellow, orange and dark green pigments, known as carotenoids, the most well-known being β-carotene. For this reason, amounts of vitamin A are measured in <b>Retinol</b> Equivalents (RE). One RE is equivalent to 0.001mg of <b>retinol,</b> or 0.006mg of β-carotene, or 3.3 International Units of vitamin A.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{conversion}} of <b>retinol</b> from provitamin carotenoids by {{the human body is}} actively regulated by the amount of <b>retinol</b> available to the body, {{the conversion}}s apply strictly only for vitamin A-deficient humans. The absorption of provitamins depends greatly on the amount of lipids ingested with the provitamin; lipids increase the uptake of the provitamin.|$|E
25|$|As some {{carotenoids}} can {{be converted}} into vitamin A, {{attempts have been made}} to determine how much of them in the diet is equivalent to a particular amount of <b>retinol,</b> so that comparisons can be made of the benefit of different foods. The situation can be confusing because the accepted equivalences have changed. For many years, a system of equivalencies in which an international unit (IU) was equal to 0.3 μg of <b>retinol,</b> 0.6 μg of β-carotene, or 1.2 μg of other provitamin-A carotenoids was used. Later, a unit called <b>retinol</b> equivalent (RE) was introduced. Prior to 2001, one RE corresponded to 1 μg <b>retinol,</b> 2 μg β-carotene dissolved in oil (it is only partly dissolved in most supplement pills, due to very poor solubility in any medium), 6 μg β-carotene in normal food (because it is not absorbed as well as when in oils), and 12 μg of either α-carotene, γ-carotene, or β-cryptoxanthin in food.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} known routes to <b>retinol</b> {{that are used}} industrially, all of which start with β-ionone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinol</b> was {{discovered}} in 1909, isolated in 1931, and first made in 1947. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Retinol</b> is available as a generic medication and over the counter. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.02 to 0.30 USD per 50,000 units. In the United States it is not very expensive.|$|E
25|$|Animal species differ {{greatly in}} their ability to convert retinyl (beta-ionone) {{containing}} carotenoids to retinals. Carnivores in general are poor converters of dietary ionone-containing carotenoids. Pure carnivores such as ferrets lack β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinals at all (resulting in carotenes not being a form of vitamin A for this species); while cats can convert a trace of β-carotene to <b>retinol,</b> although the amount is totally insufficient for meeting their daily <b>retinol</b> needs.|$|E
25|$|TTR also acts as {{a carrier}} of <b>retinol</b> (vitamin A) through its {{association}} with retinol-binding protein (RBP) in the blood and the CSF.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinol</b> at normal doses is well tolerated. High doses {{may result}} in an {{enlarged}} liver, dry skin, or hypervitaminosis A. High doses during pregnancy {{may result in}} harm to the baby. <b>Retinol</b> is in the vitamin A family. It {{or other forms of}} vitamin A are needed for eye sight, maintenance of the skin, and human development. It is converted in the body to retinal and retinoic acid through which it acts. Dietary sources include fish, dairy products, and meat.|$|E
25|$|Retinyl palmitate {{has been}} used in skin creams, where it is broken down to <b>retinol</b> and ostensibly metabolised to retinoic acid, which has potent {{biological}} activity, as described above.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic <b>retinol</b> is marketed {{under the}} {{following}} trade names: Acon, Afaxin, Agiolan, Alphalin, Anatola, Aoral, Apexol, Apostavit, Atav, Avibon, Avita, Avitol, Axerol, Dohyfral A, Epiteliol, Nio-A-Let, Prepalin, Testavol, Vaflol, Vi-Alpha, Vitpex, Vogan, and Vogan-Neu.|$|E
25|$|Eating foods high in vitamin A {{or taking}} dietary supplements, <b>retinol</b> or retinal will prevent a deficiency. The foods highest in vitamin A are any {{pigmented}} {{fruits and vegetables}} and leafy green vegetables also provide beta-Carotene.|$|E
25|$|ALDH is a {{ubiquitous}} {{aldehyde dehydrogenase}} family of enzymes, which catalyzes the oxidation of aromatic aldehydes to carboxyl acids. For instance, {{it has a}} role in conversion of <b>retinol</b> to retinoic acid, which is essential for survival.|$|E
25|$|These {{peripheral}} proteins {{function as}} carriers of non-polar compounds between {{different types of}} cell membranes or between membranes and cytosolic protein complexes. The transported substances are phosphatidylinositol, tocopherol, gangliosides, glycolipids, sterol derivatives, <b>retinol,</b> fatty acids, water, macromolecules, red blood cells, phospholipids, and nucleotides.|$|E
25|$|ULs are {{for natural}} and {{synthetic}} <b>retinol</b> ester forms of vitamin A. Beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids from foods and dietary supplements are not added when calculating total vitamin A intake for safety assessments, {{although they are}} included as RAEs for RDA and AI calculations.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A is an {{essential}} nutrient for mammals which takes form in either <b>retinol</b> or the provitamin beta-Carotene. It helps regulation of cell division, cell function, genetic regulation, helps enhance the immune system, and is required for brain function, chemical balance, growth {{and development of the}} central nervous system and vision.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinol,</b> {{the form}} of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester. It is also commercially {{produced}} and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate.|$|E
25|$|Retinoic acid receptors {{are another}} subset of nuclear receptors. They can be {{activated}} by an endocrine-synthesized ligand that entered the cell by diffusion, a ligand synthesised from a precursor like <b>retinol</b> {{brought to the}} cell through the bloodstream or a completely intracellularly synthesised ligand like prostaglandin. These receptors {{are located in the}} nucleus and are not accompanied by HSPs. They repress their gene by binding to their specific DNA sequence when no ligand binds to them, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A, or <b>retinol,</b> is {{the sole}} vitamin which is {{embryotoxic}} even in a therapeutic dose, for example in multivitamins, because its metabolite, the retinoic acid, {{plays an important role}} as a signal molecule in the development of several tisues and organs. Its natural precursor, the β-carotene, is considered safe, whereas the consumption of animal liver can lead to malformation, as the liver stores lipophile vitamins, including <b>retinol.</b> Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic-acid; brand name Roaccutane), vitamine A analog, which is often used to treat severe acne, is such a strong teratogen that just a single dose taken by a pregnant woman (even transdermally) may result in serious birth defects. Because of this effect, most countries have systems in place to ensure that it is not given to pregnant women, and that the patient is aware of {{how important it is to}} prevent pregnancy during and at least one month after treatment. Medical guidelines also suggest that pregnant women should limit vitamin A intake to about 700 μg/day, as it has teratogenic potential when consumed in excess. Vitamine A and similar substances can induce spontaneous abortions, premature births, defects of eyes (microphthalmia), ears, thymus, face deformities, neurological (hydrocephalus, microcephalia) and cardiovascular defects, as well as mental retardation.|$|E
25|$|The carotenes alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene; and the {{xanthophyll}} beta-cryptoxanthin (all {{of which}} contain beta-ionone rings), {{but no other}} carotenoids, function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals, which possess the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase which cleaves beta-carotene in the intestinal mucosa and converts it to <b>retinol.</b> In general, carnivores are poor converters of ionone-containing carotenoids, and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinal (resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species).|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinol,</b> {{also known}} as Vitamin A1, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary {{supplement}}. As a supplement {{it is used to}} treat and prevent vitamin A deficiency, especially that which is resulting in xerophthalmia. In areas where deficiency is common a single large dose is recommended to those at high risk {{a couple of times a}} year. It is also used to prevent further issues in those who have measles. It is used by mouth or injection into a muscle.|$|E
25|$|Using field-friendly technologies, the DHS Program is able {{to collect}} {{biomarker}} data relating to conditions and infections. DHS surveys have tested for anemia (by measuring hemoglobin), HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and the herpes simplex virus, serum <b>retinol</b> (Vitamin A), lead exposure, high blood pressure, and immunity from vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and tetanus. Traditionally, much of the data gathered in DHS surveys is self-reported. Biomarkers complement this information by providing an objective profile of a specific disease or health condition in a population. Biomarker data contributes {{to the understanding of}} behavioral risk factors and determinants of different illnesses.|$|E
25|$|Secondary vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{is associated}} with chronic malabsorption of lipids, impaired bile production and release, and chronic exposure to oxidants, such as cigarette smoke, and chronic alcoholism. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin and depends on micellar solubilization for dispersion into the small intestine, which results in poor use of vitamin A from low-fat diets. Zinc deficiency can also impair absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A because {{it is essential for}} the synthesis of the vitamin A transport proteins and as the cofactor in conversion of <b>retinol</b> to retinal. In malnourished populations, common low intakes of vitamin A and zinc increase the severity of vitamin A deficiency and lead physiological signs and symptoms of deficiency. A study in Burkina Faso showed major reduction of malaria morbidity with combined vitamin A and zinc supplementation in young children.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} geometric isomers of <b>retinol,</b> retinal and {{retinoic acid}} are possible {{as a result}} of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration (as seen in the structure of all-trans-retinol shown here). Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Rhodopsin is composed of the 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a Schiff base to the opsin protein (either rod opsin or blue, red or green cone opsins). The process of vision relies on the light-induced isomerisation of the chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans resulting in a change of the conformation and activation of the photoreceptor molecule. One of the earliest signs of vitamin A deficiency is night-blindness followed by decreased visual acuity.|$|E
