40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{shortage}} of nurse educators {{has an effect}} on the training of current and future nurses. A {{shortage of}} nurse educators leads to the inability {{to increase the number of}} student nurses, which results in a lack of trained nursing staff to meet the healthcare needs of the South African population. There is a need to gain an understanding of why nurse educators enter into and <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> academia versus the reasons why nurse practitioners – specifically registered nurses (RN) – choose to enter into and <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> practice. The prioritised reasons for entering into and <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> nurse academia were investigated with a focus on: i.) The difference between the reasons why RNs enter into and <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> nursing practice ii.) The difference between the reasons why nurse educators enter into and <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> academia iii.) The difference between the reasons why RNs enter into nursing practice and reasons for nurse educators entering into academia iv.) The difference between the reasons why RNs <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> nursing practice and reasons why nurse educators <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> academia A descriptive, quantitative design was used to explore the factors that lead to nurses entering into and <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> academia. An on-line, self-administered survey was used as the primary data collection instrument. Data was tabulated and presented in histograms and frequencies. The study found that: i.) RNs enter into and <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> nursing practice for the same reasons ii.) That nurse educators enter into and <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> academia for different reasons iii.) That RNs enter into nursing practice and nurse educators enter into academia for different reasons iv.) The primary reason for RNs <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> nursing practice and nurse educators <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> academia are the same The shortage of nurse educators is critical and it is essential that NEIs begin to institute plans focussing on the reasons behind nurse educators’ decision to stay in nursing education. Private NEIs should use the findings of this study to focus on areas that indicate satisfaction with the position rather than dissatisfaction in order to develop specific attraction and retention strategies...|$|R

30|$|From Table  5, in Nordic {{countries}} {{people between}} the ages of 16 – 24 are the most mobile on average and their mobility has increased over time.

In Nordic countries, highly educated individuals generally display both a higher probability of <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> employment and a lower probability of <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> unemployment and inactivity over time, while female workers display a lower probability of <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> both employment and unemployment over time (Table  4).|$|R
