60|$|But now {{the time}} arrived which {{threatened}} to frustrate the patriotism of the Maltese themselves, {{and all the}} zealous efforts of their disinterested friend. Soon after the war had {{for the first time}} become indisputably just and necessary, the people at large and a majority of independent senators, incapable, as it might seem, of translating their fanatical anti-Jacobinism into a well-grounded, yet equally impassioned, anti-Gallicanism, grew impatient for peace, or rather for a name, under which the most terrific of all wars would be incessantly waged against us. Our conduct was not much wiser than that of the weary traveller, who having proceeded half way on his journey, procured a short rest for himself by getting up behind a chaise which was going the contrary road. In the strange treaty of Amiens, in which we neither recognised our former relations with France nor with the other European powers, nor formed any new ones, the compromise concerning Malta formed the prominent feature; and its nominal <b>re-delivery</b> to the Order of St. John was authorised, {{in the minds of the}} people, by Lord Nelson's opinion of its worthlessness to Great Britain in a political or naval view. It is a melancholy fact, and one that must often sadden a reflective and philanthropic mind, how little moral considerations weigh even with the noblest nations, how vain are the strongest appeals to justice, humanity, and national honour, unless when the public mind is under the immediate influence of the cheerful or vehement passions, indignation or avaricious hope. In the whole class of human infirmities there is none that make such loud appeals to prudence, and yet so frequently outrages its plainest dictates, as the spirit of fear. The worst cause conducted in hope is an overmatch for the noblest managed by despondency; in both cases, an unnatural conjunction that recalls the old fable of Love and Death, taking each the arrows of the other by mistake. When islands that had courted British protection in reliance upon British honour, are with their inhabitants and proprietors abandoned to the resentment which we had tempted them to provoke, what wonder, if the opinion becomes general, that alike to England as to France, the fates and fortunes of other nations are but the counters, with which the bloody game of war is played; and that notwithstanding the great and acknowledged difference between the two Governments during possession, yet the protection of France is more desirable because it is more likely to endure? for what the French take, they keep. Often both in Sicily and Malta have I heard the case of Minorca referred to, where a considerable portion of the most respectable gentry and merchants (no provision having been made for their protection on the <b>re-delivery</b> of that island to Spain) expiated in dungeons the warmth and forwardness of their predilection for Great Britain.|$|E
50|$|A {{bunker clause}} {{stipulates}} that the charterer shall accept {{and pay for}} all fuel oil in the vessel's bunkers at port of delivery and conversely, (owners) shall pay for all fuel oil in the vessel's bunkers at port of <b>re-delivery</b> at current price at the respective ports. It is customary to agree upon a certain minimum and maximum quantity in bunkers on <b>re-delivery</b> of the vessel..|$|E
5000|$|The {{civilian}} firms under individual contracts {{from the}} CRO were mostly existing companies {{engaged in the}} production, maintenance, repair and operation of aircraft in the UK. Those were supplemented by additional companies in the engineering and woodworking industrial sectors. Repairs to whole aircraft or parts of aircraft were often carried out in dispersed industrial factories, then transported to airfields for re-assembly and test flying, before <b>re-delivery</b> to RAF units. For cases of minor repairs that could be achieved quickly, aircraft could be flown to a CRO firm based at an airfield, repaired, and flown out the following day by the same pilot; these were known as [...] "Fly In" [...] repairs.|$|E
50|$|MS Golden Iris is {{a cruise}} ship owned an {{operated}} by the Israel-based Mano Maritime. She was built 1975 by the Burmeister & Wain shipyard in Copenhagen, Denmark for Cunard Line as MS Cunard Conquest, but her interior fittings were subsequently installed at the Navali Mechaniche Affini in La Spezia, Italy. Following <b>re-delivery</b> from Navali Mechaniche Affini in 1977 the ship was renamed MS Cunard Princess. In 1995, the ship entered service with StarLauro Cruises (later rebranded MSC Cruises), briefly retaining her previous name before being renamed MS Rhapsody. Later during her career with MSC Cruises the ship came to be marketed as MS MSC Rhapsody, but her official registered name remained Rhapsody throughout her MSC career. The ship was sold to Mano Maritime in 2009.|$|E
40|$|Article {{discusses}} {{a research}} about communication system intended to warn people in danger. This system aims to distribute a voice message with pre-recorded content to inform participants about the target events {{in their area}} using Voice over IP technology. Transmission of information via voice messages has, compared with other ways of message distribution, the advantage that the target user is forced {{to pick up the}} call and listen to the message—and therefore the information cannot be ignored or overlooked. Another advantage is more accurate addressing of target groups of subscribers and, last but not least, it is possible to ensure the <b>re-delivery</b> of messages to users who did not receive a call.

40|$|Value Added Tax (VAT) is {{calculated}} {{based on the}} goods and service delivery costs realized by the corporations. Unless this VAT is subject to stoppage, seller takes the VAT from the purchaser in delivery of goods or services and then the corporate pays this amount to the tax office or sets off through the VAT he paid for his service or goods procurement. However, in some cases, Ministry of Finance holds not those providing the delivery or service but those purchasing or procuring the goods or services responsible partly or fully for the tax calculated based on the delivery or service fee. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to reveal VAT stoppage, accounting entries with regards to the corporation accepting the delivery and re-delivering it, VAT set off and VAT return in the <b>re-delivery</b> of a delivery subject to stoppage pursuant to General Communiqué of VAT Serial No 11...|$|E
40|$|There are {{increasing}} concerns regarding {{the impacts of}} failed first-time home deliveries on road transport and the environment, due to potentially additional vehicle trips for both carriers and consumers. Local collection-and-delivery points (CDPs) where consumers can collect their failed home deliveries have emerged as a viable solution (ByBox 2011). Using two databases of households from across Winchester and West Sussex (UK), and responses from nine major carriers, this paper quantifies GHG emissions on carrier and consumer trips related to the conventional delivery method where the carrier makes <b>re-delivery</b> attempts when a delivery fails, and appraises the environmental benefits of using CDP networks for handling delivery failures. The results suggested {{that the majority of}} GHG emissions associated with handling failed home deliveries are generated by the carrier. The share of GHG emissions generated from consumers increases as the proportion of failed first-time home deliveries increases. A range of CDPs (supermarkets, railway stations and post offices) were all found to reduce the environmental impacts of failed home deliveries. A CDP network would reduce the overall GHG emissions most effectively when: 1) 30 % or more householders who experienced a failed first-time home delivery travel to the carrier’s depot to retrieve goods; 2) The proportion of failed first-time home deliveries is significant; 3) ‘Local Collect’ post offices are used as CDPs. The study also has practical and managerial implications for retailers and carriers on how to improve home delivery services by identifying consumer home shopping behaviours and promoting more convenient and environmental-friendly delivery strategies...|$|E
