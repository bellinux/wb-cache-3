40|$|In {{introduction}} of the connoted meaning of <b>rural</b> <b>information</b> and its {{important role in the}} development of modern agriculture in our country and the development of urban and rural areas, the paper analyzes the difficulties in information construction: the first is the inadequate attendance of farmers, the low efficiency of information platform use; the second is the backward construction of information sources, which cannot meet the practical needs of information by farmers; the third is the bad situation of information exchanging. From perspective of social capital, it discusses the roles social capital factors playing in the <b>rural</b> <b>information</b> construction, among which, the information relations between farmers and information is the basis; net attendance is the necessary condition of sustainable development of <b>rural</b> <b>information</b> construction; customs afford management resources in <b>rural</b> <b>information</b> construction. Based on the above materials, the paper put forward that it is the government who must accelerate the construction of rural information: the first is planting technical net in rural credit systems, accelerating the admission and supporting of farmers to information construction; the second is to strengthen the exchanging abilities among information platforms, upgrading the attendance degrees of farmers in <b>rural</b> <b>information</b> construction; the third is to introduce and make use of the management power of rural customs to complete an <b>information</b> management norm. <b>Rural</b> <b>information</b> platforms, <b>Rural</b> <b>information,</b> Government, Social capital, China, Agribusiness,...|$|R

Performance measurement and project evaluation for African <b>rural</b> <b>information</b> services. Information Development, 15, pp. 205 - 211, is available at: [URL] {{the last twenty years}} something that could be called a <b>Rural</b> <b>Information</b> Services movement has grown up in Africa. Since Amadi attacked existing library and information services as 'colonial brainwashing'[1] and Mchombu called for a 'librarianship of poverty'[2] in the early 1980 s, there has been a steady, and increasing, trickle of books, articles and reports devoted to this topic. There has also been a number of conferences and workshops on the theme. Probably the most complete synthesis of this <b>rural</b> <b>information</b> services theme was published in 1998 with the second edition of Sturges and Neill's book, The quiet struggle. [3] In this it is suggested that the movement is influential in most countries of East, Southern and West Africa. It is found in the Anglophone countries, and it also exists in particularly lively form in Francophone West Africa. Ideas and experience from the Francophone countries have been drawn together very effectively by Ndiaye in his Communication à la base. [4] These two books show that the movement has produced speculative writing, much exhortation, some research, and some experimentation. The speculation has been fruitful, much of the exhortation fatuous, the research helpful and stimulating, but it is the experimentation that is now most important. <b>Rural</b> <b>information</b> services have actually been introduced into a large number of African countries. For instance, in Zimbabwe an NGO, the Rural Library and Resource Development Project (RLRDP), has approaching 100 centres in operation, and in Tanzania there is a national service with thousands of centres. The movement is now much more than a matter of words. Diana Rosenberg was therefore clearly quite right to ask in 1993 if such services were sustainable beyond an experimental phase. [5] To respond to the question it is necessary to have some hard information about the performance of existing <b>rural</b> <b>information</b> services. This paper will look briefly at the mission of <b>rural</b> <b>information</b> centres, so as to establish the baseline for assessing them. It will then look at sources of ideas and experience in measuring the success of services, both from within and outside the library and information sector, before reviewing some examples of this kind of research that have already taken place. In conclusion some lessons will be drawn on performance measurement and project evaluation, and their place in the whole process of providing <b>rural</b> <b>information</b> services which are well matched to need...|$|R
