In 1995, during the Yugoslav Wars, {{it was reported that}} there were incidents of violence against the Serb-Montenegrin minority in places like Boriç i Vogël and Boriç i Madh, where the Albanian government also tried to forcibly take land from them. The Serb-Montenegrin minority in Shkodër and Malësia e Madhë claims to be treated unproperly.

After intense arguments betwhen the justices, Cezar Peluso, the chief justice, chose to suspend judgement without announcing the result. It was not given by the full court a forecast for the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trial,</b> {{but according to a}} O Globo report, 14 the [...] "expectation is that the justices will return to the issue next Wednesday, four days before the election."

25|$|On 7 April 1979, Hoveyda was {{transported to}} Qasr Prison, once a getaway palace for monarchs of the Qajar dynasty, but {{converted}} into a prison during the 1920s. By this time, he was now aware {{that there would be}} no mercy for him, and the whole charade would end in his own death. Quickly shuffled back in front of Khalkhali's tribunal, he once again heard the court's indictment at three in the afternoon. There is some speculation as to who ordered the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trial.</b> Bani Sadr, one among many leaders of the Provisional Revolutionary Government who advocated a public trial, states that only Khomeini himself had the authority to make such an order. Behind locked doors, Hoveyda's fate, which had already been decided upon by Khomeini days earlier, was sealed.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{men were}} charged with the {{attempted}} murder: Ricky Valencia and Akeem Thurton. While awaiting trial and out on bail, Valencia was again arrested on charges of handling stolen goods. Valencia and Thurton were the first suspects to be tried in the new [...] "fast-track court" [...] {{without the benefit of}} a jury. Director of Public Prosecutions Cheryl Taitt represented the Government of Belize. Valencia and Thurton came before the Chief Justice Kenneth Benjamin on the charges in early February 2012, but the case was adjourned because both defendants were still trying to get lawyers. While awaiting the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trial,</b> Valencia was shot dead on 22 February while driving on Caesar Ridge Road. Police suspected his death was related to a dispute over the proceeds of a bank robbery in which he was allegedly involved.|$|R
40|$|Reviewed is {{the work}} {{which led to the}} {{development}} of a unique vaccine that prevents pregnancy in sexually active women without impairment of ovulation and block of their making normally their sex steroid hormones. Being given that hCG is not expressed by non-pregnant females, immunization with the vaccine is devoid of any crossreaction with any tissue of the body. It is totally reversible and women regained fertility on decline of antibodies. A recombinant vaccine has been developed which is highly immunogenic in mice. It is undergoing extensive toxicology under GLP conditions in rodents and a primate species, the marmosets, before <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>trials.</b> Ectopic expression <b>of</b> hCG or its subunits takes place in a variety of cancers, particularly at advanced stage with adverse survival and poor prognosis. Anti-hCG antibodies exercise therapeutic action against such cancers as indicated by in vitro culture and in vivo studies in nude mice. Transgenic hCG β mice put on weight and manifest insulin resistance. Immunization of these mice with the recombinant hCG β-LTB vaccine prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Fil: Talwar, G.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the association between}} breast feeding after <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menstruation and the duration from <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menses to the next conception. Data from a survey, “Breast-Feeding and Its Effect on Fertility,” conducted in 1987 {{under the auspices of}} the Centre of Population Studies, Banaras Hindu University, India, were used. We used hazard models of conception rates after the return of menstruation with breast-feeding duration as a time-dependent covariate. The interaction of breast-feeding duration after <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menses and postpartum amenorrhea have a significant effect on the rate of conception after return <b>of</b> menses. After <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menstruation, when there is no breast feeding, the risk of conception increases with the increase in postpartum amenorrhea. However, breast feeding attenuates the effects of postpartum amenorrhea. These results suggest that breast feeding beyond the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menstruation plays a significant role in the proximate determinants to reduce fertility...|$|R
