40|$|Traditionally, logic {{synthesis}} constrains {{the solution}} space of later design steps, such as physical design, {{because they are}} applied in sequence. <b>Rewiring</b> is a technique to restructure a circuit while maintaining its functionality. Since design properties and objectives can be considered during postsynthesis <b>rewiring,</b> it can help relieve constraints put forth by decisions made at earlier design steps. The extent of <b>rewiring</b> of a <b>rewiring</b> algorithm has {{a great impact on}} the success of the design flow. This paper presents a powerful <b>rewiring</b> technique that in addition to unifying all previously proposed Set-of-Pair-of-Functions-to-be-Distinguished based <b>rewiring</b> techniques, it can perform <b>rewiring</b> with more than one wire which increases our ability to circumvent poorlydecided design constraints. With this ability, the <b>rewiring</b> ability of using different numbers of wires is reported {{for the first time in}} this paper. It can be used for runtime/quality trade-off in any given <b>rewiring</b> application. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} SPFDs (Sets of Pairs of Functions to be Distinguished) was {{introduced}} in context of FPGA synthesis [10].

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an in-depth {{study of the}} theory and algorithms for the SPFD-based (Set of Pairs of Functions to be Distinguished) <b>rewiring,</b> and explores the flexibility in the SPFD computation. Our contributions are in the following two areas: (1) We present a theorem and a related algorithm for more precise characterization of feasible SPFD-based <b>rewiring.</b> Extensive experimental results show that for LUT-based FPGAs, the <b>rewiring</b> ability of our new algorithm is 70 % higher than SPFD-based local <b>rewiring</b> algorithms (SPFD-LR) [19][21] and 18 % higher than the recently developed SPFD-based global <b>rewiring</b> algorithm (SPFD-GR) [20]. (2) In order to achieve more <b>rewiring</b> ability on certain selected wires used in various optimizations, we study the impact of using different atomic SPFD pair assignment methods during the SPFD-based <b>rewiring.</b> We develop several heuristic atomic SPFD pair assignment methods for area or delay minimization and show that they lead to 10 % more selected <b>rewiring</b> ability than the random (or arbitrary) assignment methods.

In 1992 it was redecorated and <b>rewired.</b> Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark.

At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation.

Unnecessary hatches, coamings, scuttles, and lifts were removed and plated over, and she was ballasted differently than she had been as a battleship.

5|$|The {{practical}} {{construction of}} a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on a standard cathode ray tube (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being <b>rewired,</b> or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily in their use of Williams tubes as memory devices, instead of mercury delay lines.|$|E
40|$|A {{concept of}} bypass <b>rewiring</b> is {{introduced}} and random bypass <b>rewiring</b> is analytically and numerically investigated with simulations.

We propose a greedy bypass <b>rewiring</b> algorithm which guarantees the maximum size of the largest component at each step, assuming which node will be removed next is unknown.

40|$|Abstract Semantic overlay {{networks}} cluster peers {{that are}} semantically, thematically or socially close into groups, {{by means of}} a <b>rewiring</b> procedure that is periodically executed by each peer. This procedure establishes new connections to similar peers and disregards connections to peers that are dissimilar. Retrieval effectiveness is then improved by exploiting this information at query time (as queries may address clusters of similar peers). Although all systems based on semantic overlay networks apply some <b>rewiring</b> technique, there is no comprehensive study showing the effect of <b>rewiring</b> on system’s performance. In this work, a framework for studying the attribution of <b>rewiring</b> strategies in semantic overlay networks is proposed. A generic approach to <b>rewiring</b> is presented and several variants of this approach are reviewed and evaluated. We show how peer organisation is affected by the different design choices of the <b>rewiring</b> mechanism and how these choices affect the performance of the system overall (both in terms of communication overhead and retrieval effectiveness).

Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence.
