40|$|Locking cache {{lines in}} hard {{real-time}} systems {{is a common}} means of achieving predictability of cache access behavior and tightening as well as reducing worst case execution time, especially in a multitasking environment. However, cache locking poses a challenge for multi-core hard real-time systems since theoretically optimal scheduling techniques on multi-core architectures assume zero cost for task migration. Tasks with locked cache lines need to proactively migrate these lines before the next invocation of the task. Otherwise, cache locking on multi-core architectures becomes useless as predictability is compromised. This paper proposes hardware-based push-assisted cache migration {{as a means to}} <b>retain</b> <b>locks</b> on cache lines across migrations. We extend the push-assisted migration model with several cache migration techniques to efficiently <b>retain</b> <b>locked</b> cache lines on a bus-based chip multi-processor architecture. We also provide deterministic migration delay bounds that help the scheduler decide which migration technique(s) to utilize to relocate a single or multiple tasks. This information also allows the scheduler to determine feasibility of task migrations, which is critical for the safety of any hard real-time system. Such proactive migration of locked cache lines in multi-cores is unprecedented to our knowledge...|$|R

However, {{the feasibility of}} coupling large number of STOs with energy-efficiency and sufficient robustness towards parameter-variation and thermal-noise, may be critical for such computing applications. In this work, the impacts of parameter-variation and thermal-noise on two different coupling mechanisms for STOs, namely, magnetic-coupling and electrical-coupling are analyzed. Magnetic coupling is simulated using dipolar-field interactions. For electricalcoupling we employed global RF-injection. In this method, multiple STOs are phase-locked to a common RF-signal that is injected into the STOs along with the DC bias. Results for variation and noise analysis indicate that electrical-coupling can be significantly more robust as compared to magnetic-coupling. For room-temperature simulations, appreciable phase-lock was retained among tens of electrically coupled STOs for up to 20 % 3 s random variations in critical device parameters. The magnetic-coupling technique however failed to <b>retain</b> <b>locking</b> beyond ~ 3 % 3 s parameter-variations, even for small-size STO clusters with near-neighborhood connectivity. We propose and analyze Dual-Pillar STO (DP-STO) for low-power computing using the proposed electrical coupling method. We observed that DP-STO can better exploit the electrical-coupling technique due to separation between the biasing RF signal and its own RF output...|$|R

50|$|The canal {{as built}} had a locks at both ends, {{both of which}} dropped into the river. As it had no natural water supply, and water was lost every time a boat passed through a lock, a feeder was built from just above Paddington Lock on the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. The water was then carried across the Mersey in an aqueduct, which also acted as a footbridge, and {{followed}} {{the banks of the}} Mersey to arrive at Latchford Lock. It emptied into the canal just to the south of the lock. When the Black Bear Canal section was created, Twenty Steps Lock also rose from the ship canal, and so the feature was <b>retained.</b> Latchford <b>Lock</b> was usually known as Manor Lock after the construction of the ship canal, as the locks immediately above its junction with the Black Bear Canal were called Latchford Locks.|$|R

50|$|Lock rebuilds {{took place}} at Penton Hook in 1909 and Hurley in 1910. In 1912 the Conservancy {{undertook}} major works at Boulter's Lock, which involved the purchase of Ray Mill Island. Chertsey Lock was lengthened in 1913 and Marsh Lock rebuilt in 1914. Goring Lock was rebuilt in 1921 with a third central set of gates and Godstow Lock rebuilt in 1924. In 1927 a new lock was built at Sunbury, the old one being <b>retained.</b> Marlow <b>Lock</b> and Iffley Lock were redeveloped in the same years. In 1928 the improvement to navigation above Oxford was finally completed with the building of Eynsham Lock and King's Lock. The next significant undertaking was the digging of Desborough Cut between 1930 and 1935. The 3/4/mile (1 km) cut took the river on a straight course between Weybridge and Walton on Thames, and avoiding a meandering stretch past Shepperton and Lower Halliford.

5000|$|A Philidas nut is a locknut {{with one}} or more slots cut {{laterally}} in the reduced-diameter circular top for less than half the diameter, the metal above the slot(s) being deformed downwards so that over the last one or two turns, the thread for half the diameter is [...] "axially depitched" [...] or displaced from its normal position. As the nut is threaded on, the displaced sections are elastically forced back axially to their original position, the load increasing the friction between the nut and the fastener, creating the locking action. These nuts <b>retain</b> their <b>locking</b> action at temperatures limited only by the base material, as no polymeric insert is used, and as the locking action is by elastic deformation, they can be re-used multiple times. They may look similar, but differ substantially from the split beam nut because the former has a radial displacement of the deformed portion, while the Philidas nut uses axial deflection or depitching.|$|R

40|$|Large writes are {{beneficial}} both {{on individual}} disks and on disk arrays, e. g., RAID- 5. The presented design enables large writes of internal B-tree nodes and leaves. It supports both in-place updates and large append-only (“log-structured”) write operations {{within the same}} storage volume, within the same B-tree, and even at the same time. The essence of the proposal is to make page migration inexpensive, to migrate pages while writing them, and to make such migration optional rather than mandatory as in log-structured file systems. The inexpensive page migration also aids traditional defragmentation as well as consolidation of free space needed for future large writes. These advantages are achieved with a very limited modification to conventional B-trees that also simplifies other B-tree operations, e. g., key range locking and compression. Prior proposals and prototypes implemented transacted B-tree on top of log-structured file systems and added transaction support to log-structured file systems. Instead, the presented design adds techniques and performance characteristics of log-structured file systems to traditional B-trees and their standard transaction support, notably without adding a layer of indirection for locating B-tree nodes on disk. The result <b>retains</b> fine-granularity <b>locking,</b> full transactional ACID guarantees, fast search performance, etc. expected of a modern B-tree implementation, yet adds efficient transacted page relocation and large, high-bandwidth writes. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{space station}} {{configuration}} currently studied utilizes structures which require struts to be hinged {{in the middle}} in the stowed mode and locked into place in the deployed mode. Since {{there are hundreds of}} hinges involved, it is necessary that they have simple, positive locking features with a minimum of joint looseness or slack. This invention comprises two similar housings hinged together with a spring loaded locking member which assists in making as well as breaking the lock. This invention comprises a bracket hinge and bracket members with a spring biased and movable locking member. The locking or latch member has ear parts received in locking openings where wedging surfaces on the ear parts cooperate with complimentary surfaces on the bracket members for bringing the bracket members into a tight end-to-end alignment when the bracket members are in an extended position. When the locking member is moved to an unlocking position, pivoting of the hinge about a pivot pin automatically places the <b>locking</b> member to <b>retain</b> the <b>locking</b> member in an unlocked position. In pivoting the hinge from an extended position to a folded position, longitudinal spring members are placed under tension over annular rollers so that the spring tension in a folded position assists in return of the hinge from a folded to an extended position. Novelty lies {{in the creation of a}} locking hinge which allows compact storage and easy assembly of structural members having a minimal number of parts...|$|R

40|$|The {{movement}} to multi-core processors increases {{the need for}} simpler, more robust parallel programming models. Atomic sections have been widely recognized for their ease of use. They are simpler and safer to use than manual locking and they increase modularity. But existing proposals have several practical problems, including high overhead and poor interaction with I/O. We present pessimistic atomic sections, a fresh approach that retains many {{of the advantages of}} optimistic atomic sections as seen in “transactional memory ” without sacrificing performance or compatibility. Pessimistic atomic sections employ the locking mechanisms familiar to programmers while relieving them of most burdens of lock-based programming, including deadlocks. Significantly, pessimistic atomic sections separate correctness from performance: they allow programmers to extract more parallelism via finergrained locking without fear of introducing bugs. We believe this property is crucial for exploiting multi-core processor designs. We describe a tool, Autolocker, that automatically converts pessimistic atomic sections into standard lock-based code. Autolocker relies extensively on program analysis to determine a correct locking policy free of deadlocks and race conditions. We evaluate the expressiveness of Autolocker by modifying a 50, 000 line highperformance web server to use atomic sections while <b>retaining</b> the original <b>locking</b> policy. We analyze Autolocker’s performance using microbenchmarks, where Autolocker outperforms software transactional memory by more than a factor of 3.

40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern screw joints in structures for fixing parts. These screw joints could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal self-lock nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of screw joints with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal self-lock nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in screw joints both on spring-suspended and unspring parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of screw joints with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of screw joints with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value. Application of FS-nuts makes it possible to stop using secondary members in screw joints of railway rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge. These secondary members are used for reaction to slacking under vibration and consist of castle nuts, <b>retaining</b> washers, <b>locking</b> washers, serrated washers, check plates, disposable clamps. Using FS-nuts allow providing the rating rules for next generation of rolling stock. Besides the modern technologies of FS-nuts production provide their prolonged running time under the conditions of pollution, humidity, differential temperature and other adverse factors...|$|R
5000|$|Socket {{wrenches}} {{are most}} commonly hexagonal, or more {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "6-point" [...] in lay terms. Sockets are driven by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] square drive sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] square drive, and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded <b>retaining</b> rings), a <b>locking</b> pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|R

Barrett and Big Show were the first two in the ring, attacking one another. Rhodes entered at #3, who worked with Barrett for much of the match, attempting to slow down Big Show. Marella entered at #4, who immediately got attacked by Big Show. Khali entered at #5, who got speared by Show straight away and pinned. Show climbed Bryan's pod, ripping off the chains and attacking him. When Bryan got out, Rhodes and Barrett immediately attacked Show. After a DDT by Rhodes and a driving elbow drop from Barrett, Rhodes pinned and eliminated Big Show. Rhodes was eliminated by Marella after a roll-up. Barrett was eliminated by Marella, following a diving headbutt by Bryan. The final two were Bryan and Marella, who scored a close near-fall after performing The Cobra. Santino was shocked that Bryan had kicked out and while he was in shock, Bryan forced Marella to submit to the LeBell <b>Lock,</b> <b>retaining</b> his championship. After the match Sheamus ran in and attacked Bryan, in retaliation for Bryan spitting on him on the previous episode of SmackDown.
