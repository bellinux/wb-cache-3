40|$|The sugar-flotation-sieving (SFS) and Baermann-funnel (BF) {{methods were}} {{compared}} for nematode extraction efficiency. The SFS method recovered nematodes from more trophic groups whereas greater total numbers of individuals were recovered by BF.

40|$|The Chilean {{sclerophyllous}} matorral is a Mediterranean semiarid ecosystem {{affected by}} erosion, with low soil fertility and limited by nitrogen. However, limitation of resources {{is even more}} severe for <b>desert</b> <b>soils</b> such as from the Atacama Desert, {{one of the most}} extreme arid deserts on Earth. Topsoil organic matter, nitrogen and moisture content were significantly higher in the semiarid soil compared to the <b>desert</b> <b>soil.</b> Although the most significant loss of biologically preferred nitrogen from terrestrial ecosystems occurs via denitrification, virtually nothing is known on the activity and composition of denitrifier communities thriving in arid soils. In this study, we explored denitrifier communities from two soils with profoundly distinct edaphic factors. While denitrification activity in the <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> was below detection limit, the semiarid soil sustained denitrification activity. To elucidate the genetic potential of the soils to sustain denitrification processes we performed community analysis of denitrifiers based on nitrite reductase (nirK and nirS) genes as functional marker genes for this physiological group. Presence of nirK-type denitrifiers in both soils was demonstrated but failure to amplify nirS from the <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> suggests very low abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers shedding light on the lack of denitrification activity. Phylogenetic analysis showed a very low diversity of nirK with only three distinct genotypes in the <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> which conditions presumably exert a high selection pressure. While nirK diversity was also limited to only few, albeit distinct genotypes, the semiarid matorral soil showed a surprisingly broad genetic variability of the nirS gene. The Chilean matorral is a shrub land plant community which form vegetational patches stabilizing the soil and increasing its nitrogen and carbon content. These islands of fertility may sustain the development and activity of the overall microbial community and of denitrifiers in particular...|$|R

40|$|Background: To convert deserts into arable, green landscapes is {{a global}} vision, and desert farming is a strong growing area of {{agriculture}} world-wide. However, its effect on diversity of soil microbial communities, which are responsible for important ecosystem services like plant health, is still not known. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied the impact of long-term agriculture on <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> {{in one of the}} most prominent examples for organic desert farming in Sekem (Egypt). Using a polyphasic methodological approach to analyse microbial communities in soil as well as associated with cultivated plants, drastic effects caused by 30 years of agriculture were detected. Analysing bacterial fingerprints, we found statistically significant differences between agricultural and native <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> of about 60 %. A pyrosequencing-based analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene regions showed higher diversity in agricultural than in <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> (Shannon diversity indices: 11. 21 / 7. 90), and displayed structural differences. The proportion of Firmicutes in field soil was significantly higher (37 %) than in the desert (11 %). Bacillus and Paenibacillus play the key role: they represented 96 % of the antagonists towards phytopathogens, and identical 16 S rRNA sequences in the amplicon library and for isolates were detected. The proportion of antagonistic strains was doubled in field in comparison to <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> (21. 6 %/ 12. 4 %); disease-suppressive bacteria were especially enriched in plant roots.

40|$|This {{work was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} {{the relative merits of}} bioaugmentation, biostimulation and surfactant-enhanced bioavailability of a <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> contaminated by crude oil through biopile treatment. The results show that the <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> required bioaugmentation and biostimulation for bioremediation of crude oil. The bioaugmented biopile system led to a total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) reduction of 77 % over 156 days while the system with polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80) gave a 56 % decrease in TPH. The biostimulated system with indigenous micro-organisms gave 23 % reduction in TPH. The control system gave 4 % TPH reduction. The addition of Tween 80 led to a respiration rate that peaked in 48 days compared to 88 days for the bioaugmented system and respiration declined rapidly due to nitrogen depletion. The residual hydrocarbon in the biopile systems studied contained polyaromatics (PAH) in quantities that may be considered as hazardous.

Four land uses were assessed: (1) 5 -year wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) /barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) + 5 -year maize (Zea mays L.); (2) 5 -year wheat/barley + 5 -year alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.); (3) 6 -year wheat/barley + 4 -year acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and (4) uncultivated <b>desert</b> <b>soil.</b> The <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> contained total organic C (TOC) of 3. 1, 3. 7 and 4. 2 g kg- 1 and particulate organic C (POC) of 0. 6, 0. 7 and 0. 8 g kg- 1 at 0 - 10, 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 cm depths, respectively. The soil TOC concentration was increased by 32 - 68 % under wheat-maize rotation and by 27 - 136 % under wheat-acacia at 0 - 20 cm depth, and by 48 % under wheat-alfalfa only at 0 - 10 cm depth. This contrasted {{with an increase in}} the soil POC concentration by 143 - 167 % at depth 0 - 20 cm under wheat-maize and by 217 %, 550 % at depth 0 - 10 cm under wheat-alfalfa and wheat-acacia, respectively. The <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> had 13 Mg ha- 1 TOC stock and 2 Mg ha- 1 POC stock at depth 0 - 30 cm, whereas crop rotations increased the soil TOC stock by 30 - 65 % and POC stock by 200 - 350 %. Over the 10 -year period, the rates of TOC accumulation were 0. 6, 0. 3, 0. 8 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 and the rates of POC accumulation were 0. 4, 0. 4 and 0. 7 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 under wheat-maize, wheat-alfalfa and wheat-acacia rotations, respectively.
