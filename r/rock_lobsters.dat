5|$|One of the higher-level predators {{within its}} ecosystem, the Australian swellshark feeds on {{crustaceans}} (particularly crabs and <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters),</b> cephalopods (including squid and octopus), and small fishes. Even large-sized prey {{tends to be}} swallowed whole; the long periods of rest exhibited by some sharks may relate to digestion. Like {{the other members of}} its genus, this shark is capable of rapidly inflating its body by taking water or air into its stomach, as a defense against predators. These include larger fishes, such as the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and marine mammals. By inflating, the shark may be able to wedge itself inside crevices, make itself harder to swallow, or simply intimidate a would-be predator. Marine snails are known to prey upon this shark's eggs. The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of parasite species, but these are poorly documented.|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} the potential impacts {{of climate change}} on the Tasmanian <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> fishery, and identifies several options and opportunities for adaptation. Climate change {{is expected to have}} a significant impact on the Tasmanian <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> industry with declines in <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> biomass occurring initially in northern and north-eastern regions before eventually also declining in the south. As water temperatures increase it is also expected that the range of a damaging sea urchin will be extended. The study found that the <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> fishery is reasonably well placed to adapt to the challenges of climate change but identified several possible measures that will assist with this adaptation including improved catch modelling, long-term monitoring, better risk assessment, and effective education and communication with the industry. Understanding the impacts of climate change on the Tasmanian <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> industry is important because this fishery is ideally placed to be an ‘early warning signal’ for Australian fisheries generally. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of {{indicators of the}} indirect effects of fishing is often an issue for fisheries management, particularly if just commercial catch data are available. Complex, intermediate, and simplified qualitative models were produced for a fishery case study off Western Australia to identify potential indicators of ecosystem change attributable to western <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> (Panulirus cygnus) extraction and bait input. Models of intermediate complexity were used to identify indicators because they produced the least aggregation error. Structural uncertainty was considered {{through a series of}} structurally different intermediate models. These alternate models consistently predicted that extraction of <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> may positively impact small fish of low economic value, such as old wife (Enoplosus armatus), footballer sweep (Neatypus obliquus), and king wrasse (Coris auricularis). These small fish were therefore identified as potential indicators of the effects of <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> extraction. Small crustaceans (amphipods and isopods) also displayed positive impacts attributable to bait input from the <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> fishery and were identified as potential indicators of bait effects. Monitoring of these indicators may aid the detection of ecosystem change caused by the <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> fishery...|$|R
