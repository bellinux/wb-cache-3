40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{differences}} in perception of two <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> - an accident at a nuclear installation and medical X-rays - between four different groups: the general population without (1) and with experience related to <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> (2), new employees (3), and professionally-exposed people (4) in the nuclear sector. More precisely, this study determines if differences in risk perception {{can be explained by}} the level of experiences with ionizing radiation, the knowledge level about <b>radiological</b> <b>risks,</b> the confidence in authorities, the attitude towards nuclear energy, the trust in a management of nuclear installations, gender and age. The data are gathered using computer assisted personal interviews based on the SCK-CEN Barometer of the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre (SCK-CEN). The relations between risk perception and the independent variables are tested with linear regression analysis. The risk perception of both risks differs significantly between the four population groups. The professionally-exposed people and the new employees in the nuclear sector have a significant higher risk perception for medical X-rays compared to the risk for an accident at a nuclear installation. For the general population without experience it was just the opposite. The general population with experience does not have a significant difference in risk perception between the two <b>radiological</b> <b>risks.</b> Level of experiences with ionizing radiation is determined as an important variable; people have a lower perception of <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> when they have higher experiences with risk. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{protection}} {{training is}} generally provided {{to promote a}} radiologically safe work environment, and to help ensure that doses are kept as low as reasonably achievable. In many cases, this reason makes good sense. <b>Radiological</b> <b>risk</b> can often be a significant concern when working with radioactive materials or radiation-emitting devices. However, in conducting {{the work of the}} Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Office, it is often the case that the perception of <b>radiological</b> <b>risk</b> is of greater concern than the <b>radiological</b> <b>risk</b> itself. In this case, radiation protection training can serve another equally important purpose. It can be used to convey, in a balanced manner, the actual radiological risks associated with the work, and to put those risks in perspective. For individuals who are not familiar with radiation safety, effective radiation protection training that focuses on risk communication can reduce the level of concern surrounding work to be performed. This, in turn, can have an overall positive impact on the efficiency of the work, on goodwill within the community where the work is taking place, and even on the overall safety of those conducting the work. The radiation protection training program developed and implemented by the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Office is described in the context of other, more traditional radiation protection training programs. 1...|$|E
40|$|As {{early on}} as the sixties, the {{radiological}} protection system was already {{based on the principle}} of precaution, through the assumption that health effects may exist even at the lowest levels of exposure, and, as a result, the adoption of the linear exposure-risk relationship. At the same time, in parallel with the creation of a scientific organization dedicated to broadening the knowledge required to determine the exposure-risk relationship, a “ philosophy of action ” was progressively defined to manage the <b>radiological</b> <b>risk</b> in a responsible manner [1]. This philosophy, based on the concept of risk acceptability, was incorporated into the system of radiological protection through the ALARA principle, which recommends, for each exposure situation, “ reducing exposures As Low As Reasonably Achievable, taking into consideration economic and social factors ”. The practical implementation of the ALARA principle is complex. It requires defining transaction mechanisms which enable practicing responsible management of the <b>radiological</b> <b>risk,</b> taking into account, among other things, possible risk transfers in groups (transfers between different specialized workers, between workers and the public, between patients and workers, between present generations and future generations) and the allocation of protection resources.

40|$|This {{study was}} done to examine the risks of {{remediation}} {{and the effectiveness of}} removal methods for thorium and its associated radioactive decay products from various soils and wastes associated with DOE`s Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). Its purpose was to provide information to the Environmental Management Advisory Board`s FUSRAP Committee for use in its deliberation of guiding principles for FUSRAP sites, in particular the degree to which treatment should be considered in the FUSRAP Committee`s recommendations. Treatment of FUSRAP wastes to remove thorium could be beneficial to management of lands that contain thorium if such treatment were effective and cost efficient. It must be recognized, however, that treatment methods invariably require workers to process residues and waste materials usually with bulk handling techniques. These processes expose workers to the radioactivity in the materials, therefore, workers would incur <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> in addition to industrial accident risks. An important question is whether the potential reduction of future <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> to members of the public justifies the risks that are incurred by remediation workers due to handling materials.

40|$|With 5 - 7 month long {{duration}} missions at 51. 6 degrees inclination in Low Earth Orbit, the {{ionizing radiation}} levels to which International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers are exposed {{will be the}} highest planned occupational exposures in the world. Even {{with the expectation that}} regulatory dose limits will not be exceeded during a single tour of duty aboard the ISS, the "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) precept requires that <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> be minimized when possible through a dose optimization process. Judicious placement of efficient shielding materials in locations where crewmembers sleep, rest, or work is an important means for implementing ALARA for spaceflight. Polyethylene (CnHn) is a relatively inexpensive, stable, and, with a low atomic number, an effective shielding material that has been certified for use aboard the ISS. Several designs for placement of slabs or walls of polyethylene have been evaluated for radiation exposure reduction in the Crew Quarters (CQ) of the Zvezda (Star) Service Module. Optimization of shield designs relies on accurate characterization of the expected primary and secondary particle environment and modeling of the predicted radiobiological responses of critical organs and tissues. Results of the studies shown herein indicate that 20 % or more reduction in equivalent dose to the CQ occupant is achievable. These results suggest that shielding design and risk analysis are necessary measures for reducing long-term <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> to ISS inhabitants and for meeting legal ALARA requirements.

40|$|The Chernobyl {{disaster}} {{is still considered}} {{to be one of}} the biggest catastrophic accidents in the history of nuclear energetics. After the explosion of the nuclear reactor, abundance of radioactive substance escaped to the atmosphere and in the shape of the radioactive cloud affected even the area of the former Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Political parties and state authorities reacted on this situation by setting up the state committee, which under political pressure intentionally concealed the information about the risks and consequences of the disaster for the Czechoslovak population. The collapse of the regime not only revealed the crisis of the mistrust to the official sources of information, but also improved the effort of getting information from unofficial and, according to regime, illegal sources. The Chernobyl disaster also caused the mistrust to nuclear energetics. Therefore construction and initiation of the Temelín nuclear power station elicited the interest to the information about The Chernobyl disaster. I have decided to authenticate in my thesis, how well the residents of the Czech Republic are familiar with the Chernobyl disaster and how objective their knowledge about the <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> arising from the Chernobyl disaster at present are. I found out the state of the foreknowledge of the residents of the Czech Republic about the <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> arising from the Chernobyl disaster by means of questionnaires, where 200 respondents were interviewed. For more detailed research, I divided the residents of the Czech Republic into two groups. The first one consisted of the inhabitants that live in the zone of the disaster preparedness of the Temelín nuclear power station and comprise one half of respondents. The second group consisted of the inhabitants that live of the zone of the disaster preparedness. I drew up questions in the questionnaire in order to include the given problems completely ? from the knowledge about the risks arising from the disaster and emission of the radioactive substances to their consequences for human?s health and the way of reduction their impacts on the population of the Czech Republic. I evaluated the answers from the respondents to the single answers and drew up the tables. I accomplished them by the percentage evaluation of the right and wrong answers, computation of total mean of the achieved points and the total percentage success rate. The evaluation of the knowledge of the respondents of the Czech Republic was accomplished on the basis of the value of total mean of the achieved points and percentage success rate. I did a statistical evaluation by testing normality using ? 2 Pearson's chi-squared test. The mutual comparison of the knowledge I did by testing by means of the two-sample t-test on the basis of the guess of the empirical parameters from each group. On the basis of this evaluation of the results of the questionnaire I can declare that the knowledge of the residents of the Czech Republic about the <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> arising from the Chernobyl disaster are at a very good level. The results also proved that inhabitants of the zone of the disaster preparedness of the Temelín nuclear power station have greater knowledge about the <b>radiological</b> <b>risks</b> arising from the Chernobyl disaster than the rest of the Czech Republic.
