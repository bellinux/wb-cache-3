40|$|The {{isolation}} of DNA from foodstuffs {{is the first}} step in the detection of genetically modified organisms. <b>Refining</b> <b>processes,</b> however, have an irrevocable influence on the quality and quantity of DNA and make detection in refined oil impossible. In order to determine the most significant step in removing DNA from crude soybean oil, two <b>refining</b> <b>processes</b> were considered: chemical refining and physical refining. Although conducted on a lab scale, quality parameters showed that the <b>refining</b> <b>processes</b> were good simulations of the industrial refining. From samples drawn at various refining stages, DNA was extracted with a protocol originally developed for the extraction of DNA from lecithin. The polymerase chain reaction results prove that the protocol was sufficiently useful for extracting DNA from soybean oil. The amplified DNA revealed that degumming is the most important step in removing DNA from crude soybean oil. After degumming, DNA was concentrated in the water fraction; no DNA could be amplified in the oil fractions. During physical degumming, degradation of DNA was observed...|$|R

5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the <b>refining</b> <b>process</b> often takes place there. The first stage is known as {{affination}} and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same <b>refining</b> <b>process</b> it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E

40|$|Petroleum {{products}} such as petrol and diesel are fossil fuels and have a high environmental impact. There is a demand to minimize these impacts especially in the upstream and midstream oil operations, i. e. exploration, production and <b>refining</b> <b>processes,</b> due to current and upcoming environmental regulations/policies and increased environmental consumer awareness. Thus, integration of the tools, methods and techniques for sustainability into products is becoming essential to comply with environmental regulations. The Libyan petroleum industry appears to be very slow in approaching modern concepts of approaches of sustainability including Life Cycle Assessment and studies. Therefore, this paper presents a novel environmental Life Cycle assessment of Libyan petroleum <b>refining</b> <b>processes</b> conducted {{with the support of}} Life Cycle Assessment methods and related tools including Software SimaPro.

Any large impurities in the ore can be crushed and removed. Since slag from previous blooms may have a high iron content, slag from previous blooms can be broken up and recycled into the bloomery with the new ore.|$|E
25|$|The Recycling {{business}} segment covers four main activities: its core business is the recycling and refining of various precious and other non-ferrous metals, {{as well as}} certain nonmetals such as selenium. Umicore is the world's largest recycler of precious metals.

25|$|Mining, refining, and {{recycling}} of rare earths have serious environmental consequences if not properly managed. A particular hazard is mildly radioactive slurry tailings {{resulting from the}} common occurrence of thorium and uranium in rare-earth element ores. Additionally, toxic acids are required during the <b>refining</b> <b>process.</b> Improper handling of these substances can result in extensive environmental damage. In May 2010, China announced a major, five-month crackdown on illegal mining {{in order to protect}} the environment and its resources. This campaign is expected to be concentrated in the South, where mines– commonly small, rural, and illegal operations– are particularly prone to releasing toxic wastes into the general water supply. However, even the major operation in Baotou, in Inner Mongolia, where much of the world's rare-earth supply is refined, has caused major environmental damage.|$|E
25|$|The Circum-Superior Belt is {{the host}} for {{widespread}} mineral deposits, including copper, nickel and platinum group elements. However, the origins of this widespread mineralization is unknown. The Thompson Belt in Manitoba {{is one of the}} most comprehensive nickel producing zones on Earth. It has the potential to contain platinum group elements, but the age of the mafic-ultramafic volcanic rocks comprising the nickel deposits are not well known. Since its foundation during the 1950s, numerous mining operations throughout the Thompson Belt have produced over four billion pounds of nickel. At least two nickel deposits are in progress by Vale Inco at the Thompson and Birchtree mines. At least 70million pounds of nickel has been mined since 2005. At the city of Thompson, nickel of the Thompson Belt is smelted and refined in facilities.

25|$|The fuel used {{depended}} {{on what was}} economically available to the railway. In the UK {{and other parts of}} Europe, plentiful supplies of coal made this the obvious choice from the earliest days of the steam engine. Until 1870, the majority of locomotives in the United States burned wood, but as the Eastern forests were cleared, coal gradually became more widely used. Thereafter, coal became and remained the dominant fuel worldwide until the end of general use of steam locomotives. Bagasse, a waste by-product of the <b>refining</b> <b>process,</b> was burned in sugar cane farming operations. In the US, the ready availability of oil made it a popular steam locomotive fuel after 1900 for the southwestern railroads, particularly the Southern Pacific. In the Australian state of Victoria after World War II, many steam locomotives were converted to heavy oil firing. German, Russian, Australian and British railways experimented with using coal dust to fire locomotives.|$|E

25|$|Christopher Schutz, born in Annaberg, Saxony, {{was the son}} of Christoph Schutz (born 1505) of Chemnitz. His mother's name is unknown. He {{learned his}} craft in mines in the Erzgebirge. About 1563 he {{received}} an invitation to work in England. William Humfrey (d.1579), who had been appointed Assay Master at the Royal Mint in 1561, needed someone knowledgeable about calamine ore, used in the production of latten and brass, and paid Schutz' way to England. In 1564 Schutz, aided by twenty German-speaking workers, built England's first blast furnace at Tintern. In a letter of 16 August 1565 to Sir William Cecil, Humfrey stated that Schutz was 'bound in £10,000 to communicate his art in working metals', and requested that he and Schutz be granted a joint patent. In September 1565 Humfrey and Schutz were granted licences to prospect for calamine in England and in the Pale in Ireland, and to mine and process the ore, being joined in some of their licences with Thomas Smythe, William Williams and Humfrey Cole. Only a few months later, in early 1566, William Humfrey and Schutz found calamine in the Mendip Hills, and Daniel Hoechstetter designed a <b>refining</b> <b>process</b> by which it could be used in Schutz' furnace at Tintern.|$|E
25|$|Before a miner {{could sell}} his ore {{he had to}} dress it. Dressing was the process of extracting the ore from the rock {{in which it was}} {{embedded}} and washing it, a further <b>refining</b> <b>process.</b> In the days of bole smelting the ore was roughly washed clean of waste minerals and dirt before being riddled for bing ore. The ore for the new smelters was smashed, or crushed, into pieces about the size of peas. This was done by hand, using a hammer called a bucker or, in larger mines, on a crushing circle, where a horse dragged a roller round a paved circle on which the ore was placed. Crushed ore was washed either by running water over it in a sloping trough called a buddle or by placing it in a sieve fine enough to prevent any ore particles passing through. The sieve was then plunged several times into a trough. In each case the object was to allow the heavier, lead-rich, particles to sink, enabling those containing lighter, unwanted minerals to be skimmed off the top and removed. These processes were then repeated at the smelter. By the 17th century new mines were being opened, shafts driven deeper, and old waste heaps were yielding new supplies for the smelters.|$|E
