40|$|This paper {{examines}} the effect government policy {{has on the}} way managers of government-funded projects manage. The findings suggest that government reforms have improved the efficiency of processes undertaken during {{the life of the}} project, but have failed to address the issues arising from a lack of policy clarity relating to "what should be developed". In addition, the findings suggest that the gains achieved through the implementation of government reforms are compromised by a lack of a management framework detailing the responsibility and authority of each government entity involved in the ownership of projects. In addition, there is presently no <b>recourse</b> <b>to</b> <b>mediation</b> for resolving outstanding contract discrepancies.

40|$|Since 1 January 2007, {{victims of}} crimes and {{offenders}} {{have been offered}} the chance to have <b>recourse</b> <b>to</b> <b>mediation</b> in Hungary. This paper will first give a short overview of the current situation of {{mediation in penal matters}} in Hungary, then it will discuss some general phenomena and dilemmas concerning the general introduction of mediation. After that, I will present a SWOT analysis 1 of the current Hungarian mediation system in penal matters. The main goal {{of this article is to}} set up certain criteria for the further development of the restorative approach. The lessons we have learnt, the strengths and opportunities of the system and the identification of weaknesses might prove useful for other countries when they choose to introduce mediation, and in relation to the protection of victims in particular...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of an old}} pre-war photo representing {{a part of the}} Łódź district – Bałuty – provokes the following questions: Is it possible – although the photograph retains only a fraction of past time and space – to meet the reality which was once present. Do we experience the photographed space and time closed in a frame? How can we do that? Does this experience – if possible – depend on our individual memories and perception? In finding answers to these questions, above all, I refer to some of Roland Barthes' concepts. According to them, when we look at a photo we can experience the past directly as a past reality, without <b>recourse</b> <b>to</b> narrative <b>mediation.</b> But we cannot make attempts to reinterpret the past. The category of chronotope, widely discussed by the Russian scientist Mikhail Bakhtin, turns out to be helpful and very inspiring, as well. The term chronotope refers to the idea of inseparable connection of time and space and the conviction that any contact with the area of meanings should be made only through the spatio-temporal gate...|$|R

40|$|Mediation {{is often}} {{suggested}} {{as an alternative}} method of resolving industrialdisputes. However, the precise nature of mediation in the industrial relations context is not clear, and although {{the emphasis is on}} a facilitative approach, the evidence from two case studies suggests that a more interventionist approach may be more typical. The case studies also suggest that mediation will be used tactically {{during the course of a}} negotiation as well as being a means of bringing the dispute to an end. This opportunity for a tactical <b>recourse</b> <b>to</b> <b>mediation</b> is increased where the legislation seeks to guide or control the conduct of negotiations, as in the case of the proposed amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Some implications that arise from this tactical opportunity are explored, including tbe development of a motivational perspective to mediation. The Australian federal government’s recent proposals for further reform of the industrial relations system include the promotion of mediation as a means of resolving differences between managements, employees and unions. In his Second Reading Speech (30 June 1999) to introduce the JVorkplace Relations Legislation Amendment (NIore Jobs Better Pay) Bill 1999, the minister indicate...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} a critical {{reflection on the}} efforts at legal reconstruction initiated in 2001 {{by the international community}} and the Afghan government. Its aim is to highlight some of the more controversial factors that accompany the implementation of a foreign model of justice inspired by the ideology of the rule of law. Following Operation Enduring Freedom and the consequent arrival of various international agencies on Afghan soil, the international community (led by the United States) has attempted to bring political stability and democracy to Afghanistan. This endeavor has evolved into a more extensive, and rather controversial, process of reconstruction, which has called into question the mantra of democratization and modernization used to ideologically justify the US-led coalition control of a pro-Western Afghan government. By introducing a reflection on restorative justice and judicial mediation, I argue that the standardization and global circulation of specific models of justice present a series of problems often hidden behind legalistic interpretations. While in Western countries jurists and legal practitioners promote the industry of ‘alternative dispute resolution’ (ADR) and emphasize the <b>recourse</b> <b>to</b> <b>mediation</b> and conciliation, in Afghanistan governments and international agencies implement the rule of law, thus condemning and marginalizing customary practices in the resolution of disputes. Once taken away from the rules of the judicial order, judicial mediation becomes caught in a logic of compromise and deteriorates...|$|E
