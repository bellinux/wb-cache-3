40|$|We {{consider}} a manufacturer-retailer supply chain for a seasonal product whose demand is weather sensitive. The retailer {{orders from the}} manufacturer (supplier) prior to the selling season and then sells to the market. We examine how a manufacturer can structure a weather-linked rebate to improve his expected profit. The proposed class of rebate contracts offers several advantages over many other contract structures, including no required verification of leftover inventory and/or markdown amounts, and no adverse effect on sales effort by the retailer. We provide a thorough analysis of the manufacturer's and retailer's decisions in this context. We show that the weather-linked rebate can take many different forms, and this flexibility allows the supplier to design contracts that are Pareto improving and/or limit his risk in offering the contract and the retailer's risk in accepting it. For <b>weather</b> <b>rebates</b> with certain characteristics, the manufacturer can fully hedge his risks of offering a <b>weather</b> <b>rebate</b> by paying a risk premium; we show how this can be accomplished. We also show that the basic structural results extend to settings {{in which the two}} parties would like to limit their risk. weather-linked <b>rebate,</b> <b>weather</b> risk, weather derivatives, supply chain coordination...|$|R

2500|$|Finally, {{information}} {{on the status of}} the fighter squadrons was known to the Sectors but needed by the Groups to choose which squadrons to commit. For this task, operations rooms also contained a series of blackboards and electrical lamp systems indicating the force strengths of the fighter squadrons and their current status. Known as the [...] "tote board", this allowed commanders to tell at a glance which units were available to receive commands. The statuses were Released (not available); Available (able to be airborne in 20 minutes); Readiness (airborne in 5 minutes); Standby (pilots in cockpit, airborne in 2 minutes); Airborne and moving into position; Enemy sighted; Ordered to land; Landed and refuelling/rearming.

They were numbered 52-57-. The {{members of the class}} were fitted with <b>weather</b> <b>boards,</b> later replaced by Stirling cabs. The safety valves over the firebox were later replaced by those of Ramsbottom design over the centre of the boiler following a boiler explosion at Springhill in 1876. The class was later perpetuated by Stirling’s brother James Stirling (1835-1917) in his 65 class goods locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Wickham Mill (Grade II listed) {{previously}} a corn mill {{dominates the}} entrance into Wickhambreaux from Littlebourne and its four-storey, with attics, white <b>weather</b> <b>boarded</b> structure {{is a local}} landmark.
