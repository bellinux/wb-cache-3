5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being <b>read</b> <b>too</b> easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{states that}} Northanger Abbey looks exactly as she {{imagined}} {{it and she}} becomes intrigued by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her that perhaps {{it is possible to}} <b>read</b> <b>too</b> many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother has no intention of marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do no such thing.|$|E
25|$|Besant {{began to}} {{question}} her own faith. She turned to leading churchmen for advice, going to see Edward Bouverie Pusey, {{one of the leaders}} of the Oxford Movement within the Church of England. When she asked him to recommend books that would answer her questions, he told her she had <b>read</b> <b>too</b> many already. Besant returned to Frank to make a last unsuccessful effort to repair the marriage. She finally left for London.|$|E

25|$|The South Vietnamese {{eventually}} {{had their}} way. Seeing that the generals and Hương were {{not willing to}} reinstate the HNC Taylor sent General John Throckmorton to meet the generals to mend fences. Throckmorton told the Vietnamese generals that they had <b>read</b> <b>too</b> much into Taylor's comments and that the U.S. {{had no intention of}} pressuring them out of power. Khánh appeared reassured by this and made a public statement on 30 December, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thiệu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any tension that remained. The generals eventually won out, as the Americans did not move against them in any way for their refusal to reinstate the HNC.|$|E
500|$|He {{began to}} <b>read</b> <b>too</b> about foreign history, coming to be {{particularly}} influenced by a book titled Great Heroes of the World, through which he learned about [...] and was inspired by [...] the military prowess and nationalistic fervour of American George Washington and Frenchman Napoleon Bonaparte. Schram {{believed that it was}} here, at this school, that [...] "we can date the real beginnings of Mao's intellectual and political development". Mao remained at the school for seven or eight months, before deciding to enroll at a middle school in the provincial capital of Changsha.|$|E
500|$|In {{line with}} earlier Greek thought, the 4th-century bishop and theologian, Augustine of Hippo, {{wrote that the}} {{creation}} story in the Book of Genesis should not be <b>read</b> <b>too</b> literally. In his book De Genesi ad litteram (On the Literal Meaning of Genesis), he stated {{that in some cases}} new creatures may have come about through the [...] "decomposition" [...] of earlier forms of life. For Augustine, [...] "plant, fowl and animal life are not perfect... but created in a state of potentiality," [...] unlike what he considered the theologically perfect forms of angels, the firmament and the human soul. Augustine's idea 'that forms of life had been transformed [...] "slowly over time"' prompted Father Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti, Professor of Theology at the Pontifical Santa Croce University in Rome, to claim that Augustine had suggested a form of evolution.|$|E

500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't <b>read</b> <b>too</b> much into the speculation. I've heard it before and nothing has happened so I will just keep my head down and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and tell me they have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Graham-Dixon asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists {{could not}} help but search {{everywhere}} for meaning. He says of the windmill in The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede that it symbolises [...] "the sheer hard work needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard the future of the nation's children". The symmetries in the landscapes are [...] "reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow". Slive is more reluctant to <b>read</b> <b>too</b> much into the work, but does put The Windmill in its contemporary religious context of man's dependence on the [...] "spirit of the Lord for life". With regards to interpreting Ruisdael's Scandinavian paintings, he says [...] "My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls, torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of transcience and vanitas".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Russia, three British {{newspapers}} announced on 24 September 1906 that Michael was to marry Princess Patricia of Connaught, but neither he nor Patricia knew anything about it. Buckingham Palace issued a denial. Nevertheless, two years later, in October 1908, Michael visited London, and he and Patricia were [...] "paired" [...] at social engagements. It seems likely that Michael's mother was plotting to get him married to a more suitable bride and the originator of the false report, Reuters correspondent Guy Beringer, <b>read</b> <b>too</b> much into the plans. Michael and Dina were planning to elope, but their plans were stymied as Dina was under surveillance by the Okhrana, Nicholas's secret police, and she was prevented from travelling. Under family pressure and unable to see Dina, by August 1907 Michael appeared to be losing interest. Dina went to live abroad. She never married and believed herself to be Michael's rightful fiancée, but their romance was over.|$|E

500|$|The South Vietnamese {{eventually}} {{had their}} way. As the generals and Hương {{were unwilling to}} reinstate the HNC, Taylor sent General John L. Throckmorton to meet them and mend relations. Throckmorton told the Vietnamese generals they had <b>read</b> <b>too</b> much into Taylor's comments and that the US {{had no intention of}} pressuring them out of power with aid cuts. Cang appeared unimpressed, while Thiệu and Kỳ made indirect and vague comments about what they perceived to be misleading tactics during the talks. Khánh appeared reassured by Throckmorton's overtures and made a public statement on December 30, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thiệu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any remaining tension. He also claimed privately that the statements attributed to him by Deepe were false and set up a bilateral committee to discuss tensions. The generals eventually won out, as the Americans did not move against them in any way for their refusal to reinstate the HNC. The South Vietnamese won in large part because the Americans had spent so much on the country, and could not afford to abandon it and lose to the communists over the matter of military rule, as a communist takeover would be a big public relations coup for the Soviet bloc. According to Karnow, for Khánh and his officers, [...] "their weakness was their strength". An anonymous South Vietnamese government official said [...] "Our big advantage over the Americans is that they want to win the war more than we do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} while both parties had {{relied heavily on}} the subtexts of {{statements}} made in the 1963 parliamentary debates, [...] "one should not <b>read</b> <b>too</b> much into [...] ". This was because the phrase shall be filled by election itself is inherently filled with ambiguity. The Court noted that no member of the ruling party, including the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, had ever denied there was a constitutional obligation to call a by-election to fill a casual vacancy. Instead, the 1963 debates had only focused on the time-frame within which such by-elections should be called.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the reports}} are hearsay in the {{technical}} sense, because their content is not produced live before the hearing examiner, {{we feel that the}} claimant and the Court of Appeals <b>read</b> <b>too</b> much into the single sentence from Consolidated Edison. The contrast the Chief Justice was drawing, at the very page cited, was not with material that would be deemed formally inadmissible in judicial proceedings but with material [...] "without a basis in evidence having rational probative force." [...] This was not a blanket rejection by the Court of administrative [...] reliance on hearsay irrespective of reliability and probative value. The opposite was the case.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to mainstream bands that have some songs incorporating literary references among a wider repertoire of music (notably Led Zeppelin to The Lord of the Rings), wizard rock bands take their inspiration entirely from the Harry Potter universe.

50|$|A second {{tradition}} of satirical romances {{can be traced}} back to Heinrich Wittenwiler's Ring (c. 1410) and to François Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel (1532-1564), which parodied and satirized heroic romances, and did this mostly by dragging them into the low realm of the burlesque. Cervantes' Don Quixote (1606/1615) modified the satire of romances: its hero lost contact with reality by <b>reading</b> <b>too</b> many romances in the Amadisian tradition.|$|R
