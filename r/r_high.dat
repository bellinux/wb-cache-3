People are not only involved in this traditional occupation but also entering government jobs, as also in other fields like, engineering. Nearby villages are Narayanpur (famous for shiv mandir and garh of raja khapariya presently dih), kamargama, Darha, Saraun, Dhuriya, Makva in the west-Lakhanpur in the south - Kastikari, Rahmatpur in the east and Vikrampur in the north. It is the place where people work in meals and mostly do wood related work. Asarganj is also popular for its wood designing work which is involved in making sofas, different kinds of chairs, and all other equipment related to carpentry work. Business of cloths and vegetables are the source of income for Asarganj livers. Many coaching centers are also running here for the good education of students under matriculation. Private tutor like (uttam kumar choudhary???) who has been working for around 25 years?? to enhance the level of students over here. There are almost 12-15 shops here where clothes are sold; people from far villages come here to shop. A very old and recognized school in Asarganj is milestone for others to remember this place which is situated at Jalalabad. Numerous students studied here in school named R n and P <b>R</b> <b>high</b> school jalalabad under the guidance of learned teachers like late Bimal Choudhary, Basudev Sah and many others who devoted their life for the best future of the students.

People from all the areas know him and pronounce his name very respectfully. He was an ideal personality among all the teachers working in that school.Many doctors, engineers and civil officers were produced by him. He mostly taught English and geography but had an equal knowledge of all subjects.

40|$|Comparison of the {{phenotypic}} {{expression of}} Mycoplasma gallisepticum strain R low (passage 15) {{to that of}} strain <b>R</b> <b>high</b> (passage 164) revealed that three proteins, i. e., the cytadhesin molecule GapA, a 116 -kDa protein (p 116), and a 45 -kDa protein (p 45), are missing in strain <b>R</b> <b>high.</b> Sequence analysis confirmed that the insertion of an adenine 105 bp downstream of the gapA translational start codon resulted in premature termination of translation in <b>R</b> <b>high.</b> A second adenine insertion had also occurred at position 907. Restoration of expression of wild-type gapA in <b>R</b> <b>high</b> (clone designated GT 5) allowed us to evaluate {{the extent to which}} the diminished cytadherence capacity could be attributed to GapA alone. The results indicated that GT 5 attached to the same limited extent as the parental <b>R</b> <b>high,</b> from which it was derived. The cytadherence capability of the parental <b>R</b> <b>high</b> was not restored solely by gapA complementation alone, indicating that either p 116 or p 45 or both may play a role in the overall cytadherence process. The gene encoding p 116 was found to be immediately downstream of gapA in the same operon and was designated crmA. This gene exhibited striking homology to genes encoding molecules with cytadhesin-related functions in both Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium. Transcriptional analysis revealed that crmA is not transcribed in <b>R</b> <b>high.</b> We are currently constructing a shuttle vector containing both the wild-type gapA and crmA for transformation into <b>R</b> <b>high</b> to assess the role of CrmA in the cytadherence process...|$|E
40|$|It was {{previously}} demonstrated that avirulent Mycoplasma gallisepticum strain <b>R</b> <b>high</b> (passage 164) is lacking three proteins that {{are expressed in}} its virulent progenitor, strain R low (passage 15). These proteins were identified as the cytadhesin molecule GapA, the putative cytadhesin-related molecule CrmA, and a component of a high-affinity transporter system, HatA. Complementation of <b>R</b> <b>high</b> with wild-type gapA restored expression in the transformant (GT 5) but did not restore the cytadherence phenotype and maintained avirulence in chickens. These results suggested that CrmA might play {{an essential role in}} the M. gallisepticum cytadherence process. CrmA is encoded by the second gene in the gapA operon and shares significant sequence homology to the ORF 6 gene of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which has been shown to play an accessory role in the cytadherence process. Complementation of <b>R</b> <b>high</b> with wild-type crmA resulted in the transformant (SDCA) that lacked the cytadherence and virulence phenotype comparable to that found in <b>R</b> <b>high</b> and GT 5. In contrast, complementation of <b>R</b> <b>high</b> with the entire wild-type gapA operon resulted in the transformant (GCA 1) that restored cytadherence to the level found in wild-type R low. In vivo pathogenesis trials revealed that GCA 1 had regained virulence, causing airsacculitis in chickens. These results demonstrate that both GapA and CrmA are required for M. gallisepticum cytadherence and pathogenesis. Mycoplasma gallisepticum is one infectious agent initiatin...|$|E
40|$|As {{a product}} {{category}} evolves, consumers {{have the opportunity}} to learn a series of feature-benefit associations. Initially, consumers learn that some features predict a critical benefit, whereas other features do not. Subsequently, consumers {{have the opportunity to}} assess if previously predictive features, or novel features, predict new product benefits. Surprisingly, later learning is characterized by attenuated learning about previously predictive features relative to novel features. This ten-dency to ignore previously predictive features is consistent with a desire to protect prior learning. As consumers gain experience in a product category,they learn product features (e. g., attributes, brand names) that predict product performance (i. e., overall quality or specific benefits). To illustrate, consider a consumer who has been eating in restaurants over a number of years. The consumer has likely learned a number of cues (e. g., type of cuisine, reservation policy, location, price point) that predict outcomes (e. g., food quality, service, ambience). These cue-outcome relationships have evolved, starting with very sim-ple relationships (e. g., French cuisine <b>r</b> <b>high</b> quality food) and ending with more complex ones (e. g., French cuisine, poor location <b>r</b> <b>high</b> quality food, poor ambience). The development of this predictive knowledge structure is called adaptive learning. Adaptive learning is a dynamic process; hence, it should not be surprising that a considerable amount of research effort has focused on how predictive associations are learned and updated over time.
