25|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicate}} that the taxi drivers' (experts') recall of streets was higher in both the route order condition and the map order condition than in the two random conditions. This indicates that the experts were able to use their prelearned spatial knowledge to organize the information in such a way that they surpassed STM and WM capacity limitations. The organization strategy that the drivers employed is known as chunking. Additionally, the comments made by the experts during the procedure point towards their use of <b>route</b> <b>knowledge</b> in completing the task. To ensure that it was in fact spatial information that they were encoding, the researchers also presented lists in alphabetical order and semantic categories. However, the researchers found that it was in fact spatial information that the experts were chunking, allowing them to surpass the limitations of both visuo-spatial STM and WM.|$|E

40|$|River {{infrastructure}} such as weirs and hydropower stations commonly present migrating {{fish with}} multiple potential passage <b>routes.</b> <b>Knowledge</b> of the cues fish use to navigate such environments {{is required to}} protect migrants from hazardous areas and guide them towards safe passage; however, this is currently lacking for many species. Employing high-resolution positioning telemetry, this study examined movements of downstream migrating adult European eel, Anguilla anguilla, as they encountered a complex of water control structures in one location on the River Stour, southern England. The distribution of eels across five potential routes of passage differed from that predicted based on proportion of discharge alone. Certain routes were consistently avoided, even when the majority of flow passed through them. Passage distribution was partially explained by avoidance {{in the vicinity of}} a floating debris boom. Movement paths were nonrandomly distributed across the forebay and eels moved predominantly within a zone 2 – 4 m from the channel walls. Understanding of avoidance and structure oriented movementation exhibited by eels will help advance effective guidance and downstream passage solutions for adult...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most common cancers in females with many subtypes. Breast cancer can spread via hematogenous route as well as lymphatic <b>routes.</b> <b>Knowledge</b> of the lymphatic {{drainage}} of breast is required not only for the performance of surgical procedures but also in planning therapeutic radiation, predicting sites of locally recurrent disease. The lymphatic drainage of the breast is considered rich, and identification of the major pathways allows a surgeon to predict the sites most commonly containing lymph-borne metastases. Careful inspection and palpation of Axillary, supraclavicular and parasternal sites for nodal involvement is thoroughly performed for recording location, size, consistency, shape, mobility, fixation, and other characteristics of any palpable lymphadenopathy. Local implications of lymphatic obstruction can be Preau D orange appearance and edema while as distant manifestations can be involvement of Nodes along with dissemination to other organs. The further the lymphatic dissemination, the lesser the favourable prognosis.

However, the isolates were susceptible to polymyxin B. Resistance to cefoperazone/sulbactam was only detected in strains isolated from 2007 to 2009. Some environmental isolates and an isolate from the hands of a healthcare worker (HCW) had identical resistance profiles and PFGE profiles that were closely related to patient isolates.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{has emerged}} as a sexually {{transmitted}} infection among HIV-positive {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) in high-income countries. Little is reported about HCV awareness among MSM, although this is essential for developing targeted prevention strategies. We, therefore, studied HCV awareness and knowledge among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). During two visits, 1 year apart and starting in October 2007, MSM from the ACS answered questions regarding HCV awareness, knowledge of HCV transmission (7 items), complications (8 items) and sexual risk behaviour. We examined the percentage of HCV awareness and correctly answered knowledge items, and whether awareness and knowledge improved significantly over time. Using logistic regression, we studied whether HIV status and sexual risk behaviour were associated with awareness. Seventy percent (312 / 444) of HIV-negative and 80 % (74 / 92) of HIV-positive MSM reported to have ever heard of HCV on the first visit. Overall, awareness increased with 9 % between the first and second visit (p < 0. 001). In multivariate analysis the association of group sex with HCV awareness was borderline significant (OR 1. 49, 95 % CI 0. 97 - 2. 30). Compared with <b>knowledge</b> of transmission <b>routes,</b> <b>knowledge</b> of complications appeared to be limited. In the ACS, awareness of HCV is high, particularly among those reporting group sex, an important risk factor for HCV transmission. The majority of participants had good <b>knowledge</b> of transmission <b>routes,</b> but limited <b>knowledge</b> of complications of chronic HCV infection.

40|$|Mobile {{communication}} {{is one of}} the most ubiquitously used technologies in today's world, evolving towards its fifth generation (5 G). Amidst increasing number of devices and traffic volume, one of the key focuses of 5 G is to provide uniform service quality despite high mobility. In real world scenarios, user mobility is not random but rather direction oriented, based on its origin and destination. Further, several users exhibit repeated mobility patterns on daily basis (e. g., office goers, commuters in public transport etc.). Such mobility is termed as Diurnal mobility. Information of such diurnal mobility can assist in improving prediction accuracy of future user location (e. g., cells, <b>routes).</b> <b>Knowledge</b> of future user location will enable the designing of efficient resource management algorithms, aiming to make great service quality follow the user. In the presented work, information of diurnal mobility is used to enhance the accuracy of mobility prediction (next cell prediction as well as route prediction) in a realistic urban scenario. Further, using this context information about future routes and possible coverage holes in them, efficient resource allocation is done to sustain streaming/full buffer services, even in coverage holes. The simulation results show substantial improvements in user throughput as a result of context aware resource allocation, enabled by diurnal user mobility prediction...|$|R

50|$|Under route signalling, {{a driver}} is {{informed}} which route the train will take beyond each signal (unless only one route is possible). This {{is achieved by}} a route indicator attached to the signal. The driver uses his <b>route</b> <b>knowledge,</b> reinforced by speed restriction signs fixed at the lineside, to drive the train at the correct speed for the route to be taken. This method has the disadvantage that the driver may be unfamiliar with a route onto {{which he has been}} diverted due to some emergency condition. Several accidents have been caused by this alone. For this reason, in the UK drivers are only allowed to drive on routes that they have been trained on and must regularly travel over the lesser used diversionary routes to keep their <b>route</b> <b>knowledge</b> up to date.|$|E
