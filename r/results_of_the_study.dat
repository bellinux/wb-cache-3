5|$|The {{first major}} change under Tkach's tenure was the WCG's {{doctrine}} on healing. Previously the church taught that true believers were healed by faith in God {{and not by}} doctors. Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question. Once Tkach was satisfied with the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> he officially softened the church's teaching on the matter, encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining faith in God as a healer.|$|E

25|$|Therapy for Expressive Aphasia (nonfluent) is beneficial, {{even for}} {{patients}} with severe nonfluent aphasia. A study conducted by Marangolo and co-workers (2013) administered conversational therapy to patients with severe nonfluent aphasia. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> demonstrated {{a significant increase in}} the patient’s expressive language. The authors suggested that an intensive conversational therapy program should be considered {{for patients with}} moderately severe nonfluent aphasia in order to enhance the patient's quality of life and improve their language expression. In addition, although Anomic Aphasia is seen to be less severe than other aphasias, therapy is still imperative to help decrease the patient’s word finding deficits. A research study conducted by Harnish and co-workers (2014), provided intense treatment to patients with anomic aphasia. <b>Results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> concluded significant increases in the participant’s expressive language. These results suggest that an intensive intervention program for patients with anomic aphasia provides a surprisingly quick expressive language increase. Specifically, these patients relearned to correctly produce the problematic words after one to three hours of speech-language therapy.|$|E
25|$|One study {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} four interventions: improving social skills, enhancing social support, increasing opportunities for social interaction, addressing abnormal social cognition (faulty thoughts and patterns of thoughts).

Results of the meta-analysis suggest that correcting maladaptive social cognition offers the best chance of reducing loneliness.|$|E

The study, including a detailed census of Traveller population and an examination of their health status, was expected to take up to three years to complete.

25|$|Because the {{perception}} {{was that the}} Alliance for Progress was a failure, shortly after taking office, on February 17, 1969, President Richard Nixon commissioned a study to assess the state of Latin America.

The poor {{relationship between the two}} politicians suggested that Nixon would not be that interested in the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> There was a lack of interest for the region in the late 1960s to early 1970s.|$|E

The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> suggest that wolf-dog hybridization is a common event in the areas where large livestock guardian dogs are held in a traditional way, and that gene flow between dogs and gray wolves was an important force influencing gene pool of dogs for millennia since early domestication events.|$|E

25|$|The general {{effectiveness}} of psychotherapy and psychological intervention is partly {{explained by the}} theory of cognitive dissonance. In that vein, social psychology proposed that {{the mental health of}} the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific therapy and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance. That effective phenomenon was indicated in the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.|$|E
25|$|One study {{demonstrated}} that cross-modal visual and auditory integration is present from within 1 year of life. This study measured response time for orientating towards a source.

Younger infants, however, showed no such change in response times to these different conditions. Indeed, the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> indicates that children potentially {{have the capacity to}} integrate sensory sources at any age. However, in certain cases, for example visual cues, intermodal integration is avoided.|$|E
