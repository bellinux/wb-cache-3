50|$|The {{plates are}} often spaced by <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>gaskets</b> which are {{cemented}} into a section {{around the edge}} of the plates. The plates are pressed to form troughs at right angles to the direction of flow of the liquid which runs through the channels in the heat exchanger. These troughs are arranged so that they interlink with the other plates which forms the channel with gaps of 1.3 - 1.5 mm between the plates. The plates are compressed together in a rigid frame to form an arrangement of parallel flow channels with alternating hot and cold fluids. The plates produce an extremely large surface area, which allows for the fastest possible transfer. Making each chamber thin ensures that the majority of the volume of the liquid contacts the plate, again aiding exchange. The troughs also create and maintain a turbulent flow in the liquid to maximize heat transfer in the exchanger. A high degree of turbulence can be obtained at low flow rates and high heat transfer coefficient can then be achieved.|$|R

The effect of contact with can coatings, <b>sealing</b> <b>gaskets</b> and the epoxidised oils used in gasket manufacture on furan formation was studied. The objective was to identify factors affecting furan formation. Furan present in heat-processed food samples persisted during cooking. Furan was shown to form in foods on heating, although it did not accumulate to a significant degree on heating in an open vessel. There were no interactions between foods and cans, can coatings or gaskets that had a significant influence on furan formation. Furan accumulated particularly in heat-processed canned and jarred foods because they are sealed containers that receive a considerable thermal load. Heating epoxidised oils used in <b>sealing</b> <b>gaskets</b> formed furan. At the levels used in gaskets, however, epoxidised oils should not affect the formation of furan in foods...|$|R

In order to study the important degree of every key environmental factor in downhole influencing the <b>sealing</b> performance of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material, a new device of simulating downhole environment is designed to test the permeability of O-ring. The sample is hydrogenated nitrile O-ring and orthogonal experiment method is used to do nine tests by getting three levels from temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction. Test adopts fuzzy orthogonal method to analyze the main effects and the interaction between two factors, taking tensile strength, diameter variety rate and pH value of indicator as evaluation index. The results show that: the environmental factor influencing the sealing performance of hydrogenated nitrile O-ring from high to low by turns is temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction, while the interaction between temperature and pressure is the most significant. It provides a new way to study the influence of downhole complex environment on the performance of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material. Moreover, the results have important reference value to further study the failure mechanism of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> ring in many environmental factors and the rational use in engineering...|$|R
