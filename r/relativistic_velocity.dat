5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the <b>relativistic</b> <b>velocity</b> of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E
25|$|Poincaré {{made clear}} the {{importance}} of {{paying attention to the}} invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining <b>relativistic</b> <b>velocity</b> transformations and recorded them in a letter to Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz (1853–1928) in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell's equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. In 1905, Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating {{at the speed of light}} as being required by the Lorentz transformations.|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamical}} Casimir {{effect is}} {{the production of}} particles and energy from an accelerated moving mirror. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to quantum mechanics equations made in the 1970s. In May 2011 an announcement was made {{by researchers at the}} Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified SQUID to change the effective length of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required <b>relativistic</b> <b>velocity.</b> If confirmed this would be the first experimental verification of the dynamical Casimir effect.|$|E

2500|$|As was {{explained}} above, already in 1895 Lorentz succeeded in deriving Fresnel's dragging coefficient (to {{first order of}} v/c) and the Fizeau experiment by using the electromagnetic theory {{and the concept of}} local time. After first attempts by Jakob Laub (1907) to create a relativistic [...] "optics of moving bodies", it was Max von Laue (1907) who derived the coefficient for terms of all orders by using the colinear case of the <b>relativistic</b> <b>velocity</b> addition law.

2500|$|Minkowski's space-time {{formalism}} {{was quickly}} accepted and further developed. For example, Arnold Sommerfeld (1910) replaced Minkowski's matrix notation by an elegant vector notation and coined the terms [...] "four vector" [...] and [...] "six vector". He also introduced a trigonometric {{formulation of the}} <b>relativistic</b> <b>velocity</b> addition rule, which according to Sommerfeld, removes much of the strangeness of that concept. Other important contributions were made by Laue (1911, 1913), who used the spacetime formalism to create a relativistic theory of deformable bodies and an elementary particle theory. He extended Minkowski's expressions for electromagnetic processes to all possible forces and thereby clarified the concept of mass-energy-equivalence. Laue also showed that non-electrical forces are needed to ensure the proper Lorentz transformation properties, and for the stability of matter– he could show that the [...] "Poincaré stresses" [...] (as mentioned above) are a natural consequence of relativity theory so that the electron can be a closed system.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} drag force on dust grains moving at <b>relativistic</b> <b>velocities</b> through {{interstellar}} gas and explore its application. First, we derive a new analytical formula of the drag force at high energies {{and find that}} it is significantly reduced compared to the classical model. Second, we apply the obtained drag force to calculate the terminal velocities of interstellar grains by strong radiation sources such as supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find that grains can be accelerated to <b>relativistic</b> <b>velocities</b> by very luminous AGNs. We then quantify the deceleration of relativistic spacecraft proposed by the Breakthrough Starshot initiative due to gas drag on a relativistic lightsail. We find that the spacecraft's slowing down is negligible because of the suppression of gas drag at <b>relativistic</b> <b>velocities,</b> suggesting that the lightsail may be open for communication during its journey to α Centauri without causing a considerable delay. Finally, we show that the damage to relativistic thin lightsails by interstellar dust is a minor effect. Comment: ApJ, in press; 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
