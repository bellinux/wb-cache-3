40|$|A {{clean and}} cheap {{procedure}} for {{the synthesis of}} zeolites is presented, using glass and aluminum wastes as starting materials. The products are aluminosilicate materials with a high cation exchange capacity (CEC: 259 – 389. 5 [*]meq/ 100 [*]g) containing 25 – 30 % of crystalline zeolites. Since the synthesized materials are free of potentially toxic elements, they could be safely used for environmental and agricultural applications. More specifically, a material containing 30 % of zeolite A has been synthesized at 60 °C in one week, using NaOH as mineralizing agent. About 15 % of zeolite A has been obtained at room temperature in six months. When KOH was employed, 25 % of edingtonite has been produced in the final material after one week at 90 °C. All the materials have been characterized for crystallinity, crystal morphology, particle size, pore size, surface area, and CEC. The whole process has been designed with the aim to recycle useful waste materials and <b>reduce</b> <b>at</b> <b>minimum</b> energy consumption {{and the production of}} harmful greenhouse gases...|$|E
40|$|In new {{particles}} searches at LEP, for {{the ones}} characterised by missing energy, {{it is very important}} to have the best hermeticity in detecting particles in final states. Photon counters were installed during 1994 and 1995 to cover the weak region in photon detection, between the central part and the end-caps of DELPHI. We discuss the working principles and the tests done on the counters. The optimisation of the counters and of the detectors already present in the other weak regions of DELPHI was examined. We estimate that the efficiency of detecting photons over all the useful solid angle changes from 97 % to more than 99. 6 %. This was verified using the 1994 leptonic data of LEP at 95 % confidence level. A search for the lightest supersymmetric partners of the charged bosons (charginos) was done at LEP 1. 5. All the hermeticity detectors were used to <b>reduce</b> <b>at</b> <b>minimum</b> the contamination from radiative backgrounds. The theoretical motivations and the phenomenological description of the chargiNO 1 are given. The search was done on the data collected at LEP in November 1995 at 130. 4 and 136. 3 GeV. We put different lower limits on the chargino mass which depend on the parameters of the theoretical model. They vary between 56. 3 GeV and 66. 8 GeV.

40|$|The key {{principle}} {{behind the}} concept of sustainability is {{meeting the needs of}} the present without compromising the needs of future generations. If natural resources such as soil, nutrients and water are used up at a rate faster than they are replenished, then the farming system becomes unsustainable. Another key concept of sustainability is to maintain a high level of biodiversity also by adopting sustainable pest management (integrated pest management) strategies in order to <b>reduce</b> <b>at</b> <b>minimum</b> the risk for {{human health and the environment}} (EU directive 128 / 2009). Vineyards and fruit trees are some of the most important and extensive crops in Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. In conventional farming systems, adopted by the majority of the farmers in Southern Italy, frequent soil tillage enhances soil erosion and loss of soil fertility, and often reduces soil microbial diversity and soil microbiota complexity, that strongly contribute to the overall soil fertility. For these reasons, these conventional agronomic practices should evolve in a more sustainable management (e. g., grass cover, pruning residues recycling, organic matter inputs) addressed to improve soil organic matter. Under semi-arid climatic conditions, the application of endogenous organic matter can be a key factor to enhance soil quality and fertility and to preserve natural resources, mainly soil and water, avoiding detrimental effects on the environment. Furthermore, agricultural practices can play an important role in carbon sequestration. The carbon stock can be viewed as measure of the relative contribution to biomass to the carbon cycle, and the capacity to store organic carbon depends to a great extent upon climate and soil properties, although the cultivation system can play a considerable part. Together with the soil management, other critical points for a sustainable horticulture are the fertilization and the irrigation system which could influence water use efficiency, yield quality, and pest and soil management. Results of experiments carried out in the last two decades will be presented. The final goal is to encourage farmers to adopt a sustainable farming system as a whole, not just as individual elements, in order to promote good-quality fruit production without negative effects on the environment...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether tumor marker staining {{can improve the}} sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) to diagnose pancreatic malignancy. METHODS: Patients who underwent EUS-FNA were retrospectively identified. Each EUS-FNA specimen was evaluated by routine cytology and stained for tumor markers p 53, Ki- 67, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19 - 9. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR) were calculated in order to evaluate the performance of each test to detect malignancy. RESULTS: Sixty-one specimens had complete sets of stains, yielding 49 and 12 specimens from pancreatic adenocarcinomas and benign pancreatic lesions due to pancreatitis, respectively. Cytology alone had sensitivity and specificity of 41 % and 100 % to detect malignancy, respectively. In 46 % of the specimens, routine cytology alone was deemed indeterminate. The addition of either p 53 or Ki- 67 increased the sensitivity to 51 % and 53 %, respectively, with perfect specificity, PPV and PLR (100 %, 100 % and infinite). Both stains in combination increased the sensitivity to 57 %. While additional staining with CEA and CA 19 - 9 further increased the sensitivity to 86 %, the specificity, PPV and PLR were significantly <b>reduced</b> (<b>at</b> <b>minimum</b> 42 %, 84 % and 1, respectively). Markers in all combinations performed poorly as a negative test (NPV 26 % to 47 %, and NLR 0. 27 and 0. 70).

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, four {{energy control}} {{strategies}} are proposed and analyzed for the Standalone Renewable / Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Source (RES/FC HPS). The {{concept of the}} Load Following (LF) and Maximum Efficiency Point Tracking (MEPT) is used to control the fueling rates. A standalone RES/FC HPS uses at least one Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell (FC) as backup source. Photovoltaic (PV) array and wind turbines (WT) farm are used as RES and the surplus of energy during light load stages is stored in hydrogen tank via water electrolysis to fuel the PEMFC. Small-scale RESs and commercially available PEMFCs are interfaced to the common DC bus via power converters {{and then to the}} single-phase distribution grid through a voltage source inverter. RES/FC HPS seem to be an efficient alternative for supplying smart houses and isolated sites. This paper proposes a new supervision strategy of the Energy Management Unit (EMU) based on the LF control approach that assures a charge-sustaining (CS) mode for the Energy Storage System (ESS). So, the capacity of the batteries stack can be <b>reduced</b> <b>at</b> <b>minimum</b> if it is directly connected to the DC bus. The ultracapacitors stack compensates dynamically the power flow balance on the DC bus, regulating the DC voltage via a bidirectional buck-boost power converter. Thus, a semi-active hybrid topology is adopted for the ESS having the batteries stack. The MEPT loops ensure an optimized energy management of the RES/FC HPS.

40|$|Expanding habitat {{protection}} {{is a common}} tactic for species conservation. When unprotected habitat is privately owned, decisions must be made about which areas to protect by land purchase or conservation easement. To address this problem, we developed an optimization framework for choosing the habitat-protection strategy that minimizes the risk of population extinction subject to an upper bound on funding. The framework {{is based on the}} idea that an extinction-risk function that predicts the relative effects of varying the quantity and quality of habitat can be estimated from the results of a demographic model of population viability. We used the framework to address the problem of expanding the protected habitat of a core population of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) in the Panoche area in central California. We first developed a stochastic demographic model of the kit fox population. Predictions from the simulation model were used to estimate an extinction-risk function that depended on areas of good- and fair-quality habitat. The risk function was combined with costs of {{habitat protection}} to determine cost-efficient protection strategies and risk-cost curves showing how extinction risk could be <b>reduced</b> <b>at</b> <b>minimum</b> cost for increasing levels of funding. One important result was that cost-efficient shares of the budget used to protect different types of habitat changed as the budget increased and depended on the relative costs of available habitat and the relative effects of habitat protection on extinction risk. Another important finding was the sensitivity of the location and slope of the risk-cost curve to assumptions about the spatial configuration of available habitat. When the location and slope of the risk-cost curve are sensitive to model assumptions, resulting predictions of extinction risk and risk reduction per unit cost should be used very cautiously in ranking conservation options among different species or populations. The application is an example of how the results of a complex demographic model of population viability can be synthesized for use in optimization analyses to determine cost-efficient habitat-protection strategies and risk-cost tradeoffs...|$|R

In all four species, the zoeae were reared in seawater (32 PSU, control) and <b>at</b> a <b>reduced</b> salinity of 25 PSU, the euryhaline species also at 10 PSU; additionally, a 20 PSU treatment was included in H. araneus and P. fasciatum.

In H. araneus, W was maximum in seawater, declining <b>at</b> <b>reduced</b> salinities (<b>minimum</b> <b>at</b> 20 PSU).

The protein content remained in all species practically constant, with a slight (but significant) peak only in zoeae of P. fasciatum exposed to 25 PSU. In conclusion, reduced zoeal growth occurred in H. araneus at slightly or moderately reduced salinities (20 - 25 PSU), but in estuarine species only at a very low salinity (10 PSU).

40|$|Taphonomy is {{commonly}} described as “the {{study of the}} environmental conditions affecting the preservation of animal or plant remains”. This broad definition is usually understood to refer to post-depositional processes. One of the main purposes of taphonomic studies is the understanding of possible biases in the fossil record. In this respect, different forms of pre- and post-depositional taphonomy can affect phytolith assemblages that scientists retrieve from sediments and soils. These can be both natural- and human-induced. This paper analyses the forms of possible biases during- and post-depositional, as well as during sampling, recovery and study and proposes some methodological adjustments as to reduce the possibility of errors {{as well as to}} check the representativeness of the assemblages retrieved. It is shown that control is possible when human action is involved in the form of attentiveness in sampling and recovery strategies. Pragmatic and statistic methods are proposed so to understand the impact of pre- and post-depositional taphonomic processes on the final phytolithic assemblage. With an increase of stratigraphic control and simple calculation of representativeness it is possible to achieve a confident level of standardisation so to <b>reduce</b> biases <b>at</b> <b>minimum</b> and obtain reliable results with phytolith analysis.

40|$|For most {{bacterial}} pathogens, adherence of {{the bacterium}} {{to the surface}} of the host cell tissue is a necessary first step for colonization and infection. Agents that inhibit adherence, therefore, could be useful for preventing infections. The goal of this research was to assess the anti-adherent activity of several food-grade prebiotic carbohydrates, plant extracts, and other naturally-derived molecules against enteric pathogens. First, the antiadherent effect of galactooligosaccharides (GOS), polydextrose (PDX), and a GOS-PDX blend was tested against two strains of Cronobacter “Enterobacter” sakazakii. When measured microscopically or by cultural methods, significant reductions in adherence (56 % and 71 %, respectively) of C. sakazakii were observed in the presence of GOS (16 mg/ml). Adherence inhibition also occurred (48 %) when the GOS-PDX blend (8 mg/ml each) was tested, although PDX by itself had less effect. Subsequently, the ability of several prebiotic agents, including chitooligosaccharides (COS) and mannan oligosaccharides derived from yeast cell walls (MOSy) and konjac root (MOSk), to inhibit adherence of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorragic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Salmonella typhimurium to a human HEp- 2 cell line was tested. In addition, a high molecular weight component of cranberry (CHMW) was also assessed for anti-adherence. Different fractions of COS significantly reduced adherence of EPEC at a concentration of 16 mg/ml. Although MOSy inhibited EPEC, EHEC, and S. typhumiurim, adherence inhibition was not observed for MOSk. Adherence inhibition of EPEC, EHEC, and S. typhumiurim by CHMW was observed. Finally, the ability of two different types of lactoferrin to inhibit adherence of Cronobacter sakazakii to a HEp- 2 human cell line was assessed. Results showed that the adherence of C. sakazakii was significantly <b>reduced</b> <b>at</b> a <b>minimum</b> concentration of 10 mg/ml. However, at higher concentrations (up to 50 mg/ml), further reductions in adherence were not observed. These results show that different prebiotics, plant extracts, and other molecules may be added to foods as a prophylactic treatment to prevent or mitigate infections by enteric pathogens.
