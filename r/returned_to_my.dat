500|$|I <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the {{letterpress}} thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and {{yet there}} were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of 'the solitary rocks and promontories' by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape-- ...|$|E
500|$|The Soviet {{government}} {{welcomed the}} overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista by Fidel Castro's pro-socialist rebels in 1959. Khrushchev realized the potential of a Soviet ally in the Caribbean and dispatched Mikoyan {{as one of the}} top diplomats in Latin America. He was the first Soviet official (discounting Soviet intelligence officers) to visit Cuba after the revolution, and secured important trade agreements with the new government. He left Cuba with a very positive impression, saying that the atmosphere there made him feel [...] "as though I had <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> childhood." ...|$|E
500|$|The 49th {{had been}} ordered to proceed up the beaches of Egmont-op-Zee, a steep climb through sand dunes and poor terrain. The risks were {{exacerbated}} by harassment from French sharpshooters, who had excellent cover. After about six hours of heavy fighting, the attack was stopped about a mile (1.6km) short of the British objective. After an hour of close combat, the French began to withdraw. Brock was injured in the fighting when hit in the throat by a spent musket ball. His neck cloth prevented a possibly fatal injury. In his own words, [...] "I got knocked down shortly after the enemy began to retreat, but never quitted the field, and <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> duty in less than half an hour." ...|$|E

500|$|The lawsuit {{alleges that}} Sony induced King’s release from his {{publishing}} contract {{and refused to}} pay compensation. The attorney Alicia Roman told The Huffington Post, [...] " [...] annul the release due to the fraud they committed. When it’s annulled, all of the rights to Elijah’s songs are <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> client, particularly the song 'Vida' that Ricky Martin sang." [...] Martin has not made any comment on the lawsuit. Additionally, Luis Adrian Cortes Ramos, a finalist from the first season of Idol Puerto Rico filled a $10 million lawsuit towards Martin. He sued the singer for releasing [...] "Vida" [...] despite claims that he submitted {{his version of the}} track as part of SuperSong contest, a version that was never recognized. Ramos' lawyer released a statement saying [...] "Ramos was surprised, disillusioned and suffered mental anguish because the song was almost identical to the one he composed. Until that moment, Martin was an idol for Ramos." [...] However, Martin's representative never commented on the lawsuit.|$|E

He said the techniques worked well on his second flight and enabled him to fly a big circle back to the shore where his helpers waited.

2500|$|Romasanta {{admitted}} 13 murders {{explaining that}} he had been cursed and had committed them after transforming into a wolf."The first time I transformed, was in the mountains of Couso. I came across two ferocious-looking wolves. I suddenly fell to the floor, and began to feel convulsions, I rolled over three times, and a few seconds later I myself was a wolf. I was out marauding with the other two for five days, until I <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own body, the one you see before you today, Your Honour. The other two wolves came with me, who I thought were also wolves, changed into human form. They were from Valencia. One was called Antonio and the other Don Genaro. They too were cursed... we attacked and ate a number of people because we were hungry." [...] Manuel Blanco RomasantaThe prosecutor, Luciano Bastida Hernáez, asked Romasanta to demonstrate the transformation for the court to which he replied that the curse only lasted for thirteen years and that he was now cured as that time had expired the previous week.|$|E
