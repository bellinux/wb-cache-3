For this reason it can clog drinking water filtration facilities. In order to better understand the population dynamics of Holopedium <b>in</b> a <b>reservoir</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Cascade</b> foothills, in-situ single variable treatments were used to investigate the effects of temperature, food, and turbidity. The fatty acid composition of Holopedium, Daphnia and the seston was tested to examine likely food sources and the possibility of direct competition. It was found that temperature limits the Holopedium population during the spring phytoplankton bloom and low food quality limits the population during the late summer. Competitive exploitation between Holopedium and Daphnia is possible. The composition of several fatty acids in the cladocerans was correlated, indicating shared resources. Daphnia followed the seasonal trends in the seston fatty acid composition more closely than Holopedium, indicating that the overlap in resources was not complete. Holopedium appears to be using the food resources most commonly found above the thermocline and may be able to out-compete Daphnia under conditions when chrysophytes or allochthonous fatty acid sources dominate in the seston, however, Daphnia appears to utilize a wider range of food resources...|$|R

The Passo Real, Jacuí, Itaúba, and Dona Francisca reservoirs are located sequentially in the high way of the Jacuí River - center northern - Rio Grande do Sul state. This work has the objective of characterizing the aquatic compartments found in the remote sensing images and verifying the total solids in suspension participation on the reflectance spectra. The seasonal Landsat images 5 TM (Apr- 28 - 2006, Oct- 21 - 2006, July- 20 - 2007, Mar- 16 - 2008) were acquired, corrected from atmosphere effects and converted to reflectance. Band 3 was utilized for the aquatic compartmentation and reflectance spectra obtained from the main compartments. A greater number of aquatic compartments were identified for the Passo Real, with bigger reflectances, mainly in the tributary entrances. The Jacuí reservoir presented only one aquatic compartment, with the reflectance similar to the water of the Passo Real dam. The Itaúba and Dona Francisca reservoirs generally have a reflectance similar to the upstream reservoirs and with few compartments, but {{the increase in the number}} of compartments depends on the tributary water characteristics. In higher rainfall periods as the occurred in July- 20 - 2007, a larger input from the watersheds with increase in the reflectance values and in the number of aquatic compartments was provided.

40|$|Linkages between {{nutrient}} limitation <b>in</b> the Masinga <b>reservoir</b> <b>in</b> Kenya {{and nutrient}} supply from its catchment were approached {{by the study}} of phosphorus dynamics. The pattern of rainfall and the warm temperatures were characteristic of tropical climates and determined the state of phosphorus in the soil and its delivery to aquatic systems. Mechanism of phosphorus transport were related to adsorption/desorption equilibria between orthophosphate and metal (hydr) oxides fixed at the surface of clay particles. The monitoring of suspended solids, total and dissolved phosphorus, dissolved nitrogen, conductivity and silicate during a {{one and a half}} year field study in a selected subcatchment highlighted patterns of nutrient mobilization and transport from rivers to the reservoir. Yearly budgets of suspended sediment and total phosphorus export from the subcatchment yielded respectively 161 t/km 2 /ann and 109 kg/km 2 /ann for a yearly runoff of 346 mm. Phosphorus loading was contemporaneously monitored <b>in</b> the <b>reservoir.</b> The annual loading was 10. 4 gP/m 2 (1993) and did not result in the establishment of eutrophic conditions. Constant high temperatures, high concentrations of suspended solids and the occurrence of a deep water outlet combined to generate density flows. Part of the load was sedimented in well oxygenated, shallow, upper sections of the reservoir while the rest exited through the deep water uptake and was transported to other reservoirs downstream. The study of phytoplankton biomass and primary production in relation to nutrient availability revealed that periods of phosphorus limitation alternate with light limitation. The phytoplankton assemblage responds with an alternation of periods dominated by filamentous Cyanophytes (Cylindrospermopsis africana, Planktolyngbya limnetica) and pennate diatoms (Achnanthes sp., Synedra ulna).

The catchment covers the area of 182 ha; 95 % is covered by forests and 5 % by arable land and meadows. Field measurements comprised con-tinuous recording of water level at the Thompson’s weir and weekly measurements of groundwater levels in ten wells. Construction development was introduced {{in the area of the}} watercourse during the conducted research: six damming devices (installations) constant weirs- were constructed there. The annual outflow coeffi-cient from the catchment equals to 0. 330. It confirms the necessity of developing the discussed watercourse in order to create the so-called small retention. How-ever, no significant influence was found of the development on the water balance components of the catchment. The influence of the watercourse bank development can be clearly described by conducting an analysis of direct runoff. 14 recorded large floods were subject to analysis; 6 prior to the development and 8 following it. Each of the waves was described by applying Nash’s conceptual model. A con-stant number of 2 <b>reservoirs</b> <b>in</b> a <b>cascade</b> was assumed. Means of time-constants for high water waves after the development were higher by approx. 50 % than for the waves prior to the construction.

The optimizations were based on five different water supply and demand scenarios for the future period from 2011 to 2040.

To investigate the robustness of proposed operation rules, we (1) compare cross-scenario performance of all obtained Pareto-optimal rulesets and (2) investigate whether different metaheuristic optimization algorithms lead to the same results. For the latter we compare the originally used genetic algorithm (Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, NSGA-II) with a particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to achieve}} two goals. The {{first is to}} model the strategic interactions of firms that own <b>cascaded</b> reservoir-hydro plants <b>in</b> oligopolistic and mixed oligopolistic hydrothermal electricity generation markets. Although competition in thermal generation has been extensively modeled {{since the beginning of}} deregulation, the literature on competition in hydro generation is still limited; in particular, equilibrium models of oligopoly that study the competitive behavior of firms that own reservoir-hydro plants along the same river in hydrothermal electricity generation markets are still under development. In competitive markets, when the reservoirs are located along the same river, the water released from an upstream reservoir for electricity generation becomes input to the immediate downstream reservoir, which may be owned by a competitor, for current or future use. To capture the strategic interactions among firms with cascaded reservoir-hydro plants, the Upstream-Conjecture approach is proposed. Under the Upstream-Conjecture approach, a firm with an upstream reservoir-hydro plant assumes that firms with downstream reservoir-hydro plants will respond to changes in the upstream firm 2 ̆ 7 s water release by adjusting their water release by the same amount. The results of the Upstream Conjecture experiments indicate that firms that own upstream <b>reservoirs</b> <b>in</b> a <b>cascade</b> may have incentive to withhold or limit hydro generation, forcing a reduction in the utilization of the downstream hydro generation plants that are owned by competitors. ^ Introducing competition to hydroelectricity generation markets is challenging and ownership allocation of the previously state-owned cascaded reservoir-hydro plants through privatization can have significant impact on the competitiveness of the generation market. The second goal of the dissertation is to extract empirical guidance about best policy choices for the ownership of the state-owned generation plants, including the cascaded reservoir-hydro plants. ^ Specifically, an equilibrium model of oligopoly, where only private firms compete for electricity supply is proposed. Since some electricity generation markets are better characterized as mixed oligopolies, where the public firm coexists with the private firms for electricity supply, and not as oligopolies, another equilibrium model of mixed oligopoly is proposed. The proposed mixed oligopoly equilibrium model is the first implementation of such market structure in electricity markets. ^ The mathematical models developed in this research are applied to the simplified representation of the Turkish electricity generation market to investigate the impact of various ownership allocation scenarios that may result from the privatization of the state owned generation plants, including the cascaded reservoir-hydro plants, on the competitive market outcomes. ...|$|R
