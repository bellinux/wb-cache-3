Technical readjustment between the model of the aircraft and the scene point cloud is already used in navigation to estimate the static placement of the robot. It is planned to make targeted acquisitions, simpler in terms of movement, to verify the absence of chocks in front of the landing gear wheels, or the proper closing of engine cowling latches.|$|E
5|$|The {{guns were}} {{controlled}} from a Battery Commander's Post on the roof, from where commands {{to the gun}} detachments could be relayed via voice pipes. Three depression <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> were installed on the roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns' targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes. Rather than firing all the guns at once, the guns were positioned {{so that they could}} be fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides.|$|E
5|$|To {{perform the}} inspection, the robot has to {{navigate}} around the aircraft {{and get to}} the checkpoints called up in the aircraft virtual model. The position of the aircraft in the airport or factory is not known precisely; the cobot needs to detect the aircraft in order to know its position and orientation relative to the aircraft. To do this, the robot is able to locate itself, either with the laser data from its laser <b>range</b> <b>finders,</b> or with image data from its cameras.|$|E

5|$|Washington and {{the other}} ships of TF39 participated in {{exercises}} with the Home Fleet until late April. Along with certain British units, the task force departed the British Isles as TF99. They escorted some of the Arctic convoys which were carrying vital cargo to the Soviet Union. While carrying out this duty, an accompanying British battleship, , accidentally rammed a destroyer, cutting it in two. Directly behind King George V, Washington passed through the same stretch of sea and received damage from exploding depth charges. Though damage to the hull was minimal—limited to only one leaking fuel tank—many devices on board the ship were damaged, including main battery <b>range</b> <b>finders,</b> circuit breakers, three fire-control and the search radars. The American ships then put in at an Icelandic port, Hvalfjörður, until 15 May; they returned to Scapa Flow on 3 June. On 4 June, Washington hosted the commander of naval forces in Europe, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, who set up a temporary headquarters on the ship {{for the next few}} days. On 7 June, King George VI of the United Kingdom inspected the battleship.|$|E

A 2 D laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> usually used by autonomous mobile robots was extended by a self designed suspension and a servo motor.

50|$|The laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> only detects the {{distance}} of one point in its direction of view. Thus, the scanner scans its entire field of view one point at a time by changing the <b>range</b> <b>finder's</b> direction of view to scan different points. The view direction of the laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> can be changed either by rotating the <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> itself, or by using a system of rotating mirrors. The latter method is commonly used because mirrors are much lighter and can thus be rotated much faster and with greater accuracy. Typical time-of-flight 3D laser scanners can measure {{the distance}} of 10,000~100,000 points every second.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{combination}} of a cheap single-point laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> (LRF) device and cameras has become increasingly useful in recent research and industrial applications. While the single dot laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> can only provide depth for a single pixel in the observed image, it’s cost and size can be useful for handheld devices or very lightweight robotic platforms. In this work, we propose two accurate calibration methods for determining the position {{and direction of the}} laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> with respect to the camera. Notably, we can determine the full calibration, even without observing the laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> observation point in the camera image. We evaluate both methods on synthetic and real data demonstrating their efficiency and good behavior under noise. I...|$|R

Following the disastrous loss of four of the Combined Fleet's fast carriers on 4 June 1942, Kondō's force withdrew to Japan. On 14 July she was assigned as the flagship of the restructured Third Battleship Division. In August, Kongō was drydocked at Kure to receive surface-detection radar and additional <b>range</b> <b>finders.</b> In September, Kongō embarked with Hiei, Haruna, Kirishima, three carriers, and numerous smaller warships {{in response to the}} U.S. Marine Corps's amphibious landing on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands.

500|$|Earlier US battleships {{had used}} 13-inch guns with black powder propellant; the 1898 {{design of the}} Maine class used more {{powerful}} but smaller 12-inch guns using smokeless powder, giving a greater velocity and flatter trajectory. [...] The 12-inch rifles available in 1904 had a range of , about double {{the range of the}} black powder main armament used in the Spanish–American War. [...] These were considered an excellent compromise between weight and firepower, since limitations in gunnery control made longer-range guns impractical. The contemporary consideration was not whether to go larger, but whether to go with more. In 1902, naval officers, with the backing of President Theodore Roosevelt, began to develop superior fire control techniques and equipment. The development of better spotting and <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> led to improvements in range capacity and accuracy. At the same time, superior training and systems significantly reduced the time required to load and fire the large guns, from three minutes to one minute.|$|E

2500|$|British gunnery control systems, {{based on}} Dreyer tables, were {{well in advance}} of the German ones, as {{demonstrated}} by the proportion of main calibre hits made on the German fleet. Because of its demonstrated advantages, it was installed on ships progressively as the war went on, had been fitted to a majority of British capital ships by May, 1916, and had been installed on the main guns of all but two of the Grand Fleet's capital ships. The Royal Navy used centralised fire-control systems on their capital ships, directed from a point high up on the ship where the fall of shells could best be seen, utilising a director sight for both training and elevating the guns. In contrast, the German battlecruisers controlled the fire of turrets using a training-only director, which also did not fire the guns at once. The rest of the German capital ships were without even this innovation. German range-finding equipment was generally superior to the British [...] FT24, as its operators were trained to a higher standard due to the complexity of the Zeiss [...] <b>range</b> <b>finders.</b> Their stereoscopic design meant that in certain conditions they could range on a target enshrouded by smoke.

2500|$|Though {{scientific}} research on tracking {{devices such as}} radar and sonar was being conducted in Italian universities and military laboratories by men such as Ugo Tiberio and Guglielmo Marconi, the conservative Italian leadership {{had little interest in}} these new technologies, and did not use them to improve the effectiveness of the Italian vessels. This was mainly due to the influence of Admiral Domenico Cavagnari, whom Mussolini appointed as Chief of Staff of the Navy in 1933, and whom he later promoted to Secretary of the Navy. Likewise technological advancement in radio <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> and gunnery control devices for night combat were not incorporated. Regarding such devices, Cavagnari emphasized [...] "not wanting traps in your way".
