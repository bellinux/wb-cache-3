50|$|Since the {{delivered}} {{flow rate}} of HFT {{can meet the}} inspiration flow rate, the delivered gases are not diluted by room air.

Flow rates exceeding inspiratory demand may also provide positive pressure during inspiration. Heated humidification of the respiratory gas facilitates secretion clearance and decreases the development of bronchial hyper-response symptoms. Some patients requiring respiratory support for bronchospasm benefit from using air delivered by HFT without additional oxygen. HFT is useful in the treatment of sleep apnea.|$|E

50|$|Snorkels {{constitute}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space.</b> When {{the user}} takes {{in a fresh}} breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, {{reducing the amount of}} fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in hypercapnia. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the tidal volume of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water. It may also increase fogging.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pulmonary {{function}} is impaired during pneumoperitoneum mainly {{as a result}} of atelectasis formation. We studied the effects of 10 cm H 2 O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and PEEP followed by a recruitment maneuver (PEEP+RM) on end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), oxygenation and respiratory mechanics in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: Sixty consecutive adult patients (30 obese, 30 healthy weight) in reverse Trendelenburg position were prospectively studied. EELV, static elastance of the <b>respiratory</b> system, <b>dead</b> <b>space,</b> and gas exchange were measured before and after pneumoperitoneum insufflation with zero end-expiratory pressure, with PEEP alone, and with PEEP+RM. Results are presented as mean ± SD. RESULTS: Pneumoperitoneum reduced EELV (healthy weight, 1195 ± 405 vs. 1724 ± 774 ml; obese, 751 ± 258 vs. 886 ± 284 ml) and worsened static elastance and <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> in both groups (in all P < 0. 01 vs. zero-end expiratory pressure before pneumoperitoneum) whereas oxygenation was unaffected. PEEP increased EELV (healthy weight, 570 ml, P < 0. 01; obese, 364 ml, P < 0. 01) with no effect on oxygenation.

40|$|Background: Lung {{clearance}} index (LCI) is {{a measure}} of abnormal ventilation distribution derived from the multiple breath inert gas washout (MBW) technique. We aimed to determine the clinical utility of LCI in non-CF bronchiectasis, and to assess two novel MBW parameters that distinguish between increases in LCI due to specific ventilation inequality (LCIvent) and increased <b>respiratory</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> (LCIds). Methods: Forty-three patients with non-CF bronchiectasis and 18 healthy control subjects underwent MBW using the sulphur hexafluoride wash-in technique, and data from 40 adults with CF were re-analysed. LCIvent and LCIds were calculated using a theoretical two-compartment lung model, and represent the proportional increase in LCI above its ideal value due to specific ventilation inequality and increased <b>respiratory</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space,</b> respectively. Results: LCI was significantly raised in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis compared to healthy controls (9. 99 versus 7. 28, p 0. 75), and correlated significantly with measures of spirometric airflow obstruction. Conclusion: LCI is repeatable, discriminatory, and is associated with spirometric airflow obstruction in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. LCIvent and LCIds are a practical and repeatable alternative to phase III slope analysis and may allow a further level of mechanistic information to be extracted from the MBW test in patients with severe ventilation heterogeneity. © 2014 Gonem et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effects of implementing additional <b>respiratory</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> during cycloergometry-based aerobic training. The primary outcome measures were respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and carbon dioxide production (VCO 2). Two groups of young healthy males: Experimental (Exp, n = 15) and Control (Con, n = 15), participated in this study. The training consisted of 12 sessions, performed twice a week for 6 weeks. A single training session consisted of continuous, constant-rate exercise on a cycle ergometer at 60 % of VO 2 max which was maintained for 30 minutes. Subjects in Exp group were breathing through additional <b>respiratory</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> (1200 ml), while subjects in Con group were breathing without additional dead space. Pre-test and two post-training incremental exercise tests were performed for the detection of gas exchange variables. In all training sessions, pCO 2 was higher and blood pH was lower in the Exp group (p < 0. 001) ensuring respiratory acidosis. A 12 -session training program resulted in significant increase in performance time in both groups (from 17 ” 29 ± 1 ” 31 to 18 ” 47 ± 1 ” 37 in Exp; p= 0. 02 and from 17 ” 20 ± 1 ” 18 to 18 ” 45 ± 1 ” 44 in Con; p = 0. 02), but has not revealed a significant difference in RER and VCO 2 in both post-training tests, performed at rest and during submaximal workload.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{mountain}} sickness (CMS), {{which is}} characterised by hypoxemia, erythrocytosis and pulmonary hypertension, {{is a major}} public health problem in high-altitude dwellers. The only existing treatment is descent to low altitude, an option that for social reasons almost never exists. Sleep disordered breathing may represent an underlying mechanism. We recently found that in mountaineers increasing the <b>respiratory</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> markedly improves sleep disordered breathing. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the effects of this procedure on sleep disordered breathing in patients with CMS. Methods: In 10 male Bolivian high-altitude dwellers (mean ± SD age, 59 ± 9 y) suffering from CMS (haemoglobin > 20 g/L) full night sleep recordings (Embletta, RespMed) were obtained in La Paz (3600 m). In random order, one night was spent with a 500 ml increase in dead space through a custom designed full face mask and the other night without it. Exclusion criteria were: secondary erythrocytosis, smoking, drug intake, acute infection, cardio- pulmonary or neurologic disease and travelling to low altitude in the preceding 6 months. Results: The major new finding was that added dead space dramatically improved sleep disordered breathing in patients suffering from CMS. The apnea/hypopnea index decreased by > 50 % (from 34. 5 ± 25. 0 to 16. 8 ± 14. 9, P = 0. 003), the oxygen desaturation index decreased from 46. 2 ± 23. 0 to 27. 2 ± 20. 0 (P = 0. 0004) and hypopnea index from 28. 8 ± 20. 9 to 16. 3 ± 14. 0 (P = 0. 01), whereas nocturnal oxygen saturation increased from 79. 8 ± 3. 6 to 80. 9 ± 3. 0 % (P = 0. 009). The procedure was easily accepted and well tolerated. Conclusion: Here, we show for the very first time that an increase in <b>respiratory</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> through a fitted mask dramatically improves nocturnal breathing in high-altitude dwellers suffering from CMS. We speculate that when used in the long-term, this procedure will improve erythrocytosis and pulmonary hypertension and offer an inexpensive and easily implementable treatment for this major public health problem...|$|E

Methods: Eight anesthetized pigs were submitted to IAH of 20 mm Hg with a carbon dioxide insufflator for 30 {{minutes and then}} submitted to lung lavage with saline and Tween (2. 5 %). Pressure x volume curves of the respiratory system were performed by a low flow method during IAH and ALI, and PEEP was subsequently adjusted to 27 cm center dot H(2) O for 30 minutes. Results: IAH decreases pulmonary and respiratory system static compliances and increases airway resistance, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, and <b>respiratory</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space.</b> The presence of concomitant ALI exacerbates these findings.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the difference in incremental exercise test performance with and without a RGC system. DESIGN: Twenty moderately active males (age 21. 0 ± 1. 9 years; VO 2 peak 55. 9 ± 3. 0 ml∙kg- 1 ∙min- 1) performed two progressive treadmill tests to volitional exhaustion. In random order subjects ran with (MASK) or without (NO-MASK) a RGC facemask and flow sensor connected to a gas analyzer. Descriptive data (mean ± SD) were determined for all parameters.
