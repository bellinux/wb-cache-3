500|$|Parker and Stone were in New York {{to attend}} the 65th Tony Awards, when they were {{requested}} for interviews and had to answer questions at press junkets regarding the episode. On June 15, 2011, Parker and Stone appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where they denied being unhappy with the show and stated that they still enjoy producing episodes. Parker commented that, while the episode did deal with some issues they had with the show, they particularly enjoyed creating [...] "You're Getting Old", and that despite not knowing what upcoming episodes would be about, they would figure it out upon resuming production in August 2011. [...] "Looking back at it, it kinda does look like we’re kinda saying we don't {{want to do this}} anymore, but it's not <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were saying," [...] said Parker in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E

60|$|We sailed {{away for}} the Cape of Good Hope the {{beginning}} of October 1706, and passed by, in sight of the Cape, the 12th of November following, having met {{with a great deal}} of bad weather. We saw several merchant-ships in the roads there, as well English as Dutch, whether outward bound or homeward we could not tell; be it what it would, we did not think fit to come to an anchor, not knowing what they might be, or what they might attempt against us, when they knew what we were. However, as we wanted fresh water, we sent the two boats belonging to the Portuguese man-of-war, with all Portuguese seamen or negroes in them, to the watering-place, to take in water; and in the meantime we hung out a Portuguese ancient at sea, and lay by all that night. They knew not what we were, but it seems we passed for anything but <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> was.|$|E

6000|$|PAGANUS DE LYSKERET, styled Presbyter, was {{collated}} in 1280. It {{appears that}} at this time there was a perpetual vicar established in the Church of Hursley as well as a rector; and that he was instituted by the bishop, had a certain fixed maintenance assigned to him, and was independent of the rector. In the register of John de Pontissera, Bishop of Winton, may now be seen what is there called the [...] "Ordinatio Episcopi inter Rectorem et Vicarium de Hurslegh." [...] It is therein settled that the vicar shall have a house as described and other emoluments, and that the rector shall pay to him forty shillings per annum. The vicar at this time was Johannes de Sta. Fide. The deed of settlement was executed in Hyde Abbey, in the year 1291; Philip de Barton, John de Ffleming, William de Wenling, and others being witnesses to it. Vide Regist. de Pontissera, fol. 10. Forty shillings or five marks was, it appears, the stipend usually assigned to vicars and curates at this time, the vicar being <b>REALLY</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> now call a curate.|$|E
60|$|I {{shall never}} forget the {{impressions}} of that evening, nor the way, in particular, the immediate effect of some of them was to merge the light of my extravagant perceptions in a glamour much more diffused. I remember feeling seriously warned, while dinner lasted, not to yield further to my idle habit of reading into mere human things an interest so much deeper than mere human things were in general prepared to supply. This especial hour, at Newmarch, had always a splendour that asked little of interpretation, that even carried itself, with an amiable arrogance, as indifferent to what the imagination could do for it. I think the imagination, in those halls of art and fortune, was almost inevitably accounted a poor matter; the whole place and its participants abounded so in pleasantness and picture, in all the felicities, for every sense, taken for granted there by the very basis of life, that even the sense most finely poetic, aspiring to extract the moral, could scarce have helped feeling itself treated to something of the snub that affects--when it does affect--the uninvited reporter in whose face a door is closed. I said to myself during dinner that these were scenes in which a transcendent intelligence had after all no application, and that, in short, any preposterous acuteness might easily suffer among them such a loss of dignity as overtakes the newspaper-man kicked out. We existed, all of us together, to be handsome and happy, to be <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> looked--since we looked tremendously well; to be that and neither more nor less, so not discrediting by musty secrets and aggressive doubts our high privilege of harmony and taste. We were concerned only with what was bright and open, and the expression that became us all was, at worst, that of the shaded but gratified eye, the air of being forgivingly dazzled by too much lustre.|$|E
6000|$|The crew {{consisted}} of about thirty men, natives of Macassar and the adjacent coasts and islands. They were mostly young, and were short, broad-faced, good-humoured looking fellows. Their dress consisted generally {{of a pair}} of trousers only, when at work, and a handkerchief twisted round the head, to which in the evening they would add a thin cotton jacket. Four of the elder men were [...] "jurumudis," [...] or steersmen, who had to squat (two at a time) in the little steerage before described, changing every six hours. Then there was an old man, the [...] "juragan," [...] or captain, but who was <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> should call the first mate; he occupied {{the other half of the}} little house on deck. There were about ten respectable men, Chinese or Bugis, whom our owner used to call [...] "his own people." [...] He treated them very well, shared his meals with them, and spoke to them always with perfect politeness; yet they were most of them a kind of slave debtors, bound over by the police magistrate to work for him at mere nominal wages for a term of years till their debts were liquidated. This is a Dutch institution in this part of the world, and seems to work well. It is a great boon to traders, who can do nothing in these thinly-populated regions without trusting goods to agents and petty dealers, who frequently squander them away in gambling and debauchery. The lower classes are almost all in a chronic state of debt. The merchant trusts them again and again, till the amount is something serious, when he brings them to court and has their services allotted to him for its liquidation. The debtors seem to think this no disgrace, but rather enjoy their freedom from responsibility, and the dignity of their position under a wealthy and well-known merchant. They trade a little on their own account, and both parties seem to get on very well together. The plan seems a more sensible one than that which we adopt, of effectually preventing a man from earning anything towards paying his debts by shutting him up in a jail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Miss Miniver--she {{went on in}} a {{regularly}} undulating voice--"we DO please men. We {{have that}} gift. We can see round them and behind them and through them, {{and most of us}} use that knowledge, in the silent way we have, for our great ends. Not all of us, but some of us. Too many. I wonder what men would say if we threw the mask aside--if <b>we</b> <b>really</b> told them <b>what</b> <b>WE</b> thought of them, <b>really</b> showed them <b>what</b> <b>WE</b> were."

60|$|That, my friends, is a {{question}} which can never be answered but by {{those who believe in}} the mystery of the ever-blessed Trinity, The Father, The Son, and The Holy Ghost. It is too solemn and great a matter to be spoken of hastily {{at the end of a}} sermon. I will tell you what little I seem to see of it next Sunday, with awe and trembling, as one who enters upon holy ground. But this I will tell you, to bear in mind meanwhile, that if you wish to know or to do what is right, you must firmly believe and bear in mind this,--that God's justice is exactly like what would be just in you and me, without any difference whatsoever: that God's mercy is exactly like what would be merciful in you and me; and that, as I hope to show you next Sunday, God's humility, wonderful as it may seem, is exactly like what would be humble in you and me. For I warn you, that if you do not believe this, you will be tempted to forget God's righteousness, and to invent a righteousness of your own, which is no righteousness at all, but unrighteousness. For there can be but one righteousness--mind what I say--only one righteousness, as there can be only one truth, and only one reason. Forget that, and you will be tempted to invent for yourselves a false justice, which is dishonest and partial; a false mercy, which is cruel; a false humility, which is vain and self-conceited; and you will be tempted also, as men of all religions and denominations have been, to impute to God actions, and thoughts, and tempers, which are (as your own consciences, if you would listen to God's Word in them, would tell you) unjust, cruel, and proud; and then you will be tempted to say that things are justifiable in God, which you would not excuse in any other being, by saying: 'Of course it must be right in Him, because He is God, and can do what He will.' As if the Judge of all the earth would not do Right; as if He could be anything, or could do anything, but the Eternal Good which is His very being and essence, and which He has shown forth in His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who went about doing good because God was with Him. We all know what the good which He did was like. Let us believe that God the Father's goodness is the same as Jesus Christ's goodness. Let us believe <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> say when we confess that Jesus was the brightness of His Father's Glory, and the express image of His Person.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't {{it rather}} {{as if we}} had, Charlotte and I, for {{bringing}} us together, a benefactor in common?" [...] And the effect, for his interlocutress, was still further to be deepened. [...] "I somehow feel, half the time, {{as if he were}} her father-in-law too. It's as if he had saved us both--which is a fact in our lives, or at any rate in our hearts, to make of itself a link. Don't you remember"--he kept it up--"how, the day she suddenly turned up for you, just before my wedding, we so frankly and funnily talked, in her presence, of the advisability, for her, of some good marriage?" [...] And then as his friend's face, in her extremity, quite again as with Charlotte, but continued to fly the black flag of general repudiation: [...] "Well, we really began then, as it seems to me, the work of placing her where she is. We were wholly right--and so was she. That it was exactly the thing is shown by its success. We recommended a good marriage at almost any price, so to speak, and, taking us at our word, she has made the very best. That was <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> meant, wasn't it? Only--what she has got--something thoroughly good. It would be difficult, it seems to me, for her to have anything better--once you allow her the way it's to be taken. Of course if you don't allow her that the case is different. Her offset is a certain decent freedom-- which, I judge, she'll be quite contented with. You may say that will be very good of her, but she strikes me as perfectly humble about it. She proposes neither to claim it nor to use it with any sort of retentissement. She would enjoy it, I think, quite as quietly as it might be given. The 'boat,' you see"--the Prince explained it no less considerately and lucidly--"is a good deal tied up at the dock, or anchored, if you like, out in the stream. I have to jump out {{from time to time to}} stretch my legs, and you'll probably perceive, if you give it your attention, that Charlotte really can't help occasionally doing the same. It isn't even a question, sometimes, of one's getting to the dock--one has to take a header and splash about in the water. Call our having remained here together to-night, call the accident of my having put them, put our illustrious friends there, on my companion's track--for I grant you this as a practical result of our combination--call the whole thing one of the harmless little plunges off the deck, inevitable for each of us. Why not take them, when they occur, as inevitable--and, above all, as not endangering life or limb? We shan't drown, we shan't sink--at least I can answer for myself. Mrs. Verver too, moreover--do her the justice--visibly knows how to swim." ...|$|E

Jones recalled: [...] "We liked {{some of what}} we recorded, but it's not <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{wanted it to be}} from start to finish.

[...] Nonetheless, this decision came several weeks after the band's record label had already included the ambient disc with promotional copies of the album distributed to various people in the music industry. Drummer Robin Jones felt the reason they dropped the disc was because they were rushed into constructing it in only four days, saying they intended it to be [...] "an ambient… sound-piece. It’s really indulgent on our part, but I wanted to make it a musical story. In the same way Chill Out by The KLF is a story. So it sort of succeeds. It just needed more… conclusions.
