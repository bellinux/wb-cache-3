500|$|The Killers {{reworked}} {{the song}} for the 2011 tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered. [...] "Achtung Baby was U2's 'Holy shit!' moment," [...] remarked drummer Ronnie Vannucci, Jr. [...] "I {{was in high school}} when it came out and we'd drive around in my friend's mom's car and rock that shit all the time. When we were asked to record a cover, 'Ultraviolet' was a unanimous choice. It's <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> know that we're still on the same page after all these years. We brought it back to its bare bones, dumbed it down a little, took it back to the rock song underneath." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining that [...] "after last week’s semi-misfire, it was <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> see Fringe back in good form this week, with a creepy case, a great villain, and a pertinent plot twist". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite surprised by this episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't hold my interest at all, but everything else in this installment was fascinating material that expanded the mythos of the series far more than I could have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you probably got a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E

500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though she {{has been}} {{discussed}} in literature frequently, {{much of the information}} is exaggeration or fiction. Scholars say she did notice some geographical features, but [...] "Sacagawea...was not the guide for the Expedition, she was important to them as an interpreter and in other ways." [...] The sight of a woman and her infant son would have been <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> some indigenous nations, and she {{played an important role in}} diplomatic relations by talking to chiefs, easing tensions, and giving the impression of a peaceful mission.|$|E
2500|$|Among Steiner's {{non-traditional}} views, in {{his autobiography}} titled Errata from 1997, Steiner relates his sympathetic stance towards {{the use of public}} houses since his college years at the University of Chicago. As Steiner states, [...] "My virginity offended Alfie (his college room-mate). He found it ostentatious and vaguely corrupt in a nineteen-year-old... He sniffed the fear in me with disdain. And marched me off to Cicero, Illinois, a town justly ill famed but, by virtue of its name, <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> me. There he organized, with casual authority, an initiation as thorough as it was gentle. It is this unlikely gentleness, the caring under circumstances so outwardly crass, that blesses me still." ...|$|E
50|$|The Iraqi {{returned}} praised Embassy’s fruitful {{efforts in}} canceling judicial judgments {{against them in}} Bulgaria and providing voluntary return to them, and according to Ambassador’s guidance, the consul accompanied returned Iraqi citizens <b>to</b> Baghdad and <b>reassured</b> <b>to</b> complete entry procedures and their meeting with Ministry of Displacement and Migration’s commission.|$|R

Sam, {{overcome}} at having finally met her, kisses her also, upsetting her further.

2500|$|Baye {{was cast}} as Cécilia after having {{worked with her}} in Day for Night and The Man Who Loved Women. Baye later stated that [...] "If Francois asked me to perform with him, {{it was because he}} knew I wasn't the kind of actress who caused problems. He could rely on me, which was very <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> him." [...] Truffaut filled out the cast with Jean Dasté as Davenne's boss at The Globe, Antoine Vitez as a clergyman, Jean-Pierre Moulin as a widower that Davenne comforts in the film and Patrick Maléon as the {{deaf-mute}} child. Truffaut also cast technicians and personnel from his production company in small roles.|$|E
2500|$|By Darger's own report, {{his father}} was kind and <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> him and they lived {{together}} until 1900. In that year, the crippled and impoverished Darger Sr. was taken to St. Augustine's Catholic Mission home and his son placed in a Catholic boys' home. Darger Sr. died in 1905, and his son was institutionalized in the Illinois Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children in Lincoln, Illinois, also called the Lincoln State School (today the Lincoln Developmental Center), with the diagnosis, according to Stephen Prokopoff, that [...] "little Henry's heart {{is not in the}} right place." [...] According to John MacGregor, the diagnosis was actually [...] "self-abuse," [...] a euphemism for masturbation.|$|E
2500|$|Cobb {{transferred}} from Guam to the Philippines in February 1941, {{where she was}} again assigned—now as Chief Nurse—to the Canacao Naval Hospital in Manila (located next to the Cavite Navy Yard). When the Japanese attacked the Cavite Navy Yard on December 10, 1941, Cobb and ten other navy nurses remained with the wounded in Manila until the US Military there surrendered to the Japanese on January 2, 1942. Cobb's quiet, professional manner was <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> the other nurses and apparently respected by the Japanese. [...] When ordered by their captors to inventory medical supplies, Cobb instructed the nurses to mislabel valuable quinine as mere soda bicarbonate to preserve the quinine {{for the treatment of}} malaria patients.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{friends in}} Chicago smiled when I told them {{where we had}} been.

2500|$|An F-16 was {{successfully}} refueled on 8 July, and a C-17 on 12 July 2016. Once the hardware fix is verified, a KC-46 with the updated boom will complete regression testing on the F-16, followed by refueling demonstrations with the C-17 and A-10 {{to meet the}} final test for Milestone C approval. USAF chief of staff, General David Goldfein, commented [...] "While it took some time, this week's results confirm my confidence the Boeing team will get this figured out. It's <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> see the program take this important step toward the production decision in August." [...] On 15 July 2016 the KC-46 successfully refueled an A-10; during a four-hour flight, the KC-46 offloaded 1,500 pounds of fuel at 15,000 feet. [...] "This completed the required air refueling demonstrations needed for the upcoming production milestone decision," [...] said Boeing spokesman Chick Ramey. To date, more than 900 flight test hours have been completed with the five test aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{ignored the}} report and {{rejected}} the Kerner Commission's recommendations. In April 1968, {{one month after the}} release of the Kerner report, rioting broke out in more than 100 cities following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. [...] However, in New York City, Lindsay traveled directly into Harlem, telling black residents that he regretted King's death and was working against poverty. He is credited with averting riots in New York with this direct response, even as other major cities burned. David Garth, who accompanied Lindsay that night, recalled: [...] "There was a wall of people coming across 125th Street, going from west to east... I thought we were dead. John raised his hands, said he was sorry. It was very quiet. My feeling was, his appearance there was very <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> people because it wasn't the first time they had seen him. He had gone there on a regular basis. That gave him credibility when it hit the fan." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, his mind was extremely quick....He {{might have been a}} progressive country agent or a professor of ecology at an agricultural college. And yet there was something unprofessorially jaunty about the flip of his hat brim and his springy stride.... It is true that he liked to drive his car at breakneck speed almost as well as to talk about soils, tenant farmers and underground organization...Harold Ware was a frustrated farmer. The soil was in his pores. Unlike most American Communists, who managed to pass from [...] one big city to another without seeing anything in the intervening spaces, Ware was absorbed in the land and its problems. He held that, with the deepening of the agricultural crisis, and with the rapid mechanization of agriculture, the time had come for revolutionary organization among farmers.|$|E

The man who sat there glanced at his attire.|$|R
2500|$|As with predecessor, The Midnight Organ Fight (2008), {{the album}} was greeted with {{widespread}} praise from critics. Allmusic awarded the album four stars out of five. Heather Phares wrote, [...] "On Winter of Mixed Drinks, they focus and polish Organ Fight’s epics — and add {{a healthy dose of}} optimism. Though they’ve always been concerned with heavy issues like life, death, freedom, devotion, and spirituality, this time the bandmembers don’t seem beaten down by their struggles with them. Even when Scott Hutchison sings “Find God just to lose it again” on “The Loneliness and the Scream,” there’s a warmth in the music that makes him sound liberated instead of isolated." [...] Josh Modell of The A.V. Club awarded an [...] "A" [...] rating in his review and stated that the album is an [...] "early contender for 2010 best-of lists," [...] and described the album as The Midnight Organ Fights [...] "slightly more subdued older brother." [...] Laura Barton, writing for the BBC, was also favourable in her review and described the album as, [...] "more polished, more polite than the band’s earlier offerings, but it’s <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> note that the band’s scruffy-hearted charm still lies just below the surface." ...|$|E
