50|$|In {{medieval and}} early modern medicine, the {{medicinal}} leech (Hirudo medicinalis and its congeners Hirudo verbana, Hirudo troctina, and Hirudo orientalis) {{was used to}} remove blood from a patient as part of a process to balance the humors that, according to Galen, must be kept in balance for the human body to function properly. (The four humors of ancient medical philosophy were blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile.) Any sickness that caused the subject's skin to become <b>red</b> (e.g. <b>fever</b> and inflammation), so the theory went, must have arisen from too much blood in the body. Similarly, any person whose behavior was strident and sanguine was thought to be suffering from an excess of blood. Leeches were often gathered by leech collectors and were eventually farmed in large numbers. A unique 19th century 'Leech House' survives in Bedale, North Yorkshire {{on the bank of the}} Bedale Beck, used to store medicinal leeches until the early 20th century.|$|R

The child had symptoms of nasal stuffiness 2 {{weeks prior to}} this presentation. Physical and laboratory findings were suggestive of orbital cellulitis. The baby was started on systemic broad spectrum antibiotics. Despite 48 hours of antibiotics, the fever continued and the orbital signs worsened. Computer tomography scan, revealed a subperiosteal abscess along the medial orbital wall associated with ethmoid sinusitis. Surgical drainage of the subperiosteal abscess was followed by resolution of the clinical condition. Majority of children aged 2 and younger respond well to conservative treatment and no surgical intervention is required, but in our case though the causative organism was sensitive to many antibiotics, {{there was no response}} to systemic antibiotics. Immediate surgical drainage was followed by rapid resolution of the condition. Key words Complications; Ethmoid sinusitis; Orbital cellulitis; Subperiosteal abscess; Treatmen...|$|R
5000|$|Athenaeus (writing in the 1st or 2nd century BCE, {{and drawing}} on the etymological {{speculation}} of Apollodorus of Athens) notes that the red mullet is sacred to Hecate, [...] "on account of the resemblance of their names; for that the goddess is trimorphos, of a triple form". The Greek word for mullet was trigle and later trigla. He goes on to quote a fragment of verse [...] "O mistress Hecate, Trioditis / With three forms and three faces / Propitiated with mullets". In relation to Greek concepts of pollution, Parker observes, [...] "The fish that was most commonly banned was the red mullet (trigle), which fits neatly into the pattern. It 'delighted in polluted things,' and 'would eat the corpse of a fish or a man'. Blood-coloured itself, it was sacred to the blood-eating goddess Hecate. It seems a symbolic summation of all the negative characteristics of the creatures of the deep." [...] At Athens, it is said there stood a statue of Hecate Triglathena, to whom the red mullet was offered in sacrifice. After mentioning that this fish was sacred to Hecate, Alan Davidson writes, [...] "Cicero, Horace, Juvenal, Martial, Pliny, Seneca and Suetonius have left abundant and interesting testimony to the <b>red</b> mullet <b>fever</b> which began to affect wealthy Romans during {{the last years of}} the Republic and really gripped them in the early Empire. The main symptoms were a preoccupation with size, the consequent rise to absurd heights of the prices of large specimens, a habit of keeping red mullet in captivity, and the enjoyment of the highly specialized aesthetic experience induced by watching the color of the dying fish change." ...|$|R

The clinical features of acute and chronic intoxication with trichloroethylene are well-known and have been described in many reports, but hypersensitivity syndrome caused by trichloroethylene is rarely encountered. For managing patients with trichloroethylene hypersensitivity syndrome, avoiding trichloroethylene and initiating glucocorticoid have been generally accepted. Generally, glucocorticoid had been tapered as trichloroethylene hypersensitivity syndrome had ameliorated. However, we encountered a typical case of trichloroethylene hypersensitivity syndrome refractory to high dose glucocorticoid treatment. A 54 -year-old Korean man developed jaundice, <b>fever,</b> <b>red</b> sore eyes, and generalized erythematous maculopapular rashes. A detailed history revealed occupational exposure to trichloroethylene. After starting intravenous methylprednisolone, his clinical condition improved remarkably, but we could not reduce prednisolone because his liver enzyme and total bilirubin began to rise within 2 days after reducing prednisolone under 60 mg/day.

The initial clinical signs of the infection are focal <b>red</b> skin areas, <b>fever,</b> and general symptoms {{similar to those of}} a cold. Then, pustules and ulcerated lesions surrounded by edema and erythema follow, as well as local lymphadenopathy that can last for weeks. Cure and healing of the lesions occur over several weeks, leaving a typical scar in the skin of people and animals affected. The infection definitive diagnosis is made through morphological characterization of the virus by use of electron microscopy, followed by PCR for specific viral genes. Since 1963, circulating orthopoxviruses in infectious outbreaks in several regions of Brazil have been reported. Later, the etiological agent of those infections was characterized as samples of Vaccinia virus. In addition, the widespread use of those viruses in research laboratories and mass vaccination of militaries have contributed to increase the cases of those infections worldwide. Thus, several epidemiological and clinical studies are required, as well as studies of viral immunology, public health, and economic impact, because little is known about those Vaccinia virus outbreaks in Brazil...|$|R

From the histological changes there were the destruction of the epithelium of the gastro-intestinal organs, the atrophy of the testis and the necrosis of the tonsils, but the most noteworthy was the changes in the bone-marrow.
