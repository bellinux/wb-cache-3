Using advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) devices connected to the Internet backbone, electric utilities can not only collect data from end-user connections but also, manage other distribution automation devices like transformers and <b>reclosers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Autoreclosers {{are made}} in {{single-phase}} and three-phase versions, and use either oil, vacuum, or SF6 interrupters. Controls for the <b>reclosers</b> range from the original electromechanical systems to digital electronics with metering and SCADA functions. The ratings of <b>reclosers</b> run from 2.4-38 kV for load currents from 10-1200 A and fault currents from 1-16 kA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reclosers</b> {{address this}} problem by further {{dividing}} up the network into smaller sections. For instance, the city grid example above might be equipped with <b>reclosers</b> at every branch point on the network. <b>Reclosers,</b> because of {{their position in the}} network, handle much less power than the breakers at the feeder stations, and therefore can be set to trip at much lower power levels. This means that a single event on the grid will cut off only the section handled by the single recloser, long before the feeder station would notice a problem. A normal breaker could also be used for this role, but because they are distributed geographically throughout the grid, as opposed to being centralized at feeder stations, resetting a breaker might take considerable time. For this reason, <b>reclosers</b> are used to automatically re-connect after a brief interval. There is a strong likelihood that the fault will be gone when the power is restored. If the fault is still present, the recloser opens again.|$|E
50|$|Outage {{management}} systems are also commonly integrated with SCADA systems which can automatically report {{the operation of}} monitored circuit breakers and other intelligent devices such as SCADA <b>reclosers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Momentary {{power outages}} are often caused by {{transient}} faults, such as lightning strikes or vegetation contacting a power line, and many utilities use <b>reclosers</b> to automatically restore power quickly after a transient fault has cleared.|$|E
5000|$|Connecting to {{the grid}} poses many protection-related challenges. In {{addition}} to islanding, as mentioned above, too {{high levels of}} grid-connected PV result in problems like relay desensitization, nuisance tripping, interference with automatic <b>reclosers,</b> and ferroresonance.|$|E

In addition to thresholds {{that are designed}} to operate quickly, islanding detection systems also have absolute thresholds that will trip long before conditions are reached that could cause end-user equipment damage. It is, generally, the last two issues that cause the most concern among utilities. <b>Reclosers</b> are commonly used to divide up the grid into smaller sections that will automatically, and quickly, re-energize the branch as soon as the fault condition (a tree branch on lines for instance) clears. There is some concern that the <b>reclosers</b> may not re-energize {{in the case of an}} island, or that the rapid cycling they cause might interfere with the ability of the DG system to match the grid again after the fault clears.|$|E

50|$|In {{electric}} power distribution, a recloser, or autorecloser, is {{a circuit breaker}} equipped with a mechanism that can automatically close the breaker {{after it has been}} opened due to a fault. <b>Reclosers</b> are used on overhead distribution systems to detect and interrupt momentary faults. Since many short-circuits on overhead lines clear themselves, a recloser improves service continuity by automatically restoring power to the line after a momentary fault.|$|E

50|$|Other {{standard}} {{features include}} automatic reclosing circuit breakers (<b>reclosers).</b> Most faults (overcurrent) are transient.

The transformer secondary should also be protected by a standard high-rupture capacity (HRC) fuse or low voltage circuit breaker. A surge arrestor (spark gap) on the high voltage side is common, especially in lightning-prone areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reclosers</b> may {{cooperate}} with down-stream protective devices called sectionalizers, usually a disconnector or cutouts {{equipped with a}} tripping mechanism triggered by a counter or a timer. A sectionalizer is generally not rated to interrupt fault current and is therefore cheaper than a recloser. Each sectionalizer detects and counts fault current interruptions by the recloser (or circuit breaker). After a pre-determined number of interruptions, the sectionalizer will open, thereby isolating the faulty section of the circuit, allowing the recloser to restore supply to the other non-fault sections.|$|E

50|$|As {{the utility}} can be {{reasonably}} assured {{that they will}} always have a method for discovering a fault, whether that be automated or simply looking at the recloser, {{it is possible for}} the utility to use this information and transmit it down the line. This can be used to force the tripping of properly equipped DG systems by deliberately opening a series of recloser in the grid to force the DG system to be isolated in a way that forces it out of the NDZ. This method can be guaranteed to work, but requires the grid to be equipped with automated recloser systems, and external communications systems that guarantee the signal will make it through to the <b>reclosers.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{more common}} {{approach}} is [...] "covered" [...] line wire. It {{is treated as}} bare cable, but often is safer for wildlife, as the insulation on the cables {{increases the likelihood of}} a large-wing-span raptor to survive a brush with the lines, and reduces the overall danger of the lines slightly. These types of lines are often seen in the eastern United States and in heavily wooded areas, where tree-line contact is likely. The only pitfall is cost, as insulated wire is often costlier than its bare counterpart. Many utility companies implement covered line wire as jumper material where the wires are often closer to each other on the pole, such as an underground riser/pothead, and on <b>reclosers,</b> cutouts and the like.|$|E
30|$|The {{problems}} associated with load restoration in terrestrial microgrids and ship power systems are similar. <b>Reclosers</b> in terrestrial systems operate in a “single-shot” scheme on live-bus/dead-line post-fault conditions. This operation is known to cause reliability and lifetime degradation due to motor starting and transformer magnetizing inrush currents. Shipboard power systems do not have <b>reclosers.</b> Once a breaker trips, the operator manually investigates {{the source of the}} fault prior to attempting to re-power any interrupted loads.|$|E
40|$|International audienceReclosers and fuses are {{the commonplace}} {{protective}} devices in distribution networks. A recloser can prevent long-time outages by clearing temporary faults before {{operation of the}} fuses in the system. Thus, it decreases the rate of long-term outages and improves system reliability and power quality. Despite positive features of <b>reclosers,</b> each operation of a recloser causes a momentary voltage interruption that exacerbates power quality. Nowadays, power quality issues have become more important because of {{the increasing use of}} sensitive equipment to voltage interruptions. According to the mentioned concerns, it seems necessary to set <b>reclosers</b> {{to strike a balance between}} power quality and the effectiveness of fuse saving scheme. Thus, we proposed a method to set <b>reclosers.</b> Due to the random nature of faults, the proposed method is stochastic based on the Monte Carlo method. The proposed method determines the optimal number of operations, reclosing intervals, and protection zones. The proposed method efficiency is evaluated according to the simulation results, and the proposed method is capable of establishing an optimal trade-off between power quality and protection efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Majority of the faults in the {{transmission}} and distribution network are transient and these faults can be cleared with proper installation of protective devices with appropriate protection settings. It is important to clear the faults as soon as possible by keeping the healthy network undisturbed while avoiding damages to lives and instruments. It was observed that applying protection settings to Medium Voltage network at Grid Substations and Medium Voltage distribution feeders are done by two separate parties without coordination between them. Monthly tripping summary of 33 kV feeders of Grid Substations of Ceylon Electricity Board revealed that some feeders getting disturbed abnormally. Further, it is observed that Auto <b>Reclosers</b> are installed in downstream of these 33 kV feeders to respond to the transient faults but they are not yielding expected results. Hence, applying most appropriate protection setting to these Auto <b>Reclosers</b> and relays are very much required for the higher reliability of the Medium Voltage network. Two 33 kV feeders which were mostly disturbed were analyzed deeply and found that most of the feeder trippings are owing to Earth Fault. Further, with installation of temporary Digital Disturbance Recorder, it was observed that most of the faults have lasted less than 100 ms. Plotted Over Current and Earth Fault co-ordination curves for Medium Voltage distribution network disclose that requirement of revising the settings while identifying the most suitable way of applying Auto <b>Reclosers</b> to the 33 kV feeders. Four scenarios were studied to identify the optimum way of installing Auto <b>Reclosers</b> and protection setting for this Medium Voltage network.

40|$|Coordination among {{protective}} devices in distribution systems {{will be affected}} by adding distributed generators (DGs) to the existing network. That is attributed to the changes in power flow directions and fault currents magnitudes and directions due to the insertion of DG units in the distribution system, which may cause mis-coordination between protection devices. This paper presents an approach to overcome the impacts of DG units insertion on the protection system and to avoid the mis-coordination problem. The proposed approach depends on activating the directional protection feature which is available in most types of modern microprocessor-based <b>reclosers.</b> This will be accompanied by an updating of relays and <b>reclosers</b> settings to achieve the correct coordination. It's clear that this approach do not need any extra costs or any extra equipment to be installed in the distribution system.

40|$|Despite of {{the careful}} {{building}} {{and maintenance of}} the electricity network, faults like short-circuit and earth-faults take place from time to time. Majority of the faults customers experience in low voltage networks are caused by the faults in the medium voltage networks. Therefore minimizing faults in medium voltage networks contributes {{to the quality of}} delivery. A way of improving the quality of delivery is to sectionalize the protection areas into smaller units with network <b>reclosers.</b> <b>Reclosers</b> include short-circuit and earth-fault protection and auto-reclosing functionalities. The best results are gained by placing the recloser so {{that the majority of the}} faults stay behind the device and the customers on the other side, so that they are not affected by the outage caused by the fault occurring behind the recloser. The quality of delivery indexes are improved by using <b>reclosers.</b> After the great storms in the Nordic countries the network owners started to replace over-head line networks with underground cable. The cable characteristics, however, are very different from the characteristics of an over-head line. Cabling increases the capacitive earth-fault current for it may be considered as a cylindrical capacitor. Due to this, also the reactive power generation is increased in cabled networks. Cable can be represented with a pi-section in which the series impedance consists of reactive and resistive parts. Because an underground cable has a zero sequence series impedance which is non-negligible on contrary to over-head line, cabling long feeders produces a resistive earth-fault current component. This cannot be compensated with the usage of a Petersen coil, which is used to compensate purely capacitive earth-fault current. Increase in earth-fault current may cause hazards for human safety because the earth-fault current can energize network equipment and thereby cause dangerous over-voltages. Therefore the contact voltages have to be limited also in terms of regulations. The studies regarding earth-fault current behavior were carried out with a program namely Power System simulator for Engineering. The studies show that as the cabling increases, the zero sequence resistance becomes more dominating. When using only centralized compensation the zero sequence resistance produces resistive earth-fault current, which may cause dangerous over-voltages and causes voltage drops in zero sequence network. This may lead to difficulties in detecting high impedance earth-faults. The fault detection can be contributed with the usage of distributed compensation. The best results are gained by compensating first 10 - 15 kilometers centrally and the rest locally. The distributed Petersen coil should be dimensioned according to the produced earth-fault current in order to avoid over-compensation which may lead to false relay functions. The cable zero sequence impedance, however, is not an unambiguous matter. Therefore some field tests should be performed in the future in order to achieve even better knowledge regarding these issues. /Kir 1...|$|E
