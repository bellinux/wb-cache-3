5000|$|The Glock 18 is a selective-fire {{variant of}} the Glock 17, {{developed}} {{at the request of}} the Austrian counter-terrorist unit EKO Cobra. Originally produced in 1986, this machine pistol-class firearm has a lever-type fire-control selector switch, installed on the serrated portion of the rear left side of the slide. With the selector lever in the bottom position, the pistol fires fully automatically, and with the selector lever in the top position, the pistol fires semiautomatically. The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 will function, with available capacities of 10, 17, or 19 rounds. Early Glock 18 models were ported to reduce muzzle rise during automatic fire. Another compensated variant was produced, known as the Glock 18C. It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, similar to the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the <b>rapid-firing</b> machine <b>pistol.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There are six armor slots: helmet, gauntlets, chest, legs, class item, and {{artifact}} (artifacts {{were added}} with The Taken King). Each class has armor specific {{to them with}} exotic armor that compliment a character's sub-class. Each piece of armor increases overall defense. Before The Taken King, class items were only cosmetic (such as the Hunter's cloak) {{and did not have}} any stat or defense boosts. With The Taken King update, class items were given defense that contributes to players' Light level. Players' Ghost companion was also given defense with The Taken King update that contributes to their Light level. In addition to earning gear from loot drops by playing missions and other activities such as player vs. player activities, players can purchase gear from faction vendors. Players can pledge their allegiance to one of three factions — Dead Orbit, Future War Cult, or New Monarchy — and earning enough reputation with a faction allows players to earn and purchase that faction's legendary items. Players also earn reputation with other vendors, such as the Vanguard and Crucible, by doing playlists or bounties for that vendor, which also have their own set of legendary items. [...] There are also many different types of weapons available for players to earn or purchase: Auto Rifles (fully automatic rifles that expend the magazine as long as the trigger is held down), Pulse Rifles (burst-fire weapons that fire three/four rounds at a time), Scout Rifles (semi-automatic weapons that fire one round at a time and have sniper-like qualities, Hand Cannons (high-impact pistols that have the highest impact of any primary but the smallest magazine), Shotguns (pump-action weapons that fire multiple pellets and have a large spread), Fusion Rifles (high impact weapons that fire several bolts of energy and have a charge time), Sniper Rifles (Precision weapons that reward sharp shooting and have the highest range of any weapon) Sidearms (small <b>rapid-fire</b> <b>pistols</b> that possess fast handling), Rocket Launchers (Heavy artillery weapons that fire (and track) explosive shells at targets), and Machine Guns (Heavy automatics weapons that fire very high-caliber rounds at targets). All armor drops with a randomly rolled value of two out of three boostable statistics: Intellect(How fast your super charges), Discipline(How fast your grenades charge), and Strength(How fast your melee attacks charge, including duplicates). The defense value is determined both by the average value of your weapons and armor as well as the limitations of the activity(only endgame activities such as raids, strike chests and the Archon's Forge arena, as well as Crucible end-of-match drops).|$|R

25|$|The Glock 18 is a selective-fire {{variant of}} the Glock 17, {{developed}} {{at the request of}} the Austrian counter-terrorist unit EKO Cobra, and as a way to internally test Glock components under high strain conditions. Originally produced in 1986, this machine pistol–class firearm has a lever-type fire-control selector switch, installed on the serrated portion of the rear left side of the slide. With the selector lever in the bottom position, the pistol fires fully automatically, and with the selector lever in the top position, the pistol fires semiautomatically. The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 will function, with available capacities of 10, 17, or 19 rounds. Unlike all its other pistols, Glock is highly secretive about Glock 18 models, not featuring them on its official websites or its public catalogues, and because of the pistol's nature, it is only offered to military, law enforcement and government organizations, and its production details are highly classified. Early Glock 18 models were ported to reduce muzzle rise during automatic fire. A very early design introduced a longer ported barrel which was soon discarded as it would not fit in a holster. Another compensated variant was produced, known as the Glock 18C. It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, similar to the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the <b>rapid-firing</b> machine <b>pistol.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Panzer Dragoon Orta is a rail shooter: {{players can}} control the dragon's {{position}} onscreen, and may briefly slow down or speed up (the latter {{can be used as}} a potent ramming attack), but ultimately are in no control to fly about the level. Attacking is performed by holding down a mappable attack button, maneuvering an onscreen cursor over enemies, and releasing the button to fire a volley of arching lasers at each target. Orta is also equipped with a <b>rapid-fire</b> <b>pistol,</b> which can be used by tapping the attack button instead of holding it down. Enemies must thus be defeated before they vanish offscreen as the levels [...] "scroll" [...] by, with the exception of boss battles, which take place in environments that [...] "loop" [...] until the boss is defeated). An onscreen radar marks enemies in the dragon's immediate surroundings as red dots. Using the Right and Left Triggers, the player can rotate the view 90 degrees to the left or right. This way the player can look in front, to the sides or behind the dragon and take down incoming enemies. A Life Gauge displays the dragon's current health. When the dragon's health reaches zero, the game ends and the player will have to redo the entire Episode. If the dragon dies during the final boss fight of the Episode, the player also gets the option to restart the Episode at the boss fight.|$|E
