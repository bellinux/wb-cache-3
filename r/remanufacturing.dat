5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War, {{during which}} many U.S. Apaches {{operated}} from bases within Saudi territory, Saudi Arabia purchased twelve AH-64As for the Royal Saudi Land Force. It {{has been speculated}} that the Saudi purchase had motivated Israel to also procure the Apaches. In August 2006, the Saudi Arabian government began negotiations for Apache upgrades worth up to $400M, possibly <b>remanufacturing</b> their AH-64As to the AH-64D Longbow configuration. In September 2008, the U.S. Government approved the purchase of 12 AH-64Ds requested by Saudi Arabia. In October 2010, Saudi Arabia requested a further 70 AH-64Ds {{as part of a}} possible, massive arms deal.|$|E
5|$|As selected, the Nimrod MRA4 {{was to be}} {{produced}} as essentially a new aircraft. Significant changes {{were involved in the}} <b>remanufacturing</b> process, including the installation of current-generation BR710 turbofan engines, the adoption of a larger and more efficient wing, various new missions systems and avionics, and an extensively refurbished fuselage. Much larger air intakes were required on the MRA4 in order to provide the necessary airflow requirements imposed by the BR710 engine, which is significantly greater than that of the original Spey 250 that had powered the original Nimrod variants. The MRA4 had also borrowed heavily from Airbus technology; the glass cockpit used was derived from the Airbus A340 airliner. British Aerospace also teamed up with Boeing to provide the Nimrod MRA4's mission systems, making use of the later's work on mooted patrol aircraft systems for the P-3 and Boeing 737.|$|E

25|$|Some {{classes of}} bugs {{have nothing to}} do with the code. Faulty {{documentation}} or hardware may lead to problems in system use, even though the code matches the documentation. In some cases, changes to the code eliminate the problem even though the code then no longer matches the documentation. Embedded systems frequently work around hardware bugs, since to make a new version of a ROM is much cheaper than <b>remanufacturing</b> the hardware, especially if they are commodity items.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{recycling}} is {{performed by the}} entrepreneurial poor such as the karung guni, zabbaleen, the rag-and-bone man, waste picker, and junk man. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or economies of scale, the poor {{are more likely to}} be driven out of the recycling and the <b>remanufacturing</b> market. To compensate for this loss of income, a society may need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor. Like the parable of the broken window, there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{involved}} reuse {{organizations are}} [...] "repair and overhaul" [...] industries which take valuable parts, such as engine blocks, office furniture, toner cartridges, single-use cameras, aircraft hulls, and cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and refurbish {{them in a}} factory environment {{in order to meet}} the same/similar specifications as new products. Xerox (copy machines), and Cummins Engine are examples of refurbishing factories in the USA. Rolls Royce has a very large aircraft <b>remanufacturing</b> factory in Singapore; Caterpillar recently announced the opening of a tractor refurbishing plant in China. Some factories operate in competition with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). When the refurbished item is resold under a new label (used monitor CRTs made into TVs, or cameras resold under a new label) this has been found legal by most courts.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Beep" [...] (also {{referred}} to as the SWBLW) is an individual switcher locomotive built in 1970 by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at its Cleburne, Texas, workshops. Technically a rebuild, the Beep (a portmanteau of [...] "Baldwin Geep", whose official designation was derived from [...] "SWitcher, Baldwin Locomotive Works") originally entered service on the Santa Fe as a Baldwin Model VO-1000. Following close on the heels of its highly successful CF7 capital rebuilding program, the company hoped {{to determine whether or not}} <b>remanufacturing</b> its aging, non-EMD end cab switchers by fitting them with new EMD prime movers was an economically viable proposition. In the end, the conversion procedure proved too costly and only the one unit was modified. As of end of 2008 per Trains Magazine March 2009, this locomotive was retired and stored operational at Topeka, Kansas. In May 2009 the unit was donated to the Western America Railroad Museum in Barstow, California.|$|E

5000|$|Because the <b>remanufacturing</b> process only consumes about 15% of {{the energy}} {{used to create a}} new product, <b>remanufacturing</b> in the U.S. saves 400 {{trillion}} BTUs annually, the equivalent of 16 million barrels of crude oil, or enough gasoline to run 6 million cars for a year. Based on a weighted average of 140 pounds of [...] gas pollution for every 1 million BTUs of energy consumed, <b>remanufacturing</b> reduces [...] generation by 28 million tons each year, which is equal to the [...] output of 10, 500-megawatt coal-burning electrical plants. <b>Remanufacturing</b> also saves the U.S. enough raw materials to fill 155,000 railway cars each year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remanufacturing</b> {{with loss}} of {{original}} product identity encompasses some unique challenges in inventory management and disassembly sequence development. Some {{of the open}} questions relate to the commonality of parts in products of different generations, the uncertainty in the supply of used products, and their relationship with production planning. The National Center for <b>Remanufacturing</b> and Resource Recovery (NCR3) at Rochester Institute of Technology (NY) is researching <b>remanufacturing</b> processes including testing standards for remanufactured products.|$|E
5000|$|Repetitive <b>remanufacturing</b> without {{identity}} loss; in this method, {{there is}} the additional challenge of scheduling the sequence of dependent processes and identifying the location of inventory buffers. There is {{a fine line between}} repetitive <b>remanufacturing</b> without loss of identity and product overhaul. Again, the critical difference is that <b>remanufacturing</b> is a complete process. The final output has a like-new appearance and is covered by a warranty comparable to that of a new product.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Remanufacturing</b> by {{recoating}} of worn engine parts; many engine parts, {{components are}} large and expensive and {{after a period of}} use become worn. An example of such a part is the engine block, in particular the cylinder engine bores, which must withstand explosions during piston firing. Instead of disposing of large engine blocks, <b>remanufacturing</b> has resulted in re-use of the parts by coating them with plasma transferred wire arc spraying (PTWA) Caterpillar known for manufacturing very large industrial trucks and machinery has started such <b>remanufacturing</b> programs of equipment parts using PTWA, resulting in a greener environment. <b>Remanufacturing</b> by recoating of parts is also very popular in the aircraft field, the geothermal pipe field and the automotive engine field.|$|E

5000|$|Many formal {{definitions}} of <b>remanufacturing</b> {{exist in the}} literature, but the first published report on <b>remanufacturing,</b> by R. Lund (1984), describes <b>remanufacturing</b> as [...] "... an industrial process in which worn-out products are restored to like-new condition. Through a series of industrial processes in a factory environment, a discarded product is completely disassembled. Useable parts are cleaned, refurbished, and put into inventory. Then the product is reassembled from the old parts (and where necessary, new parts) to produce a unit fully equivalent and sometimes superior in performance and expected lifetime to the original new product".|$|E

50|$|Boston University's Prof. Robert Lund {{estimated}} the U.S. <b>remanufacturing</b> industry at $53 {{billion in sales}} in 1996, employing approximately 480,000 people. This figure only includes {{a portion of the}} electrical equipment market related to electrical motors, and doesn't include <b>remanufacturing</b> of other electrical products such as circuit breakers, transformers, etc. <b>Remanufacturing</b> electrical equipment keeps thousands of tons of waste from U.S. landfills every year, based on the inventory turnarounds shown just by PEARL member companies. Also, unlike recycling which only reclaims part of the materials within a waste stream, reconditioning reclaims more material savings, as well as most of the energy and labor energy used to manufacturer the original product, making reconditioning a more environmentally sustainable practice than recycling. In 2003, the OEM Product-Services Institute (OPI) said U.S. electrical generation facilities alone spent $3.1 billion on <b>remanufacturing,</b> overhaul, and rebuilding.|$|E

50|$|<b>Remanufacturing</b> is, at least, {{refilling}} a cartridge with toner. The term {{implies that}} the cartridge is also refurbished, with worn or damaged parts replaced. The <b>remanufacturing</b> process, {{and the quality of}} the toner, differs between remanufacturers. A poorly remanufactured (or newly manufactured) cartridge may leak, malfunction, or damage the printer. Printer manufacturers use a toner designed to be suitable for their printers; remanufactured and third-party cartridges may use a generic toner which is less well matched.|$|E
