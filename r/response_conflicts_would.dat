This so-called "affective priming" effect {{has been attributed to}} one of two main theoretical mechanisms: 1) Primes activate valenced concepts in long-term memory, such that all affectively similar constructs are temporarily more accessible (i. e., spreading activation); or 2) Primes activate response tendencies prior to target onset, such that responses to affectively congruent targets get a head start over affectively incongruent targets (i. e., <b>response</b> <b>conflict).</b> In this study, event-related potentials (ERPs) are recorded while participants complete an affective priming task using words as primes and targets. All participants are undergraduate students completing the task for class credit. Incongruent prime-target pairs should result in longer reaction times than congruent pairs. More importantly, comparison of patterns of ERP activity will be used to distinguish between the spreading activation account and the <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> account of this effect. Support for spreading activation would be seen in longer latency of the P 300 ERP component on incongruent vs. congruent trials, suggesting greater difficulty in evaluating targets preceded by opposite valence primes. In contrast, support for the <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> account <b>would</b> be indicated if the lateralized readiness potential, a component reflecting activation of motor responses in the brain, shows evidence of competing motor activation on incongruent trials...|$|R
40|$|Self-control is of {{invaluable}} {{importance for}} well-being. While {{previous research has}} focused on self-control failure, we introduce a new perspective on self-control, including the notion of effortless self-control, and a focus on self-control success rather than failure. We propose that effortless strategies of dealing with <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> (i. e., competing behavioral tendencies) are what distinguishes successful self-controllers from less successful ones. While people with high trait self-control may recognize the potential for <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> in self-control dilemmas, they do not seem to subjectively experience this conflict as much as people with low self-control. Two strategies may underlie this difference: avoidance of <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> through adaptive, habitual behaviors, and the efficient downregulating of <b>response</b> <b>conflict.</b> These strategies as well as the role of <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> are elaborated upon and discussed in the light of existing literature on self-control...|$|R

40|$|<b>Response</b> <b>conflict</b> {{and random}} <b>response</b> {{selection}} {{have both been}} associated with activations on the medial frontal surface. Random response selection was typically studied using a 'free selection' paradigm, in which subjects have to select between equally legitimate responses which are in competition with each other. Therefore, one interpretation is that the generation of spontaneous actions is merely a special case of the induction of <b>response</b> <b>conflict.</b> It {{has been reported that}} the generation of spontaneous actions is tightly associated with activity in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Most studies of <b>response</b> <b>conflict,</b> on the other hand, suggest that activations in a different and more ventral area, the anterior cingulate, reflect <b>response</b> <b>conflict.</b> Nonetheless, contradictory results have also been reported. To clarify this issue, in this experiment, we have put together a version of the Eriksen flanker task and a free selection task to allow for a direct comparison. We confirmed our hypothesis that free selection is associated with the pre-SMA, whereas <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> is associated in the anterior cingulate. The two clusters of activation do not overlap, and the peaks of them were about 30 mm apart.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{separate}} stimulus and <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> in a manual color–word Stroop task by combining electro-myography (EMG) and event-related brain potentials (ERPs). EMG {{served as a}} measure of <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> by detecting incorrect response hand activation in correctly responded trials. <b>Response</b> <b>conflict</b> was enhanced in both the incongruent and congruent conditions relative to neutral conditions. This suggests that the Stroop conflict (incongruent vs. congruent condition) could be explained by stimulus conflict in our study and that <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> was not restricted to the incongruent condition of the Stroop task. Incorrect response activity was detected in a neutral condition using words but not in a neutral condition with non-words. This suggests that the mere presence of task-irrelevant stimuli semantically related to task-relevant stimuli can prime incorrect response activity. The above factors are important to consider in studies which do not have any explicit measure of <b>response</b> <b>conflict.</b> We have detected a robust marker of Stroop conflict, the N 450 ERP effect, which has been related to ACC activity.

40|$|There are {{at least}} two ways in which <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> can be handled in the mind: dynamic <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution, which enables <b>conflicting</b> <b>response</b> demands to be {{resolved}} on-line, and discrimination learning, which reduces the amount of on-line <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> that needs to be resolved in context.

They can match their behavior to context in remarkably subtle and sensitive ways when they have learned to do so, but if they have not learned to match a response or a behavior to a context, their inability to handle on-line <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> is their undoing (for example, in the dimensional change card sort task; DCCS). We present an analysis of how discrimination learning in context might aid children’s performance in the dimensional change card sorting (DCCS) over time. In a training study in which three groups of age matched under fours attempt to complete the DCCS we find that, given appropriate discrimination learning, children are able to flexibly switch between the responses required by the DCCS. Without appropriate discrimination learning, children’s performance is far worse, and when the task contexts are novel, children fail as expected...|$|R

Such cues were overlooked more often on conflict trials than on nonconflict trials, a result indicating that shielding of the current goal and inhibition of distractors were increased on the current trial when it involved a <b>response</b> <b>conflict.</b> Thus, evidence for enhanced recruitment of control following conflict may partly reflect aftereffects of goal shielding on the conflict trial itself...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} {{reported}} here, we examined the role of conflict experience in cognitive adaptation to conflict. Although the experience of conflict is generally neglected in theoretical models of cognitive control, we demonstrated that it plays {{a critical role in}} cognitive adaptation. Using a masked-priming paradigm, we showed that conflict adaptation was present only after trials on which participants experienced <b>response</b> <b>conflict.</b> Furthermore, when subjective experience did not coincide with actual conflict, adaptation effects in the error rates were observed after the experience of <b>conflict,</b> not after <b>response</b> <b>conflict.</b> We conclude that the experience of <b>conflict,</b> and not <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> per se, is the crucial factor underlying cognitive adaptation effects. The current findings provide a new perspective on the question of why the human cognitive system exerts cognitive control, and they suggest that a crucial role of subjective experience is to allow for top-down control of behavior.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of decision making {{is the ability of}} responses to be controlled by different cues in different situations or contexts, especially when there is <b>conflict</b> between alternative <b>responses</b> or actions. Recently, a context-dependent biconditional task has been developed for rats that mimic some aspects of <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> seen in human cognitive paradigms, such as the Stroop task. In this task, contextual cues are used to disambiguate <b>conflicting</b> <b>response</b> information provided by audiovisual compound stimuli. Here we review current findings that investigate some of the behavioral, neurobiological, and neurochemical mechanisms that underlie this use of contextual or task-setting information to resolve <b>response</b> <b>conflict,</b> and discuss future ways in which this research can be extended...|$|R
40|$|Several brain imaging {{studies have}} assumed that <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> is present in Stroop tasks. However, {{this has not been}} {{demonstrated}} directly. We examined the time-course of stimulus and <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution in a numerical Stroop task by combining single-trial electro-myography (EMG) and event-related brain potentials (ERP). EMG enabled the direct tracking of <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> and the peak latency of the P 300 ERP wave was used to index stimulus conflict. In correctly responded trials of the incongruent condition EMG detected robust incorrect response hand activation which appeared consistently in single trials. In 50 – 80 % of the trials correct and incorrect response hand activation coincided temporally, while in 20 – 50 % of the trials incorrect hand activation preceded correct hand activation. EMG data provides robust direct evidence for <b>response</b> <b>conflict.</b> However, congruency effects also appeared in the peak latency of the P 300 wave which suggests that stimulus conflict also {{played a role in the}} Stroop paradigm. Findings are explained by the continuous flow model of information processing: Partially processed task-irrelevant stimulus information can result in stimulus conflict and can prepare incorrect response activity. A robust congruency effect appeared in the amplitude of incongruent vs. congruent ERPs between 330 – 400 ms, this effect may be related to the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex...|$|R
40|$|Congruency {{effects in}} {{distracter}} interference tasks are often smaller after incongruent trials than after congruent trials. However, {{the sources of}} such congruency sequence effects (CSEs) are controversial. The conflict monitoring model of cognitive control links CSEs to the detection and resolution of <b>response</b> <b>conflict.</b> In contrast, competing theories attribute CSEs to attentional or affective processes that vary with previous-trial congruency (incongruent vs. congruent). The present study sought to distinguish between conflict and non-conflict accounts of CSEs. To this end, we determined whether CSEs are driven by previous-trial reaction time (RT) [...] a putative measure of <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> [...] or by previous-trial congruency. In two experiments using a face-word Stroop task (n= 49), we found that current-trial congruency effects did not vary with previous-trial RT independent of previous-trial congruency. In contrast, current-trial congruency effects were influenced by previous-trial congruency independent of previous-trial RT. These findings appear more consistent with theories that attribute CSEs to non-conflict processes that vary with previous-trial congruency than with theories that link CSEs to previous-trial <b>response</b> <b>conflict...</b>|$|R
40|$|Fallibility is {{inherent}} in human cognition and so a system that will monitor performance is indispensable. While behavioral evidence for such a system derives from the finding that subjects slow down after trials {{that are likely to}} produce errors, the neural and behavioral characterization that enables such control is incomplete. Here, we report a specific role for dopamine/basal ganglia in <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> by accessing deficits in performance monitoring in patients with Parkinson's disease. To characterize such a deficit, we used a modification of the oculomotor countermanding task to show that slowing down of responses that generate robust <b>response</b> <b>conflict,</b> and not post-error per se, is deficient in Parkinson's disease patients. Poor performance adjustment could be either due to impaired ability to slow RT subsequent to conflicts or due to impaired <b>response</b> <b>conflict</b> recognition. If the latter hypothesis was true, then PD subjects should show evidence of impaired error detection/correction, which was found to be the case. These results make a strong case for impaired performance monitoring in Parkinson's patients...|$|R
