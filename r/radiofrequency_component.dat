40|$|Abstract: It {{is often}} desired to {{engineer}} materials that demonstrate a specific response to electromagnetic energy incident {{on them in}} antenna and <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>component</b> design. The design of such engineered materials typically requires numerically intensive computations to simulate their behavior. Furthermore, to achieve an optimal performance these simulations need to be run many times until a desired solution is achieved, presenting a major hindrance in arriving at a feasible solution in {{a reasonable amount of}} time. One example of such applications is the design of antireflective (AR) surfaces at millimeter wave frequencies, which often involves sub-wavelength gratings in a multilayer structure. The numerical modeling of such designs can be challenging due to wavelength scale features in a large multilayer structure. This paper investigates the use of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) as a coprocessor to the CPU in order to expedite the computation time. Preliminary results show that the FPGA accelerated design can achieved thousands of folds of performance speedup compared with the corresponding software implementation on an Intel Itanium 2 processor...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{problems}} that a satellite manufacturing involves is to obtain the geometrical forms and the accurate positions for the different <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>components</b> (reflectors, subreflectors and feeders). CFRP (Carbon Fibber Reinforced Plastics) sandwich structures never are obtained as designed due to the deformations associated to the manufacturing process. So, reflectors, subreflectors and structural components (towers, panels [...] .) have to be measured in order to include their deviations {{in the design of the}} regulation parts. High performance equipment (Co-ordinate Measurement Machines, CAD/CAM Systems and 5 Axis Machine Tool) is used, but it is also necessary to make an integrated and multidisciplinary team. This paper describes how this process was implemented in CASA Space Division during HISPASAT 1 C satellite manufacturing program...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Relative {{calibration}} {{has been}} proposed as {{a simple way to}} practically exploit the reciprocity of the wireless channel. It is based on a simple convolutional model for the relationship between the channel impulse responses in both directions, and accounts for the discrepancies between transmit and receive <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>components,</b> without the need for specific calibration hardware. However, the relative calibration methods developed so far have been shown to lack robustness with respect to frequency offset between the devices {{on both sides of the}} considered channel. In this article, we introduce a relative calibration algorithm that properly deals with the presence of frequency offset. We verify its robustness and assess its performance through simulations, and validate experimentally the proposed model on measured channels. I...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} construction of a test bench for the analysis and certification of radio-acoustic sensors inside conduits filled with liquids. It is a brand new test-set that integrates the capability to validate and calibrate (separately and together) the electromagnetic and acoustic front-ends of mobile nodes belonging to wireless sensor networks deployed inside conduits. The test bed consists of a pipeline that has been configured in order to host fixed and mobile wireless sensors, which can be connected by cabled and/or radio links towards the external part of the conduit. Inserting the sensor in a real scenario, with exact working conditions, parameters like the efficiency, the gain, the radiation pattern, the reflection coefficient of the <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>component,</b> {{the sensitivity of the}} acoustic component, the precision tracking can be efficiently evaluated and consequently a precise calibration is possible. The speed and pressure of the liquid, as well as the speed of the sensor, can be controlled remotely. A de-embedding procedure has been introduced, in order to eliminate the effect of the external nois...|$|E
40|$|Photonic {{technologies}} are today {{of great interest}} for use in harsh environments, such as outer space, where they can potentially replace current communication systems based on <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>components.</b> However, akin to electronic devices, the behavior of optical materials and circuits can be strongly altered by high-energy and high-dose ionizing radiation. Here, we investigate the effects of alpha (α) radiation with MeV-range energy on silicon oxynitride (SiON) optical waveguides in the 1550 nm wavelength range. Irradiation with a dose of 5 × 1015 cm- 2 increases the refractive index of the SiON core by nearly 10 - 2, {{twice as much as}} that of the surrounding silica cladding, leading to a significant increase of the refractive index contrast of the waveguide. The higher mode confinement induced by α-radiation reduces the loss of tightly bent waveguides. We show that this increases the quality factor of microring resonators by 20 %, with values larger than 105 after irradiation...|$|R

40|$|A {{versatile}} experimental Ka-band network simulator {{has been}} implemented at the NASA Lewis Research Center to demonstrate and evaluate a satellite-matrix-switched, time-division-multiple-access (SMS-TDMA) network and to evaluate future digital ground terminals and <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) <b>components.</b> The simulator was implemented by using proof-of-concept RF components developed under NASA contracts and digital ground terminal and link simulation hardware developed at Lewis. This simulator provides many unique capabilities such as satellite range delay and variation simulation and rain fade simulation. All network parameters (e. g., signal-to-noise ratio, satellite range variation rate, burst density, and rain fade) are controlled and monitored by a central computer. The simulator is presently configured as a three-ground-terminal SMS-TDMA network...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{aspects of}} ion separation in imperfect {{fields of the}} quadrupole mass analyzer operating within the first, second, and third stability regions are discussed by analysis of the beam dynamics in phase-space. The analytical approach uses an approximate solution of the Hill equation with a small heterogeneous part. These calculations indicate that the trap mechanism of ion separation is conditioned by the properties of characteristic solutions. These solutions are reduced to an approximate solution {{in the form of}} a general solution of a homogeneous Mathieu equation with combined factors taking into account a small heterogeneous part that defines the region of beam capture (acceptance) in phase-space. The infringement of independence principle of ion oscillations about each of the positional axes caused by distortions increases the cross-sectional area of the beam. The beam is cut out by the mass analyzer aperture. This causes transmission losses that depend on phase. Therefore, the ion current at the mass analyzer exit is amplitude modulated by the frequency of the <b>radiofrequency</b> (rf) <b>component</b> of the field. The maximum current is at zero phase. The modulation depth is proportional to the relative value of the distortions...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a Gain Switched (GS) optical source used as a Photonic Local Oscillator (PLO) in an Electro-Optical (EO) heterodyne receiver is experimentally evaluated and {{compared to the use}} of a traditional linearly modulated PLO. The EO heterodyne receiver used is based on an Ultra Nonlinear Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (XN-SOA) that provides a compact, cost effective and energy efficient receiver with a remote distribution of both PLO and Intermediate Frequency (IF) signals and a direct 50 -ohms input for the <b>Radiofrequency</b> (RF) <b>component.</b> The comparison between both GS and linearly modulated PLO is made in terms of the conversion efficiency (conversion ratio); linearity (1 -dB compression point) and noise (integrated RMS timing jitter). The analysis results in a significant improvement of the evaluated figures of merit when using a Gain Switched PLO.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) provide complementary information, {{and there has been}} a great deal of research effort to combine these two modalities. A major engineering hurdle is that photomultiplier tubes (PMT), used in conventional PET detectors, are sensitive to magnetic field. This thesis explores the design considerations of different ways of combining small animal PMT-based PET systems with MRI through experimentation, modelling and Monte Carlo simulation. A proof-of-principle hybrid PET and field-cycled MRI system was built and the first multimodality images are shown. A Siemens Inveon PET was exposed to magnetic fields of different strengths and the performance is characterized as a function of field magnitude. The results of this experiment established external magnetic field limits and design studies are shown for wide range of approaches to combining the PET system with various configurations of field-cycled MRI and superconducting MRI systems. A sophisticated Monte Carlo PET simulation workflow based on the GATE toolkit was developed to model the Siemens Inveon PET. Simulated PET data were converted to the raw Siemens list-mode format and were processed and reconstructed using the same processing chain as the data measured on the actual scanner. A general GATE add-on was developed to rapidly generate attenuation correction sinograms using the precise detector geometry and attenuation coefficients built into the emission simulation. Emission simulations and the attenuation correction add-on were validated against measured data. Simulations were performed to study the impact of <b>radiofrequency</b> coil <b>components</b> on PET image quality and to test the suitability of various MR-compatible materials for a dual-modality animal bed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} on the miniaturization of <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) front-end <b>components</b> such as half-wavelength resonators {{based on}} new magneto-dielectric heterostructures combining high permeability (µ = 150 - 250) and high permittivity (ε = 18 - 150). Size reduction is evaluated {{by means of}} 2 -cm-long coplanar waveguides realized with silicon technology and having a resonance frequency of about 3 GHz. The experimental results show a physical length reduction of 11. 2 % due to the dielectric contribution (ε = 18) and 14. 8 % by cumulating dielectric and magnetic effects (ε = 18 and µ = 150). These results are significant {{with respect to the}} moderate thickness of the preliminary material used here (only 150 nm). In a second part, a predictive model is proposed with µ and ε as variables. When adjusting the material properties in a realistic way (µ = 250 and ε = 150), the model predicts size reduction of ~ 50 % for the same thickness. Larger values can be expected with increasing the film thickness...|$|R
