This owns to the Cohen structure theorem, which says, roughly, that a complete local ring tends {{to look like}} a formal power series ring or a quotient of it. On the other hand, the interaction between the integral closure and completion has been among the most important aspects that distinguish modern commutative ring theory from the classical one developed by the likes of Noether.

However, much of Haas' findings have been challenged. For instance, it was subsequently determined that the scratches in the wrist area were non-traumatic—and, therefore, not evidence of crucifixion — while <b>reexamination</b> <b>of</b> the heel bone revealed that the two heels were not nailed together, but rather separately to either side of the upright post of the cross.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Graham Twigg {{published}} The Black Death: A Biological Reappraisal, {{where he}} argued that the climate and ecology of Europe and particularly England made it nearly impossible for rats and fleas to have transmitted bubonic plague. Combining information on the biology of Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, and the common fleas Xenopsylla cheopis and Pulex irritans with modern studies of plague epidemiology, particularly in India, where the R. rattus is a native species and conditions are nearly ideal for plague to be spread, Twigg concludes {{that it would have been}} nearly impossible for Yersinia pestis to have been the causative agent of the plague, let alone its explosive spread across Europe. Twigg also shows that the common theory of entirely pneumonic spread does not hold up. He proposes, based on a <b>reexamination</b> <b>of</b> the evidence and symptoms, that the Black Death may actually have been an epidemic of pulmonary anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis.|$|E

500|$|The {{relative}} importance given {{to each of}} these three strategies has varied over time and between different contexts. The general impression in the current Churches of Christ is that the group's hermeneutics are entirely based on the command, example, inference approach. [...] In practice, interpretation has been deductive, and heavily influenced by the group's central commitment to ecclesiology and soteriology. [...] Inductive reasoning has been used as well, as when all of the conversion accounts from the book of Acts are collated and analyzed to determine the steps necessary for salvation. [...] One student of the movement summarized the traditional approach this way: [...] "In most of their theologizing, however, my impression is that spokespersons in the Churches of Christ reason from Scripture in a deductive manner, arguing from one premise or hypothesis to another so as to arrive at a conclusion. In this regard the approach is much like that of science which, in practice moves deductively from one hypothesis to another, rather than in a Baconian inductive manner."
