The larvae create a protective shelter from which they feed by combining silken threads and foliage. A single larva may construct several shelters within its life span. Young larvae scour the leaf surface as they feed, and may also excavate terminal buds. Continuous feeding and webbing results in a browned surface which eventually becomes skeletonised and dies. Young larvae are translucent green/yellow. Full-grown larvae are 8-14 mm long and become dark green.

25|$|Scouting for Boys (1908) was Baden-Powell's rewrite of {{his earlier}} book Aids to Scouting (1899) with many youth {{training}} ideas openly taken from The Birch <b>Bark</b> <b>Roll</b> of the Woodcraft Indians (1906) written by Ernest Thompson Seton, who later became the Chief Scout of the Boy Scouts of America. Aids to Scouting was mostly a written explanation of the military scouting and self-reliance skills lessons Baden-Powell had learned from Frederick Russell Burnham, the British Army Chief of Scouts, but following the siege of Mafeking this military handbook unexpectedly became popular with many youth groups and educators, like Charlotte Mason, in Britain. At Mafeking, Baden-Powell's adjutant had recruited and trained boys aged 12–15 as cadets and during the siege they acted as postmen, messengers, and later to carry the wounded, to free men for fighting. Upon his return to England, following the Second Boer War, Baden-Powell learned some British schools had been using Aids to Scouting to teach observation and deduction. In 1906, Seton discussed youth training ideas with Baden-Powell and shared with him a copy of The Birch <b>Bark</b> <b>Roll</b> of the Woodcraft Indians. Soon after, Baden-Powell decided to revise Aids to Scouting into a book for boys. Several friends supported Baden-Powell, including Sir William Alexander Smith, founder of the Boys' Brigade, and Cyril Arthur Pearson, who owned newspapers and printing presses. Baden-Powell wrote a draft, then called Boy Patrols, which he used and tested with 22 boys for one week at camp on Brownsea Island {{in the summer of}} 1907, where Pearson's literary editor Percy Everett assisted.|$|R

His mother, Matilda ("Tillie") Valandra ( [...] Matilda Kent Tarleton), was a school teacher; his father, Byron John Barker, was the foreman on the electrical high line through the state of Washington. Barker is 1/8 Sioux. While in Washington, his father fell from a tower and sustained an injury which resulted in his death in 1929. Barker has a half-brother, Kent Valandra, from Matilda's subsequent remarriage. In 1931, the family moved to Springfield, Missouri, where Barker graduated from Central High School in 1941.|$|R
60|$|The trumpet {{with which}} the calling is done is simply a piece of birch <b>bark,</b> <b>rolled</b> up {{cone-shaped}} with the smooth side within. It is fifteen or sixteen inches long, about four inches in diameter at the larger, and one inch at the smaller end. The right hand is folded round the smaller end for a mouthpiece; into this the caller grunts and roars and bellows, {{at the same time}} swinging the trumpet's mouth in sweeping curves to imitate the peculiar quaver of the cow's call. If the bull is near and suspicious, the sound is deadened by holding the mouth of the trumpet close to the ground. This, to me, imitates the real sound more accurately than any other attempt.|$|R

Yes, she was a daisy! She got so she wasn't afraid of anything, she had such confidence in the ignorance of those creatures. She even brought anecdotes that she had heard the family and the dinner-guests laugh and shout over; and as a rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut, where, of course, it didn't fit and hadn't any point; and when she delivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and barked in the most insane way, while I could see that she was wondering to herself why it didn't seem as funny as it did when she first heard it. But no harm was done; the others <b>rolled</b> and <b>barked</b> too, privately ashamed of themselves for not seeing the point, and never suspecting that the fault was not with them and there wasn't any to see.|$|R
60|$|He {{accordingly}} {{took the}} other {{large piece of}} bark, which was the one which Raymond had used for his plate, and laid it upon the fire. As soon as it began to curl, he laid {{the end of the}} stick close to it, on the side towards which it seemed to be bending,--and {{in such a way that}} it curled over upon it, and soon clasped it tight, as Raymond had predicted that it would do. He then raised it in the air, and set out to run with it, so that it should not burn out before he reached the place. But he ought not to have run. It would have been far safer and better to have walked along carefully and slowly; for as he ran on, jumping over logs and stones, and scrambling up and down the hummocks, the top of the pole, with the blazing <b>roll</b> of <b>bark,</b> was jerked violently about in the air, until, at length, as he was wheeling around a tree, he accidentally held the top of the pole so far that it wheeled round through the air very swiftly, and threw the birch bark off by the centrifugal force: and away it went, rolling along upon the ground.|$|R

He alone had no desire to hold us against our will in a strange land. He had told us as much by his expressive language of signs. That evening, after dusk, he came down to our little camp, handed me (for some reason he had always shown his attentions to me, perhaps because I {{was the one who was}} nearest his age) a small <b>roll</b> of the <b>bark</b> of a tree, and then pointing solemnly up at the row of caves above him, he had put his finger to his lips as a sign of secrecy and had stolen back again to his people.|$|R

The author of the original report on these hidden scrolls advised: [...] "Indians of this region occasionally deposited such artifacts in out-of-the-way places in the woods, either by burying them or by secreting them in caves.

6000|$|When {{the work}} of {{unpacking}} and exposing the things to dry in the sun was accomplished, it was long past noon, and high time for dinner; so a fire was lighted by Bryan, who cut up another portion of Frank's canoe for the purpose. A rasher of pork and a flour cake were disposed of by each of the party in a surprisingly short time, and then the men bestirred themselves in mending the canoes. This was a more troublesome job than they expected, but being accustomed not only to mend but to make canoes, they worked {{with a degree of}} skill and diligence that speedily put all to rights. In Massan's canoe there was a hole large enough, as Bryan remarked, to stick his head through, though it was a [...] "big wan, an' no mistake." [...] Taking up a <b>roll</b> of <b>bark,</b> which was carried with them for the purpose, Massan cut from it a square patch, which he sewed over the hole, using an awl for a needle and the fibrous roots of the pine tree, called wattape, for thread. After it was firmly sewed on, the seams were covered with melted gum, and the broken spot was as tight and strong as ever. There were next found several long slits, one of them fully three feet, which were more easily managed, as they merely required to be sewed and covered with gum. Several broken ribs, however, were not so easily repaired. Had there been any wood on the island, Massan's quick knife would have soon fashioned new ribs; as it was, he had to make the best job he could, by splicing the old ones with several pieces abstracted from Frank's little canoe.|$|R

Several small local Scouting programs started in the U.S. soon after, most notably the Boy Scouts of the United States (BSUS), the National Scouts of America (NSA) and the Peace Scouts of California—these later merged into the BSA soon after it was formed. The Southern Baptist Convention’s Royal Ambassadors was founded in 1908 for elementary-school-aged boys. The YMCA in Michigan was organizing Scout troops based on Scouting for Boys as early as 1909. Salvation Army founder William Booth met with Baden-Powell for discussion about a possible Salvationist Scouting program. The Salvation Army thus began its Life Saving Scouts of the World in 1913. The BSUS was started by the National Highway Protective Association and led by Peter S. Bomus. William Verbeck, Adjutant General of New York State, was leader of the National Scouts. Both the BSUS and NSA were both more military in style.|$|R

As soon as they saw that, back they went,--Ned to threaten till he broke his pole, and Polly to flap till the strings came off.

40|$|Among the 16 or so {{recognized}} {{families of}} Coccoidea, only Pseudococcidae and the small, specialized Halimococcidae {{are represented in}} the endemic Hawaiian fauna. Why other large coccoid families failed to establish there is unknown. The endemic Pseudococcidae of Hawai'i currently include 31 described species in 13 genera. Ten genera are endemic. Around 40 undescribed endemic mealybug species belonging to both described and undescribed genera also are known. Perkins apparently collected no endemic mealybugs. Kirkaldy in Fauna Hawaiiensis listed the "Family Coccidae" (= Coccoidea) as absent from the endemic Hawaiian fauna. At least five or six, possibly more, prehistoric colonizations of Hawai'i by mealybugs were required to produce the existing fauna. Most of the endemic genera are so highly specialized that their relationships to extra-Hawaiian forms are obscure. However, some endemic species of Pseudococcus appear to be closely related to species in Australia and the Pacific islands. This conclusion is based primarily on similarities in male genitalia and secondarily on female morphology. Endemic Hawaiian mealybugs are often cryptic, occupying habitats such as plant galls, <b>rolled</b> leaves, under <b>bark,</b> and leaf sheaths of grasses. Those that occupy more exposed locations on foliage or twigs usually are cryptically colored or armed with large spines. These specialized habitats and morphologies appear to have evolved in response to pressure from predators...|$|R
