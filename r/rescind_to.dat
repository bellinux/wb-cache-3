The New York State attorney general's office opened an investigation and ordered the JNF <b>rescind</b> <b>to</b> rescind the two loans. The JNF said in response that Robinson and Rosenzweig were not officers under {{the meaning of the}} law, but the attorney general's officer rejected that argument. After the publication of the Forwards article, Robinson and Rosenzweig agreed to repay the balance of the loans, as required by the state attorney general.|$|E

It was held that this was an act showing the wish to no longer be bound, so a car dealer that ended up with the vehicle, even though they had paid good money, had to give it back. This decision may be justified on the basis that in such [...] "rogue" [...] cases, the third party could protect herself by checking with the authorities that the vehicle they were buying is not stolen.|$|E

30|$|The {{excitation}} {{profile of}} repulsive impurity-doped quantum dots triggered by simultaneous oscillations of the impurity coordinate and impurity spread reveals noteworthy features. The ratio of two oscillations (η) {{has been found}} to play a governing role in influencing the excitation rate. We have found a kind of stabilization in the excitation rate when η exceeds some threshold value at all dopant locations. However, before that threshold value, the excitation rates exhibit different trends depending on the dopant coordinate. A critical analysis of the η domain when the excitation rate attains the steady behavior reveals the exclusive role played by the dopant coordinate towards excitation. The analysis evinced maximization and minimization in the excitation rate at some particular dopant coordinate. Whereas the maximization/minimization occurs due to a change in the relative preponderance of various factors that assist or resist excitation, the observed stabilization can be explained by arguing a kind of compromise between the aforesaid factors. The said change in the relative dominance of the responsible factors in turn stems from the interplay between two oscillations. The two oscillations may sometimes reinforce each other, while in other occasions, they can <b>rescind.</b> <b>To</b> be precise, the present investigation reveals that it is the coupled effect of dopant’s coordinate and the dopant’s spatial spread which ultimately shapes the excitation rate. The results are thus quite interesting and expected to convey important insights in technological applications of quantum dot nanomaterials.|$|E
40|$|The federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) {{provides}} borrowers with protections and remedies against certain {{actions by}} lenders. TILA allows, in some circumstances, a borrower <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> a loan from a lender within {{a three-year period}} from when the loan is made. However, a circuit split has developed regarding how the right <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> must be exercised. Of the circuits that have considered this question, some require a lawsuit to be filed within the three-year period <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the loan. Other circuits have held that providing notice of the intent <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the loan within the three-year period is sufficient <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the loan, even if a lawsuit is not filed until beyond the three-year time limit. This Comment argues that in order <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the loan, courts should require that an actual lawsuit be filed before the three-year period expires...|$|R

50|$|In {{legislative}} bodies, {{the motion}} <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> {{is used for}} much the same purpose as the motion to reconsider; many court decisions treat the two motions as one motion. However, in legislative contexts, {{it is not the}} same as a motion to repeal. The difference between rescind and reconsider is that the motion <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> is ordinarily applied to actions that have been taken and are already in effect. It has been described as being in the nature of a motion to amend by striking out the entire proposal and leaving nothing remaining. It is not in order when the question can be reached by a motion to reconsider. Once legislation has been actually enacted, it is too late <b>to</b> <b>rescind.</b> The vote required <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> is the same as would be required to repeal the act which it sought <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> (usually a majority).|$|R
