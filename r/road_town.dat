5|$|The highway {{passes the}} American Real Estate School and a campus of Empire State College before {{intersecting}} NY454 (Veterans Highway). Not far from NY454, NY111 has a short concurrency with CR76 (Townline Road) along the Islipâ€“Smithtown {{and then the}} names changes to Hauppauge <b>Road</b> <b>town</b> line before fully crossing into Smithtown. After forking from CR76, NY111 continues northeast through the hamlet of Hauppauge, crossing NY347 (Smithtown Bypass) at-grade as it runs across another residential stretch. The route soon enters Village of the Branch, where it bends northward into a large commercial area {{at the center of}} the community. Here, NY111 intersects with East Main Street, which enters the junction from the west as NY25 and NY25A. At this point, NY25 continues eastward as Middle Country Road, NY111 terminates, and NY25A turns northward on NY111's right-of-way, changing names to North Country Road.|$|E

VT129 then heads to the south, paralleling the shores of the La Motte Passage (a part of Lake Champlain). At a curve to the east, VT129 intersects with a short extension of a nearby highway, which terminates quickly. The route leaves the connector and heads eastward towards US2, soon terminating at an intersection with US2 on the shores of another connector in South Alburgh.|$|E

2500|$|Bermuda {{had been}} defended {{primarily}} by Militia from 1612 until the French Revolution, although the regular English Army (subsequently the British Army) had kept a company-strength infantry force there from 1701 {{until the end}} of the American War of Independence. The Royal Navy, however, identified Bermuda as the only available replacement for all the bases and seaports it had lost between The Maritimes and the West Indies. Bermuda lies [...] east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, south of Cape Sable Island, Canada, and [...] north of <b>Road</b> <b>Town,</b> British Virgin Islands. What would become the headquarters, primary naval base, and dockyard of the North America and West Indies Squadron was established in the colony in 1795, leading to a rapidly growing British Army Bermuda Garrison tasked with protecting the naval base, and keeping the colony out of the hands of an enemy. With the large number of regular soldiers present, the Government of Bermuda allowed the Militia to subside after the American War of 1812, and no amount of cajoling, begging, or threatening by the British Government could move it to replace the military reserve until the 1890s, when the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA) and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC) (amalgamated in 1965 into what is now the Royal Bermuda Regiment) were raised. Without the assistance or funds of the colonial government, the Governor (who was also military Commander-in-Chief) and the Bermuda Garrison of the British Army employed many (mostly short-lived) schemes during the intervening decades to recruit Bermudians to reinforce the regular soldiers. Most of the volunteers were blacks. The relatively lower volunteering rate of whites was to be a recurring phenomenon as late as the First World War (when the first of the black-recruited BMA's two contingents sent to France numbered 201 officers and other ranks, more than the two First World War and the two Second World War overseas contingents of the all-white BVRC combined...although many white Bermudians also served in the British Home Forces, from which non-whites were generally barred). Simmons probably served under one of these schemes, and would have been trained in light infantry tactics.|$|E
