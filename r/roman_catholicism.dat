5|$|Mary I (18 February 1516– 17 November 1558) was the Queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 {{until her}} death. Mary {{is best known}} for her {{aggressive}} and bloody pursuit of the restoration of <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> in England and Ireland in an attempt to reverse the English Reformation which had begun during the reign of her father, Henry VIII.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of various}} provinces of today's Poland, Christianity's spread was slowest in Pomerania, where it gained a {{significant}} following only around the 12th century. Initially, the clergy {{came from the}} Western Christian European countries; native Polish clergy took three or four generations to emerge, and were supported by the monasteries and friars that grew increasingly common in the 12th century. By the 13th century <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> had become the dominant religion throughout Poland.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{identify}} themselves as adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, Cao Đài or <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism.</b> Vietnamese Buddhists are mainly found among impoverished communities living in the Tonle Sap or the rural parts of Cambodia. As Vietnamese Buddhists derive their religious doctrines and beliefs from Chinese folk religion, they participate in religious rituals organised by Chinese Cambodians during festive seasons. Vietnamese communities that have settled down in Cambodia have adopted Khmer Theravada Buddhist practices to some extent. Vietnamese adherents of <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> consist of descendants of refugees that fled the religious persecution {{during the reign of}} Tự Đức. They are split between city dwellers based in Phnom Penh and fishing communities that are based in Tonle Sap. Vietnamese Catholics make up about 90% of Cambodia's Roman Catholic community, and in the 1960s they had about 65,000 adherents in the country. Most of the Vietnamese Catholics were either deported to Vietnam or killed in March 1970, and it was only in 1990 that the Catholic church was allowed to re-establish itself in Cambodia. In 2005, there were about 25,000 Catholics in the country.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{dates to}} the late 13th century and at a height of , it is the tallest church in the Nordic countries. Originally built under <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism,</b> it was used for coronations of Swedish monarchs for a lengthy period {{following}} the Protestant Reformation. Several of its chapels were converted to house the tombs of Swedish monarchs, including Gustav Vasa and John III. Carl Linnaeus, Olaus Rudbeck, Emanuel Swedenborg, and several archbishops are also buried here.|$|E
5|$|Waugh had {{converted}} to <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> in 1930, after which his satirical, secular writings drew hostility from some Catholic quarters. He did not introduce overtly religious themes into A Handful of Dust, but later {{explained that he}} intended the book to demonstrate the futility of humanist, as distinct from religious, especially Catholic, values. The book has been dramatised for radio, stage and screen.|$|E
5|$|A {{favourite}} of {{the ruling}} Ngô family, Đính received rapid promotions ahead of officers who were regarded as more capable. He converted to <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> to curry favour with Diệm, and headed the military wing of the Cần Lao party, a secret Catholic organisation that maintained the Ngôs' grip on power. At the age of 32, Đính became the youngest ever ARVN general and {{the commander of the}} II Corps, but he was regarded as a dangerous, egotistical and impetuous figure with a weakness for alcohol and partying.|$|E
5|$|According to Fred Guweddeko, a {{researcher}} at Makerere University, Amin {{was the son of}} Andreas Nyabire (1889–1976). Nyabire, a member of the Kakwa ethnic group, converted from <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> to Islam in 1910 and changed his name to Amin Dada. He named his first-born son after himself. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Idi Amin grew up with his mother's family in a rural farming town in north-western Uganda. Guweddeko states that Amin's mother was Assa Aatte (1904–1970), an ethnic Lugbara and a traditional herbalist who treated members of Buganda royalty, among others.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the census}} of , 58.9% of all Belarusians adhere {{to some kind}} of religion; out of those, Eastern Orthodoxy (Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church) makes up about 82%. <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> is practiced mostly in the western regions, and there are also {{different}} denominations of Protestantism. Minorities also practice Greek Catholicism, Judaism, Islam and Neopaganism. Overall, 48.3% of the population is Orthodox Christian, 41.1% is not religious, 7.1% is Catholic and 3.3% follows other religions.|$|E
5|$|Because of Kilmer's close {{identification}} with <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> and his correspondence with many priests and theologians, a tree located near a grotto {{dedicated to the}} Virgin Mary at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, has been asserted as {{the inspiration for the}} poem. According to Dorothy Corson, the claim was first made by a priest named Henry Kemper. There are several accounts that Kilmer visited the campus of Notre Dame to lecture and to visit friends, but none of these accounts or occasions date before 1914.|$|E
5|$|By 1591, {{the king}} of Jaffna Ethirimanna Cinkam was {{installed}} by the Portuguese. Although he was nominally a client, he resisted missionary activities and helped the interior Kandyan kingdom in its quest to get military help from South India. Eventually, a usurper named Cankili II, resisted Portuguese overlordship only to find himself ousted and hanged by Phillippe de Oliveira in 1619. The subsequent rule by the Portuguese saw the population convert to <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism.</b> The population also decreased due to excessive taxation, as most people fled the core areas of the former kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Catherine of Bosnia (/Катарина Косача; 1424/1425 – 25 October 1478) was Queen of Bosnia as {{the wife}} of King Stephen Thomas, the {{penultimate}} Bosnian sovereign. She was born into the powerful House of Kosača, staunch supporters of the Bosnian Church. Her marriage in 1446 was arranged to bring peace between the King and her father, Stjepan Vukčić. The queenship of Catherine, who at that point embraced <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism,</b> was marked with an energetic construction of churches throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Deerfield {{and other}} {{communities}} collected funds to ransom the captives. French authorities and colonists also worked to extricate the captives from their Indian captors. Within a year's time, {{most of the}} captives were in French hands, a product of frontier commerce in humans that was fairly common at the time on both sides. The French and converted Indians worked to convert their captives to <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism,</b> with modest success. While adult captives proved fairly resistant to proselytizing, children were more receptive or likely to accept conversion under duress.|$|E
5|$|During {{his long}} and tumultuous career, Paul was {{appointed}} an Orthodox bishop, sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices, {{pretended to be}} the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, switched from Greek Orthodoxy to <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> and back again, supported both the See of Rome and the Avignon anti-popes in the Western Schism, and managed to be named Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. In the end, his deceptions unmasked, he returned to Constantinople, where he repented and confessed his sins before a synod in 1394.|$|E
5|$|During {{the medieval}} and post-medieval periods the {{township}} of Altrincham {{was part of}} Bowdon parish. Low population density meant that the town {{did not have a}} church until the Anglican church established a chapel of ease in 1799. Nonconformists were also present in Altrincham; Methodists set up a chapel in 1790, and Baptists built one in the 1870s. Irish immigrants in the 1830s and 1840s also returned <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> to the area, the first Roman Catholic church built in Altrincham being St Vincent's, in 1860.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Oxford Movement, {{headed by}} John Henry Newman {{as well as}} Froude's brother Richard Hurrell Froude, was attacking the Church's move towards {{liberalism}} and secularism, advocating instead {{a greater emphasis on}} Catholic doctrine. The Movement provided a serious challenge to Protestant beliefs, with Newman later converting to <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism.</b> Although Froude was devoted to Newman for several years, and maintained a sentimental affection for the man (which he expressed in his essays on Newman and the Oxford Movement), he ultimately repudiated his beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Protestant {{denominations}} {{accounted for}} 46.5%, while <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism,</b> at 20.8%, {{was the largest}} individual denomination. The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2014 was 5.9%. Other religions include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Buddhism (0.7%), Hinduism (0.7%). The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990. There are also Unitarian Universalist, Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting {{the history}} of Strasbourg and of France, the palace has been owned {{successively}} by the nobility, the municipality, the monarchy, the state, the university, and the municipality again. Its architectural conception and its iconography were intended to indicate the return of <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> to the city, which had been dominated by Protestantism for the previous two centuries. Thus the prelate's apartments face the cathedral, to the north, {{and many of the}} statues, reliefs and paintings reflect the Catholic dogma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> in Royton {{after the}} English Reformation began in 1874, when a disused factory {{was used as}} a chapel. Sir Percival Radcliffe, the then owner of Royton Hall, gave land and £2,000 towards the {{construction}} of a new Catholic school-chapel which opened in 1880; the local priest lived at Royton Hall. A rectory was built in 1901 and in 1966 the church, dedicated to saints Aidan and Oswald, was rebuilt. Royton, which forms part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, continues to have a Catholic community, supported by Our Lady's R.C. High School.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's early {{preoccupation with}} the occult subsided, and he became more {{interested}} in other religions, {{although it is not}} known whether he practised any. He was enthusiastic about Parsi culture, but became disillusioned with Parsis after visiting India in 1932. He embraced only a few of aspects of Zoroastrianism, and in later years he was interested in <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism,</b> although he did not take it up. For much of his life he practised yoga, but it is not known what branch of it.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{was born}} in the reign of her uncle Charles II, who had no {{legitimate}} children. Her father, James, was thus heir presumptive to the throne. His suspected <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> was unpopular in England, and on Charles's instructions Anne and her elder sister, Mary, were raised as Anglicans. Three years after he succeeded Charles, James was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Anne's sister and Dutch Protestant brother-in-law and cousin William III of Orange became joint monarchs. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne's finances, status and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Chiprovtsi {{is thought}} to have been founded in the Late Middle Ages as a mining and metalsmithing centre. Attracting German ore miners who {{introduced}} <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> to the area, the town grew in importance as a cultural, economic and religious centre of the Bulgarian Catholics and the entire Bulgarian northwest during the first few centuries of Ottoman rule. The apogee of this upsurge was the anti-Ottoman Chiprovtsi Uprising of 1688. After the suppression of the uprising, some of the town's population fled to Habsburg-ruled lands; those unable to flee were killed or enslaved by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, Irish {{people began to}} arrive in large numbers in Coatbridge. The 1851 UK Census {{recorded}} that Irish people constituted 35.8% of the local population. Although while {{a significant proportion of}} these immigrants were Protestant, the majority were Catholic. By 1901 UK Census, the percentage of Irish-born people in Coatbridge had fallen to around 15%, but remained the highest of all the major towns in Scotland. In the 2001 UK Census, Irish ethnicity was recorded at just over 1%, although just over half the population claimed their religious denomination as <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism.</b> In 1985, 56% of the population of Coatbridge were Roman Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Ewondo {{who learned}} were highly favoured {{in the early}} days of the colonial regime. Station {{commander}} Hans Dominik sent four such individuals to attend the mission school of the German Pallottine Fathers in Kribi, a settlement on the coast. There, Atangana learned German language, history, and geography; mathematics; and <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism.</b> Father Heinrich Vieter especially liked the boy, and Atangana became the first Ewondo baptised a Roman Catholic; he took the Christian name Karl. Atangana's schooling had just ended when members of the Bulu ethnic group, one closely related to the Ewondo, invaded Kribi and sacked the school and church in 1899. Atangana waited out the revolt in Douala with the Fathers until the colonial militia defeated the rebels the following year.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> only recently.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 {{can look}} back on a varied life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but not close terms with his neighbours; his <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholicism</b> sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E
