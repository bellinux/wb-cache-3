25|$|A {{coalition}} of corporations and individuals formerly {{in the coal}} industry and severely diminished by imposition of the so-called <b>Reachback</b> Tax resisted this illegal taking for over six years through a coalition. The Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel case brought some partial and desperately needed relief from the <b>Reachback</b> Tax to dozens of corporations, mom and pop companies and even individuals economically ravaged by the mandate to pay for healthcare benefits for individuals who had virtually no association with those being taxed or assessed the obligations of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. That act provided for arguably the most generous fully paid healthcare benefits in the nation, including pregnancy termination for family members of those designated as beneficiaries of the <b>Reachback</b> Tax. The anti-Reachback Tax Coalition toiled at local, state and national levels to effect relief. The efforts of the coalition included numerous Federal district court cases and appeals prior to the Supreme Court's landmark Eastern v. Apfel ruling. Those efforts included a series of paid media op-eds addressed to former U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), an original sponsor of the act and tax, which appeared on Page 3 of The Washington Post. Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue's Washington office coordinated that coalition through its long-time Congressional consultant Sam Richardson.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{military}} officials have invoked Civil Operations and Rural Development Support (CORDS) – a counterinsurgency program {{developed by the}} US military during the Vietnam war – as a precedent for HTS. In a foundational article on HTS, a group of military analysts, Kipp et al, described the program as [...] "a CORDS for the 21st Century". [...] Their article appraised CORDS as a successful and effective program that was [...] "premised on {{a belief that the}} war would ultimately be won or lost not on the battlefield, but in the struggle for the loyalty of the people". Kipp et al contended that the only major problems with the CORDS program were that it lacked adequate <b>reachback</b> facilities and that it [...] "was started too late and ended too soon". [...] As such, they argued that it provided [...] "many important lessons" [...] to [...] "guide" [...] the development of HTS as an [...] "effective cultural intelligence program" [...] that could [...] "support tactical and operational-level commanders today". By contrast, critics of HTS have drawn attention to the fact that, in Vietnam, CORDS was run in conjunction with the Phoenix Program, which used information gathered through CORDS in its effort to [...] "neutralize" [...] (by means of assassination, infiltration and capture) supporters of the Viet Cong.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to individuals who}} exhausted all rights to benefits after the original date of enactment, the EUC law includes what is {{commonly referred to as}} a <b>reachback</b> provision. A <b>reachback</b> provision makes eligible those individuals who exhausted all rights to benefits prior to the original date of enactment (back to a specified date). The EUC law makes eligible all individuals whose benefit year ending date is on or after May 1, 2007. Practically speaking, this means some individuals receiving EUC may have become unemployed as early as May 2006.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reachback</b> is {{also used}} in the US Department of Defense as the process of obtaining products, services, applications, forces, equipment, or {{material}} from organizations that are not forward deployed.|$|E

5000|$|Following William Osler's {{prescription}} for equable living day-by-day, Berne explained that [...] "living {{day by day}} means living a well-planned and organized life, and sleeping well between each day, so that the day ends without <b>reachback,</b> since tomorrow is well planned, and begins without afterburn, since yesterday was well-organized".|$|E
50|$|Additionally, 5th Signal Command {{deployed}} significant tactical {{capabilities in}} support of the War on Terrorism. 7th Signal Brigade deployed in February 2003 into Turkey and later southern Iraq {{in support of}} 4th Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Division’s invasion of northern Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The ability to establish satellite connectivity in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom leveraged 2nd Signal Brigade’s regional bandwidth, switching capabilities, and satellite downlinks into strategic satellite tactical and commercial entry points. This <b>reachback</b> extended the GIG and enabled the commander on the ground to: see friendly and enemy movements; disperse forces and conduct split-based operations; reduce the operational footprint; provide in-transit visibility of supplies, personnel, and equipment; and exploit information dominance. This <b>reachback</b> enhances the decision making and command and control for the commander on the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Berne, {{the founder}} of {{transactional}} analysis, coined the term in his book What Do You Say After You Say Hello?. He considered that <b>reachback</b> [...] "is most dramatically seen in people with phobias whose whole functioning may be disturbed for days ahead {{at the prospect of}} getting into a feared situation, such as a medical examination or a journey." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{support of}} the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), 5th Signal Command {{provides}} deployable communications packages from 2nd Signal Brigade for fort-to-port operations to support deployment and redeployment operations throughout Europe.

50|$|Airborne fighter {{platforms}} {{will participate}} in both tethered and flat ad hoc network topologies. A tethered topology would primarily be used for <b>reachback</b> and forwarding between the airborne fighter platform and supporting elements. A flat ad hoc topology would be used between airborne fighter platforms in a strike package or CAP for the more frequent information exchanges. The figure outlines the minimum equipment requirements to support a fighter platform.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flip side}} of <b>reachback</b> is afterburn, which {{is defined as the}} effect a past {{atypical}} event continues to have on a person's schedule, activities and mental state even after it is materially over. Berne considered that [...] "each person has a sort of standard 'reachback time' and 'afterburn time' for various kinds of situations ... domestic quarrels, examination or hearings, work deadlines, travel, visits from or to relatives, etc." ...|$|E
5000|$|For Berne, {{afterburn}} is {{the flip}} side of <b>reachback,</b> which is the effect that the event, thanks to the stress of anticipation, has on the person's life before it. He considered that [...] "in most cases one or the other can be tolerated without serious consequences. It can be dangerous for almost anyone, however, if the after-burn of the last event overlaps with the reach-back from the next ... this is a good definition of overwork".|$|E
50|$|Airborne {{communications}} relay platforms {{will participate}} in both tethered and tiered ad hoc network topologies. A tethered topology would primarily be used for <b>reachback</b> and forwarding between the C4ISR platform, Ground Theater Air Control System, and strike package or CAP aircraft.

50|$|The {{self-development}} plan provides {{commanders and}} other leaders with pointers to improve soldiers' and civilians' tactical and technical skills throughout their careers. The self-development plan follows each soldier from assignment to assignment and each civilian from position to position. Successful self-development requires a team effort between individual soldiers, civilians and their leaders. Self-development begins with a self-assessment of one's strengths, weaknesses, potential, and developmental needs. Commanders {{and other leaders}} create an environment that encourages subordinates to establish personal and professional development goals. Refinement of those goals occurs through personal coaching or mentoring by commanders and leaders. <b>Reachback,</b> dL, and other technologies support these self-development programs.|$|E
50|$|The 5th Signal Command, {{headquartered}} in Wiesbaden, Germany, provides forward-based deployable {{command and control}} communications supporting theater, joint, and combined forces. This support leverages the Global Information Grid (GIG) to enable extension and <b>reachback</b> capabilities for the Commander, United States European Command (EUCOM). The command's primary focus is to support U.S. Army units and organizations based in Europe. The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy also have their own high-level communications organizations in the European theater comparable to 5th Signal Command and would not normally rely upon Army assets to accomplish their missions. Likewise, EUCOM headquarters also has support from Department of Defense-level communications organizations that support networks and services not provided by 5th Signal Command.|$|E

40|$|Operational {{systems for}} nuclear {{security}} in Finland, France, Denmark, UK, US and Canada were reviewed. The Finnish {{case is a}} holistic approach to Nuclear Security Detection Architecture, {{as defined by the}} International Atomic Energy Agency; <b>reachback</b> is only one component of the system, albeit an important crosscutting element of the detection architecture. The French and US studies concentrate on the <b>reachback</b> itself. The Danish nuclear security system is information-driven, relying on the cooperation of the competent authorities. The British and Canadian analyses describe nuclear security planning and operations in a Major Public Event (MPE), Olympics, where cooperation between the frontline officers and the <b>reachback</b> centre plays a key role to reduce radiological and nuclear risks. For the implementation of an efficient <b>reachback</b> system there is a strong need for standardizing the data acquisition, storing, and the final distribution of the analysis results. Major nuclear powers take this activity very seriously and they have 24 / 7 all year national service for information processing. The case studies of Finland and France show that efficient European <b>reachback</b> is manageable and technically possible on a country-wide basis. The case study on Denmark reveals that countries with limited <b>reachback</b> resources need an adequate and standardized technical information sharing mechanism to aid their national analysis services in a precise and timely manner.

The gains achieved in the throughput by use of transmission control are analyzed and evaluated numerically. The variation of the average number of transmitting users with distance from the collecting agent is analyzed. The proposed <b>reachback</b> protocol {{can be used in a}} variety of sensor network applications. We end by giving two examples of how the <b>reachback</b> protocol can be used by the sensor network to transmit information reliably to the collecting agent. The maximum rate at which the information can be reliably transmitted with the proposed schemes is evaluated as a function of the performance parameters of the <b>reachback</b> protocol...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{operations}} are characterised by more local conflicts, more dynamic circumstances and a less predictable enemy. Besides that, commanders {{must be able}} to be present at various locations, because of the involvement of different parties. This requires a more agile command post, supporting distributed command and control. A command post with <b>reachback</b> facilities, in which the commander can co-operate with his staff while being on the move, could meet these demands. However, such a concept has major consequences for aspects of team work, leadership, information support and organisation. This paper describes the results of an experiment with a <b>reachback</b> concept within the Royal Netherlands Army (RNLA) 43 Brigade staff where the staff was equipped with collaborative tools in a changed organisational context. The results show that the <b>reachback</b> concept is promising, enabling the commander to operate at a distance while maintaining accurate situational awareness. However, improvements, especially in the communication with other staff members, have to be made to be successful during operations. The next step will be to enhance the concept and focus on <b>reachback</b> concepts enabling staff members to co-operate from outside the operational area...|$|E

40|$|A {{summary of}} the {{activities}} of the RN Thematic Group of ERNCIP in 2016 is reported. The Group organized its work in three sub-topics: awareness raising on a new standard on list-mode data acquisition, robotics in RN field and <b>reachback</b> (expert support to field teams). The work of the Group is based on the Work Programme 2016 developed at the end of March 2016. In March 2016, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) accepted the proposal to develop a new international standard (IEC 63047)  for list-mode data acquisition.  The pre-normative research for this standard was provided by the ERNCIP RN Thematic Group. A field trial was organized for the robotics. It produced valuable feedback to understand the technological and information gaps between robotics community and radiological experts. These gaps need to be acknowledged towards efficient field cooperation and standardized operations. The work on <b>reachback</b> focused on cooperation with the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism to organize a joint workshop on roles and responsibilities of the technical <b>reachback.</b> The agenda was designed and the time of the event was fixed to 28 - 30 March 2017. The activities of the Group in 2016 are documented in four ERNCIP outputs produced in 2016, including this report summarising the Group’s work in 2016. In addition, two flyers, fact sheets were produced to promote awareness raising of the list-mode data acquisition standard and the ERNCIP initiative on joint formats and protocols for the communication between the frontline officers and the technical <b>reachback.</b> JRC.
