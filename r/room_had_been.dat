5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room and kitchen. The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden <b>room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{the hotel}} {{fell into a}} {{turbulent}} period. Terrorist threats from the Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £2.75m. At {{the time of the}} sale, the hotel's occupancy rate was just 45 percent; the Ritz Grill <b>Room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times. In 1984, the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at the Ritz to hotel guests only, as those staying at the Ritz were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and the Ritz compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for tea is a must; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} the {{withdrawal}} of Bruce's bill, a ministerial by-election in Pontefract in 1872 gave the LNA an opportunity for further action. Although they did not field a candidate, Josephine attended meetings in the town. At one LNA meeting {{the floor of the}} <b>room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> liberally sprinkled with cayenne pepper by her opponents, making speaking difficult. After it was cleared away, her opponents set bales of straw alight in a storeroom below, which led to smoke rising through the floorboards; two members of the Metropolitan Police—specially drafted into the town for the by-election—looked on but took no action. Although the incumbent Liberal candidate, Hugh Childers, was returned, there were heavy abstentions, and his vote was reduced by around 150 (from an electorate of 2,000). In December 1872 Josephine met the Prime Minister, William Gladstone, when he visited Liverpool College. Although he supported the aims of the LNA, he was politically unable to back the LNA publicly, and had supported Bruce's bill.|$|E

At 22:00 on 8 April, {{just minutes}} after the ship had {{finished}} a general quarters drill, the crew was called to G.Q. again, {{but this time it}} was not a drill; a fire had broken out in the Number Three Main Machinery Room.

25|$|Swami Rama, a yogi {{skilled in}} {{controlling}} his heart functions, was {{studied at the}} Menninger Foundation {{in the spring and}} fall of 1970 and was alleged by some observers at the foundation to have telekinetically moved a knitting needle twice from a distance of five feet. Although Swami Rama wore a face-mask and gown to prevent allegations that he moved the needle with his breath or body movements, and air vents in the <b>room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> covered, at least one physician observer who was present at the time was not convinced and expressed the opinion that air movement was somehow the cause.|$|E
25|$|In January 1987, the Kohl-Genscher {{government}} {{was returned to}} office, but the FDP and the Greens gained {{at the expense of}} the larger parties. Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by Hans-Jochen Vogel. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%. Later in 1987, Kohl had a summit with the East German leader Erich Honecker. Unknown to Kohl, the meeting <b>room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> bugged by the Stasi, and the Stasi tapes of the summit had Kohl saying to Honecker that he did not see any realistic chance of reunification in the foreseeable future.|$|E

25|$|On 14 February 2008, Moss Airport, Rygge opened. To {{make the}} station an airport rail link, NSB {{introduced}} a free shuttle bus {{from the station}} to the airport in connection with all train services that call at Rygge Station. This increased the annual ridership at the station by 100,000. However, neighbors of the station had problems with strangers {{in the middle of}} the night asking for directions to the airport. In 2010, the National Rail Administration reopened the station building for waiting passengers, after the waiting <b>room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> closed for 30 years. The estimated cost of keeping the waiting room open is NOK120,000. The station building is owned by Rom Eiendom, who will rent the building to the National Rail Administration. Rom Eiendom stated that they hoped a café or other customer facility would rent part of the building as well.|$|E
25|$|A true professional, {{she would}} spend months {{preparing}} the new character types {{she wanted to}} represent on stage. These roles had a slightly mocking edge, furthering her popularity among the working class men in her audience. She was wildly popular among women as well, who viewed her {{as a symbol of}} independence. Newspaper reports of her performances emphasised how popular she was throughout the country, drawing capacity crowds in England, Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man and Wales. Often, people were turned away from the theatre as all space, including standing <b>room,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> allocated. In some cases, theatre proprietors were able to ('obliged to' in their parlance) raise ticket prices for her week-run in their theatre. As at the time ticket prices were set regardless of the performers arriving that week, Tilley's ability to sell out even when prices were raised indicates her immense popularity.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{signed a}} 280-year lease in 1994 {{and began a}} massive restoration, in which all billboards were removed and the station was restored. These renovations were mostly {{finished}} in 1998, {{though some of the}} minor refits (such as replacement of electromechanical train information displays with electronic displays at track entries) were not completed until 2000. The most striking effect was the restoration of the Main Concourse ceiling, revealing the painted skyscape and constellations. The original baggage room, later converted into retail space and occupied for many years by Chemical Bank, was removed, and replaced with a mirror image of the West Stairs. Although the baggage <b>room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> designed by the original architects, the restoration architects found evidence that a set of stairs mirroring those to the West was originally intended for that space. Other modifications included a complete overhaul of the Terminal's superstructure and the replacement of the electromechanical Omega Board train arrival/departure display with a purely electronic display that was designed to fit into the architecture of the Terminal aesthetically. The original quarry in Tennessee was located and reopened specifically to provide matching stone to replace damaged stone and for the new East Staircase. Each piece of new stone is labeled with its installation date {{and the fact that it}} was not a part of the original Terminal building.|$|E

Although legislation prohibited jailers from having a pecuniary interest in the sale of alcohol within their prisons, it was a rule that was completely ignored. Howard reported that, in the summer of 1775, 600pots of beer were brought into the Marshalsea one Sunday from a public house, because the prisoners did not like the beer in the tap room.|$|E
500|$|Two palaces {{investigated}} in Group E are architecturally {{quite different from}} the palaces in Groups C and D. A notable feature is that their doors possess projecting corners. The western structure has a vaulted room with a central bench and also a cross-shaped exterior bench, the walls of the structure still stand [...] high. The north structure's walls stand [...] high and its western <b>room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> divided in two by the placement of vertical stone slabs. This north structure did not possess any interior benches. It may be that the different architectural styles of Group E and the other main groups at Motul de San José result from their association with different lineages, each with its own style.|$|E
500|$|The Ritz Club is {{a casino}} in the {{basement}} of the hotel, occupying the space which was formerly the Ritz Bar and Grill.

[...] A May 1906 edition of Truth magazine described the basement with the Grill Room and Banqueting Hall as palatial, ivory-white in decor, with [...] "mirrors on all the walls reflecting an endless intersection of arched ceilings". The rooms were used for dinners, balls and theatrical shows, with a stage at the south end of the Banqueting Hall. By the mid 1920s the Grill <b>Room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> relocated into the Banqueting Hall, and furnished with circular tables with oval back wicker chairs.

500|$|... "Make Room for Lisa" [...] {{was written}} by Brian Scully {{and was the first}} full episode Matthew Nastuk {{directed}} for The Simpsons. Nastuk had previously received a credit for [...] "D'oh-in In the Wind", which he directed one scene for. [...] "Make Room for Lisa" [...] was also the second episode about Homer and Lisa that Scully wrote for the series, the first one being [...] "Lost Our Lisa" [...] from the previous season. [...] "Make Room for Lisa" [...] was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February28,1999. When writing the episode, the Simpsons writing staff debated what to do with Lisa after her <b>room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> rebuilt. Brian Scully eventually pitched that Lisa and Bart would have to share a room together, as it would, according to staff writer Matt Selman, comment on the feeling of having to share a room with a sibling, and how it would [...] "incredibly suck." [...] The writers then wrote the episode around that plot point.|$|E
500|$|McCartney later said, [...] "We lived {{backstage}} in the Bambi Kino, {{next to the}} toilets, and {{you could}} always smell them. The <b>room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else. No heat, no wallpaper, not a lick of paint; and two sets of bunk beds, with not very much covers—Union Jack flags—we were frozen." [...] Lennon remembered: [...] "We were put in this pigsty. We {{were living in a}} toilet, like right next to the ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [...] pissing next door." [...] After having been awoken in this fashion, the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving. They were paid £2.50 each a day, seven days a week, playing from 8:30-9:30, 10 until 11, 11:30-12:30, and finishing the evening playing from one until two o'clock in the morning.

500|$|At about 12:30, 280 bomber and torpedo bomber {{aircraft}} arrived {{over the}} Japanese force. , which {{had fallen out}} of formation due to engine trouble, was caught and sunk by a detachment of aircraft from [...] The Surface Special Attack Force increased speed to , and following standard Japanese anti-aircraft defensive measures, the destroyers began circling Yamato. The first aircraft swooped in to attack at 12:37. Yahagi turned and raced away at [...] in an attempt to draw off some of the attackers; it drew off only an insignificant number. Yamato was not hit for four minutes, but at 12:41 two bombs obliterated two of her triple 25mm anti-aircraft mounts and blew a hole in the deck. A third bomb then destroyed her radar room and the starboard aft 127mm mount. At 12:46, another two bombs struck the battleship's port side, one slightly ahead of the aft 155mm centreline turret and the other right on top of the gun. These caused a great deal of damage to the turret and its magazines; only one man survived. At 12:45 a single torpedo struck Yamato far forward on her port side, sending shock waves throughout the ship. Because many of the ship's crew who didn't go down with the vessel were killed by strafing aircraft as they swam in the oily water, the details are uncertain, but authors Garzke and Dulin record that little damage was caused. Shortly afterward, up to three more torpedoes struck Yamato. Two impacts, on the port side near the engine room and on one of the boiler rooms, are confirmed; the third is disputed but is regarded by Garzke and Dulin as probable because it would explain the reported flooding in Yamatos auxiliary steering room. The attack ended around 12:47, leaving the battleship listing ° to port; counterflooding—deliberately flooding compartments {{on the other side of}} the ship—reduced the list to °. One boiler <b>room</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> disabled, slightly reducing Yamatos top speed, and strafing had incapacitated many of the gun crews who manned Yamatos unprotected 25mm anti-aircraft weapons, sharply curtailing their effectiveness.|$|E
