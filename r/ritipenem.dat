40|$|<b>Ritipenem</b> {{is highly}} bacteriolytic against Haemophilus influenzae. Bacterial lysis was shown after {{treatments}} with <b>ritipenem</b> and cefsulodin at their MICs and after treatments with fropenem and cefdinir at four times their MICs, indicated by decreases {{in the culture}} turbidities and by morphological changes of the destroyed cells. These Î²-lactams were preferentially bound to penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 1 b. <b>Ritipenem,</b> fropenem, and cefsulodin exhibited poor affinities to PBPs 3 a and 3 b, but cefdinir showed high affinities to these PBPs. Microscopic examinations revealed that selective PBP 3 inhibitors, such as aztreonam and cefotaxime, inhibited lysis induced by <b>ritipenem.</b> These {{results suggest that the}} preferential inactivation of PBP 1 b could be essential to induce the lysis of H. influenzae cells and that binding to PBPs 3 a and 3 b may interfere with lysis...|$|E
40|$|A beta-lactamase-stable antibiotic, {{the oral}} penem FCE 22891 (<b>ritipenem</b> acoxil), was {{investigated}} {{for use in}} exacerbations of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Thirteen of the 15 COPD patients had a proven lower respiratory tract infection. Symptom scores and forced expiratory volumes in 1 s significantly improved during therapy with FCE 22891 in combination with bronchodilators and intravenous corticosteroids. Conversion of representative sputum to nonrepresentative sputum or eradication of the original pathogen in representative sputum was effected in 12 patients. Resistance to FCE 22891 was observed in three cases with Haemophilus influenzae. Gastrointestinal disturbances, of which one was severe, were experienced by eight patients. Although FCE 22891 has some beneficial effect in exacerbations of COPD, there are reservations about its use because of adverse effects and potential inefficacy in the treatment of infection with H. influenzae...|$|E
