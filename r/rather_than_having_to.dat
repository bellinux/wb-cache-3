5|$|Although {{the custom}} had {{no basis in}} law and {{frequently}} resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, {{the attitude of the}} authorities was equivocal.

5|$|Beginning in 2003, PEARL {{deemed the}} {{operation}} self-sufficient and reduced {{financial support for}} the Abahuzamugambi Cooperative. The cooperative provided its growers with loans that helped improve living standards and allowed for livestock investments, affordable medical insurance, and education.

They also moult their fleece naturally, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> be shorn annually, though older individuals do not moult as easily and may require additional shearing. Fleeces are grey or creamy white on the body, though darker individuals occur whose colouring {{is similar to the}} Soay sheep. Rough in quality, the wool is mostly used in the creation of tweeds or carpet yarns. A tweed is a rough-surfaced coarse cloth, typically made in Scotland. Its colour is a mix of flecked colours. The face and legs are wool-free and black and white, with the proportions varying between individuals.|$|E

25|$|Plans for {{a tunnel}} southward {{underneath}} the CBD to Mt Eden {{and even to}} Morningside were debated for nearly a century.

25|$|The wheellock {{was used}} {{along with the}} matchlock until both were {{replaced}} by the simpler and less-costly flintlock, by the late 17th century.

25|$|The Intel Core Duo (and later, {{including}} the current i5, i7 and Xeon) processors found in Intel Macs support Intel VT-x, allowing for high performance (near native) virtualization, {{which gives the}} user the ability to run and switch between two or more operating systems simultaneously, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> dual-boot and run only one operating system at a time.|$|E
25|$|This {{developed}} into the Surge hanging milker. Prior to milking a cow, a large wide leather strap called a surcingle was put around the cow, across the cow's lower back.

25|$|France {{adopted the}} Valée system in 1829. The new system reduced the calibers of field {{artillery}} to 8- and 12-pound cannons and 24-pound and 6-inch howitzers. Mobility was increased by standardizing limber sizes so that 8-pounders and 24-pound howitzers used the smaller type while 12-pounders and 6-inch howitzers used the larger type. In all cases, the gunners rode into action while {{sitting on the}} limbers <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> walk beside the guns.

He signed the Military Peace Establishment Act on March 16, 1802, thus founding the United States Military Academy at West Point. The Act documented in 29 sections a new set of laws and limits for the military. Jefferson was also hoping to bring reform to the Executive branch, replacing Federalists and active opponents throughout the officer corps to promote Republican values.|$|E

People could now buy their own Bible, and interpret it themselves, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> rely on their priest or minister.
