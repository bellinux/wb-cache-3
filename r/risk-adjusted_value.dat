We consider an extension to multiple time periods, where a <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>value</b> for a stochastic process is recursively defined over the time steps, which ensures time consistency. A prominent example of a single-period coherent risk measure that is widely used in applications is Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We show that a recursive calculation of CVaR leads to stochastic linear programming formulations. For the special case of the <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of a random variable at the time horizon, a lower bound is given.

Risk management techniques must be used to control the cost of these guarantees. The most common technique is to “over-fund ” the benefit: the contribution rate is set high enough so that the expected benefit is {{much larger than the}} guaranteed minimum benefit. This paper shows that while over-funding is very effective in controlling guarantee costs in traditional DB plans, it is highly ineffective for DC-MB plans. This result holds even at very large contribution rates and when risky investments are restricted to a very diversified index like the S&P 500. Calculations show that the true <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of unfunded guarantees in a realistic DC-MB plan equals 40 to 90 percent (or more) {{of the value of the}} unfunded liability in the DB benefit being replaced...|$|E

30|$|This study {{introduces}} a Real Options Model that describes option values of loan portfolios for actively traded Philippine Universal Banks. The model assumes that these banks may continually invest funds; the loan portfolio and deposit accounts are positively and strongly correlated; and banks operate {{in an environment}} of imperfect information. From simulation, the study finds that the Value of Waiting functions similar to a risk-adjusted discount factor to Operating Income from the Loan Portfolio. Resulting cumulative distribution factors (from the equilibrium condition) adjust asset values, and inflows for lending risks. A put option premium on the loan portfolio results from the difference between the salvage value of a loan, and its inflows. This put option values the strategy of not lending, or idling, the loan portfolio. The call option values the strategy of lending, essentially expanding the loan portfolio. Call option premiums result from the difference between the risk-adjusted inflows, and the <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of the loan portfolio.|$|E
40|$|Optimal risk {{transfers}} {{are derived}} within an insurance group {{consisting of two}} separate legal entities, operating under potentially different regulatory capital requirements and capital costs. Consistent with regulatory practice, capital requirements for each entity are computed by either a value-at-risk or an expected shortfall risk measure. The optimality criterion consists of minimising the <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of the total group liabilities, with valuation carried out using a cost-of-capital approach. The optimisation problems are analytically solved and it is seen that optimal risk transfers often involve the transfer of tail risk (unlimited reinsurance layers) to the more weakly regulated entity. We show that, {{in the absence of}} a capital requirement for the credit risk that specifically arises from the risk transfer, optimal risk transfers achieve capital efficiency at the cost of increasing policyholder deficit. However, when credit risk is properly reflected in the capital requirement, incentives for tail-risk transfers vanish and policyholder welfare is restored...|$|E

We take a pricing kernel approach, which builds in the arbitrage-free property and pro- vides {{a link to}} equilibrium economics. We require that the pricing kernel be consistent {{with a pair of}} axioms, one giving the inter-temporal relations for dividend-paying as- sets, and the other ensuring the existence of a money-market asset. We show that the existence of a positive-return asset implies the existence of a previsible money-market account. A general expression for the price process of a limited-liability asset is derived. This expression includes two terms, one being the discounted <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of the dividend stream, the other characterising retained earnings. The vanishing of the latter is given by a transversality condition. We show (under the assumed axioms) that, {{in the case of a}} limited-liability asset with no permanently-retained earnings, the price process is given by the ratio of a pair of potentials.

Regression analysis reveals that the equilibrium level of executive compensation is explained by economic determinant variables such as firm size and growth opportunities, whereas the pay-for-performance sensitivity remains largely unexplained.

Two approaches to estimate the value of human capital in the presence of heterogeneous labor market risk and preferences for risk are implemented. A simple asset pricing approach is applied to consumption and labor income streams to estimate the shadow value of human wealth for an individual explicitly accounting for the individual's preferences for risk and expected labor income risk. Differences in these values between high school dropouts and high school graduates provide estimates of the <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of human capital for both black and white individuals. A method of estimating the effect of education on the risk-adjusted rate of return is also pursued.

40|$|The authors propose an alternative, investment-led {{approach}} to analysing {{the potential for}} the development of hydrogen energy in the UK. The UK economy is relatively sensitive to movements in world fossil fuels markets since the energy sector contributes at least 5 % of UK GDP and represents an asset pool of at least £ 230 billion. Much of the ongoing research to assess possible scenarios for the development of alternatives to existing energy systems, including hydrogen energy, in the UK is built around the cost-optimising MARKAL model. The authors believe that this approach offers an incomplete picture of hydrogen energy deployment since it ignores the mechanisms dictating the flow of commercial capital to the sector and they suggest an alternative model based on the <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>value</b> proposition. Initial analysis shows that valuation differentials already exist between companies in the fossil fuel, utilities and fuel cell sectors and that this might be exploited to the advantage of investors thus affecting the speed of development in hydrogen energy.

40|$|Unfunded defined-benefit (DB) public {{pension plans}} {{throughout}} the world are being converted to funded defined-contribution (DC) plans that typically contain a minimum benefit guarantee (DC-MB). Risk management techniques must be used to control the cost of these guarantees. The most common technique is to 'over-fund' the benefit: the contribution rate is set high enough so that the expected benefit is {{much larger than the}} guaranteed minimum benefit. This paper shows that while over-funding is very effective in controlling guarantee costs in traditional DB plans, it is highly ineffective for DC-MB plans. This result holds even at very large contribution rates and when risky investments are restricted to a very diversified index like the S&P 500. Calculations show that the true <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of unfunded guarantees in a realistic DC-MB plan equals 40 to 90 percent (or more) {{of the value of the}} unfunded liability in the DB benefit being replaced, depending on design. This result is true even when the contribution rate in the DC-MB plan is chosen to produce an expected benefit five times larger than the DB benefit. This paper considers two approaches to controlling guarantee costs. The first approach borrows from the recent catastrophic insurance literature. A 'standardized' portfolio is guaranteed, requiring agents to accept 'basis risk' if they chose a non-standard portfolio. However, for large conversions from DB to DC-MB plans, in which there is little or no DB benefit remaining the government must still worry about any 'implicit guarantee' extending beyond the standardized portfolio, thereby enticing agents to accept a lot of basis risk (a 'Samaritan's Dilemma'). The second method, therefore, uses a more brute force approach: private portfolio returns in the good states of the world are taxed while returns in the bad states are subsidized. Both options are very effective at controlling guarantee costs, and they can be used separately or together. Calculations demonstrate that all of the unfunded liabilities associated with modern pay-as-you-go public pension programs can be eliminated under both approaches even at a modest contribution rate. ...|$|E

One way of finding undervalued stocks is to carefully analyze firms’ accounting ratios. Researchers {{have in the past}} found evidence that an investment in value stocks, often categorized as low P/E and low P/B ratio stocks, in most cases generates more value than an investment in growth stocks (categorized as high P/E and P/B). However, we found a lack of studies that investigates if this relationship exists on the Swedish market and if it holds true during the financial crisis. This resulted in the following research question:Would a portfolio consisting of value stocks outperform a portfolio consisting of growth stocks on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm?In order to answer the research question a quantitative method with a deductive approach has been applied and historical stock prices and accounting ratios over the time period 2005 - 2013 have been collected from Thomson Reuters Datastream.

40|$|By {{the end of}} the 20 th century, Hong Kong {{had emerged}} as one of the world's major {{international}} financial centres. Today, while finance remains central to Hong Kong's future, it is facing unprecedented challenges, in China, in the region and globally. In the context of China, the continuing process of economic reform and financial development raises many opportunities but at the same time brings into question Hong Kong's traditional role as the primary intermediary between China and the global financial system. At the same time, the global and European financial crises have raised fundamental questions about finance, exchange rate systems, the global position of China, and the future role of the renminbi, including Hong Kong's role therein. Reflecting the centrality of finance to Hong Kong, Article 109 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, ascribes the Hong Kong Government an obligation 'to provide an appropriate economic and legal environment for the maintenance of the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. ' However, Hong Kong has yet to take a comprehensive approach to this obligation or to consider its strategic and practical implications. While the creation of the Hong Kong Financial Services Development Council (FSDC) is a very important step, more remains to be done. There is no question that Hong Kong has developed impressively and is performing very well as an international financial centre. This is clear and well established and is thus not the central theme of this report. Rather, this report seeks to consider areas where Hong Kong could do better. Thus, the central theme of this report focuses on the need for a more strategic approach to Hong Kong’s future as a financial centre, based on an analysis of academic and policy research and current expectations of best regulatory and commercial practice. This report is the first of a major research project on 'Enhancing Hong Kong’s Future as a Leading International Financial Centre', funded by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council Theme-based Research Scheme. Throughout this report (and in the two others which will follow in 2015 and 2017) our analysis seeks to answer one specific question: What policies and legislative/regulatory changes will maximise the long-run, <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of financial activities to Hong Kong, given that other international financial centre policymakers react strategically to such policies? In addressing this issue, the report provides 21 recommendations focusing on five major areas: The first grouping addresses methods to help improve the way the public contributes to financial sector policymaking. The second group proposes ways that the directing minds of Hong Kong’s financial and commercial organisations can participate more actively in ensuring Hong Kong’s regulators adopt policies which actually improve Hong Kong’s competitiveness among international financial centres (rather than just copy international 'best practice'). The third grouping looks at ways to broaden cooperation with China.

The bequest motive influences both the level of consumption and the share of equity. Our results suggest a maximal annuitization age should be flexible as mortality improves. The UK’s maximum annuitization age of 75 years appears at least five years too low given current mortality experience.

It is especially pertinent in systems like the Swedish primary care market, where providers are free to establish themselves in any part of the country.

Our aim is to estimate the effects of using care-need adjusted capitation on the supply of private primary care centers. We use a dataset that combines information on all primary care centers in Sweden during 2005 - 2013, the payment system and other conditions for establishing new primary care centers used in the county councils, and demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic variables for low level geographic areas. To estimate the effects of care-need adjusted capitation, we use difference-in-differences models, contrasting the development over time between areas with and without risk-adjusted capitation, and with high and low Care Need Index <b>values.</b> <b>Risk-adjusted</b> capitation significantly increase the number of private primary care centers in areas with relatively high Care Need Index values.

We find that most professional analysts prefer the <b>risk-adjusted</b> net present <b>value</b> (rNPV) model. The main reasons to the popularity of the rNPV model seem to be driven by both client-driven preferences and the ability of the analyst not to be restricted in changing its forecasts. We also find evidence, using a non linear variant of the Principal Components Analysis, of four ways of valuing biotechnology firms. These variations in valuation models seems to some extent be driven by the maturity stage of the company, but also by preferences of the users (analysts). The preferences of the users become even more apparent when analysts determine critical input parameters to the valuation models. Some of these clearly deviate from what classical financial theory suggests.
