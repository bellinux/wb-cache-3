40|$|The recent {{pollution}} norms {{have brought}} {{a strong emphasis on}} the reduction of diesel engine emissions. Low temperature combustion technology such as premixed compression ignition (PCI) has the capability to significantly and simultaneously reduce nitric oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), thus meeting these specific pollution norms. There has been, however, observed loss in fuel conversion efficiency in some cases. This study analyzes how energy transfer and brake fuel conversion efficiency alter with (or are affected by) injection timings and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate. The study is conducted for PCI combustion for four injection <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> 9 ?, 12 ?, 15 ? and 18 ? before top dead center (BTDC) and for four exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates of 39 %, 40 %, 41 % and 42 %. The data is collected from the experimental apparatus located in General Motors Collaborative Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan. The heat release is calculated to obtain various in-cylinder energy transfers. The brake fuel conversion efficiency decreases with an increase in EGR. The decrease in the brake fuel conversion efficiency is due to the decrease in work output. This decrease is due to an increase in the pumping work and an increase in friction and decrease in gross indicated work. The decrease in the combustion efficiency is because of the increased formation of unburnt products due to increased ignition delay caused by the application of EGR and decreasing air-fuel (A/F) ratio. A definite trend is not obtained for the contribution of heat transfer to the total energy distribution. However the total heat transfer decreases with <b>retardation</b> <b>of</b> injection <b>timing</b> because <b>of</b> decreasing combustion temperature. As the injection timing is retarded, the brake fuel conversion efficiency is found to decrease. This decrease is because of a decrease in net work output. This is because the time available for utilization of the energy released is less because of late combustion. The total heat transfer decreases with <b>retardation</b> <b>of</b> injection <b>timing</b> because <b>of</b> decreasing combustion temperature. The contribution of heat transfer to the total energy distribution decreases with increase in EGR...|$|R
40|$|Producing {{and using}} {{renewable}} fuels for transportation is one approach for a sustainable energy future worldwide. Renewable fuels also substantially reduce contributions to global climate change. In the transportation sector, ethanol produced from biomass shows promise {{as a future}} fuel for spark-ignited engines because of its high octane quality. Ethanol, however, is not a high quality compression ignition fuel. Ethanol can be easily converted through a dehydration process to produce Diethyl Ether (DEE), which is an excellent compression-ignition fuel with higher energy density than ethanol. DEE {{has long been known}} as a cold start aid for engines, but little is known about using DEE as a significant component in a blend or as a complete replacement for diesel fuel. This paper attempts to identify the potential of blending DEE with diesel transportation fuel. Engine tests were conducted with 5 % 10 %, 15 % and 20 % DEE/Diesel blends. The nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions are high and it is necessary to reduce this emission before using methyl ester as a fuel for diesel engines. In the present work, <b>retardation</b> <b>of</b> injection <b>timing</b> and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are used to reduce the same. However UBHC, CO and particulate emissions increase when retarding the injection timing. But these pollutants are low compared to normal diesel operation. Injection <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> 20. 9 0 CA bTDC is found to give optimum results. The adopted concept of exhaust gas recirculation showed considerable reduction in nitrous oxides and slight improvement in bTE for 10 % of EGR when the engine is operated at an optimal blend. Further diethyl ether is used as an additive and engine emissions particularly NOx found to be at reasonable level for 10 % of DEE addition by not compromising in thermal efficiency and specific fuel consumption...|$|R

When clustered DNA damage sites containing bistranded AP sites were present in nucleosomal DNA, efficient cleavage of the AP sites was observed after treatment with nuclear extract. The resultant DSB formation led to DNA dissociating from the histone core and nucleosomal dispersion.
