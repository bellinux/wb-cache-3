40|$|Learner {{reflection}} {{is critical}} to effective, deep, transferable learning, especially in cognitively demanding areas, such as learning programming. This paper presents Reflect, a programming education system, which aims to facilitate student self-assessment and promote learner reflection through scrutable learner models. <b>Reflect</b> <b>sets</b> tasks and presents a set of example answers to read and assess. We report students’ use of the system over one semester. Overall Reflect appears to help students understand the teacher’s goals for the tasks set and to refine their own work in relation to these goals...|$|R
40|$|We define, in {{a dynamic}} framework, {{the notions of}} binding functions, images, <b>reflecting</b> <b>sets,</b> {{indirect}} identification, indirect information, and encompassing. We study {{the properties of the}} notion of encompassing when the true distribution does not necessarily belong to one of the two competing models of interest. In this context we propose various test procedures of the encompassing hypothesis. Some of these procedures are based on simulations, {{and some of them are}} linked with the notion of indirect estimation (in particular, the GET and simulated GET procedures). As a by-product, we get an asymptotic theory of the tests of non-nested hypotheses in the stationary dynamic case. ...|$|R

3000|$|When [...] X = X_ 2, X is a {{boundary}} rough set. The boundary regions of X {{with respect to}} the knowledge P and Q are different. Consequently, σ_P^' (X) < σ_Q^' (X) [...] and ω^'_Q (X) < ω^'_P (X) [...]. In addition, the classification granularities of objects in the boundary region {{with respect to the}} knowledge P and Q are different. Furthermore, [...] H^' (P) < H^' (Q) [...] and [...] G^' (Q) < G^' (P) [...]. Finally, the integrated measures satisfy ρ_Q^' (X) < ρ_P^' (X) [...] and α_P^' (X) < α_Q^' (X) [...]. Obviously, the proposed integrated accuracy and integrated roughness can not only correctly <b>reflect</b> <b>set</b> uncertainty but also correctly measure knowledge uncertainty for {{a boundary}} rough set. Therefore, α_P^' (X) [...] and ρ_P^' (X) [...] can adequately characterise the uncertainty of rough sets.|$|R
