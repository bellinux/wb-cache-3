5|$|There {{have been}} various {{prisoner}} <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> other disturbances at Fremantle Prison {{over the years}} that it was operational. One of the earliest was in 1854, while major riots which occurred in 1968 and 1988 resulted in damage to the prison.|$|E
5|$|Caligula {{needed to}} quell several <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> conspiracies {{in the eastern}} territories during his reign. Aiding him in his actions was his good friend, Herod Agrippa, who became {{governor}} of the territories of Batanaea and Trachonitis after Caligula became emperor in AD 37.|$|E
5|$|Numerous smaller strikes {{occurred}} in the Congo later in the war, though not on the same scale as in 1941. In 1944 strikes broke out in Katanga and Kasaï, provoked by the conscription of workers for the mines and deteriorating working conditions. In 1945, <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> strikes occurred among the black dockworkers in {{the port city of}} Matadi.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day one {{prisoner}} pleaded guilty to charges of <b>riot</b> <b>and</b> conspiracy to <b>riot,</b> <b>and</b> was also acquitted of the murder charge. The other defendants were also acquitted of murder due to the unreliability of eyewitness testimony {{and the possibility that}} White had died from a pre-existing thrombotic condition. On 16 April, four defendants including Paul Taylor were convicted of <b>rioting,</b> <b>and</b> the remaining four including Alan Lord were acquitted.|$|R

5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction of the authorities to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing <b>riots,</b> <b>and</b> the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E
5|$|Ben's Chili Bowl is a {{landmark}} restaurant in Washington, D.C., located at 1213 U Street, next to Lincoln Theatre, in the Shaw neighborhood of northwest D.C. It is known locally for its chili dogs, half-smokes, and milkshakes, {{and has been}} {{an integral part of}} the neighborhood's history since its founding in 1958. It was frequented by both police and protesters during the 1968 Washington, D.C. <b>riots,</b> <b>and</b> is regularly visited by celebrities, such as Bill Cosby and Chris Tucker.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle Prison {{receives}} {{international and}} domestic tourists, as well as ex-prisoners, former prison officers, and their descendants. Tourist numbers increased each year from 2001/02 to 2009/10, up from almost 105,000 to nearly 180,000 over that period. , the prison has won, been a finalist in, or received other commendation at tourism or heritage awards each year since 2006. While the tourist experience is based on authenticity and heritage values, some details are concealed or de-emphasised, such as prison tattooing, <b>riots,</b> <b>and</b> graffiti portraying revenge, sexuality, or brutality.|$|E

5|$|He {{continued}} {{as the leader}} of the UCR, and opposed the presidency of Carlos Menem. He initiated the Pact of Olivos with Menem in order to negotiate the terms for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. Fernando de la Rúa led a faction of the UCR that opposed the pact, and eventually became president in 1999. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 <b>riots,</b> <b>and</b> Alfonsín's faction provided the support needed for the Peronist Eduardo Duhalde to be appointed president by the Congress. Alfonsín died of lung cancer on 31March 2009, at the age of 82, and was given a large state funeral.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey {{first entered}} presidential {{politics}} in 1952 {{running as a}} favorite son candidate in Minnesota. In 1960, he mounted a full-scale run, winning primaries in South Dakota and Washington D.C., but ultimately lost the Democratic nomination to future President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, Humphrey was tapped as the running mate of President Lyndon Johnson, {{who went on to}} win in a landslide victory over Republican Barry Goldwater. As Vice President, Humphrey oversaw turbulent times in America, including race <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> growing frustration and anger over the large number of casualties in the Vietnam War. President Johnson's popularity had plummeted as the election grew closer.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} trials Sissoi Veliky {{was ordered to}} join the Mediterranean Squadron which was engaged in the naval {{blockade}} of Crete {{in the wake of}} the 1896 Cretan <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> the Hamidian massacres. Her maiden voyage revealed more problems; the lack of ventilation in the steering compartment was so appalling that during the first port call the captain purchased electric fans with his own money and the electrical systems failed one by one before reaching Gibraltar. The copper rings for sealing the portholes were left in Kronstadt and were not found until February 1897.|$|E

5|$|In {{political}} terms, {{the practical}} benefits were minimal, the dangers considerable. Less than 2% of Scots were professed Catholics {{who already had}} considerable freedom to practice in private, a point made by James himself. The opening of Catholic chapels in Edinburgh allowing public celebration of the Mass led to <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> made private worship more difficult. Attempts to build support by expanding the measures benefitted dissident Presbyterians while undermining his Episcopalian base. When James failed to get Parliament's approval, he confirmed popular prejudice linking Catholicism and arbitrary rule by using the Royal Prerogative to promote Catholics to key government positions.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{published}} {{his first book}} in 1970. Called The Pendulum Years, its subtitle, Britain and the Sixties, summed up its subject. In 22 self-contained chapters, Levin considered various aspects of British life during the decade. Among his topics were prominent people including Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson – dubbed the Walrus and the Carpenter by Levin – and {{institutions such as the}} monarchy, the churches and the British Empire in its last days. Among the individual events examined in the book were the 1968 student <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> the prosecution for obscenity of the publishers of Lady Chatterley's Lover.|$|E
5|$|President Fernando de la Rúa {{resigned}} in that year, amid the December 2001 <b>riots,</b> <b>and</b> the Congress appointed Rodríguez Saá {{as president of}} Argentina. In response to the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression, he declared the highest sovereign default in history and resigned days later amid civil unrest. The Congress appointed a new president, Eduardo Duhalde, who completed the term of office of DelaRúa. Rodríguez Saá ran for the 2003 and 2015 presidential elections but did not win.|$|E

5|$|Several {{residential}} squares with terraces of three-storey {{houses were}} laid out around central gardens. An example is Portland Square, which was built between 1789 and 1820, and is now largely occupied by offices. In the 1830s, much of Queen Square was rebuilt following damage caused during the Bristol <b>Riots,</b> <b>and</b> {{to the north of}} the city, Kings Square. The most fashionable areas were at the top of the hill, as in wet weather the cesspits overflowed down the hill. Further development, though in a less formal manner, continued along the radial roads to Stokes Croft and Cheltenham, towards Horfield and in the St Phillips, Redcliffe and Bedminster areas.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish Quarter of Gaza was {{destroyed}} in the 1929 Palestine <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> most of Gaza's fifty Jewish families fled the city. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion, with new neighborhoods, such as Rimal and Zeitoun being built along the coast, and the southern and eastern plains. Areas damaged in the riots also went through reconstruction. Most of the funding for these developments came from international organizations and missionary groups.|$|E
5|$|The crisis worsened and by December 19, 2001, <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> looting {{broke out}} at several {{points in the}} country. De la Rúa {{announced}} in a cadena nacional (national network broadcast) that he established a state of emergency. The riots continued; his speech was followed by increased protests, the cacerolazos, which caused 27 deaths and thousands of injuries. Cavallo resigned at midnight the same day, {{and the rest of}} the cabinet followed suit.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} demands {{placed on}} the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, {{as well as a}} period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} {{of power to}} the patriciate was only temporary. After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the Züriputsch of 1839, civil war (the Sonderbundskrieg) broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried {{to set up a}} separate alliance (the Sonderbund). The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through friendly fire. Yet however minor the Sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other European <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The second {{element of}} the {{auxiliary}} forces was the Yeomanry, 38 regiments of volunteer cavalry which had historically {{been used as a}} form of internal security police, deployed to suppress local <b>riots</b> <b>and</b> provide a show of force to support the authorities. Recruits to the force were usually personally wealthy, providing their own horses and uniforms, and units were often heavily bankrolled by their senior officers. Training requirements were low, with an annual eight-day camp. The regiments were liable to be called out for defence against an invasion or an insurrection, and were not prepared for effective mobilisation; the units possessed no transport resources, or even a designated quartermaster.|$|E
