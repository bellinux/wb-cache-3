5000|$|In the BKS {{paper the}} Compton effect was {{discussed}} as {{an application of}} the idea of [...] "statistical conservation of energy and momentum" [...] in a continuous process of scattering of radiation by a sample of free electrons, where [...] "each of the electrons contributes through the emission of coherent secondary wavelets". Although Compton had already given an attractive account of his experiment {{on the basis of the}} photon picture (including conservation of energy and momentum in individual scattering processes), is it stated in the BKS paper that [...] "it seems at the present state of science hardly justifiable to reject a formal interpretation as that under consideration the weaker assumption of statistical as inadequate". This statement may have prompted experimental physicists to improve `the present state of science' by testing the hypothesis of `statistical energy and momentum conservation'. In any case, already after one year the BKS theory was disproved by experiments studying correlations between the directions into which the emitted radiation and the <b>recoil</b> <b>electron</b> are emitted in individual scattering processes. Such experiments were independently performed by Bothe and Geiger, as well as by Compton and Simon. They provided experimental evidence pointing in the direction of energy and momentum conservation in individual scattering processes (at least, it was shown that the BKS theory was not able to explain the experimental results). More accurate experiments, performed much later, have also confirmed these results.|$|E

The instrument had a field of view of one steradian. For cosmic gamma-ray events, the experiment required two nearly simultaneous interactions, {{in a set of}} front and rear scintillators. Gamma rays would Compton scatter in a forward detector module, where the interaction energy E1, given to the <b>recoil</b> <b>electron</b> was measured, while the Compton scattered photon would then be caught in one of a second layer of scintillators to the rear, where its total energy, E2, would be measured. From these two energies, E1 and E2, the Compton scattering angle, angle θ, can be determined, along with the total energy, E1 + E2, of the incident photon. The positions of the interactions, in both the front and rear scintillators, was also measured. The vector, V, connecting the two interaction points determined a direction to the sky, and the angle θ about this direction, defined a cone about V on which the source of the photon must lie, and a corresponding [...] "event circle" [...] on the sky. Because of the requirement for a near coincidence between the two interactions, with the correct delay of a few nanoseconds, most modes of background production were strongly suppressed.

The de Broglie wavelength, wave and clock frequency of the scattered electrons are {{expressed in terms of}} the wavelength and the frequency of the incident and the scattered photons respectively using the familiar particle interpretation of the Compton effect, where initially the electron is at rest and its spin is ignored. Both non-relativistic and relativistic cases are considered. Numerical values of de Broglie wavelength, wave and clock frequency of the scattered electron are calculated for an incident photon energy that was used in the original experiment of Compton {{as a function of the}} scattering angle of the <b>recoiled</b> <b>electron.</b> Considering the relativistic effects which are however insignificant for the de Broglie wavelength of the <b>recoiled</b> <b>electron</b> under these conditions, the minimum value obtained is in the range of X-rays. The non-relativistic de Broglie wave frequency obtained by neglecting the rest mass of the electron leads to an underestimation of its value.

In this work we explore, in detail, the viability of the VEP hypothesis as a solution to the solar neutrino problem in a two generation scenario with both the active and sterile neutrino alternatives, choosing these states to be massless. To obtain the best-fit values of the oscillation parameters we perform a chi square analysis for the total rates of solar neutrinos seen at the Chlorine (Homestake), Gallium (Gallex and SAGE), Kamiokande, and SuperKamiokande (SK) experiments. We find that the goodness of these fits is never satisfactory. It markedly improves if the Chlorine data is excluded from the analysis, especially for VEP transformation to sterile neutrinos.
