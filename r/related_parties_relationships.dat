This study aimed to analyze the determinants affecting <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions’ intensity in companies in the business groups in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The determinants were ultimate shareholders, good corporate governance (with independent commissioner and the Big Four public accounting firms as proxies), debt to equity ratio, and period of crisis. This study used panel data with quarterly time period from 2006 to 2013. Samples were determined by purposive sampling focusing on companies’ typology, namely companies in the three business groups representing the market capitalization’s three layers. The results showed that ultimate shareholders insignificantly had positive effect on <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions’ intensity.

In this paper, {{we focus on}} the impact of {{internal control}} quality on <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions because such transactions can be managed by <b>related</b> <b>parties</b> and directly influence corporate value. According to FASB No. 57, <b>related</b> <b>parties</b> are defined to include three basic categories of individuals: board members, executives and principal owners (owners of more than 10 % of voting interests of the enterprise). Considering the influence power of these stakeholders in CSOEs, <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions attract more attention from researchers and regulatory entities than unrelated <b>party</b> transactions. Fair <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions have arm-length prices and normal business processes, which efficiently fulfil underlying economic needs of the company (Gordon et al. [2004]). However, unfair <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions under a weak governance system with agency conflicts are often used to transfer wealth for private benefits of <b>related</b> <b>parties</b> (Chen and Wang [2005]; Cheung et al.

30|$|Through <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions, {{cash and}} profits can be {{diverted}} away from firms either to controlling shareholders or to assist troubled firms {{within the group}} (Jian and Wong [2004]). For example, controlling shareholders loot their own firms during the emerging market crisis of 1997 to 1998. Firms in developed markets also use <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions to transfer assets and profits out of firms {{for the benefit of}} controlling shareholders (Johnson et al. [2000]). <b>Related</b> <b>party</b> transactions have also been under the limelight in a number of recent US and European accounting scandals, such as transactions between Enron and its special-purpose entities. <b>Related</b> <b>party</b> transaction is prevalent in China due to the corporate structures, economic institutions and the legal system. According to the 2001 annual reports of Chinese listed firms, 90 % of them are involved in different degrees of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions (Jian and Wong [2004]). State-owned groups are usually formed out of a number of related large-scale SOEs. Because of their planned economy tradition, SOEs tend to have more <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions within the group than non-SOEs. As such, <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions are more prevalent in CSOEs than in other listed firms.|$|R
3000|$|According to the {{contract}} {{theory and the}} agency theory (Jensen and Meckling [1976]), various stakeholders take part in corporate contracts with different interests and asymmetric information (Grossman and Hart [1986]). <b>Related</b> <b>party</b> transactions {{can be used by}} controlling shareholders and/or top executives for their own private benefits at the cost of deteriorating corporate value. Internal control is designed to help the organization accomplish specific goals, one of which is improving operational outcomes to achieve the strategic objective. A healthy and effective internal control system can prevent insiders tunnelling the firm (Kohlbeck and Mayhew [2004]). Of course, not all the <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions are value-destroying. Fair <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions are efficient and cost-saving. Due to information asymmetry, outsiders cannot distinguish the quality of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions.

The most important stakeholder of CSOEs is SASAC because of its influence on important decisions of CSOEs including <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions despite the fact that SASAC cannot make any direct influence through multiple agency relationships.

The sample includes 1126 public announcements of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions with controlling shareholders disclosed by 577 Chinese companies listed in Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2010 in accordance with regulatory requirements, the source of which is Shanghai Stock Exchange's website. Stock price data and key financial information for all the 894 listed companies are from Thomson Reuters One. In addition, the 2010 annual reports of all the listed companies are used to get data on corporate governance and information disclosure.

Using a sample of 131 Chinese listed firms in the basic materials industries such as mining, lumber, chemicals and building materials, we have found that firms that are controlled by a corporate group engage in more <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions than firms that are not.

The internal control is evidenced {{to be related to}} financial reporting (Doyle et al. [2007]; Altamuro and Beatty [2010]; Skaife et al.

Second, our paper evaluates the efficiency of internal control and tests the mediation effect in CSOEs based on insiders' judgments.
