40|$|Abstract: Generation of {{calibration}} curves for radiation detectors {{are essential}} in radiation spectroscopy. Such curves usually relate some characteristic quantities of measured samples (such as radioactivity {{of a certain}} isotope or its mass) with {{the output of the}} used detector (counting rates). The most direct and easiest way to generate these curves is performed using a set of suitable <b>radioactive</b> <b>standard</b> materials. Whenever standard materials are not available, mathematical calibration could be employed. In this work, a proposed model for mathematical calibration of a neutron coincidence counter (the Active Well Neutron Coincidence Counter, AWCC) was achieved using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Effects of the counter and experimental set up parameters on the simulation process were studied. The validity of the proposed model was checked using sets of nuclear material standards.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, Monte Carlo {{simulation}} of photons interacting with matter has gradually improved {{to the extent}} that it now appears suitable for calibrating germanium detectors for counting efficiency in gamma-ray spectral analysis. The process is particularly useful because it can be applied for a variety of source shapes and spatial relations between source and detector by simply redefining the geometry, whereas calibration with <b>radioactive</b> <b>standards</b> requires a separate set of measurements for each source shape and location relative to the detector. Simulation accuracy was evaluated for two large (126 % and 110 %) and one medium-sized (20 %) detectors with radioactive point sources at distances of 10 m, 1. 6 m, and 0. 50 m and with aqueous solutions in a 0. 5 -L reentrant beaker and in jars of similar volume but various dimensions.

To do this, the efficiency {{response of the}} detector was used considering 29 different energies. This allowed calibrating various gamma-emitter radioactive point sources, within of a 50 kBq to 550 MBq activity range, with expanded uncertainties below 2. 5 % at two-sigma confidence level (k= 2).

30|$|Aim: Dose calibrators are {{medical devices}} used in nuclear {{medicine}} {{to determine the}} amount of radioactivity to be administered to patients. According to Dutch Nuclear Medicine Guidelines, dose calibrators should be validated for all radionuclides and geometries with a maximum deviation of 5 % with respect to the true radioactivity. This validation requires the use of well calibrated <b>radioactive</b> <b>standards</b> or measurements with calibrated equipment. Because this is expensive and time consuming, validation is often limited to a comparison to other dose calibrators. It is questionable if this limitation is justified, especially when looking at the effect of the (type of) isotope, the dose calibrator type/manufacturer and the geometry of the radioactive sample.|$|R

40|$|The {{specific}} {{activities of}} natural radionuclides in twenty seven samples {{collected from the}} eastern Dahomey basin in southwestern Nigeria were evaluated. Experimental results were obtained by using a 3 " x 3 " sodium iodide NaI(Tl) detector. A major trace element assessment of the samples was made by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry techniques. Gamma ray <b>radioactive</b> <b>standard</b> sources, 137 Cs and 60 Co, were used to calibrate the measurement system and the International Atomic Energy Agency SOIL- 375 <b>radioactive</b> <b>standard</b> source was also used to analyze and compute the specific activities of desired natural radionuclides. Three radioelements, viz. 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K, were identified in the samples with the following specific activities of 238 U ranging from 9. 88 ± 4. 70 Bq/kg to 69. 15 ± 12. 37 Bq/kg {{with an average of}} 26. 50 ± 7. 18 Bq/kg; 232 Th from 12. 78 ± 5. 16 Bq/kg to 36. 86 ± 13. 35 Bq/kg with an average of 22. 77 ± 4. 28 Bq/kg; 40 K ranging from 189. 82 ± 79. 51 Bq/kg to 518. 77 ± ± 119. 54 Bq/kg with an average of 297. 69 ± 16. 21 Bq/kg. The result was compared with the world mean values of 35, 30 and 400 Bq/kg, respectively, specified by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. The mean result obtained for the radium equivalent, total absorbed dose rate, external hazard index, internal hazard index, and the annual effective dose equivalent, were 79. 90 Bq/kg, 38. 50 μSv/h, 0. 22 Bq/kg, 0. 29 Bq/kg, and 47. 22 μSv, respectively. With respect to radiological risk to human health, the absorbed gamma dose rate in air was estimated to be in the range of 21. 7 ± 0. 4 to 155. 7 ± 2. 2 μSv/h; the outdoor annual effective dose equivalent was evaluated to vary from 26. 6 ± 0. 4 to 190. 9 ± ± 2. 7 μSv with the arithmetic mean value of 79. 06 ± 33. 23 μSv and compared to the world-wide effective dose of 70 μSv. Also, the values of the radium equivalent and the external hazard index for all samples in the study area were found to be lower than the accepted safety limit value of 370 Bq/kg and equally below the limit of unity, respectively.

The desired monitoring points include both the feed to and decontaminated product from a technetium-removal column. A Cs-removal column precedes technetium decontamination in the proposed process. Our earlier report (Ref. 1) showed that a simple flow-through beta counting system can easily meet 99 Tc detection limit goals for solutions that do not contain interfering radionuclides; however, concentrations of residual interferences were too high in process solutions at the desired monitoring points.

40|$|The Performance Demonstration Program (PDP) for {{nondestructive}} assay (NDA) {{consists of}} a series of tests to evaluate the capability for NDA of transuranic (TRU) waste throughout the Department of Energy (DOE) complex. Each test is termed a PDP cycle. These evaluation cycles provide an objective measure of the reliability of measurements obtained from NDA systems used to characterize the radiological constituents of TRU waste. The primary documents governing the conduct of the PDP are the Waste Acceptance Criteria for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WAC; DOE 1999 a) and the Quality Assurance Program Document (QAPD; DOE 1999 b). The WAC requires participation in the PDP; the PDP must comply with the QAPD and the WAC. The WAC contains technical and quality requirements for acceptable NDA. This plan implements the general requirements of the QAPD and applicable requirements of the WAC for the NDA PDP for boxed waste assay systems. Measurement facilities demonstrate acceptable performance by the successful testing of simulated waste containers according to the criteria set by this PDP Plan. Comparison among DOE measurement groups and commercial assay services is achieved by comparing the results of measurements on similar simulated waste containers reported by the different measurement facilities. These tests are used as an independent means to assess the performance of measurement groups regarding compliance with established quality assurance objectives (QAO’s). Measurement facilities must analyze the simulated waste containers using the same procedures used for normal waste characterization activities. For the boxed waste PDP, a simulated waste container {{consists of a}} modified standard waste box (SWB) emplaced with <b>radioactive</b> <b>standards</b> and fabricated matrix inserts. An SWB is a waste box with ends designed specifically to fit the TRUPACT-II shipping container. SWB’s will be used to package a substantial volume of the TRU waste for disposal.

These radioactive isotopes of tin {{have a relatively}} low yield as a fission product but they will have got an important relevance in the future due to their high mobility and the long-life time of some of them, as 126 Sn and 121 mSn. These isotopes are usually determined by liquid scintillation technique which leads to do several steps and to use high amounts of reagents in the purification and pre-concentration processes of radionuclides. Cross-linked plastic scintillation resins are a new material employed to separate, pre-concentrate and measure radionuclides in only one step {{as well as to}} obtain less contaminant wastes than those generated by liquid scintillation technique. The objective of this study is the development of C-PSresin used to pre-concentrate and measure the β-emitter isotopes of tin. First, the composition of resin which allows the best working conditions is determined and that corresponds to 80 % of TBP in n-dodecane. Then, the elution medium effect in selectivity of C-PSresin is evaluated using cesium and antimony as interfering metals. From this study, it is determined the optimal elution medium that is HCl 2 M because it causes a quantitative retention of tin and a complete elution of cesium and antimony.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to- and method for characterization of fissile nuclide contaminated soils and process piping {{has been developed}} and implemented for low and intermediate level wastes, using new calibration bases for photon counting. The method has been validated by integrating the capabilities of MCNP 5 and ISOCS for a LaBr scintillator detector in combination with known <b>radioactive</b> <b>standards.</b> In addition, the developed methods consider nuclear safety as the priority while retaining realistic fissile mass and enrichment estimation techniques. The impact of a quick, portable non-destructive assay process to the decommissioning and remediation arena is extremely valuable. Traditional methods have inherent limitations in time consumption, resources, stability, and rigidity. In addition to optimizing a material blending and storage program, gaining a real-time understanding {{to the nature of}} fissile material prior to disturbance aids a nuclear safety program and culture invaluably. In this dissertation, detailed detector-waste models were developed and utilized to create a quick uranium mass and enrichment estimation process by taking advantage of the resolution and discrimination capabilities of the LaBr equipped InSpector 1000 instrument. The analysis takes into account multiple possible scenarios that may be encountered during decommissioning and remediation of a fuel fabrication and buried nuclear waste facility, while keeping nuclear safety controls in mind. As an inherent part of the process, the models were validated by performing a series of code-to-software and software-to-standard benchmarking procedures, which provided substantiation for use of the detector for the derived purposes, in addition to ensuring that the Monte Carlo-based calibration approach was conservative, as compared to other methods. The scenarios analyzed for the calibration basis were selected based on historical knowledge and in-field experience at the Westinghouse Hematite Decommissioning Project. The techniques developed in this dissertation offer a new characterization method for fissile material quantity and enrichment with a portable, passive non-destructive gamma assay system without relying on continual macroscopic system analysis. In addition, it provides early detection of large quantities of fissile material prior to exhumation or disturbance to enhance nuclear safety processes. This places the first priority on nuclear and radiological safety while preserving the time and money saving aspects of production-based projects...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of Non Destructive Assay (NDA) Working Reference Materials (WRMs) that are traceable to nationally recognized standards was undertaken to support {{implementation of the}} Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) Nondestructive Waste Assay Capability Evaluation Project (CEP). The WRMs produced for the CEP project consist of Increased Am/Pu mass ration (IAP) and depleted Uranium (DU) WRMs. The CEP IAP/DU WRM set provides <b>radioactive</b> material <b>standards</b> for use in combination with 55 gallon drum waste matrix surrogates {{for the assessment of}} waste NDA assay system performance. The Production of WRMs is a meticulous process that is not without certain trials and tribulations. Problems may arise at any of the various stages of WRM production which include, but are not limited to; material characterization (physical, chemical, and isotopic), material blend parameters, personnel radiation exposure, gas generation phenomenon, traceability to national standards, encapsulation, statistical evaluation of the data, and others. Presented here is an overall description of the process by which the CEP WRMs were produced and certified as well as discussions pertaining to some of the problems encountered and how they were solved...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of a planar miniature CdTe detector for gamma spectrometry has been tested by analysing <b>standard</b> <b>radioactive</b> sources and spent nuclear fuel. The detector was connected to a charhe loss corrector amplifier and yielded an energy resolution (FWHM) of 7. 2 keV at 662 keV. The {{application of}} the CdTe detector to spent fuels resulted in gamma spectra of well resolved photopeaks for the fission products 134 -Cs and 137 -Cs. The ratio of the two fission products, complemented by isotopic correlations, verified the burnup of the fuel to within 10 % of that declared by the operator. JRC.

30|$|The {{absolute}} radioactivity of 43 Sc {{and other}} obtained radionuclides {{was measured by}} γ-spectrometry using two high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The detectors were energy and efficiency calibrated in different geometries using certified <b>standard</b> <b>radioactive</b> sources (ENEA Italy, DAMRI and CERCA France). The gamma-ray spectrum analysis software package Genie 2000 (CANBERA, USA) was used to collect the data. The γ-ray peak at 372.8  keV was chosen for 43 Sc detection, and the peaks at 1157.00, 271.24, and 159.38  keV were chosen to detect 44 Sc, 44 mSc, and 47 Sc, respectively. Three peaks at 983.52, 1037.52, 1312.10 keV were used to quantify yields of 48 Sc [21]. The uncertainty of all the determined activities was below 1  %.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, Argonne National Laboratory has been {{developing}} room-temperature-setting chemically bonded phosphate ceramics for solidifying and stabilizing low-level mixed wastes. This technology is crucial for stabilizing waste streams that contain volatile species and off-gas secondary waste streams generated by high-temperature treatment of such wastes. We have developed a magnesium phosphate ceramic to treat mixed wastes such as ash, salts, and cement sludges. Waste forms of surrogate waste streams were fabricated by acid-base reactions between the mixtures of magnesium oxide powders and the wastes, and phosphoric acid or acid phosphate solutions. Dense and hard ceramic waste forms are produced in this process. The principal advantage of this technology is that the contaminants are immobilized by both chemical stabilization and subsequent microencapsulation of the reaction products. This paper reports the results of durability studies conducted on waste forms made with ash waste streams spiked with hazardous and <b>radioactive</b> surrogates. <b>Standard</b> leaching tests such as ANS 16. 1 and TCLP were conducted on the final waste forms. Fates of the contaminants in the final waste forms were established by electron microscopy. In addition, stability of the waste forms in aqueous environments was evaluated with long-term water-immersion tests...|$|R
