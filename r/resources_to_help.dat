25|$|As most {{of these}} Chinese civil {{societies}} were involved in Chinese family religious activities such as funerals or ancestral worship, they were in fact religious-oriented.

Some rich and powerful Chinese businessmen began to establish Clubs, such as the Ee Ho Hean Club (怡和轩) in 1895, and Chamber of Commerce, such as the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to broaden the Chinese social circle. Established in 1906, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry was the highest body of organisation within the Chinese community in Singapore.
