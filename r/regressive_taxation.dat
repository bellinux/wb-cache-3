While the census of China {{was completed in}} 1252, Novgorod in the far northwest was not counted until winter 1258–59. There was an uprising in Novgorod against Mongol rule in 1257, but Alexander Nevsky forced the city {{to submit to the}} Mongol census and taxation. The new census counted not only households but also the number of men aged 15–60 and the number of fields, livestock, vineyards, and orchards. Within the civilian register craftsmen were listed separately, while in the military registers auxiliary and regular households were distinguished. Clergy of the approved religions were separated and not counted. When the new register was completed, one copy was sent to Karakorum and one copy kept for the local administration. Möngke tried to create a fixed poll tax collected by imperial agents that could be forwarded to the needy units. Initially, the maximum rate was fixed at 10–11 gold dinars in the Middle East and 6–7 taels of silver in China. Protests from the landlord classes reduced this relatively low rate to 6–7 dinars and taels. Some officials raised the top rate on the wealthy of 500 dinars. While the reform did not lighten the tax burden, it made the payments more predictable.

2500|$|GPO policy {{proposes a}} concept known as green tax shifting, which it classifies under {{the broad context}} of {{ecological}} fiscal reform. In general, the party proposes gradual but significant reductions in all income and corporate taxes (or taxes on so-called [...] "earned income"), funded {{by the introduction of}} new resource-based taxes applied at the point of entry into the economy (for example, carbon taxes). The Green Party also proposes introduction of a system of land value taxation, which would replace the current value assessment-based property tax system and would be meant to discourage urban sprawl and increase land use efficiency. Central to the GPO's tax policies is the concept of revenue neutrality, in which any new taxes (i.e., those on resources and consumption) are complemented by a reduction in other forms of taxation (generally income and corporate taxes). This mixture of libertarian and free-market income tax policies with a shift towards consumption/resource taxation is one of the clear differences between the Ontario Greens and the three main provincial parties. For example, while the NDP {{and to a lesser extent}} the Liberals aim to create social equity through progressive taxation of already-earned income, and the Conservatives do not necessarily view social equity to be the role of government, the Greens prefer allowing individuals/businesses to contribute by paying more for what they use (resources, energy) and the pollution/side-effects that they create. The GPO claims that this system is more fair and more economically desirable, because it only punishes individuals and businesses who operate without regard for society and the environment, while accentuating the ability of truly efficient and responsible businesses to prosper without hindrance. Critics of these policies, however, oppose these taxation methods because they view them as examples of <b>regressive</b> <b>taxation</b> (rather than progressive taxation)due to the fact that they would have a bigger economic impact that would be felt in the everyday lives of lower-income groups. They point out that since these policies don't take into account the person's income/ability to pay, they would naturally create greater economic hardship the lower down the income ladder one is (as in any amount of money that is set to a flat rate would represent a greater portion of one's income the less money they make, hence placing the tax burden on the shoulders of the poorest in society because although everyone would be paying the same amount, [...] "x" [...] amount of dollars is far more significant to a lower-income person than a higher-income person).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} different corporate tax systems on the location of industry within an economic geography model with regional size asymmetries. Both the North and the South gain industry by adopting a tax regime that produces the lowest tax level. As the share of expenditures in the North increases, the Nash equilibrium has this region setting regressive taxes, while the South introduces progressive taxation. The unilateral welfare-maximizing tax structure in the North (South) is the regressive (progressive) system when expenditures in the North increase. Welfare in the North (South) is however maximized if both regions set regressive (progressive) taxes, while <b>regressive</b> (progressive) <b>taxation</b> in both regions represents a joint welfare maximizing outcome if the economic size of the North is higher (lower) than a certain threshold value.

5000|$|Measuring {{the value}} of care work is principally {{difficult}} because relationships of care are partly exchange transactions, and partly transactions involving what Folbre calls “the invisible heart.” This metaphor represents family values of love and economic reciprocity, which she contrasts with Adam Smith's [...] "invisible hand," [...] in which the market forces {{of supply and demand}} exist alongside the pursuit of self-interest. While the forces of the free market and competitive individualism dominates public life, the forces of compassion must temper the forces of self-interest. Under the premise that people are rational optimizers, Folbre argues that if it is costly to be caring, people can be expected to engage in it less over time. If the opportunity cost of devoting time to family over a career is perceived to be high, or if proving care for the poor or sick pays poorly, then rational decision-makers will increasingly come to avoid care work. Folbre applauds the rising autonomy of women but argues that if we don’t establish thoughtful rules defining our collective responsibilities for caregiving, the penalties suffered by the needy will increase. Intensified economic competition may drive altruism and families out of business. The book is divided into three sections, in which Folbre explores a wide range of issues, from the view of the housekeeping state to the rights of pregnant workers in Mexico. Using a storytelling voice, she tells a sequence of wonderful stories of her own extended family and acquaintances in San Antonio. Folbre views corporations as profit-obsessed and corrupt tyrants and often sees governments as bloated bureaucratic regimes that serve few and punish the poor. While <b>regressive</b> <b>taxation</b> assures that some will be able to afford more care than others, unequal school funding guarantees class inequality. Folbre compares the traditional role of women with the more contemporary career-oriented position of women. Where women have traditionally provided care within the home, this responsibility is slowly transitioning to third parties and corporate institutions. Profit motives will tend to drive the wages of care workers down. She notes that turnover rates among childcare staff are often in excess of 30 percent per year. According to Folbre, such under-provision of quality care is due to the mismatch between care's relational and public-good nature, as well as an economic system that stresses competition and individuality. Folbre argues that radical changes to the way Americans live and work, democratic control of the economy, as well as a dramatic redistribution of wealth will strengthen the ethic of solidarity and social reciprocity. She concludes with a resounding call—to extend family values to society as a whole—and a series of policy proposals for increasing both the quality and the recognition of care.|$|E

40|$|This paper derives {{the type}} of tax system (progressive, {{proportional}} or regressive) required by different marginal income utility functions to satisfy the equal absolute and equal proportional sacrifice of utility among taxpayers. The context is that in which the rules were originally formulated, namely, the old welfare economics of measurable and comparable utility. It is found that equal absolute sacrifice calls for progression only if marginal income utility decreases {{at a faster rate}} than income increases (inelastic schedule). All other marginal utility curves require <b>regressive</b> <b>taxation,</b> save the unit elastic Bernoulli curves which requires proportional taxation. Equal proportional sacrifice indicates proportional taxation if the ratio of the area formed by the product of income and marginal utility to the total area under the marginal curve up to that income level is the same for all income levels. If this ratio decreases, progressive taxation is required; if it increases, <b>regressive</b> <b>taxation</b> is needed. With equal absolute sacrifice, the degree of progression is shown to be independent of the amount of utility sacrificed, whereas with equal proportional sacrifice the greater the proportion of utility to be sacrificed the more progressive (or less regressive) must be the tax structure. Finally, Musgrave's assertion that a unit elastic marginal income utility curve calls for proportional taxation under either rule is shown to be incorrect...|$|E

5000|$|Great Depression: Some scholars, {{including}} Duiker and Scott, see a {{more direct}} relation between the Great Depression and precariousness of village livelihoods during this period. They explain that the Depression exacerbated the general economic malaise of the poorer classes, citing the falling of rice prices and land values leading to {{a sharp drop in}} farm income and increasing penury. Bernal notes, however, that most of the rural population appears to have been only slightly affected during the duration of the revolt because the Great Depression only took effect in Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh, as in the rest of Indochina, only in the mid-1930s. [...] The depression nevertheless affected the central Vietnamese local population in some ways. Firstly, poverty and density population had led many peasants to seek employment in plantations and factories which had to retrench or reduce the wages of their workers due to a fall in global and local demand for their products. Cutbacks on commercial agriculture in Cochinchina led to the return of labourers to their homes in Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh, exerting greater pressure on the already densely populated and famine ridden land. Secondly, the colonial regime which was more immediately affected by the downturn sharply accelerated the rate of tax increases and exaggerated the already <b>regressive</b> nature of <b>taxation</b> in order to increase state revenue.|$|R

We investigated how alternative tax systems affect the breadth, depth, and height of health system coverage. MethodsWe used cross-national longitudinal fixed effects models to assess the relationships between total and different types of tax revenue, health system coverage, and associated child and maternal health outcomes in 89 low-income and middle-income countries from 1995 – 2011. FindingsTax revenue was a major statistical determinant of progress towards universal health coverage. Each US$ 100 per capita per year of additional tax revenues corresponded to a yearly increase in government health spending of $ 9 · 86 (95 % CI 3 · 92 – 15 · 8), adjusted for GDP per capita. This association was strong for taxes on capital gains, profits, and income ($ 16 · 7, 9 · 16 to 24 · 3), but not for consumption taxes on goods and services (−$ 4 · 37, − 12 · 9 to 4 · 11). In countries with low tax revenues (<$ 1000 per capita per year), an additional $ 100 tax revenue per year substantially increased the proportion of births with a skilled attendant present by 6 · 74 percentage points (95 % CI 0 · 87 – 12 · 6) {{and the extent of}} financial coverage by 11 · 4 percentage points (5 · 51 – 17 · 2). Consumption taxes, a more <b>regressive</b> form of <b>taxation</b> that might reduce the ability of the poor to afford essential goods, were associated with increased rates of post-neonatal mortality, infant mortality, and under- 5 mortality rates. We did not detect these adverse associations with taxes on capital gains, profits, and income, which tend to be more progressive. InterpretationIncreasing domestic tax revenues is integral to achieving universal health coverage, particularly in countries with low tax bases. Pro-poor taxes on profits and capital gains seem to support expanding health coverage without the adverse associations with health outcomes observed for higher consumption taxes. Progressive tax policies within a pro-poor framework might accelerate progress toward achieving major international health goals.
