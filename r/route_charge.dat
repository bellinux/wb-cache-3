40|$|A {{possible}} {{method for}} {{the reduction of}} civil Pu stockpiles is the reuse of Pu in mixed oxide fuel (MOX). During MOX fuel production, residues unsuitable for further recycle will be produced. Due to their high actinide content MOX residues require immobilization within a robust host matrix. Although {{it is possible to}} immobilize actinides in vitreous wasteforms; ceramic phases, such as brannerite (UTi 2 O 6), are attractive due to their high waste loading capacity and relative insolubility. A range of uranium brannerites, formulated GdxU 1 -xTi 2 O 6, were prepared using a mixed oxide <b>route.</b> <b>Charge</b> compensation of divalent and trivalent cations was expected to occur via the oxidation of U 4 + to higher valence states (U 5 + or U 6 +). Gd 3 + was added to act as a neutron absorber in the final Pu bearing wasteform. X-ray powder diffraction of synthesised specimens found that phase distribution was strongly affected by processing atmosphere (air or Ar). In all cases prototypical brannerite was formed accompanied by different secondary phases dependent on processing atmosphere. Microstructural analysis (SEM) of the sintered samples confirmed the results of the X-ray powder diffraction. The preliminary results presented here indicate that brannerite is a promising host matrix for mixed oxide fuel residues...|$|E

Brannerites Gd 0. 1 U 0. 9 Ti 2 O 6, Ce 0. 1 U 0. 9 Ti 2 O 6 and Gd 0. 1 U 0. 81 Ce 0. 09 Ti 2 O 6 were prepared using an oxide <b>route.</b> <b>Charge</b> compensation of trivalent cations was expected to occur via the oxidation of U (IV) to higher valence states (U (V) or U (VI)).

X-ray powder diffraction of synthesized specimens found that the final phase assemblage was strongly affected by processing atmosphere (air or argon).

40|$|The Single European Sky {{is being}} {{introduced}} to improve the efficiency of flight and traffic operations by reforming the air traffic management system. Despite all of these technical advances, airlines choose detours to avoid high <b>route</b> <b>charges.</b> This mechanism is intensified when fuel prices are low. The single unit rate method has been proposed to counter this behavior, but it will introduce other problems for both air navigation service providers (ANSPs) and airlines. For instance ANSPs have {{to agree on the}} redistribution of revenues, and some airlines can be confronted with considerable hikes in the <b>route</b> <b>charges.</b> We propose a novel <b>route</b> <b>charges</b> method called FRIDAY (Fixed Rate Incorporating Dynamic Allocation for optimal Yield) that will i). take away the incentive to airlines for detours, ii). keep ANSPs in control of their unit rates, and iii). keep the new <b>route</b> <b>charges</b> for airlines close to the current <b>route</b> <b>charges</b> when introducing FRIDAY. We will show how the FRIDAY method calculates <b>route</b> <b>charges</b> for flights, and revenues for air navigation service providers. Furthermore, we will introduce a numerical method for setting the unit rates for the FRIDAY method. The expected benefits of introducing the FRIDAY <b>route</b> <b>charges</b> method are i). cost, fuel and time savings for airlines, ii). increased predictability, and reductions in traffic risks for ANSPs, and iii). reductions in emissions and CO 2 for society.
