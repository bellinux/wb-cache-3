40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} {{experiments}} to measure large scale <b>Earth</b> surface <b>displacements</b> such as caused by solid Earth tides with centimetre-level accuracy using TerraSAR-X radar images. With two totally different approaches, corner reflectors and image correlation techniques, we show clear interrelation between the radar range measurements and the projection <b>of</b> the solid <b>Earth</b> tide motion vector onto the radar line of sight. Pixel location accuracies of up to 2. 6 cm standard deviation can be achieved after a single calibration. We further demonstrate that solid Earth tides and tropospheric water vapour variations are the largest sources of ranging error if not compensated for. Alternatively, tropospheric water vapour can be estimated with centimetre accuracy using our proposed technique of SAR image correlation and solid Earth motion compensation by existing models. We also consider ionospheric delays which improve the results marginally in X-band.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} how ground-based radar interferometry can provide <b>displacement</b> measurements <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> dam surfaces and of vibration frequencies of its main concrete infrastructures. In many cases, dams were built many decades ago and, at that time, were not equipped with in situ sensors embedded in the structure when they were built. Earth dams have scattering properties similar to landslides for which the Ground-Based Synthetic Aperture Radar (GBSAR) technique has been so far extensively applied to study ground displacements. In this work, SAR and Real Aperture Radar (RAR) configurations are used for the measurement <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> dam surface <b>displacements</b> and vibration frequencies of concrete structures, respectively. A methodology for the acquisition of SAR data and the rendering of results is described.

In this paper, we present an efficient and automatic implementation of the Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) DInSAR algorithm, specifically intended for the processing of Sentinel- 1 SAR data.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development <b>of</b> probabilistic <b>risk</b> assessment for substation earthing systems. A number of key parameters have been studied in detail which {{led to the development of}} a new approach that incorporates the recommendations of applicable standards and uses historical system fault data to take account of the probabilistic nature of load, protection systems and grid characteristics. In this work, an in-depth appraisal of existing standards has led to the development of safety-limit surfaces that can be used to quantify the benefits/disadvantages <b>of</b> particular <b>earthing</b> standards. The investigation has revealed that there are substantial differences between the recommended values of tolerable voltages attributed to a combination of factors: (i) difference in assumed tolerable body current (ii) differences in the parameters of the electrocution circuit (iii) differences in the predicted touch voltage and (iv) differences in the assumed worst-case shock location. The electricity industry, like other industries, is looking to reduce risk to minimum feasible while maintaining costs of mitigation within acceptable limits. Therefore, a more rigorous and comprehensive procedure <b>of</b> probabilistic <b>risk</b> assessment <b>of</b> the <b>earthing</b> systems is required. In order to achieve this, a detailed analysis of all parameters was undertaken in this work using more representative accidental circuits and parameters extracted from historical system fault data, provided by the collaborating transmission companies. These parameters were modelled and integrated into the proposed probabilistic risk assessment process. Work within this investigation on improving accuracy of calculation of heart fibrillation has led to the development of a probability surface of ventricular fibrillation and a computerised process that determines an accurate probability for a given body current and shock duration. This procedure takes into consideration the body current path and eliminates reading errors or assumptions that could result into conservative or optimistic conclusions. The above fundamental investigations on parameters affecting the overall risk were implemented in a new computerised risk assessment procedure CRAFTS suitable for transmission systems. CRAFTS allows a probabilistic <b>risk</b> assessment <b>of</b> the system under investigation. The application integrates the recent developments in the latest standard IEC 60479 - 1 and the developed probability surface of ventricular fibrillation. A case study performed on a typical grid has shown that the developed program is very useful when applying sensitivity analysis of the various parameters of the system and accidental circuit. The proposed full probabilistic risk assessment method incorporates the earthing system simulation results performed by specialised software, namely CDEGS, making it possible to simulate different electrocution scenarios throughout the substation instead of assuming a 'worst case scenario' and exposure to maximum possible voltages. Overall, the research in this thesis, offers an integrated solution <b>of</b> probabilistic <b>risk</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>earthing</b> systems in aid of sound cost/benefit analysis and decision making.
