40|$|The {{expenditure}} on {{rental housing}} as {{a proportion of}} income is usually measured by the <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> which is the most commonly used affordability indicator, while the residual income approach is often taken as an alternative. This paper attempts to identify the determinants of the <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> and to examine the impact of accessibility on affordability in the private rental sector. Empirical results indicate not only determinants of the <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> would vary, but even the same variable would have different impacts on the <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> and hence on affordability for locations with different accessibility. Although the <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> in Hong Kong is considerably higher than in most other cities, results from the residual income approach indicate that the affordability problem is not significant, and that it has a strong link with accessibility. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Affordability is a {{dominant}} and controversial issue in housing policy {{all over the}} world. Hong Kong is no exception. In 1987, the government took a notable shift in its housing policy toward a more market-oriented system. As such, the notion of affordability overrode the notion of need. Like the United States and the United Kingdom, Hong Kong uses the median <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> as an affordability yardstick for rent setting. However, this approach suffers serious criticisms for its arbitrary benchmarking. This paper aims to examine the “affordability” issue among public rental housing tenants in Hong Kong. It takes a broader view by analyzing both their housing and nonhousing consumption patterns using economic first principles. It starts with an overview of conventional concepts of affordability and their shortcomings. It then applies the economic first principles to measure household affordability and test the “reasonableness” of using the median <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> as a benchmark. Rather interestingly, {{the findings suggest that}} the easy-to-use median <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> currently adopted by the Hong Kong Housing Authority cannot reflect the affordability of public rental housing tenants. This paper argues that household affordability could be gauged more correctly by adopting economic first principles, which render a better operational definition in housing resource allocation.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the household}} formation and tenure choice decisions of different age cohorts in the Irish market. We use data covering the years 2001 to 2011, a period which encompasses the boom, bubble and {{collapse in the}} Irish housing market. We find that the household formation decision {{is affected by the}} <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> while tenure choice depends upon the difference between rent and the user cost of housing, a notional cost of services derived from owning a home. After the crash, the balance of these costs favoured renting, resulting in a decrease in owner occupancy. In addition, we find that falling average rents caused entry to the housing market to become more affordable, and that this is linked to significantly higher household fo rmation rates...|$|E
40|$|An {{interesting}} {{report from}} LSE London {{argues that the}} government should invest more heavily in affordable housing in London. [Disclosure: I am affiliated with LSE London]. It justifies this conclusion on the basis of need (crowding and <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratios</b> are higher than {{in other parts of the}} country), value for money (costs are higher, but land used more intensively and private sector leverage higher) and housing numbers (the government will not reach its affordable housing number target otherwise) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper assesses whether {{growth in}} the {{immigrant}} population {{over the past two}} decades has adversely affected the housing consumption opportunities of native renter households. We find that the monthly housing expenses of native renters are higher in metropolitan areas with larger immigrant populations. However, these marginal effects are comparable for both native households in direct competition with immigrants and native households that are unlikely to compete with immigrants in the housing market. Moreover, while average native rents increase as the proportion immigrant increases within a given metropolitan area, the same is not true for <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratios.</b> We do find that native households in metropolitan areas with large immigrant populations consume fewer rooms and are relatively more likely to reside in crowded conditions. This result holds in an analysis of cross-sectional variation as well as the analysis of changes within metropolitan areas. However, there is little evidence that these effects are larger for those native households who are likely to be in competition for housing with immigrant households. Economics...|$|R
40|$|Tenants in the Netherlands {{not only}} pay {{relatively}} {{more for their}} housing consumption than owner-occupiers, but also appear {{to be subject to}} Schwabe&# 039;s law on rent. This law states that households with a lower income are confronted with higher <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratios</b> than households with a higher income. In the Netherlands most rents are regulated, so these are expected to be at below-market levels. Tenants of these dwellings are eligible for housing allowances if their income is considered insufficient for paying the rent. The hypothesis is that a rental dwelling with a regulated rent and for which the tenant receives a housing allowance should be affordable to the tenant. However, as this paper shows, even a maximum degree of government intervention (rent regulation and housing allowances) plus the impact of affordable rent setting by landlords, leading to a maximum subsidisation of the tenant, cannot prevent a situation whereby tenants are paying an unaffordable rent. And an unaffordable rent suggests that these tenants may indeed feel impacted by housing affordability problems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the incomes and rents of the low-income renter population in eight large cities and metropolitan areas and identifies a {{population at risk}} of homelessness based on low incomes and very high rent-to-income ratios. The per capita rate of homelessness is hypothesized to be primarily {{a function of the}} percentage of low-income renters who are vulnerable, and of the percentage of the total population who are renters. Although these factors explain most of the variation in the extent of homelessness across these cities, their effects are conditioned by supply and demand factors which tend to mitigate or promote the extent of homelessness in each area. Rent burdens of the low-income population are found to be unprecedentedly high by recent historical standards, and the separate effects of income and rent on the <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> are found to vary across metropolitan areas...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this briefing paper {{is to examine the}} residual income measures employed in investigations of the impact of housing association (HA) rents on household’s capacities to afford an adequate standard of living, and to compare these findings with those for the traditional rent-to-income measure which look only at housing affordability. In the first section, the details of the two measures are set out. This is followed by a brief overview of rent-to-income ratios for new tenants from 2002 / 03 to 2007 / 08 and an examination of residual income, using the income standards set for the Income Support scheme. However, as the CORE data employed only cover new tenants, the final section addresses ‘after housing costs ’ for existing tenants in 2006 / 07 using the Family Resources Survey. Notwithstanding the use of multiple sources of data it should be recognised that calculations of residual income and <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> represent only a ‘best estimate ’ of housing affordability because of the high incidence of non response to income questions. For instance, nearly one-third of new tenants failed to answer the income question in CORE...|$|E
40|$|Flanders and Finland {{have similar}} shares of private renting and face many similar {{problems}} on the private rental market. More specifically the income level of renters is declining and the <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> for private tenants is high. In both cases tenants have a strong wish to become home owner, but only the better off can afford an own house. Future prospects for the supply side of private rental housing are however unsure and difficult to predict in both countries. It is interesting to observe similarities in two countries with a very different housing market, different housing institutions, legislation and housing policy. Flanders and Finland belong to different welfare regimes, i. e. continental corporatist and Scandinavian social democratic using Esping-Andersen’s old welfare state regime model (1990). During the ‘ 90 s Finland has changed in more liberal direction, i. e. by total abolishment of rent regulations, {{at the same time}} preserving traits of social democratic welfare regime. Using the classification of Kemeny Flanders and Finland both have a dual rental market system. According to Kemeny housing systems can however have contrasting elements/parts, a mixture of liberal and more comprehensive welfare elements. In Finland the market rental is more liberal and social housing more universal than in Flanders. The Finnish tenure system offers also more housing tenure alternatives. The explaining factor to differences between these two countries can also be the life style, individualization, role of family and housing preferences, which differ widely. And although problems at first sight are quite similar, the development paths and directions are different. As a result of liberalization, abolishment of rent controls but also demographic and lifestyle changes and recurring recessions the private rented market in Finland has experienced renaissance since 1990 onwards. This cannot be observed in Flanders. On the contrary, the private rental market is still diminishing. In both countries survey results give a better insight in the features, future prospects, and problems and the opinions of actors in the private rental market. As well tenants as landlords were questioned concerning the characteristics of the let dwellings, paid rents, the process of selecting tenants and the relationship between tenants and landlords. In this paper we describe and discuss similarities and differences between the survey results against the background of the distinct housing markets, housing policy and housing culture in Flanders and Finland. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three empirical essays that study two independent topics: income under-reporting and immigrants’ portfolio allocations. The first essay forms Chapter 2 where we use data from the Survey of Financial Security and the Survey of Household Spending to estimate the incidence and extent of income underreporting in Canada. We find that roughly 20 % to 40 % of households underreport income by, on average, roughly $ 6, 000 in 1999. In contrast to the existing literature, we show that self-employment status is a poor indicator of income under-reporting. We find that roughly 26 % of non self-employed households under-report income, regardless of how self-employment status for households is determined. We profile income under-reporters and find that income underreporting is pervasive. We propose a simple ratio method of identifying income-under-reporting households for our second essay, Chapter 3. Our method is a straight-forward application of the Permanent Income Hypothesis; that is, households make consumption decisions based on their expected lifetime income not their reported lifetime income implying that consumption-to-income ratios should be higher for under-reporting households. We argue for using housing costs as the consumption measure in our approach. Our results confirm that households that under-report their income have mortgage-to-income <b>ratios</b> (MIR) or <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratios</b> (RIR) well in excess of those households that do not under-report. Using this finding, we propose using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to determine the optimum cutoff threshold for MIR/RIR to detect under-reporters. Our third essay, Chapter 4, uses data from the 1999 and 2005 Survey of Financial Security to investigate the differences in portfolio allocations and values between immigrants and Canadian-born households. In general, we find that immigrants hold more real estate and less pension assets relative to Canadian-born households. Limited cohort analysis suggests that settled immigrants’ portfolio allocations are {{similar to that of}} Canadian-born households in contrast to recent immigrants’ portfolios. We also find evidence that the length of time living in Canada has a positive effect on ownership rate, share and value of both real estate and pension assets...|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} and definitions of housing affordability {{vary depending on}} the economic and social contexts of specific countries. However, irrespective of the context, housing affordability is not only influenced by the market conditions, but also by the prevailing policy environment, among other social and economic factors. The impact of the supply-side instruments of the policy environment, such as the regulatory regime, on the provision of affordable housing and housing affordability has been widely studied mainly in the context of developed or richer developing countries where strong regulatory and institutional frameworks exist. Little has been done in the context of developing countries with weak regulatory and institutional frameworks. This dissertation pioneers a study of this kind in the context of Bangladesh. It aims to investigate the housing affordability problems of the middle-income groups in Dhaka and to identify the underlying supply-side causes of the policy environment. A qualitative approach is adopted for this research. The social constructivist paradigm combined with the interpretive type of narration has been engaged as the research strategy. Both the ratio and residual-income based approaches of measuring housing affordability are used. Working definitions of housing affordability and income groups are also developed. Primary and secondary data were collected using various approaches such as document analysis, questionnaire survey and interviews. This study reveals that the formal housing market in Dhaka failed to provide affordable housing for the middle-income groups. The price-to-income ratio in Dhaka is one of the highest among the major South Asian cities. The middle-income groups struggle to maintain a minimum standard of living and largely rely on rental housing. However, rents are also unaffordable to them and Dhaka has the highest <b>rent-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> in Asia. The housing units in the informal settlements could be affordable to them, but their social status inhibits them from living in these settlements. The regulatory and infrastructure development regimes are found to be non-enabling. Existing land-use regulations encourage land hoarding and land value speculation. Despite the weak urban growth control, the land price is very high and the land-supply fails to meet the demand. Further, the planning permission processes for residential development are significant time and cost inflators. Investment on infrastructure is not targeted to facilitate residential land supply. Serviced residential land is expensive due to the short supply of residential infrastructures. Institutionally, the non-participatory mode of governance, absence of a clear line of authority, and poor human resources capacities of the related government organizations are the main underlying causes of the non-enabling performance of supply-side regimes. This study recommends pro-active government initiatives to strengthen the enabling functions of the regulatory regimes. Utilization of planning tools such as planning incentives and mandatory contributions of affordable housing in private housing projects are recommended. Infrastructure investment targeting at facilitating residential land supply is suggested. Institutional restructuring and the establishment of a housing data bank are also recommended. This study enriches the literature related to the impact of the policy environment on housing by widening the debate to cover the developing countries. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
