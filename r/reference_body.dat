40|$|The {{following}} paper {{discusses the}} use of 3 D <b>reference</b> <b>bodies</b> {{for the assessment of}} measurement accuracy of free-form surface measurement systems. <b>Reference</b> <b>bodies</b> are mechanical structures with calibrated values in terms of given coordinates, distances or surfaces. Standardised guidelines exist for the determination of limited performance characteristics such as probing error or sphere distance error, that are basically used for fringe projection systems. Since free-form surfaces usually consist of a variety of surface shapes and structures of different size and curvature, it is worthwhile to discuss {{the use of}} free-form <b>reference</b> <b>bodies</b> for performance evaluation. Two different reference objects have been designed and tested with different surface measurement methods: fringe projection, laser tracking, laser scanning with articulated arm and least squares stereo matching. The first reference object is designed for static measurement purposes, the second one is used for the verification of dynamic surface deformations. Both objects provide local reference points and can be calibrated by different techniques. In particular, the references are used to check the ability of area-based matching methods, both in static and dynamic scenes. In the recent implementation of the PISA system different geometric models and matching strategies can be selected. It can be proven that least squares matching with polynomial transformation of second order yield best results. 1...|$|R

40|$|A self-calibrating nulling {{radiometer}} for non-contact {{temperature measurement}} of an object, {{such as a}} body of water, employs a black body source as a temperature reference, an optomechanical mechanism, e. g., a chopper, to switch {{back and forth between}} measuring the temperature of the black body source and that of a test source, and an infrared detection technique. The radiometer functions by measuring radiance of both the test and the <b>reference</b> black <b>body</b> sources; adjusting the temperature of the <b>reference</b> black <b>body</b> so that its radiance is equivalent to the test source; and, measuring the temperature of the <b>reference</b> black <b>body</b> at this point using a precision contact-type temperature sensor, to determine the radiative temperature of the test source. The radiation from both sources is detected by an infrared detector that converts the detected radiation to an electrical signal that is fed with a chopper reference signal to an error signal generator, such as a synchronous detector, that creates a precision rectified signal that is approximately proportional to the difference between the temperature of the <b>reference</b> black <b>body</b> and that of the test infrared source. This error signal is then used in a feedback loop to adjust the <b>reference</b> black <b>body</b> temperature until it equals that of the test source, at which point the error signal is nulled to zero. The chopper mechanism operates at one or more Hertz allowing minimization of l/f noise. It also provides pure chopping between the black body and the test source and allows continuous measurements...|$|R

The problem is demonstrated experimentally by triangulation measurement of two <b>reference</b> <b>bodies</b> whose geometry reveals systematic measurement errors due to light sheet curvature.
