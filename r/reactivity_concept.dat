40|$|When {{looking back}} {{in the history of}} psychiatry, the concept of {{reactivity}} had very variable impact on ethiological considerations. If classification of mental disorders is taken as a proxy, it seems that this impact is presently at the lowest that {{it has been in the}} last hundred years. The author gives a short historical overview of concept of reactive psychosis, followed by a description of the current state of the art. He pleads for a rethinking of the current position as stated in ICD- 10. Reintroduction of a certain degree of the <b>reactivity</b> <b>concept</b> into the classification seems to be required...|$|E
40|$|UML 2. 0 {{activity}} diagrams (ADs) {{are largely}} {{used as a}} modeling language for flow-oriented behaviors in software and business processes. Unfortunately, their place/transition operational semantics is unable to capture and preserve semantics of the newly defined high-level activities constructs such as Interruptible Activity Region. Particularly, basic Petri nets do not preserve the non-locality semantics and <b>reactivity</b> <b>concept</b> of ADs. This is mainly due {{to the absence of}} global synchronization mechanisms in basic Petri nets. Zero-safe nets are a high-level variant of Petri nets that ensure transitions global coordination thanks to a new kind of places, called zero places. Indeed, zero-safe nets naturally address Interruptible Activity Region that needs a special semantics, forcing the control flow by external events and defining a certain priority level of executions. Therefore, zero-safe nets are adopted in this work as semantic framework for UML 2. 0 activity diagrams. Keywords: UML Activity Diagrams Formalization, Interruptible Activity Region, Zero-Safe Nets.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} vision based control applied to {{autonomous}} mobile robots. The general approach in robot vision separates vision from control (static look and move). An alternative way consists {{to specify the}} problem in terms of control directly into the sensor frame. This approach {{seems to be a}} fruitful way for implementing robotics tasks based on <b>reactivity</b> <b>concept.</b> We introduce a low level task specification by the notion of virtual linkage. This virtual linkage can be expressed by a set of constraints on the motion of a frame linked to the robot with respect to a certain frame associated to the environnment. It seems interesting to apply such a vision based control to a mobile robot. The robot considered here is a two wheels driven nonholonomic cart with a camera mounted on 3 d. o. f manipulator. In this study we consider the whole mechanical system constituted by the cart and its manipulator like a single kinematic chain. So in adding the degrees of freedoom of the arm to the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Gasification of {{carbonaceous}} {{solid fuels}} {{to convert into}} syngas for application of power, liquid fuels and chemicals is practiced worldwide. Coal, biomass and petroleum coke (petcoke) are major feedstock for gasification. Petcoke is a refinery product having high calorific value and low <b>reactivity.</b> The <b>concept</b> of blending of coal/biomass to the low reactive petcoke will make the gasification efficient and profitable and alleviates {{the problems associated with}} petcoke gasification. Co-gasification of petcoke with coal or biomass is advantageous in order to obtain the highest value of products as compared to gasification of petcoke alone. This article reviews the availability of petcoke as gasification feedstock. The challenges in petcoke gasification are indentified. The co-gasification studies are analyzed to understand the advantages of blending the petcoke with coal/biomass for gasification feed. Further, based on gasifier type, co-gasification of petcoke and coal/biomass is analyzed to understand the most efficient process...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the different spin-state crossing scenarios affecting the reactivity of organometallic compounds. It focuses on the effects of crossing spin states in a number of elementary reactions typically observed for organometallic compounds, such as ligand exchange, oxidative addition, reductive elimination, migration/insertion, β-hydride elimination, C-H bond activation and intramolecular electron transfer between a transition metal and a coordinated redox active ligand. These processes are highly relevant for catalysis. To address the influence of the spin-crossing on the reaction rate, Schroder et al. introduced the two-state <b>reactivity</b> (TSR) <b>concept,</b> which applies if the overall kinetics for product formation results from an interplay between the barriers for the spin-inversion and the barriers on the high- and low-spin surfaces. The chapter discusses examples of homogeneous first-row transition metal systems that catalyze (cyclo) oligomerization reactions of alkynes and alkenes, and which undergo a spin-crossing during the catalytic turnover...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental <b>reactivity</b> <b>concepts</b> of {{relevance}} to the reactivity of transition metal surfaces are reviewed using elementary quantum-chemical concepts. The Newns-Anderson tight binding model of chemisorption is presented and subsequently used to outline the electronic structure characteristics of weak versus strong chemisorption. Fundamental concepts such as electron localization and surface complex embedding energies are defined and used to help explain surface reactivity. The emphasis here is on establishing {{an understanding of the}} surface chemical bond as a function of adatom coordination number, degree of coordinative unsaturation of the surface atoms and electron occupation of the d-type valence electron band. We derive from formal chemisorption theory the important relationships that exist between measured chemisorption properties and the average position of the d-valence electron band. The Newns-Anderson model is also used to show the relationship that exists between the d-band center and the coordinative unsaturation of the metal surface atoms. The general conclusion is that for Group VIII metals the shift of the average energy of the surface local density of states correlates with the strength of the interaction of the surface atoms with the metal atoms next to the surface layer. The same model is then used to analyze the Shustorovich bond order conservation model. The BOC or its modern version UBI-QEP is found to be consistent with a surface interaction potential comprised of a two-body repulsive term along with a constant attractive interaction independent of the number of coordinating atoms. The concepts of weak and strong chemisorption provide a very good basis for the subsequent analysis of the Brønsted-Eyring-Polanyi (BEP) relation. The extreme values of the BEP proportionality constant are related to the concept of loose and tight transition states. This proportionality constant between transition state energy and reaction energy can be expressed in parameters from the Newns-Anderson model by identifying loose transition states with intermediates in which the bond to be activated has not yet been broken, whereas in tight transition states this bond can be considered to be broken. We conclude the paper with an analysis of surface reconstruction. The power of the surface-molecule complex view of chemisorption will be quite apparent. The paper has an extensive introductory section to relate the topics of the four sections that follow with important classical catalytic notions...|$|R

Emphasis is put on the investigation of methodological uncertainties in the computation of compact and heterogeneous neutronic system {{on the basis of}} multigroup constants. The measured reactivity value of a tungsten sample is checkedagainst evaluations using given data-sets and with respeet to the validity of resonance treatment. Speelal concern is given to resolving small <b>reactivity</b> ehanges.

40|$|In this paper, an {{innovative}} collaborative data fusion approach to ego-vehicle localization is presented. This approach called Optimized Kalman Swarm (OKS) is a data fusion and filtering method, fusing {{data from a}} low cost GPS, an INS, an Odometer and a Steering wheel angle encoder. The OKS is developed addressing the challenge of managing reactivity and robustness during a real time ego-localization process. For ego-vehicle localization, especially for highly dynamic on-road maneuvers, a filter needs to be robust and reactive at the same time. In these situations, the balance between <b>reactivity</b> and robustness <b>concepts</b> is crucial. The OKS filter represents an intelligent cooperative-reactive localization algorithm inspired by dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). It combines advantages coming from two filters: Particle Filter (PF) and Extended Kalman filter (EKF). The OKS is tested using real embedded sensors data collected in the Satory’s test tracks. The OKS is also compared with both the well-known EKF and the Particle Filters (PF). The results show {{the efficiency of the}} OKS for a high dynamic driving scenario with damaged and low quality GPS data...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{some studies}} have shown high {{efficiencies}} using controlled auto-ignition by blending gasoline and diesel to a desired <b>reactivity.</b> This <b>concept</b> {{has been shown to}} give high efficiency and, because of the largely premixed charge, low emission levels. The origin of this high efficiency, however, has only partly been explained. Part of it was attributed to a lower temperature combustion, originating in lower heat losses. Another part of the gain was attributed to a faster, more Otto-like (i. e. constant volume) combustion. Since the concept was mainly demonstrated on one single test setup so far, an experimental study has been performed to reproduce these results and gain more insight into their origin. Therefore one cylinder of a heavy duty test engine has been equipped with an intake port gasoline injection system, primarily to investigate the effects of the balance between the two fuels, and the timing of the diesel injection. Besides studying trends in the dual-fuel regime, this also allows to find best points to compare with conventional diesel combustion. Results show that compared to more conventional combustion regimes, this dual-fuel concept can escape from the common NOx-smoke trade-off, reducing both to near-zero values. Although hydrocarbon emissions are somewhat increased, indicated efficiencies are significantly improved. The absolute efficiencies are not as high as reported in other work, but the increase does confirm the potential of the concept. The increase in indicated efficiency is shown to originate from a higher thermal efficiency, because short burn durations at high gasoline fractions enable for CA 50 to be phased closer to TDC, without combustion occurring too much before TDC. Pressure rise rates are as low as with conventional diesel combustion, when using the same Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) percentage. Although the dual fuel concept has a much higher rate of heat release, this is phased better after TDC. A dedicated set of experiments has also shown that the late-cycle diesel injection is dominant in combustion phasing and that control has to be found in this diesel injections...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{combined}} experimental and theoretical approach {{to demonstrate how}} lattice strain {{can be used to}} continuously tune the catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on bimetallic nanoparticles that have been dealloyed. The sluggish kinetics of the ORR is a key barrier to the adaptation of fuel cells and currently limits their widespread use. Dealloyed Pt-Cu bimetallic nanoparticles, however, have been shown to exhibit uniquely high reactivity for this reaction. We first present evidence for the formation of a core-shell structure during dealloying, which involves removal of Cu from the surface and subsurface of the precursor nanoparticles. We then show that the resulting Pt-rich surface shell exhibits compressive strain that depends on the composition of the precursor alloy. We next demonstrate the existence of a downward shift of the Pt d-band, resulting in weakening of the bond strength of intermediate oxygenated species due to strain. Finally, we combine synthesis, strain, and catalytic reactivity in an experimental/theoretical reactivity-strain relationship which provides guidelines for the rational design of strained oxygen reduction electrocatalysts. The stoichiometry of the precursor, together with the dealloying conditions, provides experimental control over the resulting surface strain and thereby allows continuous tuning of the surface electrocatalytic <b>reactivity</b> - a <b>concept</b> that can be generalized to other catalytic reactions...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{systems with}} {{integrated}} chemical reactivity and photochromic functions are potentially beneficial {{for the development}} of novel functional materials. Rationally designed photoresponsive compounds can be used to regulate chemical reactivity using light, and such systems could significantly influence both synthesis and drug delivery by increasing efficiency and decreasing undesired side-reactions or side effects. Chemical reactivity can also be employed to control the photochromic behaviour of photoswitches, providing a locking mechanism and enabling chemical detection through facile monitoring. Dithienylethene-based molecular switches are particularly well-suited to the development of functional systems with integrated chemical reactivity functions since they can be toggled between two thermally stable and structurally unique isomers when irradiated with light of the appropriate wavelengths. Dithienylethene derivatives exhibit significant differences between their ring-open and ring-closed forms, which can influence their reactivity. Alternatively, multiple strategies permit the regulation of their photochromic properties through chemical reactions or interactions. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the development of novel approaches to integrate photochromism and chemical <b>reactivity.</b> First, the <b>concept</b> of reactivity-gated photochromism is introduced and demonstrated using a spontaneous and mild chemical reaction. Results show that non photoswitchable molecules can be rendered photoactive by creating the dithienylethene architecture using the Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The use of the dithienylethene architecture as a photocleavable group that combines reactivity-gated photochromism and photogated reactivity is then presented. This approach is based on the Diels-Alder reaction between photostable dienes and dienophiles to generate photoswitchable dithienylethene derivatives. The photoresponsive unit is employed to regulate the reverse cycloaddition, enabling selective and sequential photorelease of the small dienophile auxiliary. Finally, the Lewis acidity of a boron-containing dithienylethene derivative is photomodulated. Upon exposure to light of the appropriate wavelengths, the isomerisation of the dithienylethene backbone causes a bond rearrangement of the 1, 3, 2 -dioxaborole unit, directly affecting the electron density of the boron centre and changing the Lewis acidity of the atom...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of atmospheric aerosol surfaces is currently not well understood. Important remaining questions concern the {{modification of the}} aerosol surfaces during ageing, the removal of trace gases from the gas phase and the processing in the hydrological cycle. Mineral dust and soot have been chosen as typical heterogeneous surfaces, which are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, {{and the role of}} which is still not very well understood. In this work these surfaces have been characterized in terms of two important issues: Hydrophilicity of atmospheric surfaces: Hydrophilicity is a critical but difficult to quantify parameter, characterizing the possibility of aerosol particles to act as cloud/ice condensation nuclei. Therefore, adsorption and desorption rates together with the amount of water adsorbed, are important parameters in the assessment of the hydrophilicity. Regarding this issue we have studied the interaction of mineral dust and kerosene soot surfaces with water vapour in the temperature interval 203 K < T < 298 K using a Knudsen cell reactor. A comparison of the uptake kinetics and adsorption enthalpies of water on mineral dust and soot leads to the conclusion that water is interacting with mineral dust much stronger than with soot. In terms of the hydrophilicity concept the results suggest, that mineral dust may be regarded as hydrophilic whereas soot is hydrophobic and that fundamental kinetic and thermo-chemical parameters may be used to quantify this <b>concept.</b> <b>Reactivity</b> of atmospheric surfaces: We have investigated two different types of soot samples (kerosene and ethene) and their behaviour towards NO 2 and SO 2 (as typical atmospheric pollutants) in a wide temperature interval between 180 K < T < 670 K. It has been found that under these conditions SO 2 undergoes only reversible adsorption/desorption on the surface, whereas for temperatures above 300 K NO 2 adsorbs irreversibly on the surface and reacts further leading to the formation of NO and HONO as gas phase products with strongly temperature dependent yields. Complementary, for temperatures above 470 K, the formation of CO 2 as gas phase product is observed. For the mechanistic interpretation of the reaction we have found that NO 2 adsorbs irreversibly on the surface, followed by further formation of HONO or reduction to NO (depending on temperature). Additionally, due to the reduction to NO, a new oxidised surface site is formed at higher temperatures, which releases CO 2 into the gas phase, indicating the ability of NO 2 to oxidize the soot sample followed by the consumption of soot...|$|R
