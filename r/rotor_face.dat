The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals.

50|$|The {{yaw drive}} is an {{important}} component of the horizontal axis wind turbines' yaw system.

This only applies for wind turbines with a horizontal axis rotor. The wind turbine is said to have a yaw error if the rotor is not aligned to the wind. A yaw error implies that a lower share of the energy in the wind will be running through the rotor area. (The generated energy will be proportional the cosine of the yaw error).|$|R

The rear suspension geometry was revised for better handling, and the final-drive-gear ratio on manual transmission cars was shortened from 4.444 to 4.777 for improved off-the-line performance. While minimal, these changes gave the updated RX-8 increased acceleration and performance. Mazda engineers claimed that the 2nd generation RX-8 was (slightly) faster than the previous generation due to the lower gearing and improved suspension. The Renesis II motor iteration that launched with the 2009 model year included a third oil injection port in each rotor housing to feed oil {{to the middle of}} the <b>rotor</b> <b>facing,</b> making this their first all new EMOP (Electric Metering Oil Pump) with a total of 6 lubrication injectors, plus an all new engine oil pump.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 81 - 92 The {{design of}} a 66, 000 hp {{electric}} motor to drive an air compressor presented significant design challenges. Using conventional assumptions in assessing the bearing support and foundation stiffness yielded a scenario {{where it would be}} impractical to achieve a 20 percent separation margin between operating speed and the lateral critical speeds of the motor. Structural stiffnesses well above conventional values were required in order to achieve the specified separation margin. Finite element studies were performed on the bearing pedestals and motor base. As a result of the studies, it was deemed necessary to perform a modal finite element study on the complete motor assembly. Eventually, it was decided that a modal analysis would be performed on the entire drive train (motor, gear, compressor, and foundation). These studies confirmed that the structural stiffness needed was achievable. Factory and field tests substantiated the analysis. Another challenge in this design was the ability of the motor to accelerate a drive train with a polar inertia in excess of 355, 000 lb? -ft^ 2. The rotor construction is such {{that there is not a}} discrete amortisseur. On startup, currents are induced in the <b>rotor</b> pole <b>face,</b> which lead to significant heating. Surface temperatures in excess of 400 ?C (750 ?F) were calculated. Plastic deformation of the <b>rotor</b> pole <b>face</b> will occur at this temperature due to large thermal strains. Consistency of the shaft forging mechanical properties is paramount if shaft bending is to be avoided. A stringent forging specification was written, which limited the number of forging suppliers who could meet the requirements. Finite element studies were performed to calculate the stresses and plastic strains. High temperature mechanical testing was performed on the forging material to confirm that the stress-strain hysteresis loop would close after repeated cycling. Furthermore, care needed to be taken to ensure that the rotor winding and insulation system was protected from damaging temperatures. Once again, factory and field test confirmed the analytical work...|$|R

One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points.

This study incorporates an atmospheric turbulence model, a rotor mean flow contraction model and a rapid distortion turbulence model which together determine the statistics of the non-isotropic turbulence at the rotor plane. Inputs to the combined mean inflow and turbulence models are controlled by atmospheric wind characteristics and helicopter operating conditions. A generalized acoustic source model was used to predict the far field noise generated by the non-isotropic flow incident on the rotor. Absolute levels for acoustic spectra and directivity patterns were calculated for full scale helicopters, without the use of empirical or adjustable constants. Comparisons between isotropic and non-isotropic turbulence at the <b>rotor</b> <b>face</b> demonstrated pronounced differences in acoustic spectra.

40|$|Arguably one of {{the most}} {{significant}} contributions to the field of optimal control has been the formulation and eventual solution of the H∞ design problem. Armed with this mathematical tool, designs which are robust to plant uncertainty and insensitive to plant parameters can be performed in a systematic and rigorous fashion. The H∞ methodology, however, typically leads to conservative designs. The reasons are twofold. The first is that the plant uncertainty can only be accounted for in an approximate manner, with the result that designs are performed for a set of allowable systems which is larger than what is being modeled; thus the resulting control strategy is forced to guard against non-realizable situations, potentially sacrificing system performance. The second has to do with the physical interpretation of H∞ optimization: the minimization of a system's power to power gain. Thus it is implicitly assumed in the design process that the worst case disturbance is allowed to be an arbitrary power signal, such as a sinusoid. This is clearly a poor modeling choice for many types of physical disturbances, such as sensor or thermal noise, wind gusts, and impulsive forces. The main contribution of this dissertation is the extension of H∞ optimization to allow for general closed loop design objectives which address the two limitations outlined above. In particular, non-conservative, computationally tractable, linear matrix inequality based methods for control design are developed for a certain class of physically motivated uncertain systems. In addition, these new techniques can accommodate constraints on the allowable disturbances, excluding unrealistic disturbances from the design process. Another contribution of this dissertation is an attempt to view control in the broader context of system design. Typically, a control algorithm is only sought after the system to be controlled has already been designed, and the type and location of the actuators and sensors has been determined. For most applications, however, the level of performance which can be attained by any control strategy is dictated by the dynamics of the plant. Thus from a system level, the above methodology is not optimal, since the control design process is decoupled from the design of the rest of the system. By adopting the behavioral framework for systems, an optimization problem where the given system is not treated as an input-output operator, a natural assumption when considering first principles models, is formulated and solved. The interpretation of the above extension of H∞ optimization is that of designing optimal systems. In contrast to the general purpose tools developed in the first part of the dissertation and summarized above, the second part deals with an actual experimental problem, that of controlling rotating stall using pulsed air injection in a low-speed, axial flow compressor. By modeling the injection of air as an unsteady shift in the compressor characteristic, the viability of various air injection orientations are established. A control strategy is developed which controls the pulsing of air in front of the <b>rotor</b> <b>face</b> based on unsteady pressure measurements near the <b>rotor</b> <b>face.</b> Experimental results show that this technique eliminates the hysteresis loop normally associated with rotating stall. A parametric study is used to determine the optimal control parameters for suppression of stall. The resulting control strategy is also shown to suppress surge when a plenum is present. Using a high fidelity model, the main features of the experimental results are duplicated via simulations. The main contributions of this part of the dissertation are a simple control scheme which has the potential of greatly increasing the operability of compressors, and a low-order modeling mechanism which captures the essential features of air injection, facilitating subsequent analyses and control designs which make use of air injectors. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{unique set of}} {{vibration}} sensors {{was designed}} that incorporate the fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FFPI) and permanent magnets. Feasibility of the design and its advantages over traditional sensors were verified by experiments. The new sensors consist of one that monitors the motion of a body across an air gap with the other designed {{to respond to the}} motion while in contact with the vibrating body. The FFPI is the device used to transmit the vibrational response while permanent magnets are used to transfer the vibratory motion to the FFPI. In the non-contacting sensor, a permanent magnet was used as the motive to transfer the vibratory motion to be registered at the FFPI. Although the magnet resulted in a non-linear response, the effect of the non-linearity can be removed by signal processing. The fiber optic gap sensor (FOGS) developed has a sensitivity of 250 mV/mil for a 30 mil gap to 50 mV/mil for a 65 mil gap and a dynamic range up to 820 Hz. An advantage of the FOGS over traditional eddy current based gap sensors (ECP), for measuring rotor vibration, was demonstrated with a test <b>rotor</b> <b>face</b> that had brass strips attached to it. The FOGS response was not affected by the strips whereas the response of the traditional ECP was greatly affected by the strips. This demonstrated the potential of the FOGS for measuring the motion of a coated shaft. The fiber optic vibration sensor (FOVS) had a marginal response as its construction led to spurious signals. The feasibility of it to act as a vibration sensor, however, was demonstrated. Due to problems in maintaining the proper gap between the proof mass and sensor head during assembly the natural frequency of the FOVS was around 31 Hz and not the targeted 10 Hz. The sensors presented were meant to be a first generation. However, access to additional FFPI elements was restricted limiting further development. Improvements to the sensors would be to modify the sensing head, magnet size, and the embedment of the FFPI as well as to employ tighter machining precision and assembly practices...|$|E

40|$|This {{effort is}} to develop large {{diameter}} (22 - 36 inch) Aspirating Seals for application in aircraft engines. Stein Seal Co. will be fabricating the 36 -inch seal(s) for testing. GE's task {{is to establish a}} thorough understanding of the operation of Aspirating Seals through analytical modeling and full-scale testing. The two primary objectives of this project are to develop the analytical models of the aspirating seal system, to upgrade using GE's funds, GE's 50 -inch seal test rig for testing the Aspirating Seal (back-to-back with a corresponding brush seal), test the aspirating seal(s) for seal closure, tracking and maneuver transients (tilt) at operating pressures and temperatures, and validate the analytical model. The objective of the analytical model development is to evaluate the transient and steady-state dynamic performance characteristics of the seal designed by Stein. The transient dynamic model uses a multi-body system approach: the Stator, Seal face and the rotor are treated as individual bodies with relative degrees of freedom. Initially, the thirty-six springs are represented as a single one trying to keep open the aspirating face. Stops (Contact elements) are provided between the stator and the seal (to compensate the preload in the fully-open position) and between the <b>rotor</b> <b>face</b> and Seal face (to detect rub). The secondary seal is considered as part of the stator. The film's load, damping and stiffness characteristics as functions of pressure and clearance are evaluated using a separate (NASA) code GFACE. Initially, a laminar flow theory is used. Special two-dimensional interpolation routines are written to establish exact film load and damping values at each integration time step. Additionally, other user-routines are written to read-in actual pressure, rpm, stator-growth and rotor growth data and, later, to transfer these as appropriate loads/motions in the system-dynamic model. The transient dynamic model evaluates the various motions, clearances and forces as the seals are subjected to different aircraft maneuvers: Windmilling restart; start-ground idle; ground idle-takeoff; takeoff-burst chop, etc. Results of this model show that the seal closes appropriately and does not ram into the rotor for all of the conditions analyzed.

Induction motors are {{the most}} preferred electrical motor because of their low cost, reasonable size and low maintenance. Besides all these advantages, induction motors can be operated under many stresses such as, thermal, electrical, mechanical and environmental impacts. Hence, induction motors are used in many applications of daily life and industry. The failure analysis of these machines has been researched by many years in terms of mechanical, electrical, etc. Eccentricity constitutes {{a significant portion of}} the faults related to induction motors. Eccentricity is the condition of non-uniform air gap that exists between the stator and rotor. There are three types of eccentricity; static eccentricity, dynamic eccentricity and mixed eccentricity that is combination of former two. The stator is centered on first axis and the rotor is centered on second axis. In a healthy machine, first and second axes are coincident. Static eccentricity occurs when second axis is the center of rotation. If the first axis is center of rotation, the dynamic eccentricity occurs at this time. Besides, if the center of rotation can be anywhere between first and second axes, the mixed eccentricity appear to be a problem. The non-uniformity of the air gap of an induction motor depends on design features, manufacturing process and operating conditions. The asymmetric operational conditions of induction motors are connected with bearing fault, stator windings fault, broken rotor, cracked end ring and eccentricity related faults. The causes of the misalignment of the rotor as follows; the rotor center is not being at the center of the stator (bearing fault), the stator bore and <b>rotor</b> <b>face</b> are not perfectly cylindrical, bent rotor shaft, bearing wear or mechanical resonance at critical speed. These faults produce that the differences of characteristics of motor parameters as follows; non-stable air gap voltage and line current, unbalanced air gap flux density, increase in pulsating torque, decrease in average torque, reduction in efficiency (increase in losses), over heating and increase in noise level. In most of the literature, the studies are relevant to which parameters should be monitored for the detection of eccentricity in consideration of analytical calculations. The thesis presents the dynamic model of the induction motor and shows the deviation in the magnetic flux, the current and the torque values. Faulty conditions are investigated for static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity. The air gap flux density and its harmonic components are researched for healthy and asymmetric operational conditions. Therefore, the change in the harmonic components with increasing of eccentricity is analyzed. A 2. 2 kW, 4 pole, 50 Hz, delta connected squirrel cage induction motor is used in this thesis. The finite element method (FEM) is used for the analysis as a numerical method. FEM expresses a physical system in terms of mathematical quantities. Besides, it is a model that could be decomposed into sub-elements and have material properties and applicable boundary conditions. Unknown quantities with finite number are obtained by using known quantities of system. In thesis, the dynamic model of the induction motor is created for healthy and eccentric condition by changing the air gap. After verification of the healthy model respect to the experimental results, the flux density, current and torque characteristics of the eccentric models are examined. The test motor has 3 phase, 4 poles, 36 slots and 28 rotor bars. Firstly, the motor is modeled for the rated operation condition with no eccentricity. The eccentricity is modeled by shifting the rotor position and defining the axes of rotation. The non-uniform air gap is obtained in order to analysis the asymmetric operational conditions. The uniformity of the air gap width is corrupted with eccentricity. Consequently the air gap flux density will be different than the one in the healthy condition. Therefore, the higher air gap flux density values appear in points where air gap width is smaller and lower values appear where air gap width is larger, similarly. The harmonic spectrum is obtained in order to investigate the eccentricity effect on the air gap flux density. When fundamental component is decreasing with eccentricity fault, the high frequency components increase. As the eccentricity increases, the magnitude of the harmonic permeance waves due to eccentricity will increase. The flux density distribution in the air gap is found as the product of the permeance and the magnetomotive force (MMF), so, when the harmonic permeance waves due to eccentricity increases, the magnitude of harmonic components of air gap flux density will also increase as shown in simulation results. Therefore, pulsation of torque increases. The peak values of torque increase with eccentricity about 1 %. Besides, the torque ripple increases 1 ~ 14 % with increasing of eccentricity. In addition, eccentricity is investigated in terms of mechanical parameters such as vibration and noise with using experimental setup. The two different asymmetrical condition and healthy condition of motor are tested. In this way, the vibration level of asymmetric operational conditions increase % 8. 5 compared to the healthy conditon. In conclusion, in this thesis, the dynamic model of the induction motor is modeled with uniform and non-uniform air gaps. The results for the healthy model are verified the rated values of the motor. After the verification of the motor parameters, the motor geometry is redesigned for static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity condition. Changing of the air gap flux density is illustrated for eccentric conditions. The decreasing of fundamental component and the increasing of high frequency components with increasing the percentage of eccentricity are observed. The effects of eccentricity on the air gap flux distribution, current and torque characteristics are investigated with simulation results. Besides, the effects on vibration and noise are observed with test results. Therefore, the monitoring methods of eccentricity are studied in terms of different parameters, for instance; air gap flux density, harmonic components, current, moment and vibration. Yüksek LisansM.

This paper, intended as an essential guide for the practical parallel beam laser vibrometer practioner, presents exact mathematical expressions for measured angular velocity in the presence of inevitable misalignments and estimates the likely measurement error levels due to such misalignments as well as to other sources of uncertainty through numerical simulation. Cross-sensitivity to the orthogonal vibration component, i. e. cross-sensitivity in a pitch measurement to yaw motion and vice-versa, is confirmed for rough rotors whereas it is shown not to be present when rotors are polished-circular. A complementary experimental investigation of the relationship between surface roughness and cross-sensitivity confirms the identification of two preferred measurement configurations: from the side of a polished-circular rotor and from the end face of a (rough) rotor coated in retro-reflective tape. Rotors with surface roughness up to 50 nm satisfy the former case provided the vibration displacement at the rotor surface does not exceed 20 % beam diameter. For surfaces with roughness of 10 nm this can be extended to 50 %. For rough <b>rotor</b> end <b>face</b> measurements, post-processing is required to resolve the inherent cross-sensitivity; the need for post-processing is justified quantitatively through numerical simulation. Further simulations incorporating typical levels of instrument misalignment and measurement noise are used to enable quantification of the likely errors in such angular vibration measurements. For measurements from the side of a polished-circular rotor, errors are around 1 % for amplitude and 10 mrad at integer orders affected by pseudo-vibration and around one-third of these levels elsewhere. For measurements from a rough <b>rotor</b> end <b>face,</b> errors will be similar at integer orders (from 2). Errors in the rotational speed measurement, required for post-processing, must be minimised in order to limit errors up to 2 nd order while misalignments determine errors at around 0. 4 % amplitude and 4 mrad phase at orders above 2 other than at the integer orders...|$|R
50|$|Brushless motors can be {{constructed}} in several different physical configurations: In the 'conventional' (also known as inrunner) configuration, the permanent magnets {{are part of the}} rotor. Three stator windings surround the rotor. In the outrunner (or external-rotor) configuration, the radial-relationship between the coils and magnets is reversed; the stator coils form the center (core) of the motor, while the permanent magnets spin within an overhanging rotor which surrounds the core. The flat or axial flux type, used where there are space or shape limitations, uses stator and <b>rotor</b> plates, mounted <b>face</b> to face. Outrunners typically have more poles, set up in triplets to maintain the three groups of windings, and have a higher torque at low RPMs. In all brushless motors, the coils are stationary.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the main features}} of a 100 kVA high temperature superconducting (HTS) demonstrator generator, which is designed and being built at the University of Southampton. The generator is a 2 -pole synchronous machine with a conventional 3 -phase stator and a HTS rotor operating in the temperature range 57 – 77 K using either liquid nitrogen down to 65 K or liquid air down to 57 K. Liquid air has not been used before in the refrigeration of HTS devices but has recently been commercialised by BOC as a safe alternative to nitrogen for use in freezing of food. The generator will use an existing stator with a bore of 330 mm. The rotor is designed with a magnetic core (invar) to reduce the magnetising current and {{the field in the}} coils. For ease of manufacture, a hybrid salient pole construction is used, and the superconducting winding consists of twelve 50 -turn identical flat coils. Magnetic invar rings will be used between adjacent HTS coils of the winding to divert the normal component of the magnetic field away from the Bi 2223 superconducting tapes. To avoid excessive eddy-current losses in the <b>rotor</b> pole <b>faces,</b> a cold copper screen will be placed around the rotor core to exclude ac magnetic fields...|$|R
40|$|THE recent {{trend in}} wind energy industry, with the {{increasing}} deployment of offshore wind farms, has revived the interest {{in the concept of}} a vertical axis wind turbine. The scientific, technological and economical challenges of the next generation of wind turbines indicate that a transformative approach is the key for the reduction of the cost of energy. The adaptation of current designs and practice {{may not be the best}} solution to <b>face</b> <b>rotor</b> up-scaling, wind farmlosses, floating support structures and improved reliability. In this context, the vertical axis wind turbine has the potential to respond to someof the new environment’s challenges.

40|$|A rotary latch is disclosed, {{including}} a hollow, cylindrical outer member and a concentrically arranged inner rotor. The rotor is rotatable within the outer cylindrical member. The outer cylindrical member includes {{a pair of}} aligned openings as a cylinder first end facing a latch pin. The rotor includes a pair of aligned slots at a <b>rotor</b> first end <b>facing</b> the latch pin. Slot extensions are provided in the rotor, the slot extensions extending generally perpendicularly to the slots and generally parallel to the rotor first end. In a first position, the outer cylindrical member openings and the rotor slots are aligned to allow receipt of the latch pin.

40|$|Fault {{detection}} and isolation (FDI) in <b>rotor</b> systems often <b>faces</b> {{the problem that}} the system dynamics {{is dependent on the}} rotor rotary frequency because of the gyroscopic effect. In unbalance excited rotor systems, the continuously distributed unbalances are hard to be determined or estimated accurately. The unbalance forces as disturbances make fault detection more complicated. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop linear time invariant (LTI) FDI methods (i. e., with constant parameters) for rotor systems under consideration of gyroscopic effect and disturbances. Two approaches to describe the gyroscopic effect, that is, as unknown inputs and as model uncertainties, are investigated. Based on these two approaches, FDI methods are developed and the results are compared regarding the resulting FDI performances. Results are obtained by the application in a rotor test rig. Restrictions for the application of these methods are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|There {{are other}} {{undesirable}} rotor axis configurations apart from saturation, notably anti-parallel alignments. [...] For example, if a spacecraft with two dual-gimbal CMGs {{gets into a}} state in which one rotor spin axis is facing directly forward, while the other <b>rotor</b> spin is <b>facing</b> directly aft (i.e. anti-parallel to the first), then all roll control will be lost. [...] This happens {{for the same reason}} as for saturation; the rotors can only produce gyroscopic torques at right angles to their spin axes, and here these torques will have no fore-and-aft components and so no influence on roll. [...] However, in this case the CMGs are not saturated at all; their angular momenta are equal and opposite, so the total stored angular momentum adds up to zero. Just as for saturation, however, and for exactly the same reasons, roll control will become increasingly difficult if the CMGs even approach anti-parallel alignment.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{is to improve the}} accuracy of Actuator Line Modeling (ALM) in predicting the unsteady aerodynamic loadings on turbine blades and turbine wake by assessing different methods used to determine the relative velocity between the rotating blades and wind. ALM is incorporated into a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) solver in OpenFOAM (Open Field Operations and Manipulations). The aerodynamic loadings are validated by experiment results from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Turbine wakes are validated by predictions of large eddy simulation using exact 3 D blade geometries from a two-blade NREL Phase VI turbine. Three different relative velocity calculation methods are presented: iterative process in Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory, local velocity sampling, and Lagrange-Euler Interpolation (LEI). Loadings and wakes obtained from these three methods are compared. It is discovered that LEI functions better than the conventional BEM with iterative process in both loading and wake prediction. Then LES-ALM with LEI is performed on a small wind farm deploying five NREL Phase VI turbines in full wake setting. The power outputs and force coefficients of downstream turbines are evaluated. The LES-ALM with LEI is also performed on a small wind farm deploying 25 NREL Phase VI turbines with different inflow angles (from full wake setting to partial wake setting). The power outputs and force coefficients of each turbine are evaluated under different inflow angles (the angle the rotor has to turn to make the <b>rotor</b> plane <b>face</b> the incoming wind) (0, 5, 15, 30 and 45 degree). The power coefficient distributions and thrust coefficient distributions of the wind farm under each inflow angle are compared. The range of inflow angle which is best for power generation is also discussed. The results demonstrate that the LES-ALM with LEI has the potential to optimize wind farm arrangement and pitch angle of individual turbines. ...|$|R
50|$|The process {{involves}} {{cycling the}} coupling {{a number of}} times at a lower inertia, lower speed or a combination of both. Burnishing can require anywhere from 20 to over 100 cycles depending upon the size of a coupling and the amount of initial torque required. For bearing mounted couplings, where the rotor and armature are connected and held in place via a bearing, burnishing does not have to take place on the machine. It can be done individually on a bench or in a group burnishing station. If a clutch has a separate armature and rotor (two piece unit) burnishing is done as a matched set, to make sure proper torque is achieved. Similarly, two-piece brakes that have separate armatures should be burnished on a machine rather than a bench because any change in the mounting tolerance as that brake is mounted to the machine may shift the alignment so the burnishing lines on the armature, <b>rotor</b> or brake <b>face</b> may be off, slightly preventing that brake from achieving full torque. Again, the difference is only slight so this would only be required in a very torque sensitive application.|$|R
40|$|Wear {{and failure}} of {{mechanical}} seals may be critical in certain application {{and should be}} avoided. Large relative misalignment between the seal faces {{is the most likely}} cause for intermittent contact and the increased friction that eventually brings failure. Adjustment of seal clearance is probably the most readily implemented method of reducing the relative misalignment and the elimination of seal face contact during its operation. This method is demonstrated {{with the aid of a}} noncontacting flexibly mounted <b>rotor</b> (FMR) mechanical <b>face</b> seal test rig employing a cascade control scheme. Eddy current proximity probes measure the seal clearance directly. The inner loop controls the clearance, maintaining a desired gap through adjusting the air pressure in the rotor chamber of the seal. When contact is detected the outer loop adjusts the clearance set point according to variance differences in the probes signals. These differences in variance have been found to be a reliable quantitative indication for such contacts. They are complimentary to other more qualitative phenomenological indications, and provide the controlled variable data for the outer loop. Experiments are conducted to test and verify this active control scheme and strategy. Analysis and results both show that contrary to intuition for the seal under investigation reducing seal clearance can eliminate contact and the outer cascade loop indeed drives the control toward this solution. 1...|$|R
