5|$|In 1959, the Marvell Press {{published}} Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived (Listen LPV1), an LP {{record on}} which Larkin recites all the poems from The Less Deceived {{in the order}} they appear in the printed volume.

Once again the poems are read in {{the order in which}} they appear in the printed volume, but with Larkin including introductory <b>remarks</b> <b>to</b> many of the poems. A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection, High Windows, was published in 1975 as British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems read by the author (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202).

5|$|Oxford {{began the}} next season with a new manager and a new stadium, with the {{relocation}} to the Kassam Stadium completed {{after six years of}} speculation. Former Liverpool and England defender Mark Wright was given the manager's job, but resigned in late November, after being accused of making racist <b>remarks</b> <b>to</b> referee Joe Ross. Wright's successor, Ian Atkins, was unable to make an immediate impact and Oxford finished in 21st position in the league, at the time their lowest-ever league position. United missed out on the play-off places the following season, by one place and one point. Fifteen wins {{at the start of the}} 2003–04 season saw Oxford top of the table at the end of January. However, Ian Atkins was sacked in March after agreeing to take charge at rivals Bristol Rovers. His replacement, Graham Rix, could only manage a ninth-place finish at the end of the season, and was sacked the following November. Oxford replaced him with Argentine Ramón Díaz, who managed the team to a mid-table finish. Diaz and his team of assistants left the club at the beginning of May 2005, after being banned from the ground by the chairman following failed negotiations. During his time at the club, Diaz brought in a number of South American players including his own sons, and Juan Pablo Raponi. Ex-England midfielder and former West Bromwich Albion manager Brian Talbot signed a two-year contract to replace Rix. Talbot found little success and was sacked in March 2006, with the club in 22nd place. He was replaced by youth team coach Darren Patterson.|$|E
