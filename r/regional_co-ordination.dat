With the objective of analyzing the possibilities and limits of these actions, this research approached the experience of local implementation of the program at Manguinhos, RJ. Through the methodological strategy of case-study, semi-structured interviews with managers and professionals of the health, welfare and education areas were done and local observation. Besides, a documental survey was done, privileging the consultation of the legislation and of the program official documents, during the years of 2007 and 2008. The analysis of Bolsa Fam??lia implementation process at Manguinhos showed that the creation of local instances as the Intermanaging Group and the Decentralized Group made feasible partnerships and interlocution referring to the construction of common initiatives between health, education and welfare municipal departments. However, the vertical and horizontal communication between the sectors and the local key-actors continued fragile.

40|$|The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), is {{a highly}} {{invasive}} global pest. It has been just over twenty years since Argentine ants were fi rst discovered in New Zealand.

This review provides a short history of Argentine ant invasion within New Zealand and research conducted to date.

40|$|Schistosomiasis is {{a disease}} caused by {{parasitic}} worms known as schistosomes, which infect about 200 million people worldwide. In the Philippines, as in China, the species of schistosome (Schistosoma japonicum) which causes the disease infects not only humans, but also many other species of mammals. In China, bovines {{are thought to be}} particularly important for harboring and transmitting S. japonicum, whereas in the Philippines infections in bovines are relatively rare. However, dogs, rats and pigs are often infected with S. japonicum in the Philippines, although the extent to which infections in these animals may give rise to human infections is unclear. To help answer this question, we characterized the genetic variation of the parasite in Samar province of the Philippines, and found that S. japonicum samples from humans, dogs, rats and pigs were genetically very similar, with no significant genetic difference between samples from humans and dogs. This suggests that in the Philippines this parasite is frequently transmitted between different mammalian species, particularly between dogs and humans. Reducing levels of infections in dogs may therefore help to reduce infections in humans. The results also suggest high levels of transmission between geographic areas, thus <b>regional</b> <b>co-ordination</b> of treatment programs is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Food labels {{describe}} {{the content of}} a food and are intended to guide the consumer in food selection. The nutrition information provided must be in consistency with legal requirements and dietary recommendations. Selection of the specific nutrients or food components to be listed should further take into account label space, the analytical feasibility of measuring the particular nutritional component within the food matrix, and the relative costs of such analyses. Information provided on labels should be truthful and not mislead consumers. At the same time, labeling regulations should provide incentives to manufacturers to develop products that promote public health and assist consumers in following dietary recommendations. In some countries some {{segments of the population}} benefit from information about the composition of foods. In such cases, countries should consider the need to provide for appropriate labeling and its presentation relative to existing regulations. Different approaches and legal requirements have been established. These create difficulties in developing and harmonizing labels, which have broad international applications. For these reasons, the Codex Guidelines on food labeling play an important role to provide guidance to member countries when they want to develop or update their national regulations and to encourage harmonization of national with international standards. These Guidelines are based on the principle that no food should be described or presented {{in a manner that is}} false, misleading or deceptive.

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of quality of}} economic data is a relevant issue that has been raised by several working groups and by different bodies (first of all STECF and RCMs). This issue also affects end users that {{should be aware of}} the reliability of data used in the analysis. The new Data Collection Framework establishes the list of economic variables to be collected for the total fleets and for the fleet segments. It also requires Member States to describe the methodologies applied for the data collection and to give information on the quality (accuracy and precision) of estimates. Thus, SGECA 09 - 02 was asked to give appropriate recommendations and proposals in order to homogenise the presentation of National Programmes and also in order to facilitate the STECF task to evaluate the quality of the data collected by the Member States. Moreover, the <b>Regional</b> <b>Co-ordination</b> Meetings held in 2008 identified several issues within the new DCF requiring further work or clarification. Thus, this report reflects the reviews and discussions on the most frequently applied methodologies to collect economic variables for fleet segments and the common approaches proposed to assess data quality.

It is against this backdrop that SACCAR has adopted networking as a strategy to achieve strong coordination and collaboration among SADC member states for regional Development and advancement in agriculture. The SADC Animal Agriculture Research Network (SAARNET) was therefore formed in 1997 as a joint effort between SACCAR and International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) to {{provide the framework for}} <b>regional</b> <b>co-ordination</b> and collaboration in animal agriculture. SAARNET as a regional network aims at promoting partnerships between different stakeholders (institutes, governments, donors, farmers and research disciplines) to solve common problems. Partnerships will be strengthened between stakeholders through participatory approaches (workshops, seminars, field days and training sessions) to plan and prioritise activities, and share information, technology, and materials. The organisation and operation of a collaborative research network such as SAARNET is very challenging thou rewarding. It is therefore critical that the institutional framework and activities of the research network are clearly related to the needs and goals of all its stakeholders, including the farmer. Also crucial {{to the success of the}} network are simple but efficient mechanisms for co-ordination, information dissemination, monitoring and evaluation, and impact assessment.

40|$|The paper agues that {{experience}} and empirical evidence {{have shown that}} Africa’straditional trade-focused model of regional integration has failed not only in promotingintra-regional and African trade but also economic growth. However, regional integrationremains a basic ingredient towards the attainment of high and sustainable economic growthin the continent. To realize this potential, there is therefore, the need to search for newmodalities of regionalism that lean more towards co-operation, less rigidity and morepragmatism. The paper suggests that the principles of variable geometry and subsidiaritycould be usefully applied in this more pragmatic modality for defining the functions andpowers of the various layers of the new regional co-operation institutions. The principle ofvariable geometry permits integration to proceed {{on the basis of}} progressive steps, allowingsmaller sub-groups to move faster than the whole group while providing that many decisionsbe made by the majority rather than by consensus. On the other hand, the subsidiarityprinciple provides a clearer basis for distributing powers and responsibilities across severallayers (from national to regional) of the organizational structure of a regional integrationscheme according to the comparative advantage of each in respect of the different functions. These new co-operation arrangements have important contributions to make in helping todevelop African infrastructure and thus in reducing the region’s unusually high transactionscosts, which inhibit trade, investment, and economic growth. They could also play a majorrole by assisting African countries to establish a stable macroeconomic policy environmentthrough <b>regional</b> <b>co-ordination</b> and harmonization of macroeconomic and sectoral policies,trade, and growth- and investment-enhancing institutions. In addition, in an era ofglobalization, the multilateral approach to the fuller integration of African countries into theglobal economy is a sine qua non. To derive the most benefit from this approach, Africancountries must not only participate more actively and effectively in the World TradeOrganization (WTO) process, they also need to accept and implement appropriate tariffbindingobligations. ...|$|E
