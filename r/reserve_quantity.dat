40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} whether oil and gas producing companies smooth their ending <b>reserve</b> <b>quantities.</b> Smoothing is defined as a reduction in variance in the trend of ending <b>reserve</b> <b>quantities</b> over time compared to the trend of ending <b>reserve</b> <b>quantities</b> less the hypothesized smoothing variable over time. This study focuses on two variables that are most susceptible to manipulation—revisions of previous estimates and additions. This study also examines whether revisions are positively or negatively biased and the variability of the revisions. The sample consists of 70 companies chosen from oil & Gas Reserve Disclosures: 1980 - 1984 Survey of 400 Public Companies by Arthur Andersen and Company. For each company, ending <b>reserve</b> <b>quantities</b> for the years 1978 - 1984 were regressed over time, and the standard deviation of the estimate (SDE) was calculated. Then the ending <b>reserve</b> <b>quantities</b> less the hypothesized smoothing variable were regressed over time, and the SDE was calculated. A linear model and a semi-logarithmic model were used. A smoothing ratio (SR) was determined by dividing the SDE of reserves less the hypothesized smoothing variable by the SDE of ending <b>reserve</b> <b>quantities.</b> An SR greater than one indicates smoothing, and an SR less than one indicates that smoothing did not occur. The mean percentage revision and a t-test were used to test for positive or negative bias in the revisions. The mean absolute percentage revision was used to assess the relative variability of revisions. The number of companies classified as smoothers of oil reserves was statistically significant for the semi-logarithmic model but not for the linear model. Under both models the number of companies classified as smoothers of gas reserves was statistically significant. Few companies had mean percentage revisions that were significantly different from zero. The majority of companies had mean absolute revisions of under ten percent...|$|R

To do that we extend the competing auction framework (McAfee, 1993; Peters and Severinov, 1997) in several ways: we allow buyers to choose {{how much money they}} bring to an auction; the quantities produced and traded are divisible; we let sellers charge a fee, either positive or negative, to buyers participating to their auction. Two different specifications of the model are considered. In the first model, sellers post a quantity they wish to sell, a reserve price and a fee, and allow the price to be determined by auctions. In the second model, sellers post a price, a <b>reserve</b> <b>quantity</b> and a fee and allow the quantity to be determined by auctions. When buyers bid prices, the existence of a monetary equilibrium requires that money growth not be too high. Marginal increments in money growth decrease the equilibrium posted quantity and buyers’ participation. Sellers charge a positive fee when inflation is low but subsidize buyers when inflation is high. Symmetric efficiency is attained at the Friedman rule where sellers post the efficient quantity and charge no fee to buyers. Whe...|$|E

The proposed market-based mechanism allows the SMO to control the behavior of internal loads through price signals and to provide feedback to the ISO. A regulation service reserves quantity is transacted between the SMO and the ISO for a relatively {{long period of time}} (e. g., a one hour long time-scale). During this period the ISO follows shorter time-scale stochastic dynamics to repeatedly request from the SMO to decrease or increase its consumption. We model the operational task of selecting an optimal short time-scale dynamic pricing policy as a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes average SMO and ISO utility. We then formulate an associated non-linear programming static problem that provides an upper bound on the optimal utility. We study an asymptotic regime in which this upper bound is shown to be tight and the static policy provides an efficient approximation of the dynamic pricing policy. Equally importantly, this framework allows us to optimize the long time-scale decision of determining the optimal regulation service <b>reserve</b> <b>quantity.</b> We demonstrate, verify and validate the proposed approach through a series of Monte Carlo simulations of the controlled system time trajectories.

40|$|Monetary {{policy is}} one of the two {{principal}} means (the other being fiscal policy) by which government authorities in a market economy regularly influence the pace and direction of overall economic activity, importantly including not only the level of aggregate output and employment but also the general rate at which prices rise or fall. The ability of central banks to carry out monetary policy stems from their monopoly position as suppliers of their own liabilities, which banks in turn need (either as legally required reserves or as balances for settling interbank claims) in order to create the money and credit used in everyday economic transactions. Important developments both in research and in the actual conduct of monetary policy in recent decades have revolved around the choice of a short-term interest rate versus a <b>reserve</b> <b>quantity</b> as the central bank's direct operating instrument, whether to use some measure of money as an intermediate target, whether to constrain the central bank to follow some fairly simple policy rule, what degree of political independence a central bank should have, and whether to target inflation. Some key areas of ongoing research in this area, as of the beginning of the 21 st century, are whether the behavioral process by which monetary policy affects nonfinancial economic activity centers more on money or on credit, quantitative measurement of whatever is the mechanism at work, the trade-off between price inflation and real aspects of economic activity like output and employment, and just why it is that the public in most industrialized countries is as averse to inflation as is apparently the case. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{identify}} patient characteristics and ovarian reserve markers that forecast pregnancy {{in women with}} advanced ovarian ageing and to investigate whether unfavourable cardiovascular health is associated with advanced ovarian ageing. Female reproductive ageing comprises the gradual decline in both oocyte quantity and quality will lead to four reproductive milestones, i. e. subfertility, sterility, menopausal transition and menopause. Female age {{has been identified as}} an important modulator of the reproductive ageing process, although the large inter-individual variation in normal ovarian ageing varies considerably, suggesting other factors may play a role. Women with a poor response in IVF or with elevated basal FSH levels, expressions of limited oocyte quantity, are suggested to have poor pregnancy prospects (an expression of poor oocyte quality), although reasonable pregnancy prospects have been published. The possible inconsistency between {{the quantity and quality of}} the primordial follicle pool as observed in women with advanced ovarian ageing evokes the question whether Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) or patient characteristics can identify those women who still have acceptable pregnancy prospects. The large variation in normal ovarian ageing is also expressed by a considerable variation in age at normal menopause, covering a range from 40 to 60 years of age. Early menopause is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, recently it has been suggested that vascular health may act as cause instead of a consequence of menopause. This thesis investigates whether markers of vascular ageing are associated with advanced ovarian ageing. Elucidation of these associations will create more understanding about the variation of the reproduction ageing process. The studies presented in this thesis focus on pregnancy forecasting based on information regarding quantitative ovarian reserve status, as well as the role of vascular health and unfavourable conditions during intra-uterine life in female reproductive ageing patterns. We studied these issues in several clinical cohorts, that serve as an extreme phenotype for compromised ovarian reserve, vascular health status or foetal environment. In this thesis it was confirmed that there is a complex interplay between ovarian <b>reserve</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality. Female age plays an important role in the modulation of this interaction. Women with advanced ovarian ageing, as expressed by a poor response in IVF or elevated basal FSH levels, appear to be a heterogeneous group in which ovarian reserve tests, next to female age, may identify those women with reasonable pregnancy prospects. Future research will help us unravel the mechanisms behind the individual variation of ovarian ageing. Furthermore, no conclusive evidence was found for an association between vascular health and the ovarian ageing process, using women with a history of preeclampsia, women with type 1 diabetes and women with exposure to prenatal famine as a model of compromised vascular health. To elucidate whether vascular compromise accelerates ovarian ageing, future studies would benefit from animal studies with an interventional design...|$|E

We consider one case where the unreliable supplier is the only supply option, and a second case where a second, reliable (but more expensive) supplier is available.

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of the reserves disclosures for investors and regulators, it is surprising to them {{that there has been a}} lot of focus, which is elaborated on in Chapter 2, on how the reserves data are prepared and reported on by companies. Currently, reserves disclosures in financial statements are not audited by independent public accountants, nor are they audited by any petroleum industry-designated independent evaluators. Performing the critical “reserves evaluator” function currently does not require any recognised certification program or other mandatory industry-wide training requirements. Despite the highly technical nature of the reserves estimation process, both preparers and users of the reserves information know that reserves estimation is not an exact science. Estimates are based on limited data obtained from small regions, which are then extrapolated to the whole field. Reserves estimations are also based on expected production paths over long periods of time. Many alternative procedures are often available and widely used for making similar technical or economic determinations. These factors make reserves disclosures inherently subject to information quality problems. Estimates of proved <b>reserve</b> <b>quantities</b> may often be imprecise and change over time as new information, for example, through new technologies becomes available. Accurate reserves data are extremely important to investors to value and assess the performance of energy companies, and are equally important to regulators and the public given the critical role of the energy sector in the economy. It is clear, then, that reserves data should be disclosed in a way that minimizes the credibility gap that afflicts the current disclosures. Key problem in structuring information about reserves is that relatively objective estimates of reservoir characteristics must be combined with subjective forecasts of project feasibility and commerciality.
