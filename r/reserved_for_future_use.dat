25|$|Guide {{signs are}} divided into {{directional}} signs, service area signs, route markers, and tourist-related signs, with influence from both American and Australian practice. Directional signs use a green background with white letters and arrows. Service area signs use a blue background with white letters, arrows, and symbols. Tourist-related signs use a brown background with white letters, arrows, and symbols. The route marker sign, excluding the AH26 route marker, {{is based on the}} Australian National Route marker, but <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
25|$|The second entry (cluster 1 in the FAT) {{nominally}} stores the end-of-cluster-chain marker as {{used by the}} formater, {{but typically}} always holds 0xFFF / 0xFFFF / 0x0FFFFFFF, that is, {{with the exception of}} bits 31-28 on FAT32 volumes these bits are normally always set. Some Microsoft operating systems, however, set these bits if the volume is not the volume holding the running operating system (that is, use 0xFFFFFFFF instead of 0x0FFFFFFF here). (In conjunction with alternative end-of-chain markers the lowest bits 2-0 can become zero for the lowest allowed end-of-chain marker 0xFF8 / 0xFFF8 / 0x?FFFFFF8; bit 3 should be reserved as well given that clusters 0xFF0 / 0xFFF0 / 0x?FFFFFF0 and higher are officially reserved. Some operating systems {{may not be able to}} mount some volumes if any of these bits are not set, therefore the default end-of-chain marker should not be changed.) For DOS 1 and 2, the entry was documented as <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

This dataset details {{the results of the}} first of three surveys undertaken as part of the Valuing floodplain development in the Fitzroy Basin project. This survey sampled populations from Brisbane (urban centre) Rockhampton (regional centre) and Emerald (regional town) to gauge their willingness-to-accept (WTA) and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for floodplain development. 340 completed surveys were received and split into three versions which focused on: - the whole Fitzroy basin - the Dawson river sub-catchment - the Comet-Nogoa-Mackenzie sub-catchment. For consistency, and to allow subsequent comparison of values, the same attributes were used {{as the basis for the}} choice scenarios generated for the three case study areas.

60|$|A {{compound}} formed thus {{of substances}} united by very weak affinities, {{so that they}} are always ready to separate from each other and form new unions under the influence of stronger affinities, is said to be in a state of unstable equilibrium. It is the function of vegetable life to create these unstable combinations by means of the force derived from the sun; and the combinations, when formed, of course hold the force which formed them in reserve, ready to make itself manifest whenever it is released. Animals receive these substances into their systems in their food. A portion of them they retain, re-arranging the components in some cases so as to form new compounds, but still unstable. These they use in constructing the tissues of the animal system, and some they <b>reserve</b> <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>use.</b> As fast as they require the heat and the force which are stored in them they expend, them, thus recovering the force which was absorbed in the formation of them, and which now, on being released, re-appears in the three forms of animal heat, muscular motion, and cerebral or nervous energy.|$|R
