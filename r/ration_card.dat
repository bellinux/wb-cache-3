5|$|No. 4 Commando {{was formed}} in Weymouth on 21 July 1940, when the first intake of 500 volunteers arrived. The unique nature of the commandos {{immediately}} became apparent when every man was held responsible for finding his own quarters. As commandos {{were expected to be}} fighting troops, they had no administrative personnel, such as clerks and cooks for example. To assist them with living 'off camp', with no cook house all ranks were given a daily allowance and a <b>ration</b> <b>card,</b> the allowance being 67 pence for officers and of 34 pence for other ranks. This arrangement meant that commandos lived on civilian rations, {{while the rest of the}} armed forces had the more plentiful military scale of rations.|$|E

25|$|When new {{immigrants}} arrived in Israel, they were sprayed with DDT, underwent a medical examination, were inoculated against diseases, and were given food. The earliest immigrants received desirable homes in established urban areas, {{but most of}} the immigrants were then sent to transit camps, known initially as immigrant camps, and later as Ma'abarot. Many were also initially housed in reception centers in military barracks. By the end of 1950, some 93,000 immigrants were housed in 62 transit camps. The Israeli government's goal was to get the immigrants out of refugee housing and into society as speedily as possible. Immigrants who left the camps received a <b>ration</b> <b>card,</b> an identity card, a mattress, a pair of blankets, and $21 to $36 in cash. They settled either in established cities and towns, or in kibbutzim and moshavim. Many others stayed in the Ma'abarot as they were gradually turned into permanent cities and towns, which became known as development towns, or were absorbed as neighborhoods of the towns they were attached to, and the tin dwellings were replaced with permanent housing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, despite {{continuing}} requests from editors for both fiction and non-fiction material, Lane {{turned away from}} commercial fiction writing, save for her collaboration on her mother's books. [...] At this time, she became known among libertarians as influential in the movement. She vehemently opposed the New Deal, eschewed [...] "creeping socialism," [...] Social Security, wartime rationing, and all forms of taxation. [...] Lane ceased writing highly paid commercial fiction to protest paying income taxes. Living on a small salary from her newspaper column and no longer needing to support her parents or adopted sons, she cut expenses to the bare minimum, living a modern-day version of her ancestors' pioneer life on her rural land near Danbury. She gained some media attention for her refusal to accept a <b>ration</b> <b>card,</b> instead working cooperatively with her rural neighbors to grow and preserve fruits and vegetables, and to raise chickens and pigs for meat.

They refused to get involved however since the demands of the women were fair and there was no legal basis for not handing out food <b>ration</b> <b>cards</b> to German people who had returned home. Also in Hamm, Lünen, and Bochum wild scenes reportedly played {{out in front of the}} food offices. Agitated crowds of people waited in line for the distribution rations. Because some of the women brought with them small children and nursing infants and the miners in some cases showed up in the place of their wives, those waiting began to exchange accounts of their experiences in the places they had been evacuated to, and the craziest (tollste) statements were made. Miners declared that they would not return to the mines before they had received the necessary food <b>ration</b> <b>cards</b> for their families. Women announced that they would rather suffer bombs here than to once again return to the quarters assigned to them. The publication in the newspaper as well as at the distribution center on October 12, 1943 that food <b>ration</b> <b>cards</b> would not only be denied to those who had returned but also to all children required to attend school, even if they had not yet been evacuated, led to a firsthand rebellion among the women original, who had been capable of anything, without exercise of the least restraint or caution about consequences.

2500|$|Life in the Resistance {{was highly}} {{dangerous}} {{and it was}} imperative for a good résistant to live quietly and never attract attention to themselves. Punctuality was key to meetings in public as the Germans would arrest anyone who was seen hanging around in public {{as if waiting for}} someone. A major difficulty for the Resistance was the problem of denunciation. Contrary to popular belief, the Gestapo was not an omnipotent agency with its spies everywhere, but instead the Gestapo relied upon ordinary people to volunteer information. According to the Abwehr officer Hermann Bickler, the Germans needed 32 000 indicateurs (informers) to crush all resistance in France, but he reported in the fall of 1940 that the Abwehr had already exceeded that target. It was difficult for Germans to pass themselves off as French, so the Abwehr, the Gestapo and the SS could not have functioned without French informers. In September 1940, the poet Robert Desnos published an article titled [...] "J'irai le dire à la Kommandantur" [...] in the underground newspaper Aujourd'hui appealing to ordinary French people to stop denouncing each other to the Germans. Desnos's appeal failed, but the phrase [...] "J'irai le dire à la Kommandantur" [...] ("I'll go and tell the Germans about it") was a very popular one in occupied France as hundreds of thousands of ordinary French people denounced each other to the Germans. The problem of what the French called indics or mouches as informers were known was compounded by the corbeaux (poison pen letters). The writers of the corbeaux was inspired by a mixture of motivations such as envy, spite, greed, anti-Semitism, and sheer opportunism as many ordinary French people wanted to ingratiate themselves with what they believed to be the winning side. Ousby noted [...] "Yet perhaps the most striking testimony to the extent of denunciation came from the Germans themselves, surprised at how ready the French were to betray each other". The problem of denunciation was always the most serious handicap for the resistance as there were a seemingly endless number of ordinary French people who were desperate to denounce anyone they suspected of engaging in resistance. In occupied France, one had to carry at all times a huge cache of documents such as an ID card, a <b>ration</b> <b>card,</b> tobacco voucher (regardless if one was a smoker or not), travel permits, work permits, and so on. For these reasons, forgery become a key skill for the resistance as the Germans regularly required the French to produce their papers, and anyone whose papers seemed suspicious would be arrested.|$|E
