25|$|Another {{cause of}} vitamin C being lost from food is leaching, where the {{water-soluble}} vitamin dissolves into the cooking water, which is later poured away and not consumed. However, vitamin C does not leach in all vegetables {{at the same}} rate; research shows broccoli seems to retain more than any other. Research has also shown that freshly cut fruits do not lose significant nutrients when stored in the <b>refrigerator</b> <b>for</b> a few days.|$|E
25|$|The plants {{flower in}} three {{distinct}} colours: white, yellow, and red. The flowers first appear in early May {{through the early}} summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and the fruits ripen from August through October. The fruits are typically eaten, minus the thick outer skin, after chilling in a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>for</b> a few hours. They have a taste similar to sweet watermelon. The bright red/purple or white/yellowish flesh contains many tiny hard seeds that are usually swallowed, but should be avoided {{by those who have}} problems digesting seeds.|$|E
25|$|In Loewy's {{early years}} in the United States, he lived in New York and found work as a window {{designer}} for department stores, including Macy's, Wanamaker's and Saks in addition to working as a fashion illustrator for Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. In 1929 he received his first industrial-design commission to contemporize {{the appearance of a}} duplicating machine by Gestetner. Further commissions followed, including work for Westinghouse, the Hupp Motor Company (the Hupmobile styling), and styling the Coldspot <b>refrigerator</b> <b>for</b> Sears-Roebuck. It was this product that established his reputation as an industrial designer. He opened a London office in the mid-1930s that continues to operate.|$|E

25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored in the <b>refrigerator</b> <b>for</b> a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen {{for up to two}} or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
25|$|Costco has a {{wide variety}} of {{changing}} inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products. Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the stretch wrap off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, eye and sunglass centers, photo processors, and tire garages. The produce items that require refrigeration are kept in a walk-in refrigerator, and several locations even have a walk-in <b>refrigerator</b> <b>for</b> dairy items.|$|E

2500|$|The copious seeds store well if kept dry. In climates or seasons that cannot {{provide the}} cold, damp period of {{stratification}} {{required by the}} seeds for germination, growers mimic this condition by placing the seeds in a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>for</b> 2–6 weeks, depending on species. [...] The seeds are sown {{on the surface of}} their substrate and germinate when transferred to warmer, bright conditions. Sarracenia seedlings all look alike for the first two or three years; the plants reach maturity after four or five years. [...] Regular fertilization (twice a month between April and September) with a balanced fertilizer at the rate of 1 teaspoon per gallon (using a 15-16-17 peat-lite or similar fertilizer) will speed their growth and time to maturity. [...] It is advisable to leach regularly with pure water to prevent the buildup of solutes (fertilizer salts) in the soil. [...] Deep water in a potted plant keeps the soil too waterlogged for proper root functioning.|$|E

2500|$|Anton Codelli ( [...] 22nd. March, † 28. April 1954), a Slovenian nobleman, was {{a passionate}} inventor. Among other things, he had devised a {{miniature}} <b>refrigerator</b> <b>for</b> cars {{and a new}} rotary engine design. Intrigued by television, he decided to apply his technical skills to the new medium. At the time, the biggest challenge in television technology was to transmit images with sufficient resolution to reproduce recognizable figures. As recounted by media historian Melita Zajc, most inventors were determined {{to increase the number}} of lines used by their systems – some were approaching what was then the magic number of 100 lines. But Baron Codelli had a different idea. In 1929, he developed a television device with a single line – but one that formed a continuous spiral on the screen. Codelli based his ingenious design on his understanding of the human eye. He knew that objects seen in peripheral vision don’t need to be as sharp as those in the center. The baron’s mechanical television system, whose image was sharpest in the middle, worked well, and he was soon able to transmit images of his wife, Ilona von Drasche-Lazar, over the air.|$|E

It was not time for the party to begin, but he begged so hard to come in and help that he was allowed privileges few visitors enjoy, for he kindled the fire, ran errands, and watched the progress of his supper with intense interest.
