40|$|A {{study is}} made {{of the role of}} flaw state on the {{strength}} properties of brittle ceramic coating layers bonded to soft polycarbonate substrates. We introduce Vickers <b>radial</b> <b>cracks</b> at prescribed loads into the coating undersurfaces prior to bonding to control the sizes and locations of the starting flaws. A spherical indenter is then loaded on the top bilayer surfaces, directly above the Vickers indentation sites, subjecting the <b>radial</b> <b>cracks</b> to flexural tensile stress. <b>Radial</b> <b>crack</b> responses are monitored in situ, using a camera located below the transparent substrate. Critical loads to cause <b>radial</b> <b>crack</b> instability, and ensuing growth of the arrested cracks, are recorded.

40|$|The {{cracking}} and delamination of TiN-coated hardmetals (WC-Co cemented carbides) when {{subjected to}} Brale indentation were studied. Experimental variables were substrate microstructure related to low (6 wt% Co) and medium (13 wt% Co) binder content, and surface finishes associated with {{grinding and polishing}} stages before film deposition. Brale indentation tests were conducted on both coated and uncoated hardmetals. Emphasis {{has been placed on}} assessing substrate microstructure and subsurface finish effects on load levels at which cracking and delamination phenomena emerge, the type of cracking pattern developed, and how fracture mechanisms evolve with increasing load. It is found that polished and coated hardmetals are more brittle (<b>radial</b> <b>cracking)</b> and the adhesion strength (coating delamination) diminishes with decreasing binder content. Such a response is discussed {{on the basis of the}} influence of intrinsic hardness/brittleness of the hardmetal substrate on both cracking at the subsurface level and effective stress state, particularly regarding changes in shear stress component. Grinding promotes delamination compared to the polished condition, but strongly inhibits <b>radial</b> <b>cracking.</b> This is a result of the interaction between elastic-plastic deformation imposed during indentation and several grinding-induced effects: remnant compressive stress field, pronounced surface texture and micro cracking within a thin altered subsurface layer. As a consequence, coating spallation prevails over <b>radial</b> <b>cracking</b> as the main mechanism for energy dissipation in ground and coated hardmetals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Present study {{concentrates}} {{primarily on}} <b>radial</b> <b>crack</b> propagation by the explosive gas {{pressure and the}} associated fracture formation, and on estimating the effects of natural discontinuities on rock fragmentation in bench blasting. Boundary element and finite element methods coupled with fracture mechanics theories are used to study the crack propagation. Fractal geometry principles are used to study the effect of natural discontinuities. Predicted stresses from conventional bench blasting model without any <b>radial</b> <b>crack</b> differ little from those around a pressurized hole in an infinite medium. Contrary to field observations, the radially symmetric stress field predicts a thin failed zone concentric with the hole. A loading rate dependent model, developed considering microflaws, suggest only long micro fractures become the <b>radial</b> <b>cracks.</b> The biaxial compression zone {{at the side of}} a <b>radial</b> <b>crack</b> suppresses smaller cracks. Other cracks can grow beyond this zone. Some die as the cracks become pressurized. Tensile σ₃ outside this zone peaks near the crack tip. A biaxial tension zone forms ahead of the crack tip. A multicrack model of bench blasting is developed. Biaxial compression zone forms near the hole. σ₃ is tensile outside this zone and peaks near the crack tips. Numerous tensile fractures form in these regions. Tensile fractures continue to form with <b>radial</b> <b>crack</b> growth and existing fractures grow in sliding. Stress redistribution around the fractures produces second and lower order fractures. These fractures break rock between the <b>radial</b> <b>cracks.</b> Pressurization of <b>radial</b> <b>cracks</b> is essential to propagate them for longer distances and to form associated fractures for further breakage of burden. The beam bending model produces unrealistically large burden displacement. The equivalent cavity hypothesis correctly estimates the stresses beyond the <b>radial</b> <b>cracks</b> but ignores the <b>radial</b> <b>crack</b> propagation and the associated breakage. It predicts a failed region concentric with the hole. The effect of natural discontinuities on fragmentation is determined by comparing the Schuhmann size distribution curves of the blasted fragments and the in-situ blocks. In-situ block and after blast fragments sizes, measured from photographs, are fractal which is analogous to Schuhmann Distribution. Exploiting the fractal characteristics eliminates the problems associated with size determination. Automated data reduction processes can make this method very powerful for routine monitoring and design optimization of blasts. Discontinuity pattern, fracture density, block density, fault structure, and microcracks in laboratory specimens are also fractal.
