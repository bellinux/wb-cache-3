50|$|The {{undulate}} <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> undulata) is {{a species}} of ray and cartilaginous fish found in the Mediterranean and East Atlantic from southern Ireland and England to the Gulf of Guinea. It is found in areas with mud or sand, and may occur as deep as 200 m, though it prefers shallower depths. It is considered endangered due to overfishing.|$|R
40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> brachyura), spotted <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> montagui), thornback <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> clavata), cuckoo <b>ray</b> (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> microocellata) and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|R

In the lipid fraction 14 fatty acids were identified. Palmitic acid (16 : 0) and stearic acid (18 : 0) were the majority fatty acids and represent 61. 55 % and 33 - 86 %, of the total saturated fatty acids.

40|$|Most {{advanced}} teleosts lack L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase (GULO), a {{key enzyme}} {{required for the}} biosynthesis of ascorbic acid. However, extant representatives of primitive species including sturgeon and many cartilaginous fishes, are exceptional {{in their ability to}} synthesize ascorbic acid de novo. In the present study, full-length GULO cDNAs were isolated from white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) and two shark species belonging to the Triakidae (Triakis scyllium and Mustelus manazo). The open reading frames from all three species contained 440 amino acids and the deduced polypeptides had similar hydropathy profiles, predicted molecular masses and theoretical pI values. These GULO sequences exhibited high amino acid identity (67 - 97 %) with each other, and also shared 61 - 71 % identity with mammalian GULOs. Based on the GULO sequences obtained from these species, we developed degenerate primers for the isolation of partial GULO sequences by RT-PCR from other primitive species including another shark (Mustelus griseus, Triakidae), a spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, Squalidae), two <b>ray</b> <b>species</b> (<b>Raja</b> kenojei, Rajidae and Dasyatis akajei, Dasyatidae) and four sturgeons (Acipenser baeri, A. gueldenstaedtii, A. naccarii and A. ruthenus, Acipenseridae). Overall, sequence identities of these amplified GULO segments among primitive species were 63 - 99 % at the nucleotide level and 67 - 100 % at the amino acid level. Considerable numbers of amino acid residues were unique to either fish or mammals, and Acipenseriform species occupied an intermediate position, sharing several residues with either fish or mammalian GULOs. Phylogenetic analyses based on parsimony, distance and likelihood methods of both nucleotide and amino acid sequences resulted in trees that were in agreement with known taxonomy.

5000|$|Sharks {{can detect}} weak {{electric}} fields {{in their environment}} using ampullary receptors in to find their prey. A study by Kalmijn et al. 1971 observed this action. [...] Kalmijn used a type of flatfish, called a plaice as a living source of food along with the electrodes and the whiting pieces. He saw that sharks could detect plaice buried under the sand, and would smoothly change direction to where the plaice lay hidden and attack it. To determine if sharks were using electric fields or smell to detect their prey, he devised an experiment. He used the shark species Scyliorhinus canicula and the <b>ray</b> <b>species</b> <b>Raja</b> clavata. He created an agar chamber, which would hold a plaice (small fish), and an opening tube downstream to separate any smells. The agar chamber would enclose the plaice on all sides. The agar does not allow odors to pass, but it does allow electric field to pass through it. Kalmijn would place the plaice in the agar and bury it underneath the sand to eliminate any visual cues. When sharks were in feeding mode, they would locate the agar with the plaice underneath it and attack it near the head region (where bioelectric fields are thought to originate). If chopped up bits of whiting were put in the agar chamber, the shark would try to locate the prey via smell {{coming out of the}} outlet tube. Also, if the plaice was put in an agar chamber and covered with polyethylene film, the sharks could no longer detect the plaice. The polyethylene layer inhibits the bioelectric fields and prevents the shark from using passive electrolocation to hunt its prey. One additional behavior observed in sharks is their orientation to the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth’s magnetic field acts as a uniform field, B. When the shark swim through the Earth's magnetic field with its own velocity v, the shark induces its own electric current. Sharks swimming though the Earth's magnetic field create a voltage gradient that could act as a physical basis for compass orientation.|$|R

40|$|The dorsoventrally {{flattened}} morphology of benthic ray and flatfish {{species is}} perhaps {{assumed to be}} a constraint on their locomotory ability, suggesting these sit-­‐and-­‐wait predators may exhibit reduced movement and low activity with all species exploiting similar niches. Advancing our understanding of ray and flatfish movement behaviour in relation to the environment is required however, because many commercial and non-­‐ commerical populations are threatened by demersal fisheries. The movement patterns and behaviour of the electronic tagged <b>ray</b> <b>species</b> blonde <b>ray</b> <b>Raja</b> brachyura and spotted <b>ray</b> <b>Raja</b> montagui, and benthic teleosts turbot Psetta maxima and plaice Pleuronectes platessa, were investigated off southwest Britain. Mark-­‐recapture data showed some evidence for site fidelity or increased residence time in preferred locations to some degree in all species investigated. Time-­‐series of waiting times (intervals between periods of activity) were analysed statistically, revealing complex movement patterns and behavioural structure over a wide range of temporal scales. Overall, R. brachyura displayed greater horizontal and vertical ranging behaviour with longer waiting times than R. montagui, who inhabited deeper more restricted depths. Comparatively, however, teleosts showed more extensive vertical ranging and much shorter waiting time behaviour, with P. maxima displaying surface swimming, whilst P. platessa performed substantial circa-­‐diel and tidal rhythms. The differences in behaviour patterns observed was attributed to feeding niche differences, among intraspecific variation such as sexual segregation and ontogenic changes. This integrated statistical approach to understand the behavioural strategies of these sit-­‐ and-­‐wait predators helps to assess aspects of behaviour such as decision-­‐making (waiting time between activities) in relation to habitat availability and quality. A deeper understanding of spatiotemporal movements and behaviour, including where species are distributed, how long they stay there and why, will inform better management of populations.

First evidence suggests that the abundance of fish decreases with increasing depth while the mean size of fish increases. Samples taken by trawls and baited traps at two stations complement camera observations and facilitated a direct identification of the species present: Lycodes squamiventer dominated at the shallow station (1200 m) while Lycodonus flagellicauda, Gaidropsaris argentatus and the <b>ray</b> <b>Raja</b> hyperborea occurred in low numbers. The larger-sized congeneric Lycodes frigidus was most abundant at the central station (2400 m), with a few individuals of the rare species Lycenchelys platyrhina. The biology and functional ecological role of these fishes is discussed with particular emphasis on their trophic status...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the reproductive strategy of the undulate <b>ray</b> <b>Raja</b> undulata in Portuguese mainland waters. The species was found mostly between 30 and 40 m deep on sandy bottoms. Egg-laying sites were observed in the north, centre and south-west regions, mainly at depths below 30 m. The peak of the reproductive season occurred from December to May. Asynchrony between reproductively active females and males appeared to occur, although most adult males were capable of reproducing throughout the year. The estimated length at 50 % maturity was 862 cm (87 years) and 768 cm (76 years) total length for females and males, respectively. The maximum potential fecundity was estimated to be 698 follicles per female per reproductive season, which are released in 47 batches of 15 follicles. The life-history and demographic parameters of R. undulata {{are similar to those of}} other skate species, while the potential rate of population increase (049) is above the published values for other elasmobranch species. With these new findings, this study makes an important contribution to the understanding of the life history of R. undulata, and {{provides a}} first evaluation of the productivity and susceptibility of the species to exploitation...|$|R
40|$|The 2 m {{beam trawl}} and 1. 5 m push net {{were used to}} sample the small epibenthic fish {{assemblage}} during September on the east and south coasts of England. Fishing stations were distributed along the entire coast within four depth bands to 20 m. A total of 104 species were caught between 1973 and 1995, and these included infrequent Lusitanean species such as the big-scale sand-smelt (Atherina boyeri), and the undulate <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> undulata), and infrequent boreal species such as the Norway haddock (Sebastes viviparus). Fifty-four taxa were selected as representative of the small, demersal inshore fish community that would be most vulnerable to capture by the two sampling gears, and were used in subsequent analyses of community structure. The north-east coast assemblage was the least diverse (H*= 1. 58) and least even (J*= 0. 47). It also supported the least number of species (55), and the variation in catch of the only dominant genus, Pomatoschistus spp., was partly responsible for large year-to-year variations in diversity and in the total population abundance of selected demersal species. On the east and south-east coasts, both diversity (H*= 1. 78 and 1. 93) and evenness (J*= 0. 50 and 0. 51) were greater than in the north, {{as a result of}} large...|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) {{inhibitory}} peptides {{have been}} searched in thornback <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> clavata) muscle hydrolysed with Bacillus subtilis A 26 proteases until a hydrolysis degree of 18. 35 %. The hydrolysate showed an IC 50 of 0. 83 mg mL− 1. To identify peptides {{responsible for this}} activity, the extract was eluted through size-exclusion chromatography and fractions collected. The highest ACE inhibitory activity was found for fractions F 2 and F 3 which had IC 50 of 0. 42 and 0. 51 mg mL− 1, respectively. These fractions were analysed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). A total of 131 and 108 peptide sequences mainly derived from actin, myosin heavy chain and procollagen alpha 1 chain proteins were identified in fractions F 2 and F 3, respectively. FQPSF and LKYPI showed the best results with an IC 50 of 12. 56 and 27. 07 μM, respectively. These results prove the potential of thornback ray muscle hydrolysate {{as a source of}} ACE inhibitory peptides.

40|$|The thornback <b>ray</b> <b>Raja</b> clavata {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} bycatch species of trawl fishing in the waters of the Gulf of Gabes, but little is known about its life history in this area. The present study provides the first data on age and growth of this species in Tunisian waters, as well as additional data on its reproduction. The age of individuals was estimated by counting growth bands on central vertebral sections. Marginal increment and edge analysis supported the hypothesis of annual deposition of growth bands, with the opaque band formed during autumn. The parameters estimated from von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth functions showed differences between sexes. The oldest thornback ray female was aged 15 years (104 cm TL), whereas the oldest male was 12 years (89 cm TL). Variations in the gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices of both sexes and the presence of vitellogenic activity in mature females during the year indicated that the species cannot be considered to be a continuous spawner. Males were found to mature between 55 and 75 cm TL, whereas females matured between 72. 4 and 85 cm TL. The TL at which 50 % of the population reached maturity was 67. 44 and 81. 42 cm for males and females, respectively. Males and female thornback rays mature, respectively, at approximately 5. 3 and 7 years old...|$|R
40|$|The food {{composition}} and dietary overlap between the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and thornback <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> clavata) were {{studied in the}} Eastern Black Sea. It {{was found that the}} food of S. acanthias and R. clavata in the area studied consisted of mainly fish and crustaceans. The availability of prey was found to be the main criterion in the spiny dogfish feeding strategy. In winter, anchovy were the dominant prey for S. acanthias. This reflects that there is a high availability of these prey in the region. The availability of prey items affected the diet composition, the values of diet breadth, the prey similarity and the dietary overlap of the thornback ray and spiny dogfish. The study has shown that the prey similarity index of these species was 38 %. The diet of R. clavata was significantly overlapped by the diet of S. acanthias (1. 38). However, S. acanthias was observed to have a more unique diet and was insignificantly overlapped by R. clavata (0. 36). The overall results indicate that the spiny dogfish is an indiscriminate predator preying upon those species that are most abundant and available in the area and season, and that R. clavata also feed mainly on anchovy and whiting in the winter but shift to crab and Gobius sp., a demersal species common in the area, together with whiting {{for the rest of the}} year...|$|R
40|$|The phylogeography of thornback <b>rays</b> (<b>Raja</b> clavata) was {{assessed}} from European waters, using five nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial cytochome b sequences. Strong regional differentiation {{was found between}} the Mediterranean basin, the Azores and the European continental shelf. Allelic and haplotype diversities were high in Portuguese populations, consistent with the existence of a refugium along the Iberian Peninsula. Unexpectedly, high diversity was also found in the English Channel/North Sea area. The lowest genetic diversity was found in the Black Sea. Populations sampled from the Mediterranean, Adriatic and Black Seas were characterized by a single mitochondrial haplotype. This haplotype was also the most ancestral and widespread outside of the Mediterranean basin except for the Azores. Populations from the Azores were dominated by a second ancestral haplotype which was shared with British populations. Results from multidimensional scaling, amova and nested clade analysis indicate that British waters are a secondary contact zone recolonized from at least two refugia - one around the Iberian Peninsula and one possibly in the Azores. Links to a potential refugium known as the Hurd Deep, between Cornwall and Brittany, are discussed. Finally, a historical demographic analysis indicates that thornback ray populations started to expand between 580 000 and 362 000 years ago, which suggests that the Last Glacial Maximum (20 000 years ago) had mainly affected the distribution of populations rather than population size...|$|R
