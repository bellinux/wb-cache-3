About 53 rajas have held the title, {{beginning}} with Jogotram, {{and ending with}} Haranath Ray Bahadur II in 1971. <b>Raja</b> Horonath <b>Ray</b> Bahadur I was notable for his construction of schools in Rajshahi and Naogaon district, including Natto Shala, Baganbari, Dubalhati High school, Naogaon K.D. School. He contributed sums of money to the Rajshahi Government College. He founded Dubalhati Raja Horonuth High School, only the second {{high school in the}} Rajshahi Division, in 1864.

40|$|This working {{document}} {{presents the results}} on the most significant elasmobranch species captured in the Spanish Groundfish Survey on Northern Spanish shelf in 2014. The main species in decreasing order of biomass are Scyliorhinus canicula (Lesser spotted dogfish), Galeus melastomus (Blackmouth catshark), Etmopterus spinax (Velvet belly), <b>Raja</b> clavata (Thornback <b>ray),</b> <b>Raja</b> montagui (Spotted <b>ray)</b> and Leucoraja naevus (Cuckoo ray). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed. The majority of the species showed a decrease in biomass with regard to 2013 when highest values of the time series were reached and a new vessel (R/V Miguel Oliver) was used. The results of this last survey, also on board of R/V Miguel Oliver, seem {{to return to the}} values previous to 2013. Introductio...|$|R
40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> brachyura), spotted <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> montagui), thornback <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> clavata), cuckoo <b>ray</b> (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> microocellata) and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|R

Extensive land reclamations in forested and marshy areas were carried out and intrastate trade as well as commerce were highly encouraged. These kingdoms also helped introduce new music, painting, dancing and sculpture into Bengali art-forms as well as many temples were constructed during this period. Militarily, they served as bulwarks against Portuguese and Burmese attacks.|$|R

40|$|The {{proximate}} analysis, {{nitrogen compound}} content and lipid and fatty acid {{analysis of the}} muscle of frozen <b>ray</b> (<b>Raja</b> radiata) caught in Terranova have been studied. The proximate analyses of the muscle were: 15 % real protein, 1 % non-protein nitrogen, 78 % humidity and a fatty acid content lower than 1 %. The urea reaches values of 2 %. In the lipid fraction 14 fatty acids were identified. Palmitic acid (16 : 0) and stearic acid (18 : 0) were the majority fatty acids and represent 61. 55 % and 33 - 86 %, of the total saturated fatty acids. Oleic acid (18 : 1) was the most abundant of the monounsaturated fatty acids and corresponds to 72. 72 % of the total of these. Arachidonie acid (20 : 4), eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5) and docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6) were the most predominant polyunsaturated acids, forming 12. 95, 57. 22 and 23. 67 % of the total of polyunsaturated fatty acids respectively.

5|$|Subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam {{throughout}} the region. The region was ruled by dynasties of the Bengal Sultanate and feudal lords under the Delhi Sultanate {{for the next}} few hundred years. The Bengal Sultanate was interrupted for a period of twenty years by a Hindu uprising under Raja Ganesha. In the 16thcentury, Mughal general Islam Khan conquered Bengal. Administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence under the Nawabs of Murshidabad, who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi. Several independent Hindu states were established in Bengal during the Mughal period, including those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and <b>Raja</b> Sitaram <b>Ray</b> of Bardhaman. The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the 16th and 17thcenturies; it weathered the Mughals and survived until the advent of the British colonial era.|$|R

50|$|To stir Bengali enthusiasm, {{commemoration}} of the achievements of <b>Raja</b> Sitaram <b>Ray,</b> {{one of the greatest}} Bengali Hindu heroes, was introduced as a festival, in addition to Shivaji. In the early months of 1906, Bagha Jatin or Jatindra Nath Mukherjee was accompanied by Tarak when the former was invited to preside over the Sitaram Festival at Mohammadpur in Jessore, the ancient capital of Bengal. On this occasion, during a closeted meeting around Jatin were present, in addition to Tarak, Shrish Chandra Sen, Satyendra Sen and Adhar Chandra Laskar: all the four, one after the other, were to leave for higher studies abroad. Nothing was known about the object of this meeting till in 1952 when, during a conversation, Tarak spoke of it. Along with specific higher education, they were to acquire military training and knowledge of explosives. They were especially urged to create a climate of sympathy among people of the free Western countries in favour of India’s decision to win freedom.|$|R
50|$|From the 13th century onward, {{the region}} was {{controlled}} by the Bengal Sultanate, Hindu Rajas (kings), and Baro-Bhuyan landlords. During the Medieval and Early Modern periods, Bengal was home to several medieval Hindu principalities, including the Koch Kingdom, Kingdom of Mallabhum, Kingdom of Bhurshut and Kingdom of Tripura; the realm of powerful Hindu Rajas notably Pratapaditya and <b>Raja</b> Sitaram <b>Ray.</b> In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Isa Khan, a Muslim Rajput chief, who led the Baro Bhuiyans (twelve landlords), dominated the Bengal delta. Afterwards, the region came under the suzerainty of the Mughal Empire, as its wealthiest province. Under the Mughals, Bengal Subah generated 50% of the empire's GDP and 12% of the world's GDP, globally dominant in industries such as textile manufacturing and shipbuilding, with the capital Dhaka having a population exceeding a million people. The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire led to quasi-independent states under the Nawabs of Bengal, subsequent Maratha expeditions in Bengal, and finally the conquest by the British East India Company.|$|R

As a result they took away all his lands. A penniless Narendranarayan fled away, while Bharatchandra was taken to his maternal uncle's home in Naoapara.
