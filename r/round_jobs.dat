Hence Paul, understanding this, saith, 'And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God' (Rom 8:28). But how can that be, did they not come to us through the very sides of mercy? and how could they come to us so, since Satan pryeth to wound us deadly in every, or in some private place, if mercy did not compass us round about, round about as with a shield?

40|$|IntroductionWith {{increasing}} {{social activities}} of organizations {{and their role}} in development of societies, the studies about organization function are expanded in behavioral and social sciences. Many studies and researchers every year investigate job satisfaction as a crucial aspect of organizations around the world. This attention {{is rooted in the}} important role of human resources in organizational success and plans. This attitude leads to some evolutions in management, by focusing on participatory management, and on employees' motivations and behaviors. At this <b>round,</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction is a more important variable. Job satisfaction has entered in most of the studies about jobs and organizations, in the last decades and attracted researchers and employees alike. But other variables should be investigated along with job satisfaction. Participation in job and organizational decision making, is a more crucial variable for satisfaction at work. Participation and sense of participation, can affect employees' job satisfaction directly and indirectly. Although participation in job tasks and decisions has effects on job satisfaction, other consequences are also important. One of them is alienation. Participation in job and organization can promote sense of belonging and decrease alienation from self, others and organization. This study has investigated the relationship between job satisfaction and participation by considering the alienation as an intermediate variable. Materials and MethodsThe study has been done in quantitative research approach by a survey method. Sample contained 300 employees in Fars Electronic Corporation, who were collected by random sampling method. This corporation located at Fars province in south- east of Iran and give services of electricity in Fars and Booshehr provinces. Research data collected with a questionnaire designed by researchers and filled out by employees in the two provinces. Questionnaire contained several Likert scales that measured Job satisfaction with 3 dimensions (Satisfaction with management, colleagues, wage and job conditions), sense of participation and alienation. The scales' validity and reliability were obtained by a pilot study among employees. The data was analyzed by SPSS. Job satisfaction in this study is defined as positive attitude towards job and job-related experiences. By this definition, job satisfaction is composed of satisfaction with management, work conditions, wage and job itself. Alienation is defined as a sense of powerlessness and separation from job and organization. Finally, participation is defined as a sense of playing role in job and organizational decision-making process and affairs. Age, education, wage and life satisfaction are the other variables. According to the research model, 8 hypotheses extracted and tested as follows:Hypotheses: 1 -There is a significant relationship between age and job satisfaction 2 -There is a significant relationship between education and job satisfaction 3 -There is a significant relationship between wage and job satisfaction 4 -There is a significant relationship between participation and job satisfaction 5 -There is a significant relationship between life satisfaction and job satisfaction 6 -There is a significant relationship between alienation and job satisfaction 7 -There is a significant relationship between participation and job alienationDiscussion and ConclusionsThe result of the study shows that there is a positive and significant relationship between age and job satisfaction and diverse relationship between age and alienation. According to this, older employees reported higher job satisfaction and lower alienation. Also years of working in the organization showed significant and positive relationship with job satisfaction. There is no significant relationship found between education and job satisfaction. But employee's wage showed positive and significant relationship with participation and job satisfaction. According to this, employees that get higher wage and material benefit from their organization, reported higher job satisfaction and lower alienation from organization. The hypotheses about relations between life satisfaction and sense of security with job satisfaction were also significant; there is a positive and significant relationship between job satisfaction and job security and life security. Finally {{it should be noted that}} the major hypothesis of this study was approved: there is a positive relationship between participation and job satisfaction. Also a negative relationship exists between alienation and job satisfaction. According to multivariate analysis, by multiple regression, among different variables that were investigated in this study, participation is the most important variable in impacting job satisfaction. According to path analysis, participation to job has a 63 percent effective value in the model. Participation, as is focused in some theories, has direct and indirect effects on employees' attitudes and behaviors. it can promote a sense of belonging in employees and increase their attachment to organization. Also it can be considered as a learning force in organizations to better job performance...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} unified {{framework}} for designing deterministic monotone polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS’s) {{for a wide}} class of scheduling problems on uniformly related machines. This class includes (among others) minimizing the makespan, maximizing the minimum load, and minimizing the p -norm of the machine loads vector. Previously, this kind of result was only known for the makespan objective. Monotone algorithms have the property that {{an increase in the}} speed of a machine cannot decrease the amount of work assigned to it. The idea of our novel method is to show that for goal functions that are sufficiently well-behaved functions of the machine loads, it is possible to compute in polynomial time a highly structured nearly optimal schedule. An interesting aspect of our approach is that, in contrast to all known approximation schemes, we avoid <b>rounding</b> any <b>job</b> sizes or speeds throughout. We can therefore find the exact best structured schedule using dynamic programming. The state space encodes a sufficient amount of information such that no postprocessing is needed, allowing an elegant and relatively simple analysis without any special cases. The monotonicity is a consequence {{of the fact that we}} find the best schedule in a specific collection of schedules. In the game-theoretical setting of these scheduling problems, there is a social goal, which is one of the objective functions that we study. Each machine is controlled by a selfish single-parameter agent. The private information of an agent is its cost of processing a unit-sized job, which is also the inverse of the speed of its machine. Each agent wishes to maximize its own profit, defined as the payment it receives from the mechanism minus its cost for processing all jobs assigned to it, and places a bid which corresponds to its private information. Monotone approximation schemes have an important role in the emerging area of algorithmic mechanism design, as in the case of single-parameter agents, a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness with respect to the bids is that the allocation algorithm be monotone. For each one of the problems, we show that we can calculate payments that guarantee truthfulness in an efficient manner. Thus, there exists a dominant strategy where agents report their true speeds, and we show the existence of a truthful mechanism which can be implemented in polynomial time, where the social goal is approximated within a factor of 1 + ε for every ε > 0.

40|$|Applying gang {{scheduling}} can {{alleviate the}} blockade problem caused by exclusively used space-sharing strategies for parallel processing. However, the original form of gang scheduling is not practical {{as there are}} several fundamental problems associated with it. Recently many researchers have developed new strategies to alleviate some of these problems. Unfortunately, one important problem has not been so far seriously addressed, that is, how to set {{the length of time}} slot to obtain a good performance of gang scheduling. With gang scheduling time is divided into time slots of equal length, the number of time slots introduced in the system forms a scheduling round and each new job is first allocated to a particular time slot and then starts to run in the following scheduling round. Ideally, the length of time slot should be set long to avoid frequent context switches and so to reduce the scheduling overhead. The number of time slots in a scheduling round should also be limited to avoid a large number of jobs competing for limited resources (CPU time and memory). Long time slots and the limited number of time slots in each scheduling <b>round</b> may cause <b>jobs</b> to wait {{for a long time before}} it can be executed after arrival, which can significantly affect the performance of jobs, especially short jobs which are normally expected to finish quickly. However, the performance of a short job can also suffer if the length of time slot is not long enough to let the short job complete in a single time slot. In this paper we present a strategy to deal with this important issue for efficient gang scheduling. ...|$|R
