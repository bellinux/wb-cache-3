Exposure of males to ethanol increased their frequency of steady, upwind flight; however, only lineatin was effective in inducing them to land on and enter the traps. In contrast, exposure of females to either ethanol or lineatin alone resu!ted in an increased frequency of trap landing and entry. Both compounds released simultaneously did not significantly increase the frequency of trap landing and entry for either sex. These responses {{are consistent with the}} life history strategies used by both sexes to seek and colonize suitable host material.
