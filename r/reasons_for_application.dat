40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of nurses advocate integration of complementary therapies and conventional medicine, {{and some of}} them implement these methods in their clinical practice. There various <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>application</b> of complementary therapies by nurses, identification of which is of paramount importance. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the perceptions of nurses toward the reasons for using complementary therapies in clinical nursing practice. Methods: This study was a qualitative content analysis, conducted in Isfahan and Kashan, Iran, during June 2014 -July 2015. Purposive sampling was performed and was continued until data saturation. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with fifteen experienced nurses. Data were collected and analyzed using content analysis method. Data analysis was carried out using MaxQDA software. Results: Four major categories including “ethical perceptions and attitudes”, “obligating beliefs”, “attention to information from unofficial sources”, and “attention to information from official sources” were extracted with two main themes of “moral obligation of nurses” and “application of information sources by nurses”. Conclusion: With regard to the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>application</b> of complementary therapies in practice, performance of nurses could be demonstrated through assessing their moral obligation and application of obtained information from various sources, especially unofficial ones. Therefore, acknowledging these findings could help healthcare planners design guidelines and functional models to integrate complementary therapies and nursing practice. ...|$|E

Two types of data were extracted from the stories. First, despite the selective focus of the respondents, {{it was possible to}} provide addititive data on the source of applicants and their <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>application.</b> Results showed that 48 % of vacanies contained only external applicants, 16 % were open in internal applicants only, and 33 % were contested by both internal and external candidates. Overwhelmingly, the prime reason for internal applicants to apply for posts was for promotion whereas external applicants described a much broader range of reasons for their application. Second, a number of themes were apparent in the stories. These included an analysis of the differences between internal and external candidates, the different type of fit that selectors try to examine, the role of market forces in recruitment and selection episodes, the nature of contemporary interviewing and applicants' attention to detail. In addition, it is noted that selectors did not include any mention of job analysis, job descriptions, reliability, or validity in their stories, raising concerns that they are adopting a non-scientific approach...|$|E

Some of them use these methods in their clinical practice. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>application</b> of complementary therapies by nurses are different in various fields. Identification of these reasons are essential and important. So, {{this study was conducted}} to explore the nurses’ perceptions of the reasons for using complementary therapies in clinical nursing practice. Materials and Method: This qualitative content analysis study was done from June 2014 to July 2015 in Isfahan and Kashan cities. Sampling was done purposively and was continued until data saturation. Semi-structured interviews were done with fifteen nurses who had first-hand and rich experience. Data were analyzed concurrently with data collection. Data analysis was done via the conventional content analysis approach and MaxQDA software was used to help organizing and analyzing the data. Results: Results showed that 4 major categories including ethical trends & perceptions, ‘commitment beliefs, attention to information from informal sources' and attention to information from formal sources. Also two main themes including‘nurse's moral obligation' and ‘nurse’ use of information sources' were abstracted. Conclusion: The nurse's practice about the reasons for using complementary therapies in clinical settings can be explained by their moral obligation and obtained information from various sources especially informal sources. These findings are useful for managers to designing guidelines and models related to integration of complementary therapies into nursing practice...|$|E

This research aimed to provide an understanding of the reasons why many visually impaired people have not applied for a guide dog, the range of benefits offered by guide dogs, and how these might vary amongst different populations and under different circumstances. While previous research described a number of psychological and social benefits of assistant animal ownership, consistent with the companion animal literature, it also pointed to the importance of personal and social context on the impact and effectiveness of assistance animals. The study described here involved a telephone survey of over 800 visually impaired people and found that independence, confidence, companionship, increased and changed social interaction, as well as increased mobility, are commonly cited benefits of guide dog ownership. These psychological and social dimensions of owning a guide dog distinguish it from other mobility aids in its capacity to transform the lives of owners. However, as expected, demographic and contextual factors, such as gender, age, level of vision, and domestic circumstances, influence <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>application</b> and perceived benefits and drawbacks of guide dog ownership.

Of 259 graduates surveyed, 234 or 90. 3 percent returned the questionnaire [...] 89. 6 percent of minority graduates and 90. 7 percent of nonminority graduates. Virtually all graduates were satisfied with their EIS experience (95. 2 percent), have encouraged others to apply (96. 1 percent), and are the most frequent sources of initial contact of prospective officers (38. 2 percent). Most EIS graduates (71. 2 percent) were still working in epidemiology. Compared with the nonminority graduates, the minority graduates {{were more likely to be}} women and to be single. Minority graduates were less likely than nonminorities to hold academic appointments (44. 2 percent versus 60. 0 percent) and less likely to work in academic settings as their primary job (11. 5 percent versus 18. 7 percent). At the same time, minority graduates were more likely to have learned of the EIS Program from academic advisors (32. 1 percent versus 19. 4 percent).

40|$|Recursive {{estimation}} concepts {{were applied}} to image enhancement problems since the 70 's. However, very few applications in the particular area of astronomical image processing are known. These concepts were derived, for 2 -dimensional images, from the well-known theory of Kalman filtering in one dimension. The historic <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>application</b> of these techniques to digital images {{are related to the}} images' scanned nature, in which the temporal output of a scanner device can be processed on-line by techniques borrowed directly from 1 -dimensional recursive signal analysis. However, recursive estimation has particular properties that make it attractive even in modern days, when big computer memories make the full scanned image available to the processor at any given time. One particularly important aspect is the ability of recursive techniques to deal with non-stationary phenomena, that is, phenomena which have their statistical properties variable in time (or position in a 2 -D image). Many image processing methods make underlying stationary assumptions either for the stochastic field being imaged, for the imaging system properties, or both. They will underperform, or even fail, when applied to images that deviate significantly from stationarity. Recursive methods, on the contrary, make it feasible to perform adaptive processing, that is, to process the image by a processor with properties tuned to the image's local statistical properties. Recursive estimation can be used to build estimates of images degraded by such phenomena as noise and blur. We show examples of recursive adaptive processing of astronomical images, using several local statistical properties to drive the adaptive processor, as average signal intensity, signal-to-noise and autocorrelation function. Software was developed under IRAF, and as such will be made available to interested users...|$|E
