50|$|In May 2020, the UNF scrambles Task Force 118 {{from their}} base in San Diego to {{intercept}} a large wave of USEA planes that {{took off from}} South America, and encounter them over Area B7R in Nevada.

The UNF planes pull out after defeating all enemy aircraft, but the Butterfly Master - believed killed in the Tokyo operation - reappears with a formation of drones and kills Javelin-3.

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{barriers}} to rapid full-scale growth of commercial unmanned aircraft is the concern for safety. As myriad certification agencies scramble {{to keep up with}} the unique demands of this fast-growing industry, one thing is clear - where applicable, pertinent certification standards for manned aircraft are starting to apply. For the complex electronics that provide communication and control of these systems, this means a swift move towards compliance with DO-178C and DO-254 for software and hardware development. In most cases, the unmanned aircraft can only be operated as part of a system, hence the term “unmanned aircraft system” or UAS. The UAS consists of an unmanned aircraft (UA), a <b>remote</b> <b>pilot</b> station and the command, control and communications links that join them; as such, safety considerations address all of these elements.|$|E
50|$|On 21 June 2016 the Federal Aviation Administration {{announced}} {{regulations for}} commercial operation of small UAS craft (sUAS), those between 0.55 and 55 pounds (about 250 gm to 25 kg) including payload. The rules, which exclude hobbyists, require the presence at all operations of a licensed <b>Remote</b> <b>Pilot</b> in Command. Certification of this position, available to any citizen at least 16 years of age, is obtained solely by passing a written test and then submitting an application. For those holding a sport pilot license or higher, {{and with a}} current flight review, a rule-specific exam can be taken at no charge online at the faasafety.gov website. Other applicants must take a more comprehensive examination at an aeronautical testing center. All licensees {{are required to take}} a review course every two years.

50|$|The Rockwell RPRV-870 HiMAT (Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology) was a NASA {{program to}} develop {{technologies}} for future fighter aircraft.

50|$|In late 1980s, Quimar S.A. {{built the}} MQ-2 Bigua, a {{derivative}} of the Meteor Mirach 100 <b>remote</b> <b>piloted</b> vehicle, which was tested from an IA-58 Pucara {{and in the}} 1990s the Argentine Air Force unveiled the Nostromo Yarará (Nostromo Defensa) and the 2000s AeroDreams Strix (AeroDreams) UAV.|$|R
5000|$|The HiMAT were {{remotely}} piloted, as {{the design}} team {{decided that it}} would be cheaper and safer to not to risk a pilot's life during the experiments. This also meant that no ejection seat would have to be fitted. The aircraft was flown by a pilot in a remote cockpit, and control signals up-linked from the flight controls in the remote cockpit on the ground to the aircraft, and aircraft telemetry downlinked to the remote cockpit displays. The remote cockpit could be configured with either nose camera video or with a 3D synthetic vision display called a [...] "visual display". The aircraft were launched from a B-52 Stratofortress at altitude. There was also a TF-104G Starfighter chase plane with a set of backup controls which could take control of the HiMAT in the event that the <b>remote</b> <b>pilot</b> on the ground lost control.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2003, {{a second}} series of flight demonstrations {{focusing}} on [...] "non-cooperative" [...] aircraft (those without operating transponders), {{was conducted in}} restricted airspace near Mojave, California., again using the Proteus as a surrogate UAV. Proteus was equipped with a small Amphitech OASys 35 GHz primary radar system to detect potential intruder aircraft on simulated collision courses. The radar data was sent directly to the ground station as well as via an Inmarsat satellite system installed on Proteus. A mix of seven intruder aircraft, ranging from a sailplane to a high-speed jet, flew 20 scenarios over a four-day period, one or two aircraft at a time. In each case, the radar picked up the intruding aircraft at ranges from 2.5 to 6.5 mi, depending on the intruder's radar signature. Proteus' <b>remote</b> <b>pilot</b> on the ground was able to direct Proteus to take evasive action if needed.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2002, NASA Dryden, in {{cooperation}} with New Mexico State University's Technical Analysis and Applications Center (TAAC), the FAA and several other entities, conducted flight demonstrations of an active detect, see and avoid (DSA) system for potential application to UAVs at Las Cruces, New Mexico. The Scaled Composites Proteus aircraft was flown as a surrogate UAV controlled remotely from the ground, although safety pilots were aboard to handle takeoff and landing and any potential emergencies. Three other aircraft, ranging from general aviation aircraft to a NASA F/A-18, served as [...] "cooperative" [...] target aircraft with an operating transponder. In each of 18 different scenarios, a Goodrich Skywatch HP Traffic Advisory System (TAS) on the Proteus detected approaching air traffic on potential collision courses, including several scenarios with two aircraft approaching from different directions. The <b>remote</b> <b>pilot</b> then directed Proteus to turn, climb or descend as needed to avoid the potential threat.|$|E

40|$|Time-delay is one {{key factor}} {{affecting}} handling qualities of <b>remote</b> <b>piloted</b> vehicle. In this paper, the composition elements of time-delay were analyzed, {{in order to}} determine the relationship between latency and handling qualities. Then, comparing with the definition of time-delay in manned aircraft operation, the expression of time-delay was proposed for <b>remote</b> <b>piloted</b> vehicle and the measuring method of time-delay in piloted airplane was used as a reference. Moreover, considering different types of time-delay in RPV operation, typical open-loop and closed-loop experiments were designed and conducted based on ground testing environment. According to these results, the relation between time-delay and handling qualities was obtained. Finally, validity of this relationship was demonstrated through simulated approach and landing during flight testing. Time-delay is a critical element of RPV handling qualities, the research of which will be helpful and meaningful in unmanned aerial vehicle design and flight testing...|$|R

The term “Jellyfish” refers to animals from different taxonomic groups but the Scyphomedusae are within the most significant one. Four species of Scyphomedusae are the most conspicuous ones inhabiting the studied area, the Barcelona metropolitan area. Jellyfish are usually found at the surface waters, forming big swarms.

The next day is his school field trip to Vision Enterprises, in which {{students}} participate in a special viewing of a test launch of the Vision One spacecraft. However, Sam has to leave Buddha at home to attend, so Buddha secretly escapes {{to meet up with}} the other buddies; Rosebud (Liliana Mumy), Budderball (Josh Flitter), B-Dawg (Skyler Gisondo), and Mudbud (Henry Hodges), and invites them to join his own spectatorship of the test launch.

On a tour with Dr. Finkel (Kevin Weisman), students see an automatic outfitter that Sam uses.

5000|$|After {{repairing}} the critical systems, Isaac's team launches the second beacon, attracting the nearby USM Valor; however, the Valor, having {{picked up an}} escape pod with a Necromorph inside (jettisoned earlier by Hammond) is overrun and crashes into the ship. Hammond deduces, from the military equipment he finds on board, that the Valor was actually assigned to destroy the Ishimura (later confirmed through a text log found on the Valor.) Deciding that they must escape while they can, Isaac and Hammond retrieve the Valor's singularity core in order to repair an available shuttle, though Hammond is killed by an enhanced Necromorph in the process. Dr. Kyne, {{one of the last}} survivors of the Ishimura, later contacts Isaac, urging him to return the Marker to Aegis VII, believing that it can restrain the [...] "Hive Mind", a creature that controls the Necromorphs (though originally created for military purposes). After assisting Isaac in loading the Marker onto the shuttle, Kendra murders Kyne and betrays Isaac, revealing herself as a government operative ordered to retrieve the Marker for her superiors. She reveals that the Marker is a reverse-engineered copy of the Black Marker found on Earth, placed on Aegis VII by the government to monitor its effects. She then leaves on the shuttle without Isaac, but Nicole arrives and can help him recall the shuttle via <b>remote</b> <b>pilot,</b> prompting Kendra to flee via escape pod.|$|E
