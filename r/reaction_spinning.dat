Attitude control via the reaction wheel assembly (RWA) onboard a spacecraft uses three reaction wheels (one wheel per axis) and a backup to accommodate any wheel degradation throughout the course of the mission. The spacecraft dynamics prediction depends upon the correct knowledge of the reaction wheel orientations. Thus, it is vital to determine the actual orientation of the reaction wheels such that the correct spacecraft dynamics can be predicted.

40|$|Within the PhD. thesis the {{problems}} of H-transfer from selected types of phenols, aromatic secondary amines and compounds with acidic CH bond were investigated. This process was initiated {{by the action of}} redox agents, mostly PbO 2, in nonpolar solvents. The abstraction of hydrogen atom results in the formation of radical intermediates, which were detected by EPR spectroscopy. Because in most cases, highly unstable radicals were produced, it was neccessary to apply the technique of indirect detection, so called spin trapping. This method enables to interpret the character of generated radicals on the basis of EPR parameters of radical adducts, which are formed by their reaction with suitably chosen compounds, spin traps, which are added to the <b>reaction</b> system. As <b>spin</b> traps, the aromatic nitrosocompounds were preferentially used. Due to the fact that EPR spectra of radical adducts were in most cases very complex, their interpretation was possible only using the computer simulation. Based on this approach, new information about the character of addition of phenoxyl tradicals to aromatic nitrosocompounds, stability of alkyl substituents in methyl substituted phenols and character of C-radicals, generated from substituted coumarines and beta-diketones, was obtained. Simultaneously, the small ability of nitrogen radicals, primary products of the splitting of NH bond, to enter the <b>reaction</b> with <b>spin</b> traps was proved by aromatic secondary amines...|$|R
