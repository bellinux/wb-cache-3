40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} obtain {{brighter}} light beam, consumers would like to replace the halogen bulb in the <b>headlamp</b> <b>of</b> their car with HID conversion kit. In the vehicle market of China, relevant laws or regulations on modified headlamps are rarely found for now. This study investigated the photometric performance <b>of</b> modified HID <b>headlamps.</b> Using the performance assessment method for headlighting systems described in CIE 188 Technical Report, this study compared the shape of cut-off line, road scene illumination and glare <b>of</b> <b>headlamps</b> installed in cars of same type but with different light sources (including halogen bulb, HID light source and HID conversion kit).

The present paper summarizes results from a series of field studies investigating the effect <b>of</b> <b>headlamp</b> illumination and <b>of</b> oncoming <b>headlamp</b> glare on the speed and accuracy of response to small targets located in the visual periphery. These experiments used headlamp sets providing differing amounts of illumination on targets of varying reflectance, located throughout the field of view.

The characteristics and locations of the targets and experimental geometry were similar in each study as were the subject demographic characteristics, so that results were very consistent among each of the studies.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the quantitative {{influence of a}} variety of factors on the performance <b>of</b> low-beam <b>headlamps.</b> The factors included were vertical aim, horizontal aim, mounting height, lateral separation, lens dirt, lamp voltage, number of functioning lamps, vehicle type, beam pattern and light source. The following aspects <b>of</b> <b>headlamp</b> performance were considered: visibility of pedestrians, visibility of road delineation, visibility of vehicle reflex reflectors, visibility of rettoreflective traffic signs, visibility of targets near the road expansion point, glare directed towards oncoming drivers, glare reflected from wet pavement towards oncoming drivers, glare directed towards rearview mirrors of preceding vehicles, and foreground illumination. A sales-weighted average US beam pattern, with lamps mounted at sales-weighted average locations, formed the basis for most of the analyses. The results indicate that, from among the factors studied, vertical aim is overwhelmingly {{the most important factor in}} influencing the performance <b>of</b> low-beam <b>headlamps.</b> The second most important factor is the number of functioning lamps. The main implication of this study is that major improvements in current (fixed as opposed to adaptive) low-beam headlighting could be achieved primarily by better control of vertical aim and by use <b>of</b> longer-life <b>headlamps...</b>|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine whether the recent changes in the {{sharpness}} of the vertical gradient in U. S. low beams have changed the importance <b>of</b> <b>headlamp</b> leveling and cleaning systems. The study consisted of three parts. In the first part, we collected new data on dynamic distributions of pitch angles for a passenger car, a minivan, and an SUV in actual traffic. In the second part, we applied the new dynamic pitch data (combined with recent static pitch data) to representative low-beam patterns to estimate the changes in the benefits of leveling systems. These estimates were made for a comprehensive combination of static and dynamic sources of misaim; additional analyses would be necessary to determine the relative benefits of leveling systems that address selected sources of misaim. Three sets of photometric data were used in the analysis: market-weighted 1997 and 2004 tungsten-halogen beam patterns, and a representative 2004 HID beam pattern. In the third part, we applied a previously derived model for the effects of dirt on the three beam patterns to estimate the changes in the benefits of cleaning systems. In both sets of analyses, the effects on both visibility and glare were considered. The results indicate that (1) the importance <b>of</b> <b>headlamp</b> leveling systems for U.

Background: The detection distance <b>of</b> <b>headlamps</b> is very important to prevent automobile accident at night time. The studies of detection distance of LED, Halogen and HID headlamp have been conducted, but no study has shown the detection distance of pedestrian target with various colors (Black, White, Blue). Method: The experiment of detection distance was conducted with 30 people, which divide into 2 groups as 15 men and 15 women. Automatic transferable target on the rail was manufactured in order to reduce the error of study's result, and ANOVA also conducted to analyze the main effect with sign color, sex and headlamp classified by detection distance.

40|$|Headlamps with high-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) {{sources have}} been available on vehicles sold in the U. S. for a little over ten years. Although estimates of the proportion <b>of</b> HID <b>headlamps</b> in the vehicle fleet can be made based on sales data, there are uncertainties in those estimates {{because of lack of}} comprehensive compilation of data, unknown retention rates in the fleet, and complex regional differences in sales. Furthermore, number of vehicles sold and/or registered is not necessarily predictive of vehicles in use because of possible differences in overall driving rates or, most importantly, in nighttime driving rates. This study was therefore designed to obtain direct measurements of the proportion of vehicles with HID headlamps in nighttime traffic. Eight sites (two in each of four metropolitan areas) were selected, and traffic at those sites was video recorded between the hours of 7 : 00 p. m. and 10 : 00 p. m. The observations were made in late February and early March 2008, when those evening hours were dark and virtually all vehicles had their headlamps on. Video recording was done with diffraction gratings mounted on the cameras so that the type of headlamps—HID or tungsten-halogen (TH) —could be easily discriminated by the spectrally dispersed headlamp images. Investigators later scored the videos, counting the numbers of vehicles (except for motorcycles) in terms <b>of</b> <b>headlamp</b> type (HID or TH), and number <b>of</b> <b>headlamps</b> on (both, one, or none). The proportions of vehicles with HID headlamps varied by more than an order of magnitude, from 0. 0151 to 0. 200, across the eight sites.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 16 - 17) This study {{evaluated the}} effect of blue content <b>of</b> <b>headlamps</b> on discomfort glare, {{in order to provide}} guidance regarding spectral compositions that would minimize driver complaints. Three LED headlamps were tested (with correlated color temperatures of 4000, 4800, and 6600 K), as well as a tungsten-halogen headlamp and an HID headlamp. Subjects, seated in a stationary vehicle, rated discomfort from brief presentations of stimuli that produced illuminances of 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1 lux. As predicted in our previous analytical study, we found that—when they appear bluer than current tungsten-halogen or HID headlamps—LED headlamps tend to produce more discomfort glare. The effect is probably due to the color appearance of the LED lamps used in this study rather than to any inherent characteristic of LED sources, and it could probably be altered or reversed with different sources. For the data reported here, ratings of discomfort glare were linearly related to the amount of blue content in the light output as weighted by the spectral sensitivity of the short-wavelength (blue) cone photoreceptors. Therefore, if this relationship is replicated and extended in future studies, it may provide an index of blue content that could be used heuristically to select colors <b>of</b> <b>headlamps</b> to minimize driver complaints about glare...|$|R
