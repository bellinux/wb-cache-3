5000|$|Ferrante {{was born}} and raised in Queens, New York. As a teenager, he made his {{reputation}} as a gang leader.

50|$|Chris Jackson (Neil Stuke)—Chris is Reggie's unhinged, over-motivated boss. He didn't {{get where}} he is today {{without being able to}} {{recognise}} a brilliant new squirt-based concept in shaving design when he sees one. How Groomtech survives under his leadership is a mystery, as his ideas and decision-making are far from good. Chris is work obsessed—he sends text messages to his staff in the evenings and at weekends too. It's possible he doesn't even go home. Chris likes to think he is a good people person, but he clearly isn't. For example, sitting in a big high chair looming over your employees is not great for making your staff feel at home. Chris is sacked in Series 2 and Reggie takes over his job. Reggie later hires him to make a commercial for the line of 'Grot'-products. While the commercial and new products become a huge success, Groomtech is eventually sold. Chris then becomes director again, as Reggie had told the new owners that he wasn't fit for the job. Jackson's initials are clearly a <b>reference</b> to CJ, <b>boss</b> of the original Perrin.|$|R
