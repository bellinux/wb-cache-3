During a <b>routine</b> <b>check,</b> she <b>tested</b> positive for HIV. Monica believed she contracted the virus from Sharkey who continued to deny that he had infected her. Monica ended the relationship in October 1991 due to her suspicions. In July 1992, she learned that another woman also suspected that Sharkey had infected her with HIV as well. Later that same year, Monica filed a $52 million lawsuit against the actor for knowingly infecting her with HIV.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} heart {{transplant}} patient at his 17 th year of uncomplicated follow-up. Within a frame of <b>routine</b> <b>check</b> out several <b>tests</b> were performed. With such a long and uneventful follow-up some degree of graft reinnervation could be anticipated. However, the patient's electrocardiogram and exercise parameters seemed largely inconclusive in this regard. The exercise heart rate dynamics were suggestive of only mild, if any parasympathetic reinnervation of the graft with persisting sympathetic activation. On the other hand, traditional heart rate variability (HRV) indices were inadequately high, due to erratic rhythm resulting from interference of the persisting recipient sinus node or nonconducted atrial parasystole. New tools, originated from network representation of time series, by visualization short-term dynamical patterns, provided a method to discern HRV increase due to reinnervation from other reasons...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{multicomponent}} dynamometers {{are required}} with capacities in the meganewton range, {{for a number}} of purposes ranging from improvement of existing force standards to <b>routine</b> <b>checks</b> on material <b>testing</b> machines. Owing to size constraints, elastic element configuration is almost invariably limited to single-billet style; advantage is taken of current strain gage technique for first order compensation right at bridge level of the influence of the main error originating sources. Transducer construction is therefore well within the reach of most laboratories having the required proficiency in strain gage work; commercially available instrumentation is more than adequate for excitation, signal conditioning and recording as required. Data processing is no problem either thanks to the ubiquitous microprocessor. The catch however is that for measurement exploitation purposes the relationship between applied load components and output signals must be known within a level of uncertainty consistent with the requirements of the problem at hand. As these may not infrequently entail evaluation of minute components in view of their compensation or elimination as for as possible, accurate assessment of some second order terms may then be necessary. At medium to low force/moment capacities, that is within the range of large wind tunnel testing work, say up to the order of 105 N and 104 Nm, the problem is only one of time, and cost. Facilities and procedures are available capable of yielding routinely all reasonable requirements at state of the art level. The picture however is a completely different one when the limits of these facilities are exceeded, and the outlay of the huge sums of money required to make a large capacity installation is out of question. In these conditions one finds that but a subset of the component combinations required for regular second order model fitting and validation may be applied, and educated guesses only instead of hard facts are available as basis for estimation of some effects. Theoretical analysis and accumulated experience are drawn upon to offset at least to some extent the lack of specific experimental evidence...|$|R

40|$|Background: No good {{evidence}} exists {{to support the}} practice of routinely checking for the nuchal cord, yet {{it is a common}} medical intervention in birth. Some evidence shows damage to the baby because the practice more frequently leads to premature cord-cutting and the vaginal examination, required by such <b>routine</b> <b>checking,</b> may be physically and/or emotionally damaging to the women. Our objective was to learn what training midwives have received and what their current practice is in relation to a possible nuchal cord at birth? Method: Questions about nuchal cord at birth were posted to two online midwifery discussion forums and responses were invited. Twenty-six midwives from 10 countries responded to questions on nuchal cord practices. Results: The teaching and practice of routinely checking for the nuchal cord at birth is widespread, according to at least some participants from all 10 countries. Other midwives from the same countries argued that, although they were aware that the procedure is the dominant midwifery practice, many midwives neither teach it nor perform it routinely. Conclusion: In the absence ofclear evidence, firmly entrenched positions are being argued for and against <b>routine</b> <b>checking.</b> The debate is infused with high emotion. Those arguing for <b>routine</b> <b>checking</b> cite safety for the baby as their main concern. Those arguing against checking cite the need to keep birth normal and the well-being of the baby as their primary concerns. There is a need to reconsider how the possibility of nuchal cord at birth should be conceptualised from a midwifery perspective to ensure woman-centred decision-making...|$|R
