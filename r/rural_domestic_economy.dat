The mothers most {{able to respond to}} the child's communications are those whose personal needs do not obtrude and who have only a minimum of preconceived ideas. Thus they are able to consider the child as an individual and are interested in his expression of individuality. They want to listen and to understand and enjoy the flow of communication between him and them. (Heinicke and West-heimer 1) This article discusses ideas about communication with children: first looking at ways of meeting children with and without words; secondly illustrating some of these ways through a case record, and thirdly con-sidering in what kinds of situation it is appropriate to work directly wit...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} changes in international trade and domestic transport costs on the internal geography of a <b>domestic</b> <b>economy</b> linked {{to the rest of}} the World through a hub. We address that issue by developing two three regions model, namely a version of the Footlose Entrepreneur and a model à la Ottaviano et al. (2002). One region represents the rest of the World, while the two others compose the <b>domestic</b> <b>economy.</b> One region of the <b>Domestic</b> <b>economy,</b> the hub, exhibits a ‘geographical advantage’ in terms of easier access {{to the rest of the}} World. We ﬁnd the standard result that decreases in transports and trade costs raise the likelihood of agglomeration in the <b>domestic</b> <b>economy.</b> However, high interregional transport may induce partial agglomeration in the hinterland even in case of trade integration. Therefore depending on the level of transportation costs, hinterland remoteness may not be a locational ‘disadvantage’ as Behrens et al. (2007) pointed out...|$|R
