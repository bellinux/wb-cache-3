40|$|The {{results of}} a {{numerical}} simulation of the generation of <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> in pressurized nitrogen and helium gases are presented. It was shown that <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> generation occurs in two stages. In the first stage, <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> are composed of the electrons emitted by the cathode and produced in gas ionization {{in the vicinity of}} the cathode. This stage is terminated with the formation of the virtual cathode, which becomes the primary source of <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> in the second stage. Also, it was shown that <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> current is limited by both the shielding of the field emission by the space charge of the emitted electrons and the formation of a virtual cathode. In addition, the influence of the initial conditions, such as voltage rise time and amplitude, gas pressure, and the type of gas, on the processes that accompany <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> generation is presented.

40|$|It is {{discovered}} that the tokamak field geometry generates a pitch-angle scattering effect for <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons.</b> This neoclassical pitch-angle scattering is much stronger than the collisional scattering and invalidates the gyro-center model for <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons.</b> As a result, the energy limit of <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> {{is found to be}} larger than the prediction of the gyro-center model and to depend heavily on the background magnetic field...|$|R
5000|$|A {{relativistic}} <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> avalanche (RREA) is {{an avalanche}} {{growth of a}} population of relativistic electrons driven through a material (typically air) by an electric field. RREA has been hypothesized {{to be related to}} lightning initiation, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, sprite lightning, and to spark development. [...] RREA is unique as it can occur at electric fields an order of magnitude lower than the dielectric strength of the material.|$|E
50|$|Early {{hypotheses}} of this {{pointed to}} lightning generating high electric fields and driving relativistic <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> avalanche at altitudes {{well above the}} cloud where the thin atmosphere allows gamma rays to easily escape into space, {{similar to the way}} sprites are generated. Subsequent evidence however, has suggested instead that TGFs may be produced by driving relativistic electron avalanches within or just above high thunderclouds. Though hindered by atmospheric absorption of the escaping gamma rays, these theories do not require the exceptionally intense lightning that high altitude theories of TGF generation rely on.|$|E
5000|$|Electrons in air have a mean {{free path}} of ~1 cm. Fast {{electrons}} which move at a large fraction {{of the speed of}} light have a {{mean free path}} up to 100 times longer. Given the long free paths, an electric field can accelerate these electrons to energies far higher than that of initially static electrons. If they strike air molecules, more relativistic electrons will be released, creating an avalanche multiplication of [...] "runaway" [...] electrons. This process, relativistic <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> avalanche, has been hypothesized to lead to electrical breakdown in thunderstorms, but only when a source of high-energy electrons from a cosmic ray is present to start the [...] "runaway" [...] process.|$|E
40|$|A beam {{of highly}} {{relativistic}} <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> {{can be generated}} during the current quench in a Tokamak disruption. Having energy of several MeV, these energetic electrons can cause damage to the inner wall of a Tokamak vessel. Concerning this dramatic event, a diffusion of <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> toward a lower velocity is desirable. In this study, {{an investigation of the}} secondary <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> diffusion caused by whistler waves is carried out. First, an instability growth rate for whistler waves due to the Doppler resonance with <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> is obtained. In addition, a quasi-linear equation for the <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> velocity distribution function is formed and its solution is given for mode number 1 by using the whistler wave dispersion relation and growth rate. Finally, the validity of the solution for a range of the electron energy is investigated...|$|R
50|$|<b>Runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> are {{the core}} {{element of the}} runaway {{breakdown}} based theory of lightning propagation. Since C.T.R. Wilson's work in 1925, {{research has been conducted}} to study the possibility of <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons,</b> cosmic ray based or otherwise, initiating the processes required to generate lightning.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>runaway</b> <b>{{electrons}}</b> (RE) is used {{to denote}} electrons that undergo free fall acceleration {{into the realm of}} relativistic particles. REs may be classified as thermal (lower energy) or relativistic. The study of <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> is thought to be fundamental to our understanding of High-Energy Atmospheric Physics.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the details}} of the {{mechanism}} are uncertain, there is a consensus forming about the physical requirements. It is presumed that TGF photons are emitted by electrons traveling at speeds very close to the speed of light that collide with the nuclei of atoms in the air and release their energy in the form of gamma rays (bremsstrahlung [...] ). Large populations of energetic electrons can form by avalanche growth driven by electric fields, a phenomenon called relativistic <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> avalanche (RREA). The electric field is likely provided by lightning, as most TGFs have been shown to occur within a few milliseconds of a lightning event (Inan et al. 1996). [...] Beyond this basic picture the details are uncertain. Recent research has shown that electron-electron (Bremsstrahlung) [...] leads first to an enrichment of high-energy electrons and subsequently enlarges the number of high-energy photons.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002 Dwyer, {{along with}} colleagues from Florida Institute of Technology and the University of Florida, {{launched}} rockets during thunderstorms at a facility {{now known as}} the UF/Florida Tech International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) at Camp Blanding, Florida. Using a heavily shielded instrument containing a scintillation detector, built by Dwyer and his students, they found that lightning does indeed produce x-rays and that x-ray emission is common for lightning. This research was published in Science (journal) (Dwyer et al. 2003). Since that time, Dwyer and his collaborators have established many key properties of the x-ray emissions from lightning, including the fact that the x-ray emission is produced during the lightning stepping process, has energies up to approximately 1 MeV and the x-rays are produced in the high field regions generated by the leader as it propagates. In 2005 TERA (Thunderstorm Energetic Radiation Array), a 24 detector array, was built to continue measuring x-rays and gamma-rays from lightning and to further study the x-ray characteristics that are associated with thunderstorms. Also, in 2005, Dwyer and collaborators made the surprising discovery that long laboratory sparks in air also generate x-rays similar to lightning, which has since motivated many groups around the world to study the x-ray emissions from sparks. Most recently, Dwyer and his team have built and deployed an x-ray camera at the ICLRT and have made the world’s first x-ray images of lightning. Dwyer also has made several important theoretical contributions to the newly developing field of High Energy Atmospheric Physics, including work on <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> or runaway breakdown physics, gamma-ray and radio frequency emissions or atmospheric noise, and lightning initiation. In 2003, he introduced the Relativistic Feedback Mechanism of relativistic-runaway-electron avalanches, a new discharge mechanism in air, which explains how thunderclouds may generate very large flashes of gamma-rays called terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). [...] This work also showed the importance of positrons (anti-electrons) for thundercloud electrodynamics. Working with David Smith from UCSC he also helped establish that TGFs originate from deep within our atmosphere and not at high altitudes as had been previously assumed. Indeed, Dwyer and his team observed a ground level TGF at Camp Blanding in 2004. [...] Finally, using BATSE data form the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory, Dwyer and collaborators discovered Terrestrial Electron Beams (TEBs) [...] in the inner magnetosphere, which are generated by the high energy emissions from thunderstorms.|$|E

In this contribution, we investigate the impact of the associated radiation reaction forces on the <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> distribution, using both analytical and numerical studies, and discuss the corresponding change to the <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> growth rate, which can be substantial.

40|$|New {{results from}} the {{generation}} of runaways {{and the loss of}} <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> in an ergodized magnetic field are presented. For the generation process, a clear difference between a 'normal' and a clean, freshly boronized wall condition has been found. Under clean wall conditions, one observes at low densities not only the <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> with energies up to 30 MeV and at discharges with even lower electron density one finds more <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> but at an energy in the low-MeV regime. The <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> are utilized as test particles for revealing the ergodized magnetic field line structure. For the measurements the m/n = 6 / 2 base mode configuration of the dynamic ergodic divertor (DED), has been applied. One observes a clear modification of the radial runaway profile with preferential losses in the ergodized zone. From the loss rate of the <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> due to ergodization and from the redistribution of the runaways after the DED phase, the diffusion rate is estimated to be of the order of 0. 1 m(2) s(- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Spatially and {{temporally}} resolved {{measurements of}} <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> {{have been performed}} in the TEXTOR tokamak. The main diagnostic for the investigations is a newly developed runaway probe which is mounted at a reciprocating mechanism.

The scanning probes consists of fluorescing crystals covered by a graphite housing and is located at different radial positions. In this study, two generations of the probes are presented, a simple one for proving the principle and a more advanced one which allows the measurement of the energy distribution of the runaways. A strong decay of the <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> at the plasma edge was observed. <b>Runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> have been measured at different plasma densities by synchrotron radiation and the probe.

40|$|A new {{physical}} {{mechanism of}} formation of <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> (RE) beams during plasma disruptions in tokamaks is proposed. The plasma disruption {{is caused by}} a strong stochastic magnetic field formed due to nonlinearly excited low-mode number magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes. It is conjectured that the <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> beam is formed in the central plasma region confined inside the intact magnetic surface located between q= 1 and the closest low [...] order rational magnetic surfaces [q= 5 / 4 or q= 4 / 3, [...] . ]. It results in that <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> beam current has a helical nature with a predominant m/n= 1 / 1 component. The thermal quench and current quench times are estimated using the collisional models for electron diffusion and ambipolar particle transport in a stochastic magnetic field, respectively. Possible mechanisms for the decay of the <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> current owing to an outward drift electron orbits and resonance interaction of high [...] energy electrons with the m/n= 1 / 1 MHD mode are discussed.

40|$|Prompt <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> bursts, {{generated}} by rapidly cooling DIII-D plasmas with argon killer pellets, {{are used to}} test a recent knock-on avalanche theory describing the growth of multi-MeV <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> currents during disruptions in tokamaks.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> {{represent}} {{a serious problem}} for the reliable operation of the future experimental tokamak ITER. Due to the multiplication factor of exp(50) in the avalanche even a few seed <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> {{will result in a}} beam of high energetic electrons that is able to damage the machine. Thus suppression of <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> is a task of high importance, for which reason we present here a systematic study of <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> following massive gas injection in TEXTOR. Argon injection can cause generation of runaways carrying up to 30 % of the initial plasma current, while disruptions triggered by injection of helium or of mixtures of argon (5, 10, 20 %) with deuterium are runaway free. Disruptions caused by argon injection finally become runaway free for very large amounts of injected atoms. The appearance/absence of <b>runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> is related to the fraction of atoms delivered to the plasma center. This so called mixing efficiency is deduced from a 0 D model of the current quench. The estimated mixing efficiency is: 3 % for argon, 15 % for an argon/deuterium mixture and about 40 % for helium. A low mixing efficiency of high-Z impurities can have a strong implication for the design of the disruption mitigation system for ITER. However, a quantitative prediction requires {{a better understanding of the}} mixing mechanism. <b>Runaway</b> <b>electrons</b> in MGI experiments in TEXTOR 2 1...|$|R

40|$|For ITER-relevant <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> studies, such as suppression, mitigation, {{termination}} and/or {{control of}} runaway beam, obtaining the runaway electrons after the disruption is important. In this paper {{we report on}} the first achieved discharges with post-disruptive <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> beam, entitled "runaway plateau", in the COMPASS tokamak. The runaway plateau is produced by massive gas injection of argon. Almost all of the disruptions with <b>runaway</b> <b>electron</b> plateaus occurred during the plasma current ramp-up phase. Comparison between the Ar injection discharges with and without plateau has been done for various parameters. Parametrisation of the discharges shows that COMPASS disruptions fulfill the range of parameters important for the runaway plateau occurrence. These parameters include electron density, electric field, disruption speed, effective safety factor, maximum current quench electric field. In addition to these typical parameters, the plasma current value just before the massive gas injection surprisingly proved to be important.
