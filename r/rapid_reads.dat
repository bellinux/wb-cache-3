A change in angle or in a proportion is easier to interpret than a change in a digital readout.

50|$|Tinker {{provides}} the following explanations for why all capital printing {{is more difficult}} to read: Text in all capitals covers about 35 percent more printing surface than the same material set in lower case. This would tend to increase the reading time. When this is combined with the difficulty in reading words in all-capital letters as units, the hindrance to <b>rapid</b> <b>reading</b> becomes marked. In the eye-movement study by Tinker and Patterson, the principal difference in oculomotor patterns between lower case and all capitals was the very large increase in number of fixation pauses for reading the all-capital print.|$|R
30|$|College English {{provides}} more sustained and effective support for non-English majors {{than that which}} is available in many other contexts, including programs for foreign students in many English-speaking countries. Contemporary curriculum requirements essentially produce a general English program. Evaluation {{is considered to be}} a key to successful implementation and the summative phase usually takes the form of a pen and paper language examination; the CET is also available for web delivery but, at the time of writing, most students continue to take the paper-based test.

40|$|The World Wide Web {{and other}} {{technological}} advances have meant <b>rapid</b> <b>reading</b> or "skimming" of text is increasingly common in our information-rich time-limited society. This study investigates {{the effectiveness of}} skimming as a strategy for understanding a text. A replication and extension of Masson's (1982) work found that recognition of important, unimportant and inferable information declined equally when readers were required to skim rather than read text normally. This indicates that readers struggle to focus on important information when skimming. Moreover, a response bias suggests skimmers {{are more likely to}} over-interpret complicated information as consistent with the text. Thus, designers including large amounts of text should be aware that skimming is a limited strategy for achieving understanding...|$|R

50|$|From this beginning, the British Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park {{built up}} an {{extensive}} cryptanalytic facility. Initially, the decryption was mainly of Luftwaffe {{and a few}} Army messages, as the Kriegsmarine (German navy) employed much more secure procedures for using Enigma. Alan Turing, a Cambridge University mathematician and logician, provided much of the original thinking {{that led to the}} design of the cryptanalytical Bombe machines and the eventual breaking of naval Enigma. However, the German Navy introduced an Enigma version with a fourth rotor for its U-boats resulting in a prolonged period when these messages could not be decrypted.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} documented two patients (FOL and CLA) with posterior cortical atrophy who achieved accurate and <b>rapid</b> <b>reading</b> despite deficits in ten measures of visual processing, with two notable exceptions: (1) {{a measure of}} visual acuity, (2) a measure of visual crowding. Subsequent longitudinal investigation of these patients was carried out, involving annual tests of early visual, visuoperceptual and visuospatial processing and assessment of reading ability. Follow-up assessments identified {{the evolution of a}} particular early visual processing deficit, excessive visual crowding; this deficit has been previously implicated in forms of dyslexia. Consistent with the link between crowding and reading dysfunction, follow-up assessments also revealed deterioration in both patients' reading ability. The current findings demonstrate a neurodegenerative approach towards understanding the relationship between visual crowding and the reading system, and suggest possible mechanisms for how excessive crowding may disrupt word recognition...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} speed reading courses {{have been widely}} {{researched}} (cf. Berger, 1968). Stevens and Orem (1963) {{have suggested that the}} superior reader entering such a course with a more <b>rapid</b> <b>reading</b> rate, is an average or above average student, and likes to read. Rauch and Weinstein (1968) and Combs (1966) stress 2 ̆ 2 read, read, read 2 ̆ 2 as the best method for gaining speed. However, the National Association of Secondary School principals (1965) has warned that speed and comprehension do not necessarily go hand-in-hand, a finding which challenged earlier research by O 2 ̆ 7 Brien (1921). A study of Air Force personnel (Brim, 1968) suggests that comprehension remains fairly constant as speed increases. Ray (1962) summarized nineteen representative studies since 1945 and found that most of these reported gains in rate of reading. Fewer than half the studies showed gains in both speed and comprehension...|$|R
5000|$|Children {{with reading}} {{disorders}} rely {{primarily on the}} sub-lexical route while reading. Research shows that children can decode non-words, letter by letter, accurately but with slow speed. However, in decision tasks, they have trouble differentiating between words and pseudohomophones (non words that sound like real words but are incorrectly spelled), thereby showing that they had impaired internal lexicons.Because children with reading disorders (RD) have both slow reading speeds and impaired lexical routes, there are suggestions that the same processes are involved in lexical route and fast naming of words. [...] Other studies have also confirmed this idea that rapid naming of words is more strongly correlated with orthographical knowledge (lexical route) than with phonological representations (sub-lexical route). Similar results were observed for patients with ADHD.Research concludes that reading disorders and ADHD have common properties: lexical route processing, <b>rapid</b> <b>reading</b> and sublexical route processing deficits as well.|$|R
6000|$|As a child, Macaulay is {{strongly}} suggestive of Coleridge. At {{three years of}} age he began to read eagerly; at five he [...] "talked like a book"; at ten he had written a compendium of universal history, besides various hymns, verse romances, arguments for Christianity, and one ambitious epic poem. The habit of <b>rapid</b> <b>reading,</b> begun in childhood, continued throughout his life, and the number and vari ety of books which he read is almost incredible. His memory was phenomenal. He could repeat long poems and essays after a single reading; he could quote not only passages but {{the greater part of}} many books, including Pilgrim's Progress, Paradise Lost, and various novels like Clarissa. Once, to test his memory, he recited two newspaper poems which he had read in a coffeehouse forty years before, and which he had never thought of in the interval.|$|R

It is proposed that the alphabet originated in an intellectual sequence similar to that followed by Alexander Bell and Henry Sweet in constructing their Visible and Organic Alphabets. The originator of the alphabet used the same kind of introspective analysis of his own speech sounds and of {{the manner in which they}} were articulated. This was the vital step.

40|$|The {{report about}} {{studying}} English by oneself proposes that college students should make different {{use of the}} authorized English textbooks for senior {{high school students in}} order to acquire reading skills. In general, those readers are made up of varied interesting materials. The words they use are limited to some extent and the expressions are mostly basic and common. The writer advises seeing the textbooks just as selected readings for young people. By continuing to read each lesson at a time for the information they are interested in, juniors and seniors at university can gain broad knowledge and expand their horizons as well as get used to reading a wide variety of English passages. Nevertheless, college students are not expected to read all the lessons in a textbook. They can choose to read whichever passages they like. The second section of the report introduces sample articles from three kinds of current textbooks with different levels. English readers for senior high school students are classified into three categories: English I, English II and Reading. So it is advisable to read a textbook whose level suits each student. The last section shows how to use the textbooks including <b>rapid</b> <b>reading</b> and reading out aloud. The report concludes that those English textbooks with good reading materials offer the opportunity for college students to keep reading diverse articles out of intellectual curiosity for themselves, which will lead to the improvement of their English abilities...|$|R

40|$|Most {{people believe}} that the slower we read the better we comprehend. However, a lot of novel <b>rapid</b> <b>reading</b> {{techniques}} and methods were developed to increase the reading speed without diminishing the comprehension. In this research an empirical study was performed to investigate {{if there is a}} difference in speed reading between male and female. The initial hypothesis in this research was the assumptions that there is NO difference between male and female in reading speed. Ten undergraduate and graduate students participated in achieving this experiment; five females and five males using head mounted eye trackers ASL 6000 series. The experiment results showed that there is a difference in speed reading between males and females. Females spend longer time between consecutive segments than males and they spend longer time on each segment than males in the reading process.

We have developed a new compression method for FITS binary tables that is modeled after the FITS tiled-image compression compression convention that has been in use for the past decade. Tests of this new method on a sample of FITS binary tables from a variety of current missions show that on average this new compression technique saves about 50 % more disk space than when simply compressing the whole FITS file with gzip. Other advantages of this method are (1) the compressed FITS table is itself a valid FITS table, (2) the FITS headers remain uncompressed, thus allowing <b>rapid</b> <b>read</b> and write access to the keyword values, and (3) in the common case where the FITS file contains multiple tables, each table is compressed separately and may be accessed without having to uncompress the whole file...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempted}} {{to investigate the}} underlying cognitive and linguistic skills necessary for three different aspects of reading fluency: rate, phrasing, quality of expression.
