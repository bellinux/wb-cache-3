After traveling both worlds, the party learns that Murdaw was not the only evil in the world, having fought several other monsters that all seem to be connected.|$|E

The Dutch rider captured her sixth success on Qatar soil and comforted her overall lead. Wild indeed wins the Ladies Tour of Qatar {{for the third time}} after 2009 and 2010 and shows that she <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Queen of the event. In the final overall standings, she can enjoy a lead of 14” on Chloe Hosking and 29” on Ellen van Dijk.|$|E

Really the script is based on those common, very basic experiences and concepts, and where can those take you? And the only outlandish idea that the film presents, <b>really,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> existence of a technology {{that allows you to}} enter and share the same dream as someone else." ...|$|E

Fourth Wall Studios was formed by former members of 42 Entertainment, who produced the highly successful I Love Bees alternate reality game to promote Halo 2.

Fishburne stated that he modeled his {{character}} after Ed Bradley, stating that [...] "my inspiration <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> late Ed Bradley, who was a CBS correspondent on 60 Minutes for many years ... legendary Ed Bradley... was a friend, a mentor, and {{a role model for}} me, particularly because he worked in journalism, and {{he was the kind of}} guy who walked with kings, but he had the common touch. And so he was my inspiration for Perry." ...|$|E
500|$|Edwin Catmull, {{president}} of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios, felt that Jobs would [...] "be appalled" [...] at his depiction in the film, arguing {{that he was}} a kinder person later in life than is portrayed in the picture. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Catmull commented, [...] "When [...] left Apple, he then entered into what <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> classic hero's journey: He's wandering in the wilderness, he's working with NeXT, it's not working. He's working with Pixar, we're failing. In that process, Steve learned some major lessons, and he changed. He became an empathetic person, [...] that aspect of the change of Steve was missed." ...|$|E

500|$|Jethro Tull's {{frontman}} {{and songwriter}} Ian Anderson {{was surprised when}} critics called the band's previous album, Aqualung (1971), a [...] "concept album". He rejected this, thinking {{it was simply a}} collection of songs, so in response decided to [...] "come up with something that <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mother of all concept albums". Taking the surreal English humour of Monty Python as an influence, he began to write a piece that would combine complex music with a sense of humour, with the idea it would poke light-hearted fun at the band, the audience, and the music critics. He also intended to satirise the progressive rock genre that was popular at the time.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} rest of the cast, Yelchin was allowed to choose what {{elements}} there were from their predecessor's performances. Yelchin decided to carry on Walter Koenig's speech patterns of replacing [...] "v"s with [...] "w"s, although he and Abrams felt this was a trait more common of Polish accents than Russian ones. He described Chekov as an odd character, being a Russian who was brought on to the show [...] "in the middle of the Cold War." [...] He recalled a [...] "scene where they're talking to Apollo , 'I am Apollo.' And Chekov is like, 'And I am the czar of all the Russias.' [...] They gave him these lines. I mean he <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> weirdest, weirdest character." ...|$|E
500|$|Pei's {{style is}} {{described}} as thoroughly modernist, with significant cubist themes. He is known for combining traditional architectural elements with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns. As one critic writes: [...] "Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method." [...] In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei [...] "the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice". At the same time, Pei himself rejects simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: [...] "The talk about modernism versus post-modernism is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style {{in which it is}} going to be designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, <b>really,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> community.

500|$|Despite Righetti's {{pitching}} on {{the last}} day of the season, the Red Sox still won the division and marched on in the playoffs. The Yankees' bad performance during the 1980s came when the Red Sox faced the Yankees' cross-town rivals, the New York Mets, in the World Series. The New York Times called the series a [...] "painful series". Newsday called it [...] "woeful days for Yankee fans". Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News called the series [...] "the World Series that is the Yankee nightmare". Both Newsday and The Boston Globe said there were Mets T-shirts saying [...] "Steinbrenner's nightmare," [...] referring to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. John Powers of the Globe quoted Claire Smith, who covered the Yankees for the Hartford Courant, as having said [...] "this <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> World Series of the nightmares".|$|E
500|$|The reissue was {{critically}} well received, although reception {{was mixed}} about the supplemental material. Reviews in AllMusic, Uncut, Q, Rolling Stone, Paste and PopMatters praised the supplemental material, but with reservations. A review written by Scott Plagenhoef for Pitchfork awarded the reissue a perfect score, {{arguing that it}} was worth buying for fans who did not already own the rare material. Plagenhoef said, [...] "That the band {{had nothing to do}} with these is beside the point: this is the final word on these records, if for no other reason that the Beatles' September 9 remaster campaign is, arguably, the end of the CD era." [...] The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell praised both the bonus disc and the DVD, and said of the album, [...] "It <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> perfect synthesis of Radiohead's seemingly conflicted impulses." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Fazekas {{talked about}} how the series would relate to the One-Shot, saying, [...] "The short <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> basis for the series.

[...] Markus reiterated this in January 2015, but added that [...] "we all agree and understand that [...] going to get tougher if we continue" [...] making the series. The first season introduces the origins of the Black Widow and Winter Soldier programs, which both appear in several MCU films, while the second season shows the discovery of the Darkforce (known as Zero Matter in the series), which previously appeared in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and has ties to Doctor Strange.|$|E

500|$|Barrowman {{states that}} when fans {{ask him if}} Jack is really the Face of Boe, he tells them he {{believes}} he is and states that he and Davies hold {{it to be true}} [...] "in [...] little world"; the link is [...] "unconfirmed" [...] within the text of the show. As to how Jack becomes the Face, Barrowman feels the answer doesn't matter as it is intentionally mysterious. Barrowman likes the characters being connected because it means in spite of how the Doctor initially treats Jack, [...] "Boe becomes his confidante and the one the Doctor returns to for advice and information" [...] which he feels is a [...] "wonderful twist of events". However, Davies chooses not to confirm (within the story's narrative) whether or not Jack <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Face of Boe, stating [...] "the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies". He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two.|$|E
500|$|The final trailer was [...] "unlocked" [...] by fans on March 4, 2015, via {{the use of}} hashtags on Twitter, {{ahead of}} its {{broadcast}} debut during the series premiere of American Crime on March 5. Mendelson felt [...] "this [...] a fine final trailer, teasing what we already know, hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we don't already know" [...] adding, [...] "Here we have the fourth and final Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer and we don't know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. I have expressed my concern dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between October and May. But if this <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> final Avengers 2 trailer, then {{at least on the}} trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled." [...] A week after the final trailer debuted, Marvel revealed that the trailer had [...] "smashed records" [...] with over 35 million views.|$|E
500|$|Freelance {{journalist}} S.I. Rosenbaum, {{writing for}} the Washington Post, criticized Oliver's [...] "Donald Drumpf" [...] appellation as derisive of German Americans and other immigrant groups who anglicized their names upon immigration. Rosenbaum wrote that the phrase was reminiscent of Trump's own xenophobic statements {{in that it was}} part of a long-running trend of [...] "bestowing foreign-sounding names to imply that the target isn't really an American". Oliver later said that the joke [...] "got out of hand" [...] and never used it on the show again. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, he said, [...] "That joke became old for us very quickly. There's a reason we didn't use it again. It <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> song I skip past. It's 'Creep.' It's a good song, Thom Yorke! It was a good song when he wrote it." [...] Alluding to the fact that the segment aired on the same night as the Oscars, the comedian also stated, [...] "We were not doing [...] with the sense that it would become bigger than our show normally is," [...] but the [...] "Drumpf" [...] appellation's later popularity [...] "kind of slightly ruins the memory".|$|E

500|$|Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. On the critic review aggregator site Metacritic, the album holds {{a score of}} 71/100, based on 39 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable" [...] reviews. At Digital Spy, Adam Silverstein commends that [...] "more often than not, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is this band sharpening their particular surefire indie to glittering distinction." [...] Commenting on the band's future, {{he says that the}} [...] "half-sorry, half-bitter 'Goodbye Lovers & Friends' is probably not Franz Ferdinand's very last act, even if Kapranos proclaiming in the final seconds 'But this <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> end' would make one awesome blowout. Although after delivering a record as good as this, they can take as long as they want". At The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski wrote positively of the musical differences between many of this album's tracks compared to the band's prior work, adding: [...] "Admittedly, these more nuanced Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action sounds aren't as easily accessible; it's much easier to gravitate toward more familiar raucous post-punk ('Bullet,' 'Right Action') or the Clash-reminiscent punk-funk of 'Evil Eye.' But by expanding its worldview, Franz Ferdinand has very nicely settled onto a path toward career longevity." ...|$|E
500|$|On several occasions, {{people within}} the {{television}} and entertainment industry have suggested that Holby City {{is a waste of}} the television licence fee, with some suggesting that it ought to be cancelled. In August 2002, Paul Bolt, director of the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised BBC programming as being [...] "humdrum" [...] and [...] "formulaic", saying of Holby City and the police procedural Mersey Beat: [...] "One begins to wonder what <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> point of the BBC bringing this to us. Let's have something a bit different." [...] Then head of BBC drama Jane Tranter responded that Bolt's examples were [...] "highly selective" [...] as well as [...] "hugely patronising to the millions of viewers who enjoy popular dramas like Holby City – week in, week out". Young, who at the time held the position of head of drama serials, told The Guardian: [...] "Popular drama has always been singled out for criticism, but people are increasingly voting with their on-buttons." [...] Also in 2002, David Cox of the New Statesman criticised BBC One's 2001 Christmas schedule, for airing Holby City against a contemporary version of Othello. On this basis, Cox advocated the abolition of the licence fee, explaining: [...] "The BBC was invented in a period when the elite decided what the population should know. If that has gone, then the licence fee should go too." [...] At the 2003 Edinburgh International Television Festival, BSykB chief executive Tony Ball called for stricter restrictions on how the BBC spent licence payers' money, suggesting that Holby City be sold to the channel's commercial rivals, with the proceeds used to develop more original programming. The BBC refused Ball's suggestion, responding in a statement: [...] "This speech clearly reflects BSkyB's view that programmes are merely a commodity to be bought and sold." [...] In June 2004, Charles Allen, chief executive of ITV plc questioned the amount of funding spent on lengthened episodes of Holby City, and in January 2010, Janet Street-Porter of The Independent, opined Holby City had [...] "come to the end of [...] natural life" [...] and should be cancelled.|$|E
