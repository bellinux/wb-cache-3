50|$|The Trust {{was founded}} in 1961 and was then named the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation. Founder members {{included}} Sir Peter Scott {{and a group of}} other local people with the shared interest of nature conservation. The name was changed to the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust in 1991. In 1990 Lady Scott became the Trust's patron succeeding her late husband, Sir Peter Scott. Originally the Trust headquarters was at Church House, Standish, which was opened in 1971. By that year 33 nature reserves were under trust management. In 1989 HRH Prince of Wales was present at the launch of the appeal for funding for the proposed new nature centre, which was held in Shire Hall, Gloucester. In 1992 a new headquarters and Conservation Centre was opened at Robinswood Hill Country Park by Sir David Attenborough. In 1993 Sir Henry Elwes became the President following the late Lord Dulverton. In 1995 HRH Prince of Wales visited the Midger SSSI reserve, being one of the woodland reserves in the county. In 1997 HRH Prince of Wales opened the Lower Woods SSSI Nature Reserve. In 1999 Chris Packham launched an event on Cleeve Common hosted by the Trust, which involved geological work at <b>Rolling</b> <b>Bank</b> Quarry SSSI. In 2004 a Special 10 year award from 'Investors in People' was achieved. In 2008 the Badgeworth SSSI nature reserve, the first reserve managed by the Trust, celebrated its 75th anniversary. In 2012 this reserve celebrated its 50th anniversary of being managed by the Trust.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} by the NASA to obtain statistical measurements of landing-contact conditions for a large turbojet transport in commercial airline operations. The investigation was conducted at the Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California. Measurements were taken photographically during routine daylight operations. The quantities determined were vertical velocity, horizontal velocity, <b>rolling</b> velocity, <b>bank</b> angle, and distance from runway threshold, just prior to ground contact. The results indicated that the mean vertical velocity for the turbojet-transport landings was 1. 62 feet per second and that 1 landing out of 100 would be expected to equal or exceed about 4. 0 feet per second. The mean airspeed at contact was 132. 0 knots, with 1 landing in 100 likely to equal or exceed about 153. 0 knots. The mean rolling velocity was about 1. 6 deg per second. One lending in 100 would probably equal or exceed a rolling velocity of about 4. 0 deg. per second {{in the direction of the}} first wheel to touch. The mean bank angle for the turbojet transports was 1. 04 deg, and right and left angles of bank were about evenly divided. One lending in 100 would be likely to equal or exceed a bank angle of about 3. 5 deg. The mean value of distance to touchdown from the runway threshold was 1, 560 feet. One lending in 100 would be expected to touchdown at or beyond about 2, 700 feet from the runway threshold. The mean values for vertical velocity, airspeed, and distance t o touch-down for the turbojet transports were somewhat higher than those found previously for piston-engine transports.

40|$|AbstractThe {{movement}} {{characteristics and}} control response of oblique wing aircraft (OWA) are highly coupled between the longitudinal and lateral-directional axes and present obvious nonlinearity. Only with {{the implementation of}} flight control systems can flying qualities be satisfied. This article investigates the dynamic modeling of an OWA and analyzes its dynamic characteristics. Furthermore, a flight control law based on model-reference dynamic inversion is designed and verified. Calculations and simulations show that OWA can be trimmed by <b>rolling</b> a <b>bank</b> angle and deflecting the triaxial control surfaces in a coordinated way. The oblique wing greatly affects longitudinal motion. The short-period mode is highly coupled between longitudinal and lateral motion, and the bank angle also occurs in phugoid mode. However, the effects of an oblique wing on lateral mode shape are relatively small. For inherent control characteristics, symmetric deflection of the horizontal tail will generate not only longitudinal motion but also a large rolling rate. Rolling moment and pitching moment caused by aileron deflection will reinforce motion coupling, but rudder deflection has relatively little effect on longitudinal motion. Closed-loop simulations demonstrate that the flight control law can achieve decoupling control for OWA and guarantee a satisfactory dynamic performance...|$|R

In one part this channel was so crooked that it became necessary to go on the other tack a short distance. In ordinary circumstances the captain would have thought nothing of this, but he felt anxious just then, because some of the stores and cordage furnished by mistake to him had been intended for the Ruby.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has {{recently}} completed a statistical investigation of landing-contact conditions for two large turbojet transports and a turboprop transport landing on a dry runway during routine daylight operations at the Los Angeles International Airport. Measurements were made to obtain vertical velocity, airspeed, <b>rolling</b> velocity, <b>bank</b> angle, and distance from the runway threshold, just prior to ground contact. The vertical velocities at touchdown {{for one of the}} turbojet airplanes measured in this investigation were essentially the same as those measured on the same type of airplane during a similar investigation (see NASA Technical Note D- 527) conducted approximately 8 months earlier. Thus, it appeared that 8 months of additional pilot experience has had no noticeable tendency toward lowering the vertical velocities of this transport. Distributions of vertical velocities for the turbojet transports covered in this investigation were similar and considerably higher than'those for the turboprop transport. The data for the turboprop transport were in good agreement with the data for the piston-engine transports (see NACA Report 1214 and NASA Technical Note D- 147) for all the measured parameters. For the turbojet transports, 1 landing in 100 would be expected to equal or exceed a vertical velocity of approximately 4. 2 ft/sec; whereas, for the turboprop transport, 1 landing in 100 would be expected to equal or exceed 3. 2 ft/sec. The mean airspeeds at touchdown for the three transports ranged from 22. 5 percent to 26. 6 percent above the stalling speed. Rolling velocities for the turbojet transports were considerably higher than those for the turboprop transport. Distributions of bank angles at contact for the three transports were similar. For each type of airplane, 1 landing in 100 would be expected to equal or exceed a bank angle at touchdown of approximately 3. 0 deg. Distributions of touchdown distances for the three transports were also quite similar. Touchdown distances from the threshold for 1 landing in 100 ranged from 2, 500 feet for the turboprop transport to 2, 800 feet for one of the turbojet transports...|$|R

60|$|Hence we {{were driven}} to the huge palace of Necessidades, which is but a wing of a {{building}} that no King of Portugal ought ever to be rich enough to complete, and which, if perfect, might outvie the Tower of Babel. The mines of Brazil must have been productive of gold and silver indeed when the founder imagined this enormous edifice. From the elevation on which it stands it commands the noblest views,--the city is spread before it, with its many churches and towers, and for many miles you see the magnificent Tagus, <b>rolling</b> by <b>banks</b> crowned with trees and towers. But to arrive at this enormous building you have to climb a steep suburb of wretched huts, many of them with dismal gardens of dry cracked earth, where a few reedy sprouts of Indian corn {{seemed to be the}} chief cultivation, and which were guarded by huge plants of spiky aloes, on which the rags of the proprietors of the huts were sunning themselves. The terrace before the palace was similarly encroached upon by these wretched habitations. A few millions judiciously expended might make of this arid hill one of the most magnificent gardens in the world; and the palace seems to me to excel for situation any Royal edifice I have ever seen. But the huts of these swarming poor have crawled up close to its gates,-- the superb walls of hewn stone stop all of a sudden with a lath- and-plaster hitch; and capitals, and hewn stones for columns, still lying about on the deserted terrace, may lie there for ages to come, probably, and never take their places by the side of their brethren in yonder tall bankrupt galleries. The air of this pure sky has little effect upon the edifices,--the edges of the stone look as sharp as if the builders had just left their work; and close to the grand entrance stands an outbuilding, part of which may have been burnt fifty years ago, but is in such cheerful preservation that you might fancy the fire had occurred yesterday. It must have been an awful sight from this hill to have looked at the city spread before it, and seen it reeling and swaying in the time of the earthquake. I thought it looked so hot and shaky, that one might fancy a return of the fit. In several places still remain gaps and chasms, and ruins lie here and there as they cracked and fell.|$|R
60|$|But here {{their case}} was little improved, {{for the current}} was almost as violent as that from which they had escaped. The craggy banks being low enough, however, to admit of the tracking-line being used, the men landed and towed the canoe till {{they came to the}} foot of the most rapid cascade they had yet seen. To ascend being impossible, they {{unloaded}} and carried everything over a rocky point; relaunched, reloaded, and continued to track with the line: but the dangers attending this operation had now seriously increased, for stones both small and great came continually <b>rolling</b> down the <b>bank,</b> and the steepness of the ground was such that the risk of the men slipping and falling into the water became imminent; besides which they had frequently to pass outside of trees which overhung the precipices; at such times a false step or a slip might have proved fatal. Presently they came to a sheer impassable precipice, where the men had to embark and take to poling up the stream; but ere long they got into water too deep for the poles, and recourse was again had to the tracking-line. Coming to another precipice, they were again checked; but Mackenzie, finding that the rock was soft, cut steps in it for the distance of about twenty feet, and thus passing along, leaped, at the risk of his life, on a small rock below, where he received those who followed him on his shoulders. Thus four of them passed, and managed to drag up the canoe, though they damaged her in doing so. They had now reached a spot where the canoe could be repaired, and fortunately found a dead tree which had fallen from the cliffs above. But for this, fire could not have been kindled there, as no wood was to be procured within a mile of the place; in which case the repairs could not have been accomplished.|$|R
40|$|Sizable {{risk capital}} from outside may be {{necessary}} to accelerate Japan''s corporate restructuring to replace the stock of impaired bank loans. To attract risk capital, impaired loans must find market-clearing prices. However, the asymmetry in the bid-ask prices faced by banks and distressed-debt investors continues to stall efforts to create a liquid distressed-debt market. This paper asserts that the wedge between the prices faced by different participants is primarily a result of different valuation methods employed by banks and distressed-debt investors. On the one hand, banks do not recognize "maturity default" that results in <b>banks</b> <b>rolling</b> over impaired-loan accounts, effectively turning them into perpetual debt, which is expected to capture any upside potential for value. On the other hand, distressed-debt investors presently view their investments as equity stakes that require improved cash flows, unlike the buy-and-sell distressed-collateral market that existed in the mid- 1990 s. We suggest that bids from distressed-debt investors may not be as low as they are deemed by local banks and the asymmetry in prices may be reduced if banks value their claims as corporate equity.

40|$|During {{maintenance}} troubleshooting for fluctuating hydraulic pressures, {{a technician}} {{found that a}} right hand aileron return line, on the flight hydraulic side, was ruptured (Fig. 1, 2).

Ailerons are small hinged sections on the outboard portion of a wing used to generate <b>rolling</b> motion thereby <b>banking</b> the aircraft. The ailerons work by changing the effective shape of the airfoil of the outer portion of the wing [1]. The drawing, Northrop P/N 3 - 43033 - 55 (6 / 1960), specifies that the line is made from 0. 375 inch OD, aluminum 5052 - 0 tubing with a 0. 049 inch wall thickness. WW-T- 787 requires the tube shall be seamless and uniform in quality and temper [2]. The test pressure for this line is 3000 psi, and the operational pressure for this line is estimated to be between 45 psi and 1500 psi based on dynamic loading during flight. Examination of the fracture surface found evidence of arrest bands originating on the inner diameter (Fig 3). Ductile dimples are observed on the tube fractures (Fig. 4). The etched cross-section revealed thinning and work-hardening in the burst region (Fig. 5). The wall thickness just outside the work-hardened fracture region measured 0. 035 ". Barlow's Formula: P = 2 St/D, where P is burst pressure, S is allowable stress, t is wall thickness and D is the outer diameter of tube. Using the ultimate tensile strength of 28 ksi and a measured wall thickness of 0. 035 inches at burst, P = 5. 2 ksi (burst pressure). Using the yield of 13 ksi (YS) for aluminum 5052 - 0, plastic deformation will happen at P = 2. 4 ksi suggesting plastic deformation occurred at a proof pressure of 3. 0 ksi. Conclusion: The burst resulted from high stress, low-cycle fatigue. Evidence of arrest bands originating on the inner diameter. Fracture is predominately shear dimples, characteristic of high load ductile fractures (Fig 6). Section wall reduction in the burst region. Plastic deformation and thinning of the out-of-specification tube wall likely happened during the initial proof testing years ago. Metallography of tubing away from rupture site confirmed tubing was seamless. Based on the tube microstructure, {{it is likely that the}} initial wall thickness was about 30 % thinner than the requirement of 0. 049 inches. Fracture initiated on the ID and progressed to the OD (shear lip). The tube is made of the correct material of 5052 - 0 aluminum as verified using Optical Emission Spectroscopy (Table 2). The tubing hardness tested 77 HV 100 (77 HRE). This hardness is slightly above the requirement for 70 HRE maximum for aluminum 5052 - 0 in AMS 2658 C [3]...|$|R
