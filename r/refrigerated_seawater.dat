Experiments were conducted to identify the cause of tough texture and to improve the overall quality of the catch. The possibility that a cold shock reaction may occur was investigated by observing the contraction of fillets under a range of temperature conditions before freezing. The effect of on-board handling practices were evaluated using frozen shark fillets, which had been stored prior to freezing in <b>refrigerated</b> <b>seawater</b> at different rigor stages, temperatures and times as trunks. Fillets were analyzed for nucleotides, lactate, thaw pH, sarcomere length and raw and cooked shear force values. The existence of thaw rigor was also investigated.

A cold shock reaction could not be demonstrated in these species. The main influences on texture were of biological origin. The species, sex and size were found to have significant links with texture of fillets.

40|$|Fishing {{technology}} onboard {{fishing vessels}} fishing pelagic species has received increased attention, especially {{the influence of}} storage method on fish quality and the vessel’s energy consumption. More flexible storage methods are needed to give higher quality to the landed pelagic species thereby lowering energy consumption and investment costs. Today, when sizing storage systems, high capacity in the pre-chilling period {{is used as a}} designing criteria resulting in large installed refrigeration capacity and limited flexibility. To analyse the demands of better fish quality and lower energy consumption of these systems, a new storage method is simulated to compare it with standard storage methods like <b>refrigerated</b> <b>seawater</b> (RSW) and chilled seawater (CSW). The purpose of the simulation is to analyse the chilling of the catches and operational cost of the systems to see if combined system (RSW/CSW) gives better results. A mathematical model is developed and applied to simulate a periodic and quasi-steady fishing voyage including a pre-chilling period followed by chilling of one catch. The models are developed in a new software tool, called MarenEDT™, which can handle optimisation of non-linear and non-convex models and simulation of steady-state and transient models.

40|$|In the Celtic Sea and ICES Division VIIj the herring {{fishery is}} divided into 3 main {{catching}} seasons. In quarters four and one, the fishery is focused on autumn and winter pre-spawning and spawning aggregations. In the 2004 / 05 season 34 vessels participated in the fishery, ranging from small dry hold polyvalent vessels (< 20 m) to purpose built RSW (<b>Refrigerated</b> <b>seawater)</b> vessels of 23 - 40 m. Single and pair midwater trawling are common, with the latter representing the preferred catching method. In recent years a quarter- 3 summer fishery has developed targeting offshore feeding aggregations, 78 nmi (nautical miles) offshore on the Labadie Bank. This offshore fishery is restricted to the RSW fleet {{on the grounds of}} product quality delivered to processors. The 2006 autumn survey is the most comprehensive survey carried out in the current time series. The geographical extent of the annual 21 day survey was extended further offshore to include areas to the south of the main coastal spawning grounds to target winter spawning fish on an inward spawning migration. Spatial resolution of acoustic transects were increased over the entire south coast survey areas, with a special focus on spawning grounds throughout the survey confines.

Swordfish landed alive, {{and to a lesser}} extent prerigor, have better quality when unloaded. Warmer fishing waters did not lead to poorer quality at unloading. There was a serious loss of quality during long fishing trips. Sex had no influence on swordfish quality. Three methods of chilling were evaluated: <b>refrigerated</b> <b>seawater</b> (RSW) chilling for up to 2 days followed by storage under ice, refrigerated brine (seawater with extra salt added) for up to 2 days followed by storage in a freshwater ice slurry, and ice slurry (freshwater ice mixed with seawater) for up to 2 days followed by storage under ice only. Two fishing trips were monitored for each method. The freshness indicator K value was used to determine which method produced the best quality swordfish when unloaded at the factory. Storage method played a larger role in quality loss than capture conditions. Refrigerated brine produced the best quality swordfish when the machinery functioned properly closely followed by RSW. Ice slurry chilling of large fish such as swordfish exhibited initial delays in the reduction of core temperature which led to lower quality. This method could be improved with the addition of mechanical circulation.

Consuming raw or undercooked seafood contaminated with V. parahaemolyticus can result in development of acute gastroenteritis with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping and watery diarrhea within 24 hours of infection. Illness is usually self-limited and lasts for about 3 days. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 45, 000 cases of V. parahaemolyticus occur annually in the U. S. Depuration is a process which holds shellfish in clean seawater to allow them to purge sand and bacteria. Recently, we developed a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>seawater</b> (7 to 15 °C) depuration capable of decreasing V. parahaemolyticus populations in oysters by > 3. 0 log MPN/g after 5 days of the process with no adverse effect on oysters.

40|$|The {{northwest}} and west coast (ICES Divisions VIaS & VIIb, c) herring acoustic survey programme was first established in 1994. A larval survey programme was initially carried out between 1981 and 1986. In the early 1990 s, the ICES herring working group (HAWG) identified {{the need for}} a dedicated herring acoustic survey in this area (Anon, 1994). From 1994 to 1996 surveys were carried out on this stock during the summer feeding phase. In 1997 a two-survey spawning aggregation program was established covering both autumn and winter components. In 2004, a single spawning stock survey was carried out early in quarter 1 and continued until 2007, whereupon it was decided that this survey should be incorporated into the larger coordinated Malin shelf survey. This survey will be the first in a new time series and a step away from the traditional spawning stock surveys. The Irish survey will be carried out concurrently with the West of Scotland (MarLab) and Irish Sea surveys (AFBI) and was coordinated through the ICES Planning Group of Herring Acoustic Surveys (PGHERS). Combined survey data on herring distribution, abundance and age will be used to provide a measure of the relative abundance of herring within the Malin shelf stock complex. Survey data on stock numbers at age are submitted to the ICES Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) and used in the annual stock assessment process. The {{northwest and}} west coast (ICES Divisions VIaS & VIIb, c) herring stock is composed of 2 of spawning components (Autumn and Winter spawners) covering a large geographical area, which extends over a 4 -month period from late September through to late March (Molloy et al, 2000). Traditionally fishing effort has been concentrated on spawning and pre-spawning aggregations. In Vlas, fishing begins in late Novemember and continues until late March (winter spawners). Further south in Vlllb, peak fishing takes place from October to December (Autumn spawners). The protracted spawning period of herring and the overlap between the two spawning stocks in this area (October to February) is highly dynamic with variations between annual spawning events of up to 3 weeks. Up to 40 vessels commonly participate in the fishery, many of which are based in the Co. Donegal port of Killybegs. The fleet is made up of 20 RSW (<b>Refrigerated</b> <b>Seawater)</b> vessels of 40 - 70 m in length; 20 polyvalent trawlers 10 of which are vessels of 22 - 40 m and 10 of less than 25 m.

40|$|In the Celtic Sea and ICES Division VIIj, to {{the south}} and {{southwest}} of Ireland, herring are an important commercial species to the pelagic fleet. The local fleet is composed of dry hold polyvalent vessels and a number of purpose built RSW (<b>Refrigerated</b> <b>seawater)</b> vessels. This stock is composed of both autumn and winter spawning components. The commercial fishery has historically taken place within 6 nmi (nautical miles) of the coast and focused on aggregated schools within the spawning cycle. In recent years the RSW fleet has actively targeted offshore summer feeding grounds in the south Celtic Sea. In division VIIj, the fishery traditionally begins in early October and is concentrated within several miles of the shore bays and inlets. The division VIIaS fishery peaks towards the year end in December, but may be active from mid October depending on location. In division VIIg, along the south coast herring are targeted from October to January at a number of known spawning sites and surrounding areas. Overall, the protracted spawning period of the two components extends from October through to January, with annual variation of up to 3 weeks. Spawning occurs in successive waves in a number of well known locations including large scale grounds and small discreet spawning beds. The stock structure and discrimination of herring in this area is not fully understood. It is known that fish in the eastern Celtic Sea recruit from nursery areas in the Irish Sea and tagging studies have shown linkages between these areas also. For the purpose of stock assessment and management these areas have been combined since 1982. For a period in the 1980 ’s, egg and larval surveys were conducted for herring in this area. However, since 1989, acoustic surveys have been carried out, and currently are the only tuning indices available. In the Celtic Sea and VIIj, herring acoustic surveys have been carried out since 1989, and the current survey is the 16 th in the series. The autumn 2005 survey is the most comprehensive survey carried out in the current time series. The geographical confines of the annual 21 day survey were expanded to include areas {{to the south}} of the main winter spawning grounds in an effort to identify the whereabouts of winter spawning fish before the annual inshore spawning migration. Spatial resolution of acoustic transects were increased over the entire south coast survey areas. The acoustic component of the survey was complimented by a continuation of the detailed hydrographic work carried out in the Celtic Sea in 2004. In addition a second inshore survey was carried out along the southern coast using a chartered commercial fishing vessel (FV Regina Ponti). This second survey focused on area between 0. 5 nmi and 10 nmi offshore and covered the main autumn and winter spawning areas along the south coast.

The stock is composed of both autumn and winter spawning components and the fishery targets pre-spawning and spawning aggregations. The Irish commercial fishery has historically taken place within 1 - 20 nmi (nautical miles) of the coast and focused on aggregated schools within the spawning cycle. In recent years the larger RSW vessels have actively targeted offshore summer feeding aggregations in the south Celtic Sea.

Spawning occurs in successive waves in a number of well known locations including large scale grounds and small discreet spawning beds. The stock structure and discrimination of herring in this area has been investigated recently. Hatfield et al. (2007) has shown the Celtic Sea stock to be fairly discrete. However, it is known that fish in the eastern Celtic Sea recruit from nursery areas in the Irish Sea, returning to the Celtic Sea as young adults (Brophy et al. 2002; Molloy et al., 1993). The stock identity of VIIj herring is less clear, though there is evidence that they have linkages with VIIb and VIaS (ICES, 1994; Grainger, 1978). Molloy (1968) identified possible linkages between young fish in VIIj and those of the Celtic Sea herring. For the purpose of stock assessment and management divisions VIIaS, VIIg and VII j have been combined since 1982. For a period in the 1970 s and 1980 s, larval surveys were conducted for herring in this area. However, since 1989, acoustic surveys have been carried out, and currently are the only tuning indices available for this stock. In the Celtic Sea and VIIj, herring acoustic surveys have been carried out since 1989, and this survey represents the 18 th in the overall acoustic series or the fourth in the modified time series.

40|$|This survey {{represents}} the first dedicated exploratory research survey for boarfish (Capros aper) undertaken {{along the western}} seaboard. The commercial fishing vessel the MFV Felucca, {{an active participant in}} the fishery was equipped with a calibrated scientific echosounder. A consultant biologist from the Killybegs Fisherman’s Organisation (KFO) and a Marine Institute scientist headed the biological and acoustic research respectively during the cruise. Exploratory fishing for boarfish by Irish vessels began in the later 1980 s when commercial quantities were encountered during the spring horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) and mackerel (Scrombrus scomber) fishery in northern Biscay. Several landings were made into Ireland for fishmeal during this time but due to logistical problems related to handling (prominent dorsal spines) this species was not favoured by processors. Interest increased again around the mid 1990 s when Dutch pelagic vessels landed frozen samples to determine if a market could be developed for human consumption. From the early 1970 s onwards the abundance of boarfish was seen to increase exponentially and distribution ever increasingly spread northwards along the western seaboard (Blanchard and Vandermeirsch, 2005). With this increase in abundance boarfish were taken as bycatch in both the pelagic and demersal fisheries in ever increasing quantities and this caused serious problems relating to damaged target species due to the aforementioned formidable dorsal spines. During the early 2000 s the Irish landings were relatively small (< 700 t per yr) and it wasn’t until 2006 that the directed fishery developed in earnest. Fishing was undertaken primarily by vessels from the Castletownbere and Killybegs based RSW fleets (<b>refrigerated</b> <b>seawater</b> vessels) which targeted boarfish from northern Biscay to the southern Celtic Sea. In 2007 - 08 Scotland and Denmark also began targeting boarfish in quantity. Irish landings are primarily landed into fishmeal plants in Denmark and the Faroe Islands with increasing amounts being landed in Killybegs. The boarfish fishery bridged an important gap between the short season fisheries for horse mackerel, mackerel and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) affectively extending the fishing season for the RSW fleet from late August through to May. A precautionary interim management plan was adopted in November 2010 covering ICES Divisions VI, VII and VIII and an EU TAC of 33, 000 t was set. Of this the Irish allocation for 2011 was 22, 000 t. This precautionary TAC was based on 50 - 75 % of total landings from the period 2007 - 2009 which peaked at over 83, 400 t (2009). Landings in 2010 reached over 137, 000 t in a scramble to build up a track record in the fishery prior to a fixed quota allocation. In 2010 Sweden now also shares the TAC allowance with those actively involved in the fishery. In addition to the TAC control, seasonal closures were also implemented; from September 1 -October 31 ICES (area VIIg) to protect herring feeding and pre spawning aggregations and from March 15 –August 31 where mackerel are frequently encountered as a large bycatch. A catch rule ceiling of 5 % bycatch was also implemented within the fishery where boarfish are taken with other TAC controlled species. Data from this survey, in addition to the extensive biological research carried out on this species forms part of a larger program aimed at increasing the knowledge of this species and its abundance outside of the commercial fishery. Data from this survey will be presented for inclusion into the ICES Planning Group meeting for North Atlantic Pelagic Ecosystem Surveys in August 2011 (WGNAPES) and for the ICES assessment Working Group for Widely Distributed Stocks (WGWIDE) also meeting in August 2011.
