5|$|While the Myrmica ant colony can {{identify}} {{each other through}} chemical signaling, social ranks are partially determined by sound acoustics. Therefore, once the P. rebeli begin to mimic {{the sound of the}} queen ant, the worker ants begin to treat the P. rebeli {{as if it were the}} queen ant. On the other hand, the queen ant treats the P. rebeli larvae and pupae as if they were rivals, as she is the only one in the colony that <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> P. rebeli larvae is not ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E

25|$|Spiritual ecofeminism {{is another}} branch of ecofeminism, and is popular among ecofeminist authors such as Starhawk, Riane Eisler, Carol J. Adams, and more. Starhawk calls this an earth-based spirituality, which <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Earth is alive, {{that we are}} interconnected, {{as well as a}} community. Spiritual ecofeminism is not linked to one {{specific}} religion, but is centered around values of caring, compassion, and non-violence. Often, ecofeminists refer to more ancient traditions, such as the worship of Gaia, the Goddess of nature and spirituality (also known as Mother Earth).|$|E

25|$|Psychiatry, {{like most}} medical {{specialties}} has a continuing, has significant need for research into its diseases, classifications and treatments. Psychiatry adopts biology's fundamental belief that disease and health are different elements of an individual's adaptation to an environment. But psychiatry also <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{environment of the}} human species is complex and includes physical, cultural, and interpersonal elements. In addition to external factors, the human brain must contain and organize an individual's hopes, fears, desires, fantasies and feelings. Psychiatry's difficult task is to bridge the understanding of these factors {{so that they can be}} studied both clinically and physiologically.|$|E
25|$|Social Security {{affects the}} saving {{behavior}} {{of the people in}} three different ways. The wealth substitution effect occurs when a person saving for retirement <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Social Security system will take care of him and decreases his expectations about how much he needs to personally save. The retirement effect occurs when a taxpayer saves more each year in an effort to reduce the total number of years he must work to accumulate enough savings before retirement. The bequest effect occurs when a taxpayer recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social Security tax and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{attempts}} to develop global social, political, and economic alternatives have led him in episodic engagements in national debates around the world. His approach in these engagements <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> problems facing contemporary societies are not distinct from nation to nation, and that general structural arrangements can first be implemented, {{which will allow}} for local innovation, flexibility, and development in social, economic, and political arenas. There is no institutional blueprint for Unger, however, only a direction that can be pointed to and general proposals that can be implemented to allow further institutional innovation and experimentation. Unger's guiding principle is that institutional flexibility needs to be built into the implemented system, {{and in this way}} a diversity of local experiments would take hold the world over.|$|E

Additionally, Selene is also angry over Frost using the Black Queen moniker when she was leading the Dark X-Men.

Once Selene's inner circle appears on Utopia Frost recognizes Blink and stops Wolverine from killing Wither. However, in the aftermath Selene's inner circle succeed in capturing Warpath, injuring Angel and ruthlessly killing Onyxx and Diamond Lil before returning to Necrosha. Frost <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> threat will not end until Selene and her inner circle are permanently stopped, and orders X-Force to travel to Necrosha and kill them all, including Wither.|$|E
25|$|The Marschallin, Sophie, and Octavian {{are left}} alone. The Marschallin <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> day she so feared has come, as Octavian hesitates {{between the two}} women (Trio: Marie Theres'! / Hab' mir's gelobt). In the {{emotional}} climax of the opera, the Marschallin gracefully releases Octavian, encouraging him to follow his heart and love Sophie. She then withdraws elegantly to the next room to talk with Faninal. As soon as she is gone, Sophie and Octavian run to each other's arms. Faninal and the Marschallin return to find the lovers locked in an embrace. After a few bittersweet glances to her lost lover, the Marschallin departs with Faninal. Sophie and Octavian follow after another brief but ecstatic love duet (Ist ein Traum / Spür' nur dich), and the opera ends with little Mohammed running in to retrieve Sophie's dropped handkerchief, and racing out again after the departing nobility.|$|E
25|$|In the 5th century, Saint Augustine wrote The Literal Meaning of Genesis {{in which}} he argued that Genesis should be {{interpreted}} as God forming the Earth and life from pre-existing matter and allowed for an allegorical interpretation of {{the first chapter of}} Genesis. For example: he argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. On the other hand, Augustine called for a historical view of the remainder of the history recorded in Genesis, including the creation of Adam and Eve, and the Flood. Apart from his specific views, Augustine <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that Christians should be willing to change their minds about it as new information comes up. He also warned believers not to rashly interpret things literally that might be allegorical, as it would discredit the faith.|$|E
