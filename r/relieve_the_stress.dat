5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>stress.</b> Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E
500|$|Started in February 1918; as a [...] {{means to}} <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> the troops, sailors, and {{officers}} were under aboard a {{ship in the}} danger zone; {{it was written by}} officers who had previous literary experience and produced by men who had printing and publishing experience. [...] It was printed on a small hand press– 5,000 copies with the first issue but this was increased to 7,000– and titled [...] The Hatchet (a reference to the tale about George Washington and the cherry tree). News from the ship and news received by radio were in the single-sheet newspaper. The masthead in 1919 listed the ship chaplain as managing editor and three reporters—one each from the Associated Press, International News Service and the United Press as [...] "associate editors". The newspaper pages, printed on a shipboard press, measured about [...] The newspaper's motto: [...] "We Cannot Tell a Lie".

500|$|Masato Kato {{directed}} {{and wrote the}} main story, leaving sub-plots and minor character events to other staff. The event team sometimes struggled to mesh their work on the plot due {{to the complexity of}} the parallel worlds concept. Masato Kato confirmed that Cross featured a central theme of parallel worlds, as well as the fate of Schala, which he was previously unable to expound upon in Chrono Trigger. Concerning the ending sequences showing Kid searching for someone in a modern city, he hoped to make players realize that alternate futures and possibilities may exist in their own lives, and that this realization would [...] "not... stop with the game". He later added, [...] "Paraphrasing one novelist's favorite words, what's important is not the message or theme, but how it is portrayed as a game. Even in Cross, it was intentionally made so that the most important question was left unanswered." [...] Kato described the finished story as [...] "ole' boy-meets-girl type of story" [...] with sometimes-shocking twists. Kato rode his motorcycle to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> of the game's release schedule. He continued refining event data during the final stages of development {{while the rest of the}} team undertook debugging and quality control work. Square advertised the game by releasing a short demo of the first chapter with purchases of Legend of Mana. The North American version of Cross required three months of translation and two months of debugging before release. Richard Honeywood translated, working with Kato to rewrite certain dialogue for ease of comprehension in English. He also added instances of wordplay and alliteration to compensate for difficult Japanese jokes. To streamline translation for all 45 playable characters, Honeywood created his own version of the accent generator which needed to be more robust than the simple verbal tics of the Japanese cast. Although the trademark Chrono Cross was registered in the European Union, the game was not released in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|There was a {{proposal}} for a new station to be built in the Eastside to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> from New Street station. The station, dubbed [...] "Grand Central Station'" [...] was to be nearly twice the size of New Street and would handle all major railway lines.

2500|$|As noted above, RNA {{polymerase}} makes {{contacts with}} the promoter region. [...] However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme's ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. [...] Once the open complex is stabilized, RNA polymerase synthesizes an RNA strand to establish a DNA-RNA heteroduplex (~8-9 bp) at the active center, which stabilizes the elongation complex. [...] In order to accomplish RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, [...] "scrunching" [...] more downstream DNA into the initiation complex. During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a [...] "stressed intermediate." [...] Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. [...] Once the DNA-RNA heteroduplex is long enough, RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. However, promoter escape {{is not the only}} outcome. RNA polymerase can also <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription. [...] The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3'OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase's catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. [...] Scientists have coined the term [...] "abortive initiation" [...] to explain the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition. [...] The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.|$|E
