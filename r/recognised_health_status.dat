40|$|The need to {{synthesise}} mortality and morbidity information {{to achieve a}} more global and relevant measure of population <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is well <b>recognised,</b> with <b>health</b> expectancy indices being the most common approach used to date. Using New Zealand hospital discharge and mortality data over the 1980 - 98 period, we introduce readers to a newly developed health index, the Hospital Utilisation Expectancy (HUE). We describe how HUE changes with age and over time. New Zealand national and regional trends are described. The methodological strengths of the measure and its applications in the health sector are discussed. Background In recent years, {{attempts have been made}} {{to synthesise}} mortality and morbidity indices to achieve a more global and relevant measure of population <b>health</b> <b>status</b> than using either on its own. Research on population <b>health</b> <b>status</b> indices has concentrated on quantifying the relationship between mortality and morbidity in order to predict future health trends. Health expectancy (HE) (Robine and Michel 1992, Bone et al 1995) and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) (Murray and Lopez 1996) are two macro-level indices developed over the last decade.

Method: As part of the TRIL clinic assessment, we gathered information from 473 community dwelling adults {{over the age of}} 65, regarding hours spent per week exercising, depression, personality, perceived <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> and objective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> (in the form of a comorbidity count). Regression analyses were performed on these data to investigate whether perceived <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> objective <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> personality and mood are associated with hours of exercise per week. Results: Perceived and objective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> were significantly but weakly correlated. Both perceived and objective <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> as well as depression, were independently associated with hours of exercise per week. Conclusions: We conclude that exercise uptake in older adults is contingent on both perceived and objective <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> as well as depression.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} outcome indicators to monitor the quality of care. Traditionally, outcome indicators have been based mainly on biological indicators reflecting death or disease. Now that various instruments for <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measurement have become available, questions have been raised as to the potential application of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> scores in monitoring the quality of care. This paper identifies conditions which should be fulfilled before such applications can be recommended. Firstly, the relationship between care delivery processes and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> outcomes must be established. In order to achieve this, <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures which are clearly able to detect <b>health</b> <b>status</b> variations between groups of patients (i. e. discriminative ability) and variations over time (i. e. sensitivity to change) are needed. Secondly, <b>health</b> <b>status</b> data should be available, preferably from established data collection registries (e. g. computerized hospital records or national registries) where data relating to the description of variations in <b>health</b> <b>status</b> (between physicians, hospitals, regions, etc.) are routinely collected. Thirdly, methods should be found to collect additional data, including 'case-mix' information and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> reference data, in order to enable the interpretation of variations in <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Because most of these conditions are currently not being fulfilled, we conclude that the state-of-the-art of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measurement has not yet matured sufficiently to allow for the use of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> as an indicator of quality of care.

40|$|Minimal {{clinically}} {{significant difference in}} health status: the thorny path of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures? T. Hajiro*, K. Nishimura# <b>Health</b> <b>status</b> or health-related {{quality of life is}} being recognized as an important outcome when evaluating patients with chronic pulmonary disease. There is growing literature about <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures in patients with asthma and chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease (COPD). The European Respiratory Journal (ERJ) has published numerous articles on issues related to <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> The authors believe that the ERJ is a valuable resource in this area, especially for summarizing updated issues on the <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of pulmonary disease [1], or vali-dating new questionnaires or comparing <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures. Clinicians need to understand and critically eva-luate measurements of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> in order to determine if a new therapy could be applied to their own patients with expectation of improving their <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> However, {{it is also true that}} many readers face confusion and difficulty in interpreting the results of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures. Important concepts when evaluating measurements of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> are the {{clinically significant}} threshold or the minimal clinically significant difference (MCSD) [2]. When <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is measured using a continuous scale, it needs to be known whether an observed difference indicates a clinically significant or trivial effect on the patients 9 <b>health</b> <b>status</b> or quality of life. A statistically significant difference in <b>health</b> <b>status</b> might be of little practical importance; it is more important to know the MCSD. There are several defi-nitions of the MCSD that correspond to the per-spective of those who evaluate. For example, JAESCHKE et al. [3] define "minimal clinically important differ-ence " as the smallest difference in a score in a domain of interest that patients perceive as beneficial and that would mandate, in the absence of side-effects and a change in the patient 9 s management [3].

Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russia) were used. Russia was included as the benchmark population {{as it is the}} country of origin of ethnic Russians. Data were collected from respondents aged 25 years in 2001 e 2003. Methods: Principal component analysis was used to derive the <b>Health</b> <b>Status</b> Index and Household Wealth Index. Multiple classification analysis was applied {{to examine the effects of}} the determinants on <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> including ethnic group membership. Results: In Estonia and Kazakhstan, ethnic Russians have, on average, a lower <b>health</b> <b>status</b> than members of the majority population, while their <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is higher in Ukraine. Higher levels of material wealth, educational attainment and physical activity were associated with a higher <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> The association of these variables with <b>health</b> <b>status</b> was often stronger than the association between ethnic group membership and <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Conclusion: Differences in <b>health</b> <b>status</b> between Russian ethnic minorities and the majority populations were found in Estonia and Kazakhstan, but were non-existent in Latvia and were the opposite of what was expected in Ukraine.

Data in <b>Health</b> <b>Status</b> Change were analyzed statistically in percentage, significance of difference, correlation and regression. Results: Immigrants of different gender, language and category sub-groups exhibited different <b>Health</b> <b>Status</b> Change Rates, <b>Health</b> <b>Status</b> Improving Rates and <b>Health</b> <b>Status</b> Declining Rates, but no statistical difference between the rates. Immigrant general <b>Health</b> <b>Status</b> Change was correlated positively with Age and Primary Occupation, and negatively with Income. Mother Tongue, Primary Occupation and Income significantly impacted <b>Health</b> <b>Status</b> Change. Conclusion: Immigrants of different sub-groups in Canada experienced different <b>health</b> <b>status</b> change. The results supported “healthy immigrant effect”. The “decline in immigrant health status” over time existed in some of immigrant sub-groups. Data of immigrant <b>health</b> <b>status</b> change can provide evidence for health policy-making and policy-revising in Canada...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. <b>Health</b> <b>status</b> {{and social}} {{networks}} {{are associated with}} resilience among older adults. Each of these factors may be important {{to the ability of}} adults to remain in rural and remote communities as they age. We examined the association of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and social networks and resilience among older adults dwelling in a rural and remote county in the Western United States. Methods. We selected a random sample of 198 registered voters aged 65 years or older from a frontier Wyoming county. Hierarchical linear regression was used to examine the association of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> as well as social networks and resilience. We also examined <b>health</b> <b>status</b> as a moderator of the relationship between social networks and resilience. Results. Family networks (p= 0. 024) and mental <b>health</b> <b>status</b> (p< 0. 001) significantly predicted resilience. Mental <b>health</b> <b>status</b> moderated the relationship of family (p= 0. 004) and friend (p= 0. 021) networks with resilience. Smaller family and friend networks were associated with greater resilience when mental <b>health</b> <b>status</b> was low, but not when it was high. Conclusion. Efforts to increase mental <b>health</b> <b>status</b> may improve resilience among older adults in rural environments, particularly for those with smaller family and friends networks...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To date, many <b>health</b> <b>status</b> {{instruments}} exist, but {{the validity}} of these instruments is questionable. This {{is caused by the}} fact that <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is poorly defined. Purpose: To develop a validated framework that improves conceptual insight into <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and its domains. METHODS: Based on theoretical and clinical considerations, we defined the domains of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> into concrete sub-domains by formulating conceptual models. Guided by these conceptual models, for each sub-domain, existing instruments were selected. We validated the conceptual models in the data of 168 COPD patients. Using factor analysis, underlying concepts in the data were identified. RESULTS: The resulting framework included physiological functioning, complaints, functional impairment, and quality of life. These main domains were shown to be subdivided into 15 sub-domains. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that <b>health</b> <b>status</b> consists of conceptually distinct sub-domains. Integral assessment of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> thus entails measuring all sub-domains. Existing instruments measure only few sub-domains. Integral assessment of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> thus requires the combination of different instruments. The present framework of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> can help in composing such a battery of instruments. Patient profiles obtained by the framework are essential in individualizing treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundSubjective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is an {{increasingly}} important parameter to assess the effect of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in clinical practice. Aim {{of this study was}} to determine medical and psychosocial predictors of poor subjective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> over a 10 years' post-PCI period. MethodsWe included a series of consecutive PCI patients (n= 573) as part of the RESEARCH registry, a Dutch single-center retrospective cohort study. ResultsThese patients completed the 36 -item Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36) at baseline and 10 years post-PCI. We found 6 predictors of poor subjective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> 10 years post-PCI: SF- 36 at baseline, age, previous PCI, obesity, acute myocardial infarction as indication for PCI, and diabetes mellitus (arranged from most to least numbers of sub domains). ConclusionsSF- 36 scores at baseline, age, and previous PCI were significant predictors of subjective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> 10 years post-PCI. Specifically, the SF- 36 score at baseline was an important predictor. Thus assessment of subjective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> at baseline is useful as an indicator to predict long-term subjective <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Subjective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> becomes better by optimal medical treatment, cardiac rehabilitation and psychosocial support. This is the first study determining predictors of subjective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> 10 years post-PCI...|$|R
40|$|The general social surveys (GSS) {{conducted}} by Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in 2002, 2006 and 2010 contain <b>health</b> <b>status</b> {{data collected from}} the participants over the country. ABS only presented a brief summary of Australian <b>health</b> <b>status</b> through simple data analysis, which provided little insight into the trends of general <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of Australians and variations of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of different age groups over the years. In this paper, these <b>health</b> <b>status</b> data have been analyzed using some existing methods and a newly proposed method of “average residual analysis” (ARA) to identify any hidden trends and variations of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> from 2002 to 2010 in Australia. This trend analysis not only reaffirmed the previous summaries given by ABS, but also found two possible tendencies in the 2010 GSS: people who rated their <b>health</b> <b>status</b> very good or excellent became declining in the extended young-middle age groups (25 - 64 years old), {{and people in the}} middle age groups (35 - 54) were more likely to rate their <b>health</b> <b>status</b> as good, rather than as very good or excellent, compared with that in the 2002 and 2006 GSSs...|$|R
40|$|This {{study on}} Multiple Sclerosis {{focuses on the}} use of the {{physical}} and mental health dimensions of self perceived health measured by the SF- 36 that are linked to clinical data and psychosocial factors. A review of the articles described that the more disabled and older the MS patients, the poorer their perceived <b>health</b> <b>status</b> was and the more depressed the patients, the worse their perceived <b>health</b> <b>status</b> was. MS patients who reported good self rated health were more likely to be employed, less disabled and less anxious. Furthermore, social support from significant others is positively associated with their physical <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> while social support from family and friends was found to have more positive consequences on the mental <b>health</b> <b>status</b> in MS patients. Mastery is a meaningful variable determining perceived <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> especially in MS patients of 45 years and over. The role of depression was present with regard to perceived <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> mainly to perceived physical <b>health</b> <b>status</b> in the older group and to perceived mental <b>health</b> <b>status</b> in the younger one. The role of anxiety was more important in younger MS patients than among older patients with regard to their perceived <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Supporting social ties and relationships between MS patients and others are very important. Furthermore, health care professionals` education and counselling in supporting the coping strategies of MS patients are essential for good patient management. ...|$|R

This study examines the impact of <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> socioeconomic status, and gender on the mental <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of older Latinos age 65 + (n= 708). This study utilized data from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). The independent variables {{for this study were}} <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> socioeconomic status, and gender. The dependent variable was mental <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Frequency and regression analysis were performed in order {{to examine the relationship between}} variables. The regression analysis found that <b>health</b> <b>status</b> (self-rated <b>health)</b> was the main predictor in determining the mental <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of older Latinos 65 +. The results of this study suggest that social workers, practitioners, primary providers of health care, and medical providers need to assess frequently for mental health problems within the older Latino population...|$|R

In this paper we analyze the links between <b>health</b> <b>status</b> (measured by self-reported illness occurrence in the last 12 months) and individuals’ socioeconomic situation. Using the annual households surveys of Uruguay for the period 1991 to 2000, we compute probit models and find that men, unmarried, {{those who do not}} live alone, young people, those who have a job and those with more than 5 years of education, have a smaller probability of reporting a bad <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Also, we evaluate the evolution of self-reported <b>health</b> <b>status</b> during this 10 -years period and find that the probability of reporting a bad <b>health</b> <b>status</b> has a descendent trend, being 0, 34 in 1991 and 0, 25 in 2000. <b>health</b> capital, <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> human capital...|$|R
40|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} (CHF) {{is a major}} public health concern today with a high {{mortality}} rate. The major {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL) of men and women with a diagnosis of CHF. A cross-sectional exploratory design was used. Specific study aims were to determine (a) whether there were differences in self-reported <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and HRQOL of men and women with CHF, (b) whether the variables of age, race/ethnicity, living status, number of comorbidities, perceived general <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> and perceived symptom management differ by gender, and (c) whether gender, age, race, number of comorbidities, living <b>status,</b> perceived general <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> perceived symptom management perceived physical <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> and perceived mental <b>health</b> <b>status</b> predict HRQOL. A non-probability convenience sample of 113 participants, who met the criteria for participation, were recruited from two cardiac clinics. There were no significant differences among gender categories on the variables of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and HRQOL. Independent samples ttest showed no significant differences in age, total number of comorbidities, perceived general <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> and perceived symptoms management by gender. Chi-square test results revealed that gender and living status were independent, as were gender and race/ethnicity. Hierarchical regression analysis showed all predictors for each hypothesized dependent variable in the model contributed to the outcome. Perceived symptoms management was a direct predictor of functional status, and its prediction of the mental health component of functional status represented the model's highest relationship. The model's only nonsignificant path was from comorbidities to HRQOL. The variables of perceived general <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> physical <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> and perceived symptom management contributed to the HRQOL outcome when age, but not comorbidities, was the exogenous variable. Using kappa, agreement regarding functional status was only 44...|$|R
