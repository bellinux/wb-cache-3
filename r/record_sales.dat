5|$|Although the Rolling Stones {{remained}} popular {{through the}} early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band's output, and <b>record</b> <b>sales</b> failed to meet expectations. By the mid-1970s, after punk rock became influential, many people had begun to view the Rolling Stones as an outdated band.|$|E

He recorded {{his first three}} albums for Elektra Records: All the News That's Fit to Sing (1964), I Ain't Marching Anymore (1965), and Phil Ochs in Concert (1966). Critics wrote that each album was better than its predecessors, and fans seemed to agree; <b>record</b> <b>sales</b> increased with each new release.|$|E
5|$|At each venue, {{the concert}} {{was treated as}} a major event by the local press and {{attended}} by between ten and twenty thousand fans, whose enthusiastic response to the Beatles produced sound levels that left the music only semi-audible. The tour earned the Beatles over a million dollars in ticket sales. It also stimulated a further increase in <b>record</b> <b>sales,</b> and resulted in the sale of a considerable quantity of Beatle-related merchandise.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many of the}} band's albums {{have been}} {{underground}} hits, they never found larger commercial success. The band were released from their recording contract with Warner Bros. Records when Warner's imprint Elektra Records folded. The release was reportedly due to poor <b>record</b> <b>sales,</b> and since then Stereolab's self-owned label, Duophonic Records, has signed a distribution deal with Too Pure. Duophonic holds the copyrights to the band's recordings, and on this label the band has released many limited-edition records. In 2009, Stereolab announced via their website {{that they were going}} on indefinite hiatus.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain {{to be a viable}} investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue that arose from the sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and <b>record</b> <b>sales.</b> Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E

Berman asked Parker under which conditions would he take the project, to which Parker replied that he was only interested in the music score of the movie and owning the rights for <b>record</b> <b>sales</b> and publishing royalties. Presley's payment was settled at 250,000 and 50% of the royalties from the distribution of the movie.|$|E

As her <b>record</b> <b>sales</b> were unaffected and audiences demanded to see Mina on the air, RAI was forced to end the ban and let Mina return to television on 10 January 1964. Within a year, her affair with Corrado ended.|$|E

5|$|Neon Genesis Evangelion gained {{widespread}} {{critical acclaim}} {{as well as}} controversy.

5|$|Success exposed TISM to {{mainstream}} Australian radio and television, {{most of which}} was perplexed by the band's guerrilla approach to interviews and {{lack of interest in}} the music industry. A four CD box set of early albums was released and steady <b>record</b> <b>sales</b> allowed extensive tours of Australia and New Zealand. In 1996 TISM toured on the Big Day Out, during which Ron Hitler-Barassi was either absent or wheelchair-bound due to a detached retina and broken arm caused by a stage dive he performed at the Pacific Hotel, Lorne, Victoria prior to the tour. Later the same year, TISM toured England, the group's sole Northern Hemisphere excursion.|$|E
