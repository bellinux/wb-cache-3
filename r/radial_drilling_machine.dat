40|$|The present paper {{focus on}} the {{investigation}} into rotary forging of axi-symmetric aluminium disc experimentally and ‘Upper Bound ’ theoretical analysis. Conical die with include angle of 170 0, i. e. skew angle of 5 0 was fabricated and experiments were performed using these dies on <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The deformation and conical indented contact area were critically investigated. The theoretical analysis was done based on ‘Upper Bound ’ approach, where exponential velocity field and corresponding strain rates satisfying necessary boundary conditions were proposed. Using these expressions, total energy expended during rotary forging was computed, which was used to compute the average rotary forging load. For ease of computation mechanics, the entire rotary forging process was considered into two phases, i. e., indentation phase and rotary phase. The final average rotary forging load was computed by summing up the average loads during indentation and rotary phases. The effect of various rotary forging characteristics like axial feed rate, rotational speed, skew angle on percent deformation, average forging load etc were studied. It is expected that present work will be useful for the prediction of the rotary forging load, as well {{for the design of}} rotary forging processes...|$|E
40|$|Engineering {{problems}} often embody many {{characteristics of}} a multi-response optimization problem, and these responses are often conflicting in nature. To address this issue, the present work uses Grey- based Taguchi method to express surface roughness of drilled holes and drill flank wear into an equivalent single response grey relational grade. Experiments have been conducted in a <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> with five input parameters using L 27 orthogonal array. It has been observed that combined response of flank wear and surface roughness is affected by almost all input parameters; however, drill diameter is statistically most significant one whereas Spindle speed is least significant input parameter. The prediction results were obtained via. Mamdani fuzzy logic model and BPNN and the corresponding results were compared. It is observed that Mamdani produces better result compared to BPNN in predicting the equivalent response grey relational grade. The advantage of mamdani fuzzy logic {{lies in the fact}} that it can take into account the uncertainty and impreciseness involved during experimentation. It is usually convenient for the practitioners to express model inputs in linguistic terms such as high, low, medium rather than expressing in quantifiable terms. The extraction of linguistic terms can largely reduce the chances of error, which is a constriction experienced in case of crisp values used in neural networks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{outlines the}} Taguchi optimization methodology, which {{is applied to}} optimize cutting parameters in drilling of glass fiber reinforced composite (GFRC) material. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to study the effect of process parameters on machining process. This procedure {{eliminates the need for}} repeated experiments, time and conserves the material by the conventional procedure. The drilling parameters and specimen parameters evaluated are speed, feed rate, drill size and specimen thickness. A series of experiments are conducted using <b>Radial</b> <b>Drilling</b> <b>Machine</b> to relate the cutting parameters and material parameters on the cutting thrust and torque. The measured results were collected and analyzed {{with the help of the}} commercial software package MINITAB 15. An orthogonal array, signal-to-noise ratio are employed to analyze the influence of these parameters on cutting force and torque during drilling. The method could be useful in predicting thrust and torque parameters as a function of cutting parameters and specimen parameters. The main objective is to find the important factors and combination of factors influence the machining process to achieve low cutting low cutting thrust and torque. From the analysis of the Taguchi method indicates that among the all-significant parameters, speed and drill size are more significant influence on cutting thrust than the specimen thickness and the feed rate. Study of response table indicates that the specimen thickness, and drill size are the significant parameters of torque. From the interaction among process parameters, thickness and drill size together is more dominant factor than any other combination for the torque characteristic...|$|E

The paper {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} results of <b>radial</b> <b>drilling,</b> drilling perforation, cumulative reperforation and acid treatment. The study was focused at carbonate deposits in Russia. For each technology average incremental oil rates were estimated at the same exploration targets. The analysis of technological effectiveness in the given geologic and physical conditions revealed that <b>drilling</b> perforation and <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> allow reaching higher incremental oil rates compared to acid treatment and cumulative perforation. This fact confirms effectiveness of <b>drilling</b> <b>radial</b> canals by enlarging infiltration area. For the sake of completion <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> and drilling perforation are performed in the same wells. To reveal limiting conditions of applying <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> and drilling perforation an effectiveness analysis is made depending on the thickness of the interlayers exposed. To formulate criteria of radial exposing applicability an analysis of effects of different geological and physical formation parameters on geological and engineering operations effectiveness is done. The following parameters are considered: relation between the current formation pressure and initial formation pressure, formation permeability, skin factor, thickness of interlayers in overall perforation interval, thickness of interlayers exposed by radial canals.
