25|$|Around the 1960s to 1970s Woman's Weekly {{magazine}} {{gave away}} a soft plastic on-needle knitting <b>row</b> <b>counter</b> of unusual but simple design. Two numbered blue-and-white barrels rotate independently around a central white spindle, {{which has a}} number-pointer {{at one end and}} a loop to thread onto a needle at the other end. The friction (to prevent the barrels rolling freely) is maintained by the tightness of the number-pointer and shortness of the spindle.|$|E

25|$|A <b>row</b> <b>counter</b> for hand {{knitting}} is a tally counter for counting rows or courses worked, for counting stitch pattern repetitions, or for counting increases or decreases {{of the number}} of stitches in consecutive rows. The first commercially produced one appeared on the market in the 1920s after the general public started regularly knitting from unfamiliar printed and complex patterns. Design variations include on-needle barrel-shaped counters for straight-needle work, stitch-marker counters for knitting on double-pointed and circular needles, complex counters which attempted to assist with decreases, increases and lacework, stand-alone hand-held counters in imitation of the hand-tally, pendant counters worn round the neck and online software for iPhones.|$|E
2500|$|These {{tend to be}} on-needle barrel row {{counters}} {{which have}} been attached to stitch-marker rings. [...] They are intended {{to be used with}} circular or double-pointed knitting needles. In the 21st century Prym has marketed a dedicated stitch-marker <b>row</b> <b>counter,</b> labelling it the Universal Rotally.|$|E
2500|$|The pendant Electronic <b>Row</b> <b>Counter</b> was {{produced}} in the early 21st century and was sold in the United States at least until 2010. [...] Its LCD display counts up to 4 digits, whereas all foregoing knitting row counters were limited to 2 digits. It has add- and subtract-buttons which allow the user to count forwards and backwards in increments of one with an audible beep at each press, and the on-off button {{can be used to}} reset the count to zero. [...] Because there is no memory facility, the counter must be left turned on if the count is to be maintained; however the gadget's instructions say that the battery will last for over seven months. There is no lock so that the maintained count is vulnerable to playing children. The more complex version of this counter, the Electronic <b>Row</b> <b>Counter</b> Plus, has ceased manufacture.|$|E

2500|$|The Compact rotary <b>row</b> <b>counter</b> was {{manufactured}} in England in the 1950s to 1960s under a pending patent application, although the general design was similar {{in principle to}} the early I.X. Products version. It had the same precise engineering for control of friction, and central metal spring suitable for needles up to 3.5mm. [...] The basic Compact, however, had a central knurled grip-band, which made the gadget easier to hold and to turn quickly and precisely. [...] The earlier version of the late 1950s to early 1960s had red numerals, and the later 1960s version had black numerals.|$|E
2500|$|Around the 1980s to 1990s, Woman's Weekly {{magazine}} {{gave away}} a plastic on-needle knitting <b>row</b> <b>counter</b> of unusual design. It {{was presented as}} a self-assembly kit, in a small blue envelope with assembly instructions and a diagram on the back. According to the diagram, the gadget consists of (a) two blue front and back plates, pierced to show the numbers; (b) an inner white soft plastic frame to hold the number discs and to which are attached the two loops to bend back and thread on the needle; (c) the two number discs. [...] So the disks don't spin on an axis; they spin within circular spaces in the inner frame.|$|E
2500|$|The luxury {{version of}} the Compact was {{presented}} in a gift box, it was priced at a guinea and became a contemporary collector's item, tending to be little-used due to impracticality. The assemblage included a thin and delicate 6-inch - later 8-inch - tape measure {{in place of the}} grip band. [...] On this luxury version the tape-measure assembly caused the centre of the gadget to rotate independently, making it difficult for adult fingers to grip the remaining part of the stable outer skin to turn the main assemblage for use as a <b>row</b> <b>counter.</b> Some of the counters in this range featured pearlised plastic outer skins in various pastel colours.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} on-needle <b>row</b> <b>counters</b> seem to {{have appeared}} in the UK between 1920 and 1939, when complicated printed patterns increased in popularity among the working population. [...] In the 1920s a [...] grey-brown enamelled unit was manufactured with two rotary dials on the front showing tens and units, and slots on the back for sliding onto a knitting needle. [...] The front was flat and shaped like a figure-8, but was heavier than the back so that the unit hung downward from the needle, making the numbered face difficult to read. A similar bakelite unit was manufactured by Abel Morrell for sale in the US in the 1930s.|$|R

2500|$|In Britain in the 1950s {{when the}} baby boom years {{following}} World War II caused an increased requirement for hand-knitting, I.X. Products produced a brightly coloured and marketable plastic <b>row</b> <b>counter</b> with patent number 424432. This was a barrel-shaped counter which sat in stable fashion on the knitting needle by {{the aid of a}} central metal spring. The assemblage consisted of a double rotating inner barrel and an outer fixed and slotted skin which was pinned to the central spring. [...] The two separately rotating halves of the inner barrel were printed with numbers, and the outer slotted skin rotated over the barrels, revealing a single ten and a single unit at one time. Precise engineering ensured that there was just enough ease of movement for the turning of the barrels, but just enough friction to prevent movement of the barrels while vigorous knitting continued. However the introduction in the late 1950s of double knitting yarn and the consequent popular use of thicker needles tended to damage the springs which were intended for needles of a maximum thickness of 3.25mm. [...] This design and most of the barrel-shaped on-needle counters which followed it had a white or cream central barrel and a decoratively coloured outer skin.|$|E
