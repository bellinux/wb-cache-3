40|$|As {{common as}} the normal <b>distribution</b> is the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distribution</b> which occurs in works on radar, {{properties}} of sine wave plus-noise, etc. Rayleigh (1880) derived {{it from the}} amplitude of sound resulting from many important sources. The <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distribution</b> is widely used in communication engineering, reliability analysis and applied statistics. Since the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distribution</b> has linearly increasing rate, it is appropriate for components which might not have manufacturing defects but age rapidly with time. Several types of electro-vacum devices have this feature. It is connected with one dimension and two dimensions random walk and is some times {{referred to as a}} random walk frequency distribution. It is a special case of Weibull distribution (1951) of wide applicability. It can be easily derived from the bivariate normal distribution with and p = 0. For further application of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distribution,</b> we refer to Johnson and Kotz (1994). Adatia (1995) has obtained the best linear unbiased estimator of the Rayleigh scale parameter based on fairly large censored samples. Dyer and Whisend (1973) obtained the BLUE of scale parameter based on type II censored samples for small N = 2 (1) 5. With the advance of computer technology it is now possible to obtain BLUE for large samples.
