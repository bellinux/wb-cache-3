25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or <b>radiculitis</b> when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E

5000|$|Along with fever, {{patients}} may experience an incredible range of nonspecific symptoms. The clinical features of relapsing fever may include recurring febrile episodes, chills, nausea, headache, muscle and joint aches, vomiting, lethargy, thrombocytopenia, spirochetemia, anemia, facial paralysis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, anorexia, dry cough, light sensitivity, rash, neck pain, eye pain, confusion, dizziness, eosinopenia, myocarditis, dermatitis, brain infection, lymphoid hyperplasia, and pregnancy complications. The neurological complications of Borrelia infections {{are referred to}} as neuroborreliosis, and the most common manifestations of neuroborreliosis in relapsing fever include meningitis, facial nerve palsy, <b>radiculitis,</b> and encephalopathy. The severity of the disease depends on the infecting serotype. The incubation period typically lasts 7 days, while the symptomatic periods tend to last 3 days, and the afebrile periods tend to last 7 days. Each febrile episode ends with a sequence of symptoms collectively known as a [...] "crisis". During the [...] "chill phase" [...] of the crisis, which lasts 10 to 30 minutes, patients develop very high fever (up to 106.7°F or 41.5°C) and may become delirious, agitated, tachycardic, and tachypneic. This phase is followed by the [...] "flush phase", characterized by drenching sweats and a rapid decrease in body temperature and transient hypotension. Generally, patients who are not treated will experience one to four episodes of fever before illness resolves. TBRF contracted during pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion, premature birth, and neonatal death. The maternal-fetal transmission of Borrelia is believed to occur either transplacentally or while traversing the birth canal. In general, pregnant women have higher spirochaete loads and more severe symptoms than nonpregnant women.|$|E

Objective: To {{evaluate the}} effectiveness of cervical interlaminar epidural injections of local anesthetic with or without steroids in the management of chronic neck pain and upper extremity pain in patients with disc herniation and <b>radiculitis.</b> Summary of Background Data: Epidural injections in managing chronic neck and upper extremity pain are commonly employed interventions.

There is also paucity of high quality literature. Methods: One-hundred twenty patients were {{randomly assigned to one of}} 2 groups: Group I patients received cervical interlaminar epidural injections of local anesthetic (lidocaine 0. 5 %, 5 mL); Group II patients received 0. 5 % lidocaine, 4 mL, mixed with 1 mL of nonparticulate betamethasone.

Results: One hundred and twenty patients without disc herniation or <b>radiculitis</b> and negative for facet joint pain by means of controlled diagnostic medial branch blocks were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, ie, injection of local anesthetic only (group 1) or local anesthetic mixed with nonparticulate betamethasone (group 2).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) and serum samples from 34 consecutive patients {{suspected of having}} varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Population and METHODS: The patients were divided into three groups. The first group consisted of 27 patients with a rash in one to three dermatomes and clinical suspicion of meningitis and radiculitis; among them, three subgroups were distinguished according to the affected dermatome: ophthalmicus (n = 9), oticus (n = 11) and cervico-thoraco-lumbar zoster (n = 7). Four cases of zoster sine herpete (ZSH) were included in the second group: these patients presented with either <b>radiculitis</b> (n = 2) or meningoencephalitis (n = 2), without cutaneous eruption. The third group consisted of three patients with a generalised rash and encephalitis. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VZV DNA and antigen-driven immunoblots for oligoclonal anti-VZV antibodies were carried out on all CSF samples. RESULTS: PCR of the CSF was positive in 44 % of the patients from the first group, mainly within the first 7 days after eruption. In addition, intrathecal synthesis of anti-VZV antibodies was detected in 37 % of patients, always after an interval of 7 days (p< 0. 0001). Among the four patients with ZSH, a positive VZV PCR was detected in three patients and CSF-specific oligoclonal anti-VZV antibodies in two. PCR was also positive in the CSF of two of the three patients with generalised rash and encephalitis; local production of anti-VZV antibodies was seen in a second CSF sample in one patient, and was also present in the third patient. CONCLUSION: Amplification of VZV DNA by PCR in the CSF and antigen-driven immunoblots have important diagnostic value in suspected VZV infection, although their presence depends on the timing of the CSF sampling. VZV is thought to be a causative agent in unexplained cases of meningitis associated with <b>radiculitis</b> or focal CNS symptoms, {{even in the absence of}} skin manifestations.
