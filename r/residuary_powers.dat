The first was the Standstill Agreement, which confirmed the continuance of the pre-existing agreements and administrative practices. The second was the Instrument of Accession, by which the ruler of the princely state in question agreed to the accession of his kingdom to independent India, granting the latter control over specified subject matters. The nature of the subject matters varied depending on the acceding state. The states which had internal autonomy under the British signed an Instrument of Accession which only ceded three subjects {{to the government of}} India—defence, external affairs, and communications, each defined in accordance with List 1 to Schedule VII of the Government of India Act 1935. Rulers of states which were in effect estates or talukas, where substantial administrative powers were exercised by the Crown, signed a different Instrument of Accession, which vested all <b>residuary</b> <b>powers</b> and jurisdiction in the Government of India. Rulers of states which had an intermediate status signed a third type of Instrument, which preserved the degree of power they had under the British.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the text}} of the Act gives Parliament <b>residuary</b> <b>powers</b> to enact laws in any area that has not been {{allocated}} to the provincial governments, subsequent jurisprudence has limited the scope of the [...] "peace, order, and good government" [...] power. The limitation on the scope of this clause stems from the narrow interpretation of its branches and the expansive interpretation of provincial powers under section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Particularly limiting is the breadth of provincial power over property and civil rights under s. 92(13). Although the Emergency Branch and the National Concern Branch may be viewed as delimited federal competencies like the enumerated clauses under section 91 (see e.g. AG Canada v AG Ontario (Labour Conventions), [...] AC 326 (PC)), the clause remains residuary. The powers under POGG must be interpreted in light of the subsequent jurisprudence on the limitations of the clause and the expansive powers of the provinces under their enumerated heads of power. If a matter does not fall within one of the enumerated classes in section 92, section 91, or the emergency or national concern branches, then it falls within the narrowly defined residual branch of POGG. The POGG power is best understood as a narrowly defined residual power limited to the following three branches.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the Act {{is to be}} viewed, as {{recently}} suggested by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Edwards v. Attorney-General of Canada as a living tree, capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits, and if it should be on all occasions interpreted in a large, liberal and comprehensive spirit, considering {{the magnitude of the}} subjects with which it purports to deal in very few words, and bearing in mind that we are concerned with the interpretation of an Imperial Act, but an Imperial Act creating a constitution for a new country, every effort should be made to find in the B.N.A. Act some head of legislative jurisdiction capable of including the subject matter of this reference. If, however, it should be found impossible to assign that subject matter to any specifically enumerated head of legislative jurisdiction, either in section 91 or in section 92 of the B.N.A.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, the area of family law has become {{increasingly}} infused with federal constitutional principles. Prior to this period, two factors—the fact that 2 ̆ 2 family rights 2 ̆ 2 are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution and the tenth amendment 2 ̆ 7 s <b>residuary</b> <b>power</b> clause—combined to leave the area of family law under the exclusive jurisdiction of the states, with constitutional protections thought to be inappropriate if not inapplicable. Today, the clear trend {{has been in the}} direction of an increasing recognition and protection of family rights under the Constitution. This protection has taken two distinct but at times related forms: equal protection and due process. This analysis focuses solely on the second branch of these constitutional protections. Following the landmark case of Griswold v. Connecticut, in which the Court held that the fourteenth amendment 2 ̆ 7 s due process clause was applicable to the fundamental interest of marital privacy, the due process doctrine has been extended to a number of important, related rights, including the right of parents to rear their children. Since then, the Supreme Court has been confronted with a host of decisions asking it to define the parameters of what process is constitutionally due. In Lassiter, the Court applied the three-factor balancing test laid out in Mathews v. Eldridge to define what process is constitutionally due in the area of family rights. Santosky v. Kramer, a case in which the Court was asked to determine what standard of proof is constitutionally mandated in a termination of parental rights proceeding, presented the Court with another opportunity to apply the Mathews analysis in a matter of family law. This Note analyzes the Santosky decision, giving particular emphasis to its reconcilability with Lassiter. Additionally, an analysis of whether the Supreme Court went far enough in establishing the standard of proof is undertaken...|$|R
40|$|The law {{respecting}} {{nuclear energy}} has to date {{been the subject}} of relatively few studies in Canada. Considering, however, the growing importance of nuclear energy as a new or additional form of energy, besides oil, gas, coal and hydroelectric power, and on the other hand, the increase in public concern about the possible consequences of the nuclear option, especially on health and the environment, this area of law is undoubtedly bound to experience a major development. The purpose of the present article is to study existing federal legislation on the matter, as well as its effects on certain provincial jurisdictions, more particularly in Quebec. The author, after recalling certain technical data concerning components and functions of nuclear reactors, proceeds to analyse the main intervenors in the nuclear field, as contemplated by the Atomic Energy Control Act. One cannot help but acknowledge that the Atomic Energy Control Board, by means of its important supervisory and regulatory powers, intervenes at all stages of the nuclear cycle. The author also studies the constitutional basis for the federal intervention in this field of activity. After eliminating the national defence power, the national dimension theory and the emergency power as possible alternatives, he concludes that while Parliament may perhaps invoke its <b>residuary</b> <b>power,</b> its declaratory power appears as the surest constitutional basis for asserting its legislative authority over that particular matter. In {{the last part of the}} article, the author attempts to emphasize the effects of federal intervention on provincial property rights over uranium mines, and on provincial jurisdictions over labour relations, health and safety at the workplace and environmental protection. This analysis points out that provincial legislative authority over the management and development of their natural resources is not only inapplicable in respect of uranium, but that their property rights over uranium mines are rather precarious. It seems clear, further, that jurisdiction over labour relations within nuclear undertakings lies exclusively with the federal authority. One could argue that such is also the case with those aspects of nuclear undertakings which are connected with workers' health and safety as well as environmental protection, since those matters are intimately linked with the control of atomic energy. Two main conclusions can be drawn from this study. Firstly, it appears certain that Parliament, in legislating as it did, intended to regulate the whole nuclear energy cycle, from the extraction of uranium ore to the ultimate disposal of nuclear waste. Secondly, that authority could hardly be challenged by provinces or any other interested party, at least on constitutional grounds...|$|R

40|$|The one I {{feel sorry}} for is John Ely. More than thirty years ago, in his classic article The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, he {{explained}} painstakingly, if not clearly, how thinking of the Erie/Hanna doctrine as a constitutional cornerstone of our federalism was just a mistake. Such a view, he pointed out, makes a major mystery out of what are really three distinct and rather ordinary problems of statutory and constitutional interpretation. He described the analytical and practical costs of the mistake, showed how the analysis ought to go, explained why academics and judges had failed {{to get it right}} up until then, and proposed a minimally disruptive cure for straightening out the case law confusion then in effect. Most academic commentators signed off on Ely 2 ̆ 7 s analysis almost immediately, acknowledging the power of his analytical framework even when they disagreed with his application of it to particular cases. And judges cited to his approach routinely, sometimes almost reverentially, as if before a shrine of our federalism, even when they simultaneously misapplied its central tenets. Ely even held out hope that the Supreme Court would understand the full implications of the interpretive project it had set in motion, and take the first available opportunity to complete its analysis. It must have been a very optimistic time. But then the casebook authors got hold of the project, and all bets were off. Many of these authors, it turned out, would not have decided the Erie/Hanna cases {{in the same way as}} the Court. They objected most to the decision to replace the sensible moderation of the balancing test of Byrd v. Blue Ridge with the more difficult to understand refined outcome determination test of Hanna v. Plumer (some even deny that this happened), and to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s failure to ground the doctrine more explicitly in the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, as a protection of a fixed enclave of state power forever off limits to federal regulation, rather than a shifting enclave of statutorily protected state <b>residuary</b> <b>power</b> left over after the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s grant of federal enumerated power was fully identified. Disagreement over the meaning of case law among academics is common, of course, but what makes the Erie/Hanna dispute unusual is that casebook authors acknowledge the persuasiveness of Ely 2 ̆ 7 s analysis at the same time that they fail to follow it in organizing the treatment of the doctrine in their books. Students learn one or another casebook version of Erie/Hanna of course, since casebooks are one of a student 2 ̆ 7 s primary sources of information about the doctrine, and when they became law clerks, as ultimately some must, they draft Erie/Hanna opinions based on their slightly-off-track understandings because these are the only understandings they have. A principal consequence of this exercise in what one might think of as casebook law reform, is a major doctrinal disconnect between the upper and lower branches of the federal judicial system, with the Supreme Court on one page (pretty much), and the lower federal courts on several others. As if in an extended telephone game, the Erie/Hanna doctrine reported back by the lower federal courts differs considerably from the one sent out by the Supreme Court, Ely 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to provide an interpretive algorithm notwithstanding. In this article I examine this episode of casebook law reform to figure out how and why it occurs, and whether anything can or should be done about it. I do not doubt that what I say about Erie/Hanna also could be said about other complicated statutory and constitutional doctrines. This is not a unique instance of casebook law reform, just an interesting one. Section II of the article describes the development of the doctrine, principally as it is articulated in the four well known Supreme Court cases with which it is usually associated, and shows how the cases are stages in a common project, successive drafts of the same document if you will, which build on and improve one another more than they attempt to start the doctrine over on a clean slate. Section III describes how civil procedure casebooks present the doctrine, both how they edit the Supreme Court cases for inclusion, and how they suggest that the cases should be interpreted (in Teacher 2 ̆ 7 s Manuals and in Notes and Comments following the cases). Finally, Section IV asks why it matters that casebook treatments of Erie/Hanna differ from one another, and from the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s views, and offers some modest suggestions for getting Erie/Hanna instruction back on track...|$|R

50|$|The Constitution {{provides}} for a three-fold distribution of legislative subjects between the Union andthe states, viz., List-I (the Union List), List-II (the State List) and List-III (the Concurrent List) in theSeventh Schedule:(i) The Parliament has exclusive powers to make laws with respect {{to any of the}} mattersenumerated in the Union List. This list has at present 100 subjects (originally 97 subjects)like defence, banking, foreign affairs, currency, atomic energy, insurance, communication,inter-state trade and commerce, census, audit and so on.(ii) The state legislature has “in normal circumstances” exclusive powers to make laws withrespect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List. This has at present 61 subjects(originally 66 subjects) like public order, police, public health and sanitation, agriculture,prisons, local government, fisheries, markets, theaters, gambling and so on.(iii) Both, the Parliament and state legislature can make laws with respect to any of the mattersenumerated in the Concurrent List. This list has at present 52 subjects (originally 47 subjects)like criminal law and procedure, civil procedure, marriage and divorce, population controland family planning, electricity, labour wel-fare, economic and social planning, drugs,newspapers, books and printing press, and others. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976transferred five subjects to Concurrent List from State List, that is, (a) education, (b) forests,(c) weights and measures, (d) protection of wild animals and birds, and (e) administration ofjustice; constitu-tion and organisation of all courts except the Supreme Court and the highcourts.The power to make laws with respect to residuary subjects (i.e., the matters which are notenumerated in any of the three lists) is vested in the Parliament. This residuary power of legisla-tionincludes the power to levy residuary taxes.From the above scheme, {{it is clear that the}} matters of national importance and the matters whichrequires uniformity of legislation nationwide are included in the Union List. The matters of regionaland local importance and the matters which permits diversity of interest are specified in the StateList. The matters on which uniformity of legislation throughout the country is desirable but notessential are enumerated in the concurrent list. Thus, it permits diversity along with uniformity.In US, only the powers of the Federal Government are enumerated in the Constitution and theresiduary powers are left to the states. The Australian Constitution followed the American pattern ofsingle enumeration of powers. In Canada, on the other hand, there is a double enumeration—Federaland Provincial, and the <b>residuary</b> <b>powers</b> are vested in the Centre.The Government of India (GoI) Act of 1935 provided for a three-fold emumenration, viz., federal,provincial and concurrent. The present Constitution follows the scheme of this act but with onedifference, that is, under this act, the <b>residuary</b> <b>powers</b> were given neither to the federal legislaturenor to the provincial legislature but to the governor-general of India. In this respect, India follows theCanadian precedent.The Constitution expressly secure the predominance of the Union List over the State List and theConcurrent List and that of the Concurrent List over the State List. Thus, in case of overlappingbetween the Union List and the State List, the former should prevail. In case of overlapping betweenthe Union List and the Concurrent List, it is again the former which should prevail. Where there is aconflict between the Concurrent List and the State List, it is the former that should prevail.In case of a conflict between the Central law and the state law on a subject enumerated in theConcurrent List, the Central law prevails over the state law. But, there is an exception. If the state lawhas been reserved for the consideration of the president and has received his assent, then the state lawprevails in that state. But, it would still be competent for the Parliament to override such a law bysubsequently making a law on the same matter.''''3. Parliamentary Legislation in the State Field''''''The above scheme of distribution of legislative powers between the Centre and the states is to bemaintained in normal times. But, in abnormal times, the scheme of distribution is either modified orsuspended. In other words, the Constitution empowers the Parliament to make laws on any matterenumerated in the State List under the following five extraordinary circumstances:When Rajya Sabha Passes a Resolution If the Rajya Sabha declares that it is necessary in thenational interest that Parliament should make laws on a matter in the State List, then the Parliamentbecomes competent to make laws on that matter. Such a resolution must be supported by two-thirds ofthe members present and voting. The resolution remains in force for one year; it can be renewed anynumber of times but not exceeding one year at a time. The laws cease to have effect on the expirationof six months after the resolution has ceased to be in force.This provision does not restrict the power of a state legislature to make laws on the same matter. But,in case of inconsistency between a state law and a parliamentary law, the latter is to prevail.During a National Emergency The Parliament acquires the power to legislate with respect tomatters in the State List, while a proclamation of national emergency is in operation. The lawsbecome inoperative on the expiration of six months after the emergency has ceased to operate.Here also, the power of a state legislature to make laws on the same matter is not restricted. But, incase of repugnancy between a state law and a parliamentary law, the latter is to prevail.When States Make a Request When the legislatures of two or more states pass resolutionsrequesting the Parliament to enact laws on a matter in the State List, then the Parliament can makelaws for regulating that matter. A law so enacted applies only to those states which have passed theresolutions. However, any other state may adopt it afterwards by passing a resolution to that effect inits legislature. Such a law can be amended or repealed only by the Parliament and not by thelegislatures of the concerned states.The effect of passing a resolution under the above provision is that the Parliament becomes entitled tolegislate with respect to a matter for which it has no power to make a law. On the other hand, the statelegislature ceases to have the power to make a law with respect to that matter. The resolutionoperates as abdication or surrender of the power of the state legislature with respect to that matterand it is placed entirely in the hands of Parliament which alone can then legislate with respect to it.Some examples of laws passed under the above provision are Prize Competition Act, 1955; WildLife (Protection) Act, 1972; Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; Urban Land(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976; and Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994.To Implement International Agreements The Parliament can make laws on any matter in the StateList for implementing the international treaties, agreements or conventions. This provision enables theCentral government to fulfil its international obligations and commitments.Some examples of laws enacted under the above provision are United Nations (Privileges andImmunities) Act, 1947; Geneva Convention Act, 1960; Anti-Hijacking Act, 1982 and legislationsrelating to environment and TRIPS.During President’s Rule When the President’s rule is imposed in a state, the Parliament becomesempowered to make laws with respect to any matter in the State List in relation to that state. A lawmade so by the Parliament continues to be operative even after the president’s rule. This means thatthe period for which such a law remains in force is not co-terminus with the duration of thePresident’s rule. But, such a law can be repealed or altered or re-enacted by the state legislature.4. Centre’s Control Over State LegislationBesides the Parliament’s power to legislate directly on the state subjects under the exceptionalsituations, the Constitution empowers the Centre to exercise control over the state’s legislativematters in the following ways:(i) The governor can reserve certain types of bills passed by the state legislature for theconsideration of the President. The president enjoys absolute veto over them.(ii) Bills on certain matters enumerated in the State List can be introduced in the state legislatureonly with the previous sanction of the president. (For example, the bills imposing restrictionson the freedom of trade and commerce).(iii) The President can direct the states to reserve money bills and other financial bills passed bythe state legislature for his consideration during a financial emergency.From the above, it is clear that the Constitution has assigned a position of superiority to the Centre inthe legislative sphere. In this context, the Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State Relations (1983-87)observed: “The rule of federal supremacy is a technique to avoid absurdity, resolve conflict andensure harmony between the Union and state laws. If this principle of union supremacy is excluded, itis not difficult to imagine its deleterious results. There will be every possibility of our two-tierpolitical system being stultified by interference, strife, legal chaos and confusion caused by a host ofconflicting laws, much to the bewilderment of the common citizen. Integrated legislative policy anduniformity on basic issues of common Union-state concern will be stymied. The federal principle ofunity in diversity will be very much a casualty. This rule of federal supremacy, therefore, isindispensable for the successful functioning of the federal system”.|$|E

40|$|Le problème de la {{ratification}} des conventions de l'O. I. T. par les états fédératifs s'est toujours posé. Après une brève présentation de l'Acte de l'Amérique du Nord britannique, l'auteur examine plus particulièrement le cas du Canada. INTRODUCTIONThe International Labour Organization {{was established}} in 1919 on the firm belief that universal and lasting peace can only be established if based upon social justice and by eliminating injustice, hardship and privation. The Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the I. L. O. play an essential part in fulfilling the basic objectives of the organization. The provisions of Conventions and Recommendations form international labour standards affecting all aspects of conditions of labour. By the end of 1968 the I. L. O. had adopted 128 Conventions and 132 Recommendations. Conventions are draft international treaties intended for ratification and when ratified they create binding legal obligations. Recommendations are not intended for ratification but to provide guidance to governmental policies, legislation and practice. The making of both Conventions and Recommendations {{is a function of}} the I. L. O. Conference. In each case a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast by the delegates present is required for their adoption. A Convention adopted by the I. L. O. is a draft international treaty. This character of a draft international treaty is not impaired by the fact that owing to the tripartite structure of the I. L. O. (governments, workers, employers) the adoption of I. L. O. Conventions is not subject to unanimous agreement of government delegates of the Member States. The fact that a draft Convention is adopted by a two-thirds majority vote of delegates representing governments, workers and employers is a specific characteristic of the I. L. O. A Member State of the I. L. O., by ratifying a given Convention, assumes a legal international obligation to the effect that the requirements of a Convention will be met in the ratifying country. In case of non-compliance with the ratified Convention, a complaint against the ratifying country may be lodged with the I. L. O. either by an industrial association of employers or of workers, or by any other ratifying State. Procedures dealing with such complaints are outlined in the I. L. O. Constitution. The enforcement of the ratified I. L. O. Conventions is not restricted to the formal complaints mentioned above. By a system requiring periodic reports which are examined by a committee of experts, the I. L. O. exercises very effective supervision of the application of ratified Conventions. TREATY-MAKING AND TREATY-PERFORMING POWERSThe process of ratification entails : (1) the formation ; and (2) the performance,of the obligations undertaken by a Convention(or a treaty). These two aspects are sometimes referred to as the treaty-making and treaty-performing powers. In countries with written constitutions, these matters are usually dealt with in the Constitution. In the case of unitary States, the position is simple. The national executive (the government of the day) performs ratification, essentially an executive act, with or without consent of the legislative branch of the government (Parliament). In some systems, a ratified treaty may, by the provisions of the Constitution, become automatically a part of the law of the land. In others, it may require — to be internally effective — implementing legislation. This may already exist or may have to be enacted by Parliament. In the case of federal states, the situation is more complicated. The treaty-making power is normally the exclusive prerogative of the central (federal) government. The implementing (performing) power, in cases where a ratified treaty does not become automatically the law of the land, would be vested in a legislature or legislatures following the constitutional division of powers. The power of ratifying and implementing I. L. O. Conventions within the Canadian constitutional context has two aspects :(a) which level of government has constitutional power to ratify I. L. O. Conventions ; and(b) which level or levels of governments has or have power to implement aConvention by taking appropriate legislative measures, when necessary. THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT, 1867 The B. N. A. Act enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1867 and subsequent amendments established Canada as it is known today, and form the written part of the Canadian Constitution. The unwritten part of the Canadian Constitution consists of political conventions and customs which form the unwritten Constitution of the United Kingdom which has been applied in Canada before and after the enactment of the B. N. A. Act. Some judicial decisions, particularly those rendered by the Privy Council in London in interpreting the provisions of the B. N. A. Act, added an important element to the totality of written and unwritten rules that form the Canadian Constitutional setup. When, in 1867, the B. N. A. Act was enacted, it was not contemplated that the Dominion of Canada would possess treaty-making powers. At that time, Canada did not possess a separate juristic identity in the field of international relations and the Imperial Government in London was responsible for Canada's international relations. Therefore, the B. N. A. Act only in one section dealt with the powers of the Parliament and Government of Canada regarding implementation (performance) of international obligations contracted by the Parliament and Government of Great Britain insofar as such obligations were binding Canada. The relevant section 132 of the B. N. A. Act reads as follows :« The Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada or of any Province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards Foreign Countries, arising under Treaties between the Empire and such Foreign Countries ». At that time the treaty-making power (that is the creation of international obligations affecting Canada) was understood to be within the exclusive competence of the Imperial Parliament and Government of Great Britain. When Canada emerged from the First World War as an international person, and through membership in the League of Nations became a full fledged member of the international community of sovereign states, she faced her new international capacities and responsibilities without constitutional provisions regarding the treaty-making and treaty-performing powers that would correspond to her new international status. It was mainly left to judicial interpretation of the B. N. A. Act to fill in the constitutional gaps regarding the formation and performance of Canada's international obligations. When federal legislation implementing Canada's obligations under the Aeronautic Convention was challenged, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upheld the validity of such legislation under section 132 of the B. N. A. Act as being legislation to perform obligations imposed by a treaty between the British Empire and the foreign countries (The Aeronautics Case (1932) A. C. 54). 1 In the Radio Case (1932) A. C. 304, the validity of the federal radio communication legislation implementing the international Convention was upheld not on the ground of section 132 of the B. N. A. Act, but on the ground that the Convention in question dealt with classes of matters not included within the enumerated classes of the subjects reserved in section 92 of the B. N. A. Act exclusively to provincial legislatures, or even within the enumerated classes reserved to the Dominion Parliament in section 91 of the B. N. A. Act. Moreover, part of the subject matter of the Convention, namely, broadcasting, might come under the heading « Inter-provincial Telegraphs », expressly excluded from section 92 and thus falling within federal jurisdiction 2. THE LABOUR CONVENTIONS CASE (1937) 3 In 1935 the federal government ratified three I. L. O. Conventions the subject matter of which was partly within both federal and provincial jurisdictions, but primarily within provincial jurisdiction under section 92 (13) of the B. N. A. Act, namely, « Property and civil rights in the Province ». The Conventions in question were :Convention No. 1  : Hours of Work (Industry), 1919 Convention No. 14  : Weekly Rest (Industry), 1921 Convention No. 26  : Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery, 1928. The same year (1935) the legislation implementing these Conventions was enacted by the Parliament of Canada, namely : The Limitation of Hours of Work Act ; The Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings Act ; and the Minimum Wage Act. By the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council rendered on January 28, 1937, the statutes implementing these ratified Conventions were declared ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. This decision of the Privy Council is of primary importance as it dealt with the question of ratification and implementation of the I. L. O. Conventions and international treaties in general within Canadian constitutional framework and the B. N. A. Act in particular. Considering that the constitutional position established in the judgment of the Privy Council in the Labour Conventions Case is still applied to Canada's approach to ratification and implementation of I. L. O. Conventions, it might be useful to present the main aspects of the judgment. The main issue that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was called to decide was whether the federal statutes implementing the ratified Conventions were valid. It was admitted at the bar that each statute affected property and civil rights within each province. Nevertheless, the federal government argued that the implementing legislation was validly enacted under the legislative powers given to the Dominion Parliament by the B. N. A. Act, 1867. In particular, it was contended that the legislation could be justified either (1) under section 132 of the B. N. A. Act as being legislation « necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or any Province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries, arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries » or (2) under the general powers, sometimes called <b>residuary</b> <b>powers</b> granted by section 91 of the B. N. A. Act to the Dominion Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned by the B. N. A. Act exclusively to the legislatures of the Provinces 4. The latter argument was apparently prompted by an opinion expressed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada (when the case was considered by that Court) that the judgments of the Judicial Committee in the Aeronautics Case and the Radio Case (referred to above) indicated that « jurisdiction to legislate for the purpose of performing the obligation of a treaty resides exclusively in the Parliament of Canada » 5. The provinces (Ontario, New Brunswick and British Columbia) contended :Regarding the first argument —(a) « that the obligations, if any, of Canada under the labour conventions did not arise under a treaty or treaties made between the Empire and foreign countries: and that therefore section 132 of the B. N. A. Act did not apply »;(b) « that the Canadian Government had no executive authority to make any such treaty as was alleged »;(c) « that the obligations said to have been incurred, and the legislative powers sought to be exercised, by the Dominion were not incurred and exercised in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles ». Regarding the second argument —« if the Dominion had to rely only upon the powers given by s. 91, the legislation was invalid, for it related to matters which came within the classes of subjects exclusively assigned to the Legislatures of the Provinces — namely, property and civil rights in the province » 6. The judgment stressed that it is essential to make the distinction between (1) the formation, (2) the performance, of the obligations constituted by a treaty. It pointed out that « within the British Empire there is a well-established rule that the making of a treaty is an executive act, while the performance of its obligations, if they entail alteration of the existing domestic law, requires legislative action » 7. Another rule is that, « unlike some other countries, the stipulations of a treaty duly ratified do not within the Empire, by virtue of the treaty alone, have the force of law » 8. If the national executive, the government of the day, decide by the act of ratification to be bound by the obligations of a treaty which involves alteration of law it has to obtain the assent of Parliament to the necessary legislation implementing the treaty obligations. There is no doubt that the creation of the obligations undertaken in treaties is the function of the executive alone. Once such obligations are created, « while they bind the State as against the other contracting parties, Parliament may refuse to perform them and so leave the State in default » 9 In a unitary state (like the United Kingdom) with a legislature possessing unlimited powers, the problem is simple. Parliament will either fulfil or fail to fulfil treaty obligations imposed upon the state by its executive. The nature of the obligations does not affect the full power of the Parliament to make them into law only if it so chooses. But the problem is complex in a state where the legislature does not possess absolute authority ; or, in a federal state where legislative authority is either limited by a constitutional document, or, even more so when it is divided up between different legislatures in accordance with classes of subject-matter (as in Canada). In this latter case, the obligations imposed by a treaty may have to be performed by several Legislatures. Then the executive has to obtain the legislative assent (implementation) not only of the one Parliament to which the executive may be responsible but also of all other legislatures concerned and to which the executive stands in no direct relation. The judgment emphasized that the question is not how is the obligation formed, which is the function of the executive, « but how is the obligation to be performed, and that depends upon the authority of the competent Legislature or Legislatures » 10. At this point it should be noted that the Judicial Committee did not consider necessary to rule on the contention submitted by the Provinces that the Canadian government did not have executive authority to ratify the Conventions in question. But, on the other hand, the Judicial Committee noted that no argument was raised that would question « the international status which Canada had now attained, involving her competence to enter into international treaties as an international juristic person » 11. In declaring the federal statutes implementing the ratified Conventions to be ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, the Judicial Committee rejected the contentions submitted by the Federal government on the following grounds :The contention that the implementing legislation was valid under section 132 of the B. N. A. Act was rejected on the ground that the international obligations contracted by ratifying the conventions were not obligations of Canada as part of the British Empire, but of Canada, « by virtue of her new status as an international person », and were not created under a treaty between the British Empire and foreign countries 12. The judgment admitted that it was not contemplated in 1867 that the Dominion would possess treaty-making powers, but added that it was impossible to stretch section 132 so as to cover the event not contemplated at that time, also, it was impossible to accept the argument that the obligations to perform the conventions arose « under » part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles which dealt with the establishment of the I. L. O. In this respect, the judgment stated that « no obligation to legislate in respect of any of the matters in question arose until the Canadian executive, left with an unfettered discretion,of their own volition, acceded to the conventions, a novus actus not determined by the Treaty » 13. The second argument that the power to enact the contested legislation was based on section 91 of the B. N. A. Act was also rejected. In the opinion of the Judicial Committee, there is no doubt whatsoever that normally the contested legislation came within the classes of subjects by section 92 of the B. N. A. Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the Provinces, namely, property and civil rights in the Province. Being so, such legislation is expressly excluded from the general powers given to the Parliament of Canada by the first words of section 91 (Peace, Order and good Government of Canada) 15. Further, the judgment rejected the argument that the distribution of powers in sections 91 and 92 of the B. N. A. Act could be disregarded and federal legislation could be justified on the grounds that the legislation in question was concerned with matters of such general importance as to have attained « such dimensions as to affect the body politic » and to have « ceased to be merely local or provincial » and to have « become matters of national concern ». Such argument could only be accepted in some exceptional circumstances such as epidemic of pestilence or the existence of « some extraordinary peril to the national life in Canada », but the situation in Canada at the time of the enactment of the legislation in question was far from such highly exceptional conditions which might over-ride the normal distribution of powers in sections 91 and 92 15. The judgment stressed that for the purposes of sections 91 and 92, which divided the legislative powers between the Dominion and the Provinces, « there is no such thing as treaty legislation as such » 16. The distribution of legislative powers is based on classes of subjects. Consequently when a treaty affects a particular class of subjects then the legislative power of performing it is to be ascertained accordingly. The judgment stressed that the distribution of legislative powers between two levels of governments constitutes probably the most essential condition in the « inter-provincial compact » achieved under the B. N. A. Act. Therefore, any claim by the Dominion following ratification of a treaty to legislate on matters reserved to provincial legislatures would « undermine the constitutional safeguards of Provincial constitutional autonomy » 17. It is true, the judgment noted, that the federal executive has now the powers of making treaties and assuming international obligations. But if such obligations affect the classes of subjects within provincial jurisdictions enumerated in section 92, their implementation is within the competence of the Provincial legislatures only. In other words, the Judicial Committee added that « the Dominion cannot, merely by making promises to foreign countries, clothe itself with legislative authority inconsistent with the Constitution which gave it birth » 18. Finally, the judgment stated :« It must not be thought that the result of this decision is that Canada is incompetent to legislate in performance of treaty obligations. In totality of legislative powers, Dominion and Provincial together, she is fully equipped. But the legislative powers remain distributed, and if in the exercice of her new functions derived from her new international status Canada incurs obligations they must, so far as legislation be concerned, when they deal with Provincial classes of subjects, be dealt with by the totality of powers, in other words by co-operation between the Dominion and the Provinces. While the ship of the state now sails on larger ventures and into foreign waters she still retains the watertight compartments which are an essential part of her original structure » 19. EFFECTS OF LABOUR CONVENTIONS CASEThe decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council created an awkward situation for Canada. The decision did not affect the validity of ratification of the Conventions in question. Canada remained bound to comply with the provisions of the ratified Conventions but the legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada, in order to perform the contracted obligations, was declared ultra vires and consequently not valid. There were two courses open to the federal government. Canada could consider the denouncing of these conventions under the terms provided in each of them. Alternatively, Canada could remain bound by the ratifications hoping that the provinces as well as the federal government acting within their respective jurisdictions would enact the necessary legislation implementing the international obligations contracted by the federal executive. The second alternative was adopted. Canada did not denounce the conventions, and legislative action on both levels of government brought us on the whole into compliance with conventions regarding weekly rest and minimum wage-fixing machinery. Regarding Convention No. 1 — Hours of Work (Industry) — full compliance as yet has not been achieved. The judgment of the Privy Council clarified the constitutional aspects of ratification of the I. L. O. Conventions by indicating how Canada could perform contractual international obligations when subject matters of the conventions fall within exclusive provincial or both federal and provincial jurisdictions. The approach regarding I. L. O. Conventions, the subject matter of which is within exclusive federal jurisdiction was not affected by the Privy Council decision and several conventions of this kind have been ratified particularly in the field of conditions of employment of seafarers. Regarding conventions affecting both federal and provincial jurisdictions, the judgment stressed the need of consultation and co-operat...|$|E
