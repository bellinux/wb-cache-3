Some fatal accidents have occurred because normal engine-out procedures for light twin aircraft are not effective when flying the MU-2.

40|$|AIm: To {{investigate}} clinical {{factors that}} may influence the decision to preserve or remove the bone flap during the craniectomy surgery for patients of traumatic brain injury. mATERIAL and mETHods: Clinical data from 2256 TBI patients were quantitatively analyzed and scored based on multiple clinical factors, including preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, changes in pupil size, hematoma volume, time interval between injury and surgery, midline shift on CT scan, hematoma location and type, cortical collapse and the lateral ventricular shift deformation. REsuLTs: We identified several independent factors {{in the decision to}} preserve the bone flap: GCS score and pupil changes before the operation, cortical collapse, injury/surgery time interval and hematoma location. The results suggested that for patients with a combined score of ≥ 55, their bone <b>flap</b> was generally <b>retained.</b> For cases with a score of 50 - 55, the surgical decision was based on the patient level of preconscious status, changes in pupil size and the extent of postoperative cortical collapse, and for patients with a score < 50, the bone flap was generally removed.

50|$|The CL-1200 was to {{have kept}} the basic F-104 {{fuselage}} structure, increased in length to provide 46% extra internal fuel capacity. The fuselage extension consisted of a 30 in plug between the standard F-104 front and center fuselage sections. Unlike the F-104, the rear fuselage section was to be constructed using titanium alloy for the frames, longerons and skinning around the jet exhaust. The major revision of the design was a shoulder-mounted wing of 53% larger area which was also moved further aft. The new wing had a span of 29 ft and still featured leading and trailing edge flaps but gained new leading edge extensions, while the 10° anhedral of the Starfighter was <b>retained.</b> The <b>flap</b> system {{was designed to be}} either manual or automatic in operation; the system configuring them as required for load factor, airspeed and altitude. The new inner wing panels featured an additional trailing edge flap which doubled the area in comparison to the F-104; this would have improved short-field performance and lowered the landing speed. The boundary layer control system of the F-104 was deemed unnecessary due to the increased flap area and was omitted. The outer wing panels were virtually identical to those of the F-104.|$|R
50|$|Externally {{the old and}} new {{aircraft}} are similar, wings and tail having the same features and the side-by-side seating <b>retained.</b> Electrically operated <b>flaps</b> are fitted to the Scout and there is a central trim tab on the elevator. Its fixed tricycle undercarriage is mounted on the fuselage with cantilever composite mainlegs. The mainwheels have brakes operated with a central lever and the nosewheel has helical springing. All wheels are spatted. It is powered by a 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912ULS flat four air- and water- cooled piston engine, driving a three blade propeller with ground adjustable blade pitch. The higher engine power and lighter weight gives the Scout UL a much improved rate climb of 5.0 m/s (984 ft/min) over the Skaut's 3.5 m/s (689 ft/min) and the Scout LSA climbs faster still. (6.0 m/s or 1.181 ft/min). Wing tanks give a fuel capacity of 90 L (23.5 US gal; 19.8 Imp gal).|$|R
40|$|Delaying stall {{is always}} an {{attractive}} option in the aerospace industry. The major benefit of delaying stall is increased lift during takeoff and landings as well as during high angle of attack situations. Devices, such as fluidic oscillators, can be integrated into wing flaps to help delay the occurrence of stall by adding energized air to the airflow on the upper surface of the wing flap. The energized air from the oscillator allows the airflow to remain attached to the upper surface of the wing flap. The fluidic oscillator being integrated in this thesis is an active flow control device (AFC). One common method for integrating any device into a wing flap is to remove {{a section of the}} flap and mechanically secure the device. A current trend in the aerospace industry is the increased use of fiber-reinforced composites to replace traditional metal components on aircraft. The traditional methods of device integration cause additional complications when applied to composite components as compared to metal components. This thesis proposes an alternative method for integration of the AFC devices, which occurs before the fabrication of wing flaps is completed and they are attached to the aircraft wing. Seven design concepts are created to reduce the complications from using current methods of integration on composite wing flaps. The concepts are based on four design requirements: aerodynamics, manufacturing, maintenance, and structure. Four of the design concepts created are external designs, which place the AFC on the exterior surface of the wing flap in two types of grooved channels. The other three designs place the AFC inside the wing flap skin and are categorized as internal designs. In order for the air exiting the AFC to reach the upper surface of the wing flap, slots are created in the wing flap skin for the internal designs. Within each of the seven design concepts two design variants are created based on foam or ribbed core types. Prototypes were created for all of the external design AFC devices and the side inserted AFC and <b>retaining</b> pieces. Wing <b>flap</b> prototypes were created for the rounded groove straight AFC design, the semi-circular groove with straight AFC, and the side inserted AFC designs. The wing flaps were created using the VARTM process with a vertical layup for the external designs. The rounded groove and semi-circular groove prototypes each went through three generations of prototypes until an acceptable wing flap was created. The side inserted design utilized the lessons learned through each generation of the external design prototypes eliminating the need for multiple generations. The lessons learned through the prototyping process helped refine the designs and determine the ease of manufacturing {{to be used in the}} design evaluation. The evaluation of the designs is based on the four design requirements stated above. The assessment of the designs uses two levels of evaluation matrices to determine the most fitting design concept. As a result of the evaluation, all four of the external designs and one of the internal designs are eliminated. The two remaining internal designs' foam core and ribbed variants are compared to establish the final design selection. The vertically inserted AFC foam core design is the most fitting design concept for the integration of an AFC device into a composite wing flap.
