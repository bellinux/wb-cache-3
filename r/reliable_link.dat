Network reliability can be improved effectively by improving the most important key link on the network. When such important link is once discovered, it enables to improve and maintain network reliability efficiently. For the indicator for discovering the key link, Birnbaum’s structural importance has been proposed so far.

Thus a node often has to decide whether the rrep indicates a <b>reliable</b> <b>link</b> or is due to an outlier in the distribution of received power. If the node accepts an atypical rrep when the link is not reliable, the subsequent attempt to communicate will fail.

40|$|Abstract — A {{considerable}} body {{of evidence}} indicates {{that the use of}} <b>reliable</b> <b>link</b> layer protocols over error prone wireless links dramatically improves the performance of Internet protocols and applications. While traditional link layer protocols set their timeout values assuming that they fully control the underlying link, some wireless networks allow multiple link layer sessions to co-exist over the same link. Since the optimal timeout values for a <b>reliable</b> <b>link</b> layer protocol depend on the available bandwidth, with dynamic link sharing such a protocol should ideally adapt its timeout values accordingly. We have thus designed an Adaptive Selective Repeat protocol that modifies its timeout values based on the policy used by TCP. We compare the performance of Web Browsing over Selective Repeat when using our adaptive timeout scheme with a range of parameters, against a manually tuned fixed timeout version. Our measurements show that these adaptive timeout policies outperform the fixed one, regardless of the level of contention, and that the best adaptive timeout policy in this setting is not the one used by TCP.

This model includes two types of links: reliable, which always deliver messages, and unreliable, which sometimes fail to deliver messages. Real networks compensate for this differing quality by deploying low-layer detection protocols to filter unreliable from reliable links. With this in mind, we begin by presenting an algorithm that solves the CCDS problem in the dual graph model under the assumption that every process u is provided with a local link detector set consisting of every neighbor connected to u by a <b>reliable</b> <b>link.</b> The algorithm solves the CCDS problem in O (∆ log 2 n b +log 3 n) rounds, with high probability, where ∆ is the maximum degree in the <b>reliable</b> <b>link</b> graph, n is the network size, and b is an upper bound in bits on the message size.

40|$|Although many {{successful}} ensemble clustering {{approaches have}} been developed in recent years, there are still two limitations {{to most of the}} existing approaches. First, they mostly overlook the issue of uncertain links, which may mislead the overall consensus process. Second, they generally lack the ability to incorporate global information to refine the local links. To address these two limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach based on sparse graph representation and probability trajectory analysis. In particular, we present the elite neighbor selection strategy to identify the uncertain links by locally adaptive thresholds and build a sparse graph with a small number of probably <b>reliable</b> <b>links.</b> We argue that a small number of probably <b>reliable</b> <b>links</b> can lead to significantly better consensus results than using all graph links regardless of their reliability. The random walk process driven by a new transition probability matrix is utilized to explore the global information in the graph.
