50|$|The {{property}} was not sold until John <b>Rattoon,</b> first official {{mayor of the}} then town of Perth Amboy. purchased it for $1,051 in 1794. <b>Rattoon,</b> a Perth Amboy merchant, had carefully concealed his work as an operator for the British secret service. He tore down the damaged rear portion of the upper story, put on a roof, and refurbished the interior.|$|E
5000|$|In 1808 <b>Rattoon</b> {{sold the}} {{property}} to Richard M. Woodhull of New York City who converted it into a hotel called The Brighton. In addition to building a three-story wing, Woodhull added two stories to the main block. The smaller lintels of the third floor windows indicate the change. During the 1986 restoration, the attic chimneys revealed that the original roof had been only about eight feet lower than the present one. Woodhull replaced the huge front door, the outline of which is still distinguishable in the brick pattern. The massive brownstone steps were replaced with a two-story porch. A door leading to the second story of the porch replaced the Venetian window. Almost all of the present woodwork dates from the 1808-1809 period. It was then that the two handsome interior arches were constructed. The New York Gazette of May 27, 1809, described the Brighton Hotel as a [...] "Charming Place, magnificent by nature and elegant by art." ...|$|E

6000|$|We passed several sugar plantations--new {{ones and}} not very extensive. The crops were, in most cases, third <b>rattoons.</b> [NOTE.--The first crop is called [...] "plant cane;" [...] {{subsequent}} crops which spring from the original roots, without replanting, are called [...] "rattoons."] Almost everywhere {{on the island of}} Hawaii sugar-cane matures in twelve months, both <b>rattoons</b> and plant, and although it ought to be taken off as soon as it tassels, no doubt, it is not absolutely necessary to do it until about four months afterward. In Kona, the average yield of an acre of ground is two tons of sugar, they say. This is only a moderate yield for these islands, but would be astounding for Louisiana and most other sugar growing countries. The plantations in Kona being on pretty high ground--up among the light and frequent rains--no irrigation whatever is required.|$|R

The aim of the experiments to get the cultivation varieties of sugar cane which has high total sugar content after 6 months, either plant cane or the first <b>rattooned.</b> Several cultivars of PS 87, produced by P 3 GI, were tested. The experiment consisted of plant density, date of planting kind of cultivar and level of potassium fertilizers. The result showed that the PS 87 - 22704 cultivar and PS 58 variety (as a control) produced the high total-sugar content (15. 64 % and 15. 89 %) ...|$|R
