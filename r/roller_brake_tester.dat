50|$|A <b>roller</b> <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> is {{a method}} of {{allowing}} the dynamic assessment of the braking system of a motor vehicle, whilst the vehicle itself is in a static condition. This type of brake tester is normally used in UK garages when used {{as part of an}} inspection lane for the MOT test.|$|E
5000|$|A {{decelerometer}} is a {{hand held}} device for measuring dynamic braking forces during a vehicle road test. A vehicle decelerometer operates {{as if it}} were, and {{it could also be}} known as, an accelerometer as it calculates braking efficiency by using those forces captured during a vehicle's deceleration. A decelerometer is a method by which braking effort can be accessed quickly and easily but it is generally used as an indicator to acceptable brake performance. Low efficiency readings should lead to further investigation on a <b>roller</b> <b>brake</b> <b>tester.</b>|$|E
40|$|Brake system {{diagnosis}} {{is one of}} the most common and necessary technical operations applied to the car, regardless of its type and operating phases. Measuring the diagnostic parameters on a <b>roller</b> <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> is a fast operation with no disassembly necessary. Measuring the run-out of friction surfaces of brake discs with a dial gauge is an action that requires more extensive preparatory operations but it offers a high accuracy of the results. The paper aims to analyze the correlation between the dial gauge measured values and the diagnostic obtained using the brake roller tester...|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} 3 {{different}} types of <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> {{used to calculate the}} braking efforts and efficiencies of a motor vehicle. <b>Roller</b> <b>brake</b> <b>testers,</b> which consist of a chassis with a driven <b>roller</b> system; plate <b>brake</b> <b>testers,</b> which consist of 2 parallel measuring plates, and decelerometers which are usually hand held devices.|$|R
50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>brake</b> <b>testers</b> {{consist of}} a {{mechanical}} floor unit which contains electrical motors, two independent sets of three measuring <b>rollers,</b> <b>brake</b> force transducers and additional safety sensors. The driving rollers operate at a low (known) speed using a gearbox and motor arrangement and during a test measurements of the maximum braking force are taken by applying the vehicle brakes which induces a reaction force on the electric motor itself. An electric transducer with strain gauges then measures the individual induced forces which are acting during the deceleration phase in order to calculate the individual braking forces for each wheel.|$|R
50|$|A plate <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} a vehicles braking system in a dynamic test. The unit consists of two moving parallel plates mounted on force transducers. A measurement of the braking force is made when a vehicle passes over the plates and then applies its brakes. The braking action causes the individual plates to ‘slip’ forwards allowing a calculation of braking force to be made. Brake imbalance between {{the left and right}} hand side can also be measured by the differences in voltage measured on each of the force transducers under the chassis. Due to the nature of it dynamic operation, plate <b>brake</b> <b>testers</b> are far less common than <b>roller</b> <b>brake</b> <b>testers</b> in UK garages although they are also an extremely accurate method of measurement.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe main testing {{parameter}} of the <b>roller</b> <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> is the braking force. Actually, {{there are}} some differences in results even if the same vehicle is tested on the same tester. So it will bring trouble to evaluate the braking performance accurately. Based on force analysis, the mathematical model of the roller opposite force type automobile brake tester is built in this article. And then the factors of influencing braking force value will be analyzed by theoretical calculations Taking the instance of the Jianghuai light truck and using the mathematical model analyze influencing factors for testing results and calculate error value. The results showed that adhesion cofficients of between testing wheels and rollers and between non-testing wheels and floor, structure of the roller brake testor have an influece on testing results of braking force {{and structure of the}} roller brake testor is the least. The theoretical analysis provide references for comparison test among testing equipments of the braking performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{investigation}} of the roll <b>brake</b> <b>testers</b> used testing for trucks has been made during year 2002. There have been developed a test trail [1], reported in TC- 3 Congress Celle 2002. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to get information about real measurement capability of the roll <b>brake</b> <b>testers</b> used in inspection of the trucks for Finnish authority (The Finnish Vehicle Administration AKE). The usually way to calibrate roll <b>brake</b> <b>tester</b> has been to generate the reference force direct against of the force measurement transducer. This calibration does neither take in to account the mechanical construction of the rollers nor the diameters of them or the dynamic behaviour of the measurement. The investigation gives the information over practical uncertainty of the roll <b>brake</b> <b>tester.</b> The used comparing method has been static with the reference transducer as well quasistatic by the test trail, which makes the control of roll <b>brake</b> <b>testers</b> with the speed of normal use of a roll <b>brake</b> <b>tester,</b> about 3 km/h...|$|R

2500|$|Invented in 1897, {{the duck}} <b>brake</b> or duck <b>roller</b> <b>brake</b> used a rod {{operated}} by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers (usually made of wood or rubber) against the front tyre. [...] Mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set {{at an angle to}} conform to the shape of the tyre, the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre, thus braking the front wheel. [...] A tension spring held the rollers away from the tyre except when braking. [...] Braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar, which provided additional leverage when braking (two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary). [...] Used in combination with a rear coaster brake, a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake. [...] Known colloquially as the duck brake, the design was used by many notable riders of the day, and was widely exported to England, Australia, and other countries. [...] In 1902, Louis H. Bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the Duck <b>Roller</b> <b>Brake</b> (Patent 708,114) for use on motorized bicycles (motorcycles).|$|R

2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of mass-produced pneumatic tyres by the Dunlop Tyre Company, the use of spoon brakes began to decline, as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres.
