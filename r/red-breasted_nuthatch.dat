5|$|Nuthatches {{are very}} vocal, using an {{assortment}} of whistles, trills and calls. Their breeding songs tend to be simple and often identical to their contact calls but longer in duration. The <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> which coexists with the black-capped chickadee throughout much of its range, is {{able to understand the}} latter species' calls. The chickadee has subtle call variations that communicate information about the size and risk of potential predators. Many birds recognise the simple alarm calls produced by other species, but the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is able to interpret the chickadees' detailed variations and to respond appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Members of the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch</b> {{superspecies}} excavate {{their own}} tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch</b> makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E
5|$|This nuthatch's {{responses}} to predators {{may be linked}} to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch</b> in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch's</b> call is high-pitched, nasal and weak. Transcribed as yenk or ink, {{they have}} been likened to a toy tin horn or a child's noisemaker. Its song is a slowly {{repeated}} series of clear, nasal, rising notes, transcribed as eeen eeen eeen.|$|R
25|$|Arthropods and {{molluscs}} found include millipedes, collembolans, spiders, beetles, slugs, {{and various}} centipedes. Animals that inhabit the Northern Coast range are weevils, chipmunks, bears, rabbits, white-footed deer mice, Columbian Black tail deer, and others. Birds include chickadees, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatches,</b> kinglets, Western pileated woodpeckers, Oregon gray jays, California creepers, and Sitka red crossbills among others.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch's</b> diet changes {{depending}} on the season. In the summer, it eats mostly insects, occasionally even flycatching, while in the winter, it switches to conifer seeds. At feeders it will take sunflower seeds, peanut butter, and suet. It often wedges food pieces in bark crevices in order to break them up with the bill (as opposed to holding the food in their feet, like the black-capped chickadee does).|$|R
5|$|Three other, {{significantly}} smaller, nuthatches have ranges which overlap that of white-breasted, {{but none}} has white plumage completely surrounding the eye. Further distinctions {{are that the}} <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch</b> has a black eye line and reddish underparts, and the brown-headed and pygmy nuthatches each have a brown cap, and a white patch on the nape of the neck.|$|E
5|$|Holkham's north-facing coastal {{location}} {{can attract}} {{large numbers of}} migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, especially with a north to north-east wind. The common species may {{be accompanied by a}} wryneck, red-backed shrike or greenish warbler in August, with goldcrests, thrushes and finches later in the season, and perhaps red-breasted flycatchers and yellow-browed warblers. Vagrant rarities such as Pallas's, Radde's or dusky warblers may occur; a <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch</b> in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2012, the only individual of its species to be recorded in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Members of the {{nuthatch}} family live {{in most of}} North America and Europe {{and throughout}} Asia down to the Wallace Line. Nuthatches are sparsely represented in Africa; one species lives in a small area of northeastern Algeria and a population of the Eurasian nuthatch subspecies, S. e. hispaniensis, lives {{in the mountains of}} Morocco. Most species are resident year-round. The only significant migrant is the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> which winters widely across North America, deserting the northernmost parts of its breeding range in Canada; it has been recorded as a vagrant in Bermuda, Iceland and England.|$|E
40|$|Variation in {{population}} abundance reduces statistical power and complicates planning of effective monitoring programs. We studied patterns of temporal variation over space in six bird species in northern Alberta, Canada. Species with larger body mass {{did not have}} larger scales of population synchrony, but larger territory sizes were roughly associated with larger maximum extents of synchrony. The minimum extent of synchrony was 400 m to 600 m for all species examined, except Black-capped Chickadees Parus atricapillus, {{for which it was}} 1 km. Ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapillus, <b>Red-breasted</b> <b>Nuthatches</b> Sitta canadensis and Tennessee Warblers Vermivora peregrina were synchronous to 10 km, Black-capped Chickadee were synchronous to 7 km, while White-throated Sparrow Zonotrichia albicolis and Yellow-rumped Warbler Dendroica coronata did not show synchrony at any distance. Synchrony was strongest in Tennessee Warblers and <b>Red-breasted</b> Nuthatches; <b>Red-breasted</b> <b>Nuthatches</b> had a regular biannual cycle consistent with cone crop periodicity, while Tennessee Warbler abundance was related to spruce budworm abundance within Canada. Black-capped Chickadees are more abundant in warm years and may also be associated with large cone crops. Ovenbird abundance seems to depend on both local effects and factors on wintering grounds...|$|R
500|$|Nuthatches {{prefer a}} fairly {{temperate}} climate; northern species live near sea level whereas those further south {{are found in}} cooler highland habitats. Eurasian and <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatches</b> are lowland birds {{in the north of}} their extensive ranges, but breed in the mountains further south; for example, Eurasian nuthatch, which breeds where the July temperature range is , is found near sea level in Northern Europe, but between [...] altitude in Morocco. The velvet-fronted nuthatch is the sole member of the family which prefers tropical lowland forests.|$|R
50|$|Each {{forest type}} attracts its own subset of summer birds. The aspen-birch {{community}} supports ovenbirds, red-eyed vireos, veeries, ruffed grouse, black-capped chickadees, least flycatchers, and black-throated green warblers. The same species {{appear in the}} aspen-birch-fir forest {{with the addition of}} white-throated sparrows, magnolia warblers, yellow-rumped warblers, and winter wrens. The most common overwinterers are black-capped chickadees, gray jays, pine grosbeaks, and hairy and downy woodpeckers. Specific to the pine forests are Blackburnian warblers, hermit thrushes, eastern wood pewees, golden-crowned kinglets, brown creepers, and <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatches.</b>|$|R
5|$|Most nuthatches {{breed in}} the {{temperate}} or montane woodlands of the Northern Hemisphere, although two species {{have adapted to}} rocky habitats in the warmer and drier regions of Eurasia. However, the greatest diversity is in Southern Asia, and similarities between the species have {{made it difficult to}} identify distinct species. All members of this genus nest in holes or crevices. Most species are non-migratory and live in their habitat year-round, although the North American <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch</b> migrates to warmer regions during the winter. A few nuthatch species have restricted ranges and face threats from deforestation.|$|E
5|$|The nuthatches {{are all in}} {{the genus}} Sitta Linnaeus, 1758, a name derived from , Ancient Greek for this bird. Nuthatch refers to the {{propensity}} of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Kr√ºper's and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E
5|$|For the few {{species on}} which data are available, the average {{nuthatch}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is between 2 and 3.5years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male Corsican nuthatch 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators {{may be linked to}} reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E

25|$|The pine {{plantation}} {{is home to}} {{many animals}} that prefer a coniferous habitat. The silence of the pine forest is often broken by the chatter of a red squirrel as it sees visitors. In the winter months, one may catch sight of a <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch</b> as it searches the bark of a nearby pine for food.|$|E
25|$|Birds of {{the area}} include bald eagle, {{northern}} spotted owl, Lewis's woodpecker, Williamson's sapsucker, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> golden-crowned kinglet and many migratory species, with the riverbanks important habitat for this birdlife. Mammals that move through the mountain grasslands include elk (including the largest herd in North America at Hells Canyon), bighorn sheep and mule deer. Native fish include Chinook Salmon, Steelhead, Redband Trout, Coho Salmon, Bull Trout, and Pacific Lamprey.|$|E
500|$|Worlds End State Park is {{featured}} in the Audubon Society's Susquehanna River Birding and Wildlife Trail Guide. Birds {{of interest in the}} park include common mergansers along the creek and other riparian species such as belted kingfisher, as well as barred, great horned, and the scarce, elusive northern saw-whet owls. Other avian species seen in the park and believed to nest there include tufted titmouse, brown creeper, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> common raven, scarlet tanager, yellow-bellied sapsucker, and winter wren.

40|$|Many animals {{recognize}} the alarm calls produced by other species, {{but the amount}} of information they glean from these eavesdropped signals is unknown. We previously showed that black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) have a sophisticated alarm call system in which they encode complex information about the size and risk of potential predators in variations of a single type of mobbing alarm call. Here we show experimentally that <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatches</b> (Sitta canadensis) respond appropriately to subtle variations of these heterospecific ‚Äúchick-a-dee‚Äù alarm calls, thereby evidencing that they have gained important information about potential predators in their environment. This study demonstrates a previously unsuspected level of discrimination in intertaxon eavesdropping...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 I studied species' abundances {{and habitat}} {{relationships}} of breeding and winter birds in commercially thinned and unthinned Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands from May 1989 to June 1991. The {{study was conducted}} in 40 - to 55 -year old stands in the Central Oregon Coast Ranges and the Tillamook State Forest. Total abundance and species diversity of breeding birds was greater in thinned stands. During the breeding season, Hammond's flycatchers (Empidonax hammondii), hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus), <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatches</b> (Sitta canadensis), and dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) were more abundant in thinned than unthinned stands. Golden-crowned kinglets (Regulus satrapa), black-throated gray warblers (Dendroica nigrescens), and Pacific-slope flycatchers (Empidonax difficilis) were more abundant in unthinned stands. During the winter, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatches</b> and winter wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes) were more abundant in thinned stands. Differences in abundances of bird species between thinned and unthinned stands seemed to be related to differences in stand structure caused by thinning and to differences in hardwood densities that were probably unrelated to thinning. Differences in abundances of bird species between the Central Coast Ranges and the Tillamook State Forest were related to differences in shrub cover, and densities of hardwoods, snags, and conifers (> 56 cm dbh) between the 2 regions. I recommended a thinning regime that would encourage understory and hardwood development in combination with unthinned leave areas to provide snag recruitment and habitat for species associated with dense stands. This regime is intended to maximize bird diversity and abundance in 40 - to 55 - year-old Douglas-fir stands in western Oregon...|$|R
2500|$|Birds {{living in}} the Central Coast Range include a variety of smaller and larger bird species. These include winter wrens, chestnut-backed chickadees, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>nuthatches,</b> varied thrushes, several swallow species, red crossbills, evening grosbeaks, brown creepers, olive-sided flycatchers, Hammond's flycatchers, gray jays, western wood-pewees, and western tanagers. Some of the larger species in the range include the red-breasted sapsucker, common ravens, {{peregrine}} falcons, the pileated woodpecker, turkey vultures, wood duck, common nighthawks, and the red-tailed hawk. Birds in lower numbers include Vaux's swifts, the endangered spotted owl, bald eagles, the downy woodpecker, hairy woodpeckers, the pine siskin, the hermit warbler, Pacific-slope flycatchers, golden-crowned kinglets, and ruffed grouse. One of the more common avian wildlife is the American dipper, which live mainly near rivers and streams. These birds build nests from six to nine inches (229mm) [...] in diameter out of moss.|$|R
500|$|Ricketts Glen State Park has {{extensive}} acreage of [...] "interior forest" [...] that is {{far from}} open space; several bird species that are area-sensitive are found within these forests in the park, including the black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, dark-eyed junco and black-capped chickadee. Two species of owl, barred and northern saw-whet, inhabit the deep forests. The hemlock forests of the glens are home to the Louisiana waterthrush, Acadian flycatcher, Blackburnian warbler, blue-headed vireo, magnolia warbler, brown creeper, golden-crowned kinglet and winter wren. Wood thrush {{are found in the}} lower elevations of the park and are replaced within the ecosystem by hermit thrush at the higher elevations. The Canada warbler and black-throated blue warbler are on several watchlists, but are common within the park. The Canada warbler inhabits blueberry thickets with white-throated sparrow, while the black-throated blue warbler is found in the forests atop the plateau with the least flycatcher. Common raven are regularly seen soaring over the forests of the park looking for carrion. Canada goose are present in the park and have been classified as a [...] "pest" [...] due to their high numbers and the large amount of fecal waste they leave on the shores of Lake Jean.

40|$|Monday, November 8, 2010, was {{an unusually}} warm (upper 70 s) autumn day for Lincoln, Nebraska, with no clouds and a {{wind from the}} southwest. I went to Holmes Lake Park in {{southeast}} Lincoln to scan for late migrating waterfowl and then to check the stand of conifers {{for the arrival of}} winter migrants. Around 11 A. M. I was attracted to a feeding group of six Black-capped Chickadees and three <b>Red-breasted</b> <b>Nuthatches</b> in the 30 - to 40 -year-old pines and Douglas firs north of Hyde Observatory. I noticed a differently patterned nuthatch in the group. I had seen a Pygmy Nuthatch several times in Lincoln. This nuthatch, however, was a Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla). It was about {{the same size as the}} <b>Red-breasted</b> <b>Nuthatches</b> it was feeding with in the pines. However, it appeared plumper and not as sleek. Noticeable upon seeing it was the rich brown crown and a dark eye line (not noticeable unless at close range). It was pale buff below. The short tail was obvious along with the white nape spot. The back and wings were gray with the primaries lighter gray. The throat and cheek were white. It was not very vocal; only snippets of sound were heard that could have been nuthatch utterances. Quite a few birders (100 +) from around Nebraska and surrounding states made the nuthatch pilgrimage to Holmes. Birders kept this up for at least a couple of months. I saw the Brown-headed Nuthatch on the following dates: November 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, and 21 and December 5 and 28, 2010, and on January 5 and 14, 2011. Four extended searches of the area in February produced no further sightings. Lincoln is one of the few places in North America where all four North American species of <b>nuthatches</b> (White-breasted, <b>Red-breasted,</b> Pygmy, and Brown-headed) have been seen. Holmes Lake Park is where I can say that I have seen and heard all four species of nuthatches in the last two years...|$|R

40|$|Avian keratin {{disorder}} (AKD), {{characterized by}} debilitating overgrowth of the avian beak, was first documented in black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) in Alaska. Subsequently, similar deformities {{have appeared in}} numerous species across continents. Despite the widespread distribution of this emerging pathology, the cause of AKD remains elusive. As a result, it is unknown whether suspected cases of AKD in the afflicted species are causally linked, and the impacts of this pathology at the population and community levels are difficult to evaluate. We applied unbiased, metagenomic next-generation sequencing to search for candidate pathogens in birds affected with AKD. We identified and sequenced the complete coding region of a novel picornavirus, which we are calling poecivirus. Subsequent screening of 19 AKD-affected black-capped chickadees and 9 control individuals {{for the presence of}} poecivirus revealed that 19 / 19 (100 %) AKD-affected individuals were positive, while only 2 / 9 (22 %) control individuals were infected with poecivirus.
