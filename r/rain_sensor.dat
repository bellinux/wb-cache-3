500|$|The Camry in the Philippines offers three grades: {{the base}} G, {{offering}} a 2.4-litre engine mated to a five-speed automatic transmission, has 2 SRS airbags, has fabric seats {{and has a}} foot-type parking brake. The 2.4 V is almost {{the same as the}} G variant, however, it has a 4-spoke steering wheel with wood grain, 2 SRS airbags, and has a leather-wrapped wood grain with chrome shift lever and knob. The 3.5 Q is the top-of-the-line segment, offering a 3.5 2GR-FE V6, 24V, DOHC and dual VVT-i. It is mated to a six-speed gate-type automatic transmission, adaptive front lighting system, automatic <b>rain</b> <b>sensor,</b> dual exhaust tail pipe, tri-color/Optitron with multi-information display, 2 SRS front airbags, side SRS airbags, and a push start system. All of the variants has an integrated type / tuner/ in-dash 6 CD changer / MP3 / WMA. All of the variants use a foot-type parking brake, welcome the driver whenever the ignition is set to [...] "ON", displaying on the central console [...] "Welcome to Camry". All of the variants also have 4 front and 2 rear speakers.|$|E

50|$|To report {{freezing}} rain, {{the system}} combines the sensor output from the freezing <b>rain</b> <b>sensor</b> {{with data from}} the LEDWI. The LEDWI must provide a positive indication of unknown precipitation or rain before the system can transmit a report of freezing rain. If the LEDWI reports either no precipitation or snow, the system will ignore the input from the freezing <b>rain</b> <b>sensor.</b> The sensor is designed to detect and report icing from all weather conditions.|$|E

The Loyola recycling program includes office paper, aluminum cans, and newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} modern <b>rain</b> <b>sensors</b> {{are based on}} the {{principle}} of total internal reflection: an infrared light is beamed at a 45-degree angle into the windshield from the interior — if the glass is wet, less light makes it back to the sensor, and the wipers turn on. Most vehicles with this feature have an [...] "AUTO" [...] position on the stalk.|$|R

50|$|A {{robotic mower}} is {{contained}} by a border wire around the lawn {{that defines the}} area to be mowed. The robot uses this wire to locate the boundary of the area to be trimmed {{and in some cases}} to locate a recharging dock. Robotic mowers are capable of maintaining up to 5 acre of grass.

40|$|Smart home Automation technology, {{lifetime}} {{is getting}} easier and simpler on all side in life. In the world, automatically systems are being chosen over the manual system. With the fast {{growth in the}} number of users of the internet through the past decade, the Internet has become a part and section of human life. In this study, a remotely controlled smart home automation system, for monitoring and controlling the temperature degree, humidity percentage, gas leakage, fires, and rain in the house, was developed. This system can also control the light by using motion and light sensors inside and outside the home. The developed system consists of two parts: hardware and software. The hardware consists of many units such as smartphones, personal computers, Arduino Mega, Ethernet shield and relay board, temperature and humidity, gas, motion, flame, light and <b>rain</b> <b>sensors,</b> a buzzer and fire alarm. Arduino Mega used as the Microcontroller is the primary hardware unit connected with an Ethernet Shield responsible for sending and receiving directives and status via the internet. The software is the second part of this system; it is Arduino IDE’s code used to design web browser page. The web browser page connected to hardware devices and sensors through Ethernet shield. Moreover, it works to control and monitor this system from the web page and smartphone. Finally, this system uses an internet network for communication and alerts due to its low cost and large area coverage and can control every device via the web browser and Android application anywhere and anytime. Moreover, the gas, flame, light, temperature, humidity and <b>rain</b> <b>sensors</b> work correctly with excellent results...|$|R

50|$|Base Prioras {{come with}} {{standard}} driver's side airbag and electric power steering. Since May 2008, Lada Priora offers a «Lux» package, which includes passenger airbag (and more recently front side airbags), seat belt pretensioners {{in the front}} seats, ABS and parking sensors. In addition, some packages add standard air conditioning with climate control, integrated audio with bluetooth handsfree, heated front seats, automatic headlamps and <b>rain</b> <b>sensor.</b> In April 2010, an optional multimedia system {{was added to the}} options list, followed by a navigation system in early 2011. On the other hand, electronic stability control an fully automatic transmission are not offered.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rain</b> <b>sensor</b> or rain switch is a {{switching}} device activated by rainfall. There {{are two main}} applications for rain sensors. The first is a water conservation device connected to an automatic irrigation system that causes the system to shut down {{in the event of}} rainfall. The second is a device used to protect the interior of an automobile from rain and to support the automatic mode of windscreen wipers.An additional application in professional satellite communications antennas is to trigger a rain blower on the aperture of the antenna feed, to remove water droplets from the mylar cover that keeps pressurized and dry air inside the wave-guides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rain</b> <b>sensors</b> for {{irrigation}} systems {{are available in}} both wireless and hard-wired versions, most employing hygroscopic disks that swell {{in the presence of}} rain and shrink back down again as they dry out — an electrical switch is in turn depressed or released by the hygroscopic disk stack, and the rate of drying is typically adjusted by controlling the ventilation reaching the stack. However, some electrical type sensors are also marketed that use tipping bucket or conductance type probes to measure rainfall. Wireless and wired versions both use similarmechanisms to temporarily suspend watering by the irrigation controller— specifically they are connected to the irrigation controller's sensorterminals, or are installed in series with the solenoid valve common circuit such that they prevent the opening of any valves when rain has been sensed.|$|R
50|$|The Shadow is {{restricted}} from operating {{in bad weather}} conditions, not being meant to fly through <b>rain</b> and with <b>sensors</b> that cannot see through clouds.|$|R
40|$|Two {{water vapour}} radiometers (WVRs), called Astrid and Konrad, were {{operated}} during the CONT 11 campaign at the Onsala Space Observatory. A well known feature of WVRs {{is that their}} algorithm brakes down when there are large drops of water affecting the observations. Without any independent information one has {{to rely on the}} WVR data themselves to detect rain and remove the corresponding low quality results. In order to assess this technique we operated different types of <b>rain</b> <b>sensors</b> during CONT 11 : a zenith looking Doppler rain radar, three optical, and three capacitive sensors. The first 8. 25 days had frequent rain events whereas the last 7. 75 days where significantly drier. We summarize the data set acquired by the WVRs and the rain detectors. The inferred time series of the equivalent zenith wet delay (ZWD) and linear horizontal gradients are compared to the corresponding estimates from GPS data (acquired at the IGS station ONSA) and the VLBI data themselves...|$|R
