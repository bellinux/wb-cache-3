25|$|There {{are strong}} network {{effects in the}} initial choice of <b>rail</b> <b>gauge,</b> and in gauge {{conversion}} decisions. Even when placing isolated rails not connected to any other lines, track layers usually choose a standard <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> so they can use off-the-shelf rolling stock. Although a few manufacturers make rolling stock that can adjust to different <b>rail</b> <b>gauges,</b> most manufacturers make rolling stock that only works {{with one of the}} standard <b>rail</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R

25|$|Track {{consists}} of two parallel steel rails, anchored perpendicular to members called ties (sleepers) of timber, concrete, steel, or plastic to maintain a consistent distance apart, or <b>rail</b> <b>gauge.</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>gauges</b> are usually categorized as standard gauge (used on approximately 54.8% of the world's existing railway lines), broad gauge, and narrow gauge. In addition to the <b>rail</b> <b>gauge,</b> the tracks will be laid to conform with a Loading gauge which defines the maximum height and width for railway vehicles and their loads to ensure safe passage through bridges, tunnels and other structures.|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, we have {{developed}} computer vision methods for measurement of <b>rail</b> <b>gauge,</b> and reliable identification and localization of structural defects in railroad tracks. The <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> is {{the distance between the}} innermost sides of the two parallel steel rails. We {{have developed}} two methods for evaluation of <b>rail</b> <b>gauge.</b> These methods were designed for different hardware setups: the first method works with two pairs of unaligned video cameras while the second method works with depth maps generated by paired laser range scanners. We have also developed a method for detection of rail defects such as damaged or missed rail fasteners, tie clips, and bolts, based on correlation and MACH filters. Lastly, to make our algorithms perform in real-time, {{we have developed}} the GPU based library for parallel computation of the above algorithms. <b>Rail</b> <b>gauge</b> is the most important measurement for track maintenance, because deviations in gauge indicate where potential defects may exist. We have developed a vision-based method for <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> estimation from a pair of industrial laser range scanners. In this approach, we start with building a 3 D panorama of the rail out of a stack of input scans. After the panorama is built...|$|R
