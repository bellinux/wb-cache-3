2500|$|Under Bureau of Land Management permits {{that had}} first been issued in 1954, Bundy grazed his cattle legally and paid his grazing fees on the Bunkerville Allotment until 1993. In 1989, the federal {{government}} had declared the desert tortoise an endangered species and began negotiating a habitat conservation plan in Clark County, NV {{to meet the needs of}} both the tortoise and the people, such as Bundy, who were using the land. In mid-1991, the Fish and Wildlife Service approved a short-term conservation plan that allowed for development of about 22,000 acres of tortoise habitat in and around Las Vegas in exchange for strict conservation measures on 400,000 acres of federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land south of the city. This included the elimination of livestock grazing and strict limits on off-road vehicle use in the protected tortoise habitat. In 1993, a permanent conservation plan was put into place that more than doubled the conservation area, including the Bunkerville Allotment. Unlike many ranchers, Bundy refused to sell his grazing privileges to {{the federal government}}. Instead, as a protest, Bundy did not pay his <b>renewal</b> <b>fees</b> in 1993. His permit was canceled in 1994. Although the agency made several attempts to have Bundy renew the permit, the rancher declared that he no longer recognized the BLM's authority to regulate his grazing, and he asserted that he had [...] "vested rights" [...] to graze cattle on the land. Federal courts consistently ruled against Bundy, concluding that he was a trespasser with no right to graze on federal land. The courts authorized the BLM to remove Bundy's cattle and to levy damages for unauthorized use.|$|E
