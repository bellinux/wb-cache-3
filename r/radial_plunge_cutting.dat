40|$|International audiencePocket milling is an {{essential}} issue in rough milling. Although the technology progress increased the machining capacities and enabled new machine structures, no significant evolution was observed about pocket milling trajectories. Trochoïds and plunge milling are new types of strategies which have found practical applications in hard materials rough milling, especially die manufacturing. On a productivity point of view, they were not favourable until the development of high-speed machine tools. This paper aims at evaluating the potential of trochoïdal milling and <b>plunge</b> <b>cutting</b> strategies in rough pocket millings. Algorithms were developed to generate trochoïdal and <b>plunge</b> <b>cutting</b> trajectories for pocket milling, with cycle time optimisation regarding to milled surfaces quality. Then, an experimental campaign {{has been done to}} compare the new strategies with classical ones. The study focused both on productivity and quality issues. The influence of the machine tool capacities and architecture was also examined. Two different high speed milling dedicated machine tools were tested: a serial three-axis machine tool with "classic" dynamic capacities, and a parallel kinematics five-axis machine tool with high dynamic capacities. The results of this work leads to a better definition of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} trochoïdal milling and <b>plunge</b> <b>cutting</b> strategies in aluminium alloys rough machining with the focus to optimize the choice of strategies...|$|R

40|$|Modification of {{semiconductors}} by {{ion implantation}} is a promising technology for improving their machinability. As well as ion implantation that induce amorphization, non-amorphizing ion implantation is also reported {{to improve the}} machinability of silicon. However, the anisotropy in micro cutting of crystalline silicon modified by non-amorphizing ion implantation is not clear. In this study, hydrogen is implanted in (001) silicon wafer with implantation energies and doses up to 175 KeV and 3 × 1016 cm- 2, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy, numerical simulations and X-ray diffraction are carried out to confirm that point defects and strain are introduced by the implantation, and that crystalline damage is below the amorphization level. <b>Plunge</b> <b>cutting</b> experiments in two crystal directions are performed to {{study the effects of}} limited crystal damage induced by ion implantation on the anisotropy in micro cutting of silicon. The <b>plunge</b> <b>cutting</b> experiments show that the anisotropic behaviour is significantly changed. The critical undeformed chip thickness (CUCT) in the direction with lower CUCT before implantation exceeds that in the other direction after implantation. The ductile-regime cutting force is significantly reduced in one direction, while nearly un-affected in the other direction. The results are discussed {{from the perspective of the}} effects of ion implantation on the interaction between restricted slip systems. In addition, it is found that the scenarios of brittle-ductile cutting mode transition are significantly different in the and directions for both implanted and bare silicon, and the mechanisms are discussed from the perspective of the anisotropic cleavage systems.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of brittle-ductile cutting mode transition has received much attention {{over the past}} two decades. Due to the difficulties in directly observing the cutting zone during the brittle-ductile cutting mode transition by experimental techniques, many molecular dynamics (MD) studies have been conducted to investigate the atomicscale details of the phenomena, e. g. phase transformation, stress distribution and crack initiation, mostly under nanoscale undeformed chip thicknesses. A research gap is that direct MD modelling of the transition under practical undeformed chip thicknesses was not achieved in previous studies, due to the limitations in both computation capability and interaction potential. Important details of the transition under practical undeformed chip thicknesses thereby remain unclear, e. g. the location of crack formation and the stress distribution. In this study, parallel MD codes based on graphics processing units (GPU) are developed to enable large-scale MD simulations with multi-million atoms. In addition, an advanced interaction potential which reproduces brittle fracture much more accurately is adopted. As a result, the direct MD simulation of brittle-ductile cutting mode transition is realised for the first time under practical undeformed chip thicknesses. The MD-modelled critical undeformed chip thickness is verified by a <b>plunge</b> <b>cutting</b> experiment. The MD modelling shows that tensile stress exists around the cutting zone and increases with undeformed chip thickness, which finally induces brittle fractures. The location of crack formation and direction of propagation varies with undeformed chip thickness in the MD simulations, which agrees with the surface morphologies of the taper groove produced by the <b>plunge</b> <b>cutting</b> experiment. This study contributes significantly {{to the understanding of the}} details involved in the brittle-ductile cutting mode transition. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Powder metals are {{becoming}} a popular choice in the automotive and other manufacturing industries because {{of their ability to}} meet wide ranging product functional requirements without compromising the performance of the product. They offer various advantages, including weight reduction, near net-shape processing capability, and their ability to be sintered to achieve desired properties in the end-product. However, in order to satisfy the product design requirements during manufacturing, they need to be machined to the required tolerances. Machining of powder metals is quite different to machining of traditional metals because of their specific properties, including porosity. This thesis work deals with the finish machining of powder metal steels in automotive applications, for increased tool-life/reduced tool-wear. Tool-life is affected by a variety of factors such as tool grade selection, tool coating, cutting conditions and tool geometry including cutting edge geometry.

40|$|The orbital {{properties}} of infalling satellite haloes set the initial conditions which control the subsequent evolution of subhaloes and the galaxies that they host, with implications for mass stripping, star formation quenching and merging. Using a high-resolution cosmological N-body simulation, {{we examine the}} orbital parameters of satellite haloes as they merge with larger host haloes, focusing primarily on orbital circularity and pericentre. We explore in detail how these orbital parameters depend on mass and redshift. Satellite orbits become more <b>radial</b> and <b>plunge</b> deeper into their host halo at higher host halo mass, {{but they do not}} significantly depend on satellite halo mass. Additionally, satellite orbits become more <b>radial</b> and <b>plunge</b> deeper into their host haloes at higher redshift. We also examine satellite velocities, finding that most satellites infall with less specific angular momentum than the host halo virial value, but that satellites are 'hotter' than the host virial velocity.

40|$|It was {{reported}} that non-amorphizing implantation by hydrogen has a potential in improving silicon machining. Post-implantation high-temperature treatment will affect implantation-induced damage, which can have impact on silicon machining. In this article, a relation of a thermal annealing of hydrogen implanted in silicon to micro-cutting experiment is investigated. Hydrogen ions were implanted into 4 ″ silicon wafers with 175 keV, 150 keV, 125 keV and doses of 2  ×  1016 cm− 2, 2  ×  1016 cm− 2 and 3  ×  1016 cm− 2, respectively. In this way, low hydrogen atom–low defect concentration {{was created in the}} region less than ~ 0. 8  μm deep and high hydrogen atom–high defect concentration was obtained at silicon depth of ~ 0. 8 – 1. 5  μm. The post-implantation annealing was carried out at 300 and 400  °C in nitrogen for 1  h.

H 577 P ISE 2015 Xiaoxxiii, 251 pages :color illustrationsBrittle-ductile cutting mode {{transition}} (BDCMT) is {{an important}} phenomenon in ultra-precision machining of brittle materials. Though many {{studies have been conducted}} to investigate the mechanism of BDCMT, a number of fundamental issues remain unclear or controversial. Four such issues are identified and investigated in this study. The first issue is the atomicscale details of BDCMT under practical undeformed chip thickness (UCT). Molecular dynamics (MD) codes based on graphics processing units are developed to enable large-scale simulations with an advanced interaction potential. MD modelling of BDCMT is realized for the first time. It is found that the tensile stress in the cutting zone increases with UCT, and finally induces brittle fracture. In the simulations, the direction of crack propagation varies with UCT, and agrees with the surface morphologies produced by <b>plunge</b> <b>cutting</b> experiments. The second issue is the relationship between the tensile and compressive stresses in BDCMT. The mechanisms of BDCMT are analyzed {{from the perspective of the}} mechanics involved. The finite element method is employed to verify the proposed mechanics on silicon and 6 H SiC, and the critical UCT (CUCT) for BDCMT are estimated accordingly. The estimated values of CUCT are verified in <b>plunge</b> <b>cutting</b> experiments. It is found that, to induce the same magnitude of compressive stress, the tool has to advance a larger distance for larger UCT, and thereby induces larger tensile strain and consequently larger tensile stress below and behind the tool. The third issue is whether high pressure phase transformation (HPPT) is the origin of ductility in BDCMT for 6 H SiC. MD simulations are conducted to investigate the mechanism of ductile deformation in BDCMT for 6 H SiC. The HPPT and dislocation activities in the machining of 6 H SiC are visualized for the first time. Micro Raman spectroscopy is conducted on a ductile-cut 6 H SiC surface, with no peaks detected for amorphous SiC. These results indicate that the ductility in BDCMT of 6 H SiC is due to both HPPT and dislocation activities, with dislocation plasticity playing a major role. The fourth issue is whether the change of effective rake angle to be highly negative accounts for BDCMT. MD simulations show that BDCMT also occurs under a positive rake angle for silicon and SiC, though the CUCT are much smaller than that under negative rake angles. This indicates that negative rake angle is a more favorable condition for BDCMT than positive rake angle, rather than an enabling factor for BDCMT. The originality and significance of this study can be summarized as (i) MD modelling of BDCMT is realized for the first time, revealing important details of BDCMT; (ii) an explicit relationship between the tensile and compressive stresses in BDCMT is revealed by mechanistic analysis; (iii) the mechanism of ductile deformation in BDCMT of 6 H SiC is visualized by MD simulations for the first time, resolving the controversy regarding the role of HPPT; (iv) it helps to achieve more comprehensive understanding on the role of rake angle in BDCMT.

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{application}} of physical micromachining techniques to integrated optics. These physical micromachining techniques were used to make structures which would be difficult or impossible to produce using conventional cleanroom based technologies. A tuneable Bragg grating was fabricated and characterized and was found to offer an enhanced power efficiency for tuning of 45 pm/mW for the transverse magnetic mode and 39 pm/mW for the transverse electric mode. This an improvement in the operating power efficiency of a factor of 90 over bulk thermally tuned Bragg gratings in silica. A dual cantilever device has also been demonstrated which can operate as a force sensor or variable attenuator. The response of the device to mechanical actuation was measured, and shown to be very well described by conventional fibre optic angular misalignment theory. The device {{has the potential to}} be utilized within integrated optical components for sensors or attenuators. An array of devices was fabricated with potential for parallel operation. The fabrication work features the first use of a dicing saw in <b>plunge</b> <b>cutting</b> mode to rapidly produce grooves which were free of chipping. A wire electro discharge unit was designed and built. This was retrofitted to a micromill to give capability to manufacture tools directly on machine. This work built upon previous machining research in the group to allow free form diamond tools to be fabricated. Tools formed by wire electro discharge machining of polycrystalline diamond were formed. A ring tool was created and proved to be able to machine ring structures in the ductile mode regime in germanium oxide glass with a surface roughness of Ra 4. 9 nm. This is the first time that ductile mode machining has been achieved in glass with this type of tool. By using a XeF 2 etch this was shown to be able to create the stuctures necessary for whispering gallery mode resonators. A number of exemplar micro disk structures have been researched in this work to test the concept and provide real examples. Firstly a phosphogermanate glass on silica resonator was fabricated.

40|$|AbstractWhite {{layers and}} {{extensive}} material drag introduced during rough machining {{are regarded as}} detrimental to surface integrity. As such a sensible method for determining the amount of material to be removed in a roughing process would be to understand the relationship and interaction between roughing (i. e. drilling) and finishing (i. e. plunge milling) operations. Within this work non-standard cutting parameters were employed during the roughing process to generate a white layer and material drag up {{to a depth of}} 20 μm. Various <b>plunge</b> milling <b>cutting</b> strategies followed, with radius removal ranging from 25 μm to 250 μm in order to identify the amount of material removal necessary to eliminate the anomalies previously generated from mistreated surface history. The results show that finishing with a depth of cut between 50 μm and 125 μm removes all anomalies from the roughing process, leaving behind a negligible amount of material drag (3 – 4 μm). X-ray diffraction demonstrates significant tensile residual stresses (1000 – 2000 MPa) were generated in the axial and hoop direction by abusive hole drilling while subsequent plunge milling operation leaves compressive surface stresses in the region of − 500 MPa in both the axial and hoop directions; in both cases the depth of the surface stresses extended to around 125 μm from the drilled surface. It was also found that a depth of cut of 25 μm was not sufficient to recover the abused surface; this was due to intense material drag accompanied by surface cracking (i. e. 2 μm depth). The research shows that understanding the interaction between successive cutting operations can provide a suitable machining route to fulfil the industrial quality requirements in terms of the machined surface mechanical/metallurgical properties...|$|R

Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} <b>plunge</b> milling.
