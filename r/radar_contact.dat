5|$|No {{attempt was}} made by either the Embraer or Brasilia Center to contact each other from 15:51 until 16:26 when, 24 minutes after the loss of {{secondary}} <b>radar</b> <b>contact,</b> Brasilia Center called the Embraer and received no reply.|$|E
5|$|Gol 1907 {{took off}} from Manaus at 15:35, flying southeast-bound along UZ6 and {{reaching}} FL370 at 15:58, 23 minutes later, where it remained until the collision. There were no radio or <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> problems with the flight until its handoff to Brasilia Center. There were no known attempts by ATC to warn Flight 1907 of the conflicting traffic.|$|E
5|$|ATC {{maintained}} normal {{two-way radio}} {{contact with the}} Embraer up until 15:51, when the last successful radio exchange with the Embraer was made on VHF frequency 125.05MHz with Brasilia Center. At that point the Embraer was just approaching the Brasilia VOR. The Embraer overflew the Brasilia VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, secondary <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen.|$|E

5|$|With {{the weather}} worsening, Lütjens {{attempted}} to detach Prinz Eugen at 16:40. The squall was not heavy {{enough to cover}} her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain <b>radar</b> <b>contact.</b> Prinz Eugen was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. Bismarck turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing Suffolk to turn away at high speed. Prince of Wales fired twelve salvos at Bismarck, which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted Prinz Eugen to slip away.|$|E

5|$|Yamatos {{crew were}} at general {{quarters}} {{and ready for}} anti-aircraft action by dawn on 7 April. The first Allied aircraft made contact with the Surface Special Attack Force at 08:23; two flying boats arrived soon thereafter, {{and for the next}} five hours, Yamato fired Common Type 3 or Beehive (3 Shiki tsûjôdan) shells at the Allied seaplanes, but could not prevent them from shadowing the force. Yamato obtained her first <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> with aircraft at 10:00; an hour later, American F6F Hellcat fighters appeared overhead to deal with any Japanese aircraft that might appear. None did.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, Samford {{stated that}} the unknown <b>radar</b> <b>contacts</b> were not caused by solid {{material}} objects, and therefore posed no threat to national security. In {{response to a question}} as to whether the Air Force had recorded similar UFO <b>radar</b> <b>contacts</b> prior to the Washington incident, Samford said that there had been [...] "hundreds" [...] of such contacts where Air Force fighter interceptions had taken place, but stated they were all [...] "fruitless." [...] The conference proved to be successful [...] "in getting the press off our backs", Ruppelt later wrote.|$|R
50|$|On 27 July, 80 mi west of Kiska, TG 16.22 {{began to}} pick up a series of unknown <b>radar</b> <b>contacts.</b> The order was given to open fire, and 518 14 in shells from both battleships were expended, but there were no hits.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of Šolta and Brač, the Vis TG led by Pula sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Kaštela TG. As the ships approached the Split Entrance, they made a <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed. Pula, attempting to enforce the blockade imposed in September, requested the vessel by radio to stop for an inspection. The vessel failed to respond and Pula fired several shots {{in front of it}} before Brčić noticed that it was a hydrofoil carrying an ECMM team and flying the flag of Europe. He abandoned the pursuit and proceeded to Šolta.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minutes after}} initial <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> the two forces sighted each other, {{at about the}} same time, but both Abe and Callaghan hesitated {{ordering}} their ships into action. Abe was apparently surprised by the proximity of the U.S. ships, and with decks stacked with high explosive (rather than armor penetrating) munitions, was momentarily uncertain if he should withdraw to give his battleships time to rearm, or continue onward. He decided to continue onward. Callaghan apparently intended to attempt to cross the T of the Japanese, as Scott had done at Cape Esperance, but—confused by the incomplete information he was receiving, plus the fact that the Japanese formation consisted of several scattered groups—he gave several confusing orders on ship movements, and delayed too long in acting.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} {{who shot}} down Sayn-Wittgenstein is unanswered. Friedrich Ostheimer remained {{convinced that they}} were shot down by a long range intruder de Havilland Mosquito night fighter. However, no Mosquito pilot claimed an aerial victory that night. A closer analysis reveals that three Mosquitos, two Serrate-equipped aircraft from No. 141 Squadron RAF and one from No. 239 Squadron RAF, participated in the attacks on Magdeburg. Only one Mosquito had enemy contact: No. 141's squadron Mosquito F.II, DZ303, piloted by Pilot Officer Desmon Snape with Flying Officer L. Fowler as his radar operator reported <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> at 23:15south of Brandenburg. After three to four minutes of pursuit they encountered a Ju 88with its position lights on. They attacked the Ju 88and believed to have damaged it behind its cockpit, {{but they did not}} claim a victory. This encounter exactly matches the time and area in which Sayn-Wittgenstein was killed.|$|E
50|$|July-December 1944: The {{capture of}} French ports used for {{submarine}} bases greatly curtailed {{the activities of}} the German U-boat fleet. The use of the schnorkel by the German U-boats made intercepts more dependent on the use of radar. Although 16 sonobuoys were dropped on <b>radar</b> <b>contacts</b> in the months of October to December 1944, the results were negative.|$|R
2500|$|Initially, F-102 {{detachments}} {{began to}} be sent to bases in Southeast Asia in 1962 after <b>radar</b> <b>contacts</b> detected by ground radars were thought to possibly be North Vietnamese Il-28 [...] "Beagle" [...] bombers [...] considered to be a credible threat in that time period. The F-102s were sent to Thailand and other nearby countries to intercept these aircraft if they threatened South Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|A T-33 trainer {{from the}} 512th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, crewed by 1st Lieutenants Charles Metz and Andrew Rowe, was {{directed}} to investigate the <b>radar</b> <b>contacts,</b> but saw nothing. No visual sightings of the objects were made from Bentwaters in this period {{with the exception of}} a single amber star-like object which was subsequently identified as probably being Mars, then low in the south-east.|$|R
5|$|While the Japanese raid {{into the}} Indian Ocean was not successful, {{associated}} Japanese shipping movements provoked a major Allied response. In early March 1944, Allied intelligence reported that two battleships escorted by destroyers had left Singapore {{in the direction}} of Surabaya and a U.S. submarine made <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> with two large Japanese ships in the Lombok Strait. The Australian Chiefs of Staff Committee reported to the Government on 8 March that there was a possibility that these ships could have entered the Indian Ocean to attack Fremantle. In response to this report, all ground and naval defences at Fremantle were fully manned, all shipping was ordered to leave Fremantle and several RAAF squadrons were redeployed to bases in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E
25|$|On 24 October, Seadragon {{received}} {{a message from}} Shark stating {{that she had made}} <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> with a single freighter, and she was going in to attack. This was the last message received from the submarine. She was reported as presumed lost on 27 November.|$|E

25|$|Ralph Zia, {{commanding}} officer of the Hawkeye monitored the airways designated for commercial jets focusing on a converge point south of Crete. He and his crew tracked <b>radar</b> <b>contacts</b> flying west out of Egypt, presumably towards Tunisia. Zia had to send a Tomcat to visually determine if the contact was an EgyptAir 737, as there was no sensor that would confirm the exact identity of each radar blip. The fighter jets were commanded to perform the operation with lights out.|$|R
25|$|On August 4, Secretary of Defense McNamara gave President Johnson the raw {{translation}} of intercepted Korean transmissions {{directly from the}} NSA which, ostensibly, reported to DI McCone, rather than to McNamara. It was later determined that the transmission took place before the weapon discharges that night {{which leads to the}} conclusion that the transmission refers to the events of the attack the day before, and that, although Destroyers Maddox, and Turner Joy fired hundreds of shells at intermittent <b>radar</b> <b>contacts,</b> they were firing at false returns.|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{before midnight}} on 3 July Snook made <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> with another enemy convoy. Early the {{following}} morning, she fired a spread of six torpedoes, sinking cargo ships Koki Maru and Liverpool Maru and severely damaging Atlantic Maru. Snook returned to Pearl Harbor from her second patrol on 18 July.|$|E
25|$|The flight {{had taken}} off from Vancouver International Airport at {{approximately}} 7:02 Pacific Time Zone. The aircraft abruptly descended from 2,400 meters to 900 meters {{in less than a}} minute. Air Traffic Controllers soon lost <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> with the aircraft, en route to Prince George, at roughly 7:08. The aircraft crashed on a hillside near Crown Mountain.|$|E
25|$|After sinking Akikawa Maru and Hawaii Maru, Sea Devil {{continued}} {{to patrol the}} sea lanes to Kyūshū. On 4December, she received a positive ship contact report from a China-based B-29 Superfortress, but the position was too distant. On 5December, she sighted only two small fishing trawlers. Then, {{on the evening of}} 8December, she made <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> with four distant targets zigging on various courses toward Nagasaki.|$|E
25|$|Overtaking the disorganized convoy, {{during a}} {{tropical}} squall the next day, Ray fired on two <b>radar</b> <b>contacts</b> scoring hits. When the weather cleared, Ray saw one ship whose stack was going under and whose bow was {{rising from the}} water. The second was enveloped {{in a cloud of}} smoke and her decks awash. Ray dived deep to escape Japanese patrol aircraft, and the sinking was never confirmed by captured records. As no further suitable contacts were found, the submarine returned to Fremantle, arriving on 14 June.|$|R

25|$|The next {{target was}} a {{battleship}} escorted by three destroyers, {{on which she}} made <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> shortly after midnight on 18–19 August. At 01:35, after getting as close as she was able, , Sailfish fired all four bow tubes. One of the escorts ran {{into the path of}} two fish; the other two missed. While the destroyer must have been severely damaged or sunk, there was nothing in JANAC.|$|E
25|$|Based on the <b>radar</b> <b>contact</b> on 6 March, moon {{conditions}} and {{assumptions of the}} Japanese force's speed and likely flying off positions if it included any aircraft carriers, the Allied militaries judged that any attack on the Fremantle-Perth area was most likely to occur during {{the early hours of}} 11 March. However, it was possible that such an attack could be conducted any time between the night of 9/10 March and the morning of 14 March.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>contact</b> and tracking, {{sometimes}} {{from multiple}} sites. These have included {{military personnel and}} control tower operators, simultaneous visual sightings, and aircraft intercepts. One such example were the mass sightings of large, silent, low-flying black triangles in 1989 and 1990 over Belgium, tracked by NATO radar and jet interceptors, and investigated by Belgium's military (included photographic evidence). Another famous case from 1986 was the Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident over Alaska investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).|$|E
5|$|The <b>radar</b> <b>contacts</b> were, in fact, the {{approaching}} 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled {{around to the}} south of TF18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky, but Giffen's ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|R
50|$|On 27 January 1945, Robert H. Smith sailed as escort for {{a convoy}} of the 5th Amphibious Corps bound for Iwo Jima. During final amphibious rehearsals off Saipan, she rescued the crew of a downed B-29. She arrived off Iwo Jima {{early in the morning}} of D-day, 19 February 1945. For most of the next three weeks, she served on radar picket station 50 miles north of the island, {{controlling}} CAP and reporting <b>radar</b> <b>contacts.</b> She also bombarded Japanese shore positions and acted as a screening ship for the night retirement formations.|$|R
50|$|The {{destroyer}} escort sailed on 4 December for ASW {{operations with}} TG 22.3, again formed around the now famous Bogue. In ensuing days, the group operated off the northeastern seaboard, running into rough weather {{over a week}} after their departure from New York. At 1030 on 13 December, the wheelhouse inclinometer in Willis registered one roll of 62 degrees. The ships did not experience good hunting but investigated numerous sonar and <b>radar</b> <b>contacts</b> with negative results. On 16 December, Willis moored at the convoy escort piers, Norfolk, where she remained through Christmas.|$|R
