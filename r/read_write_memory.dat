Analisamos retrospectivamente exames de neuroimagem de crianças com diagnóstico de dislexia e correlacionamos os achados com avaliação das funções corticais superiores. Estudamos 34 prontuários de pacientes atendidos no Ambulatório de Neuro-Dificuldades de Aprendizado, FCM/UNICAMP, no período de 1994 a 2002. Todas foram encaminhadas com queixa primária ou secundária de dificuldade escolar e submetidas à avaliação neuropsicológica e exame de imagem (SPECT). Das crianças avaliadas, 58, 8 % apresentaram exames alterados. Dentre as alterações, 16 possuíam hipoperfusão no lobo temporal. Nas funções corticais superiores, as habilidades mais prejudicadas foram leitura, escrita e memória. Houve significância entre as áreas hipoperfundidas com a variável escolaridade, leitura, escrita, memória e raciocínio matemático.
