5|$|If {{a person}} spots a nearby tornado while driving, the {{official}} National Weather Service directive {{has been for}} the individual to abandon the car and seek shelter in a ditch or culvert, or substantial shelter if nearby. Far-away, highly visible tornadoes, however, can be successfully fled from at right angles (90-degrees) from its direction of apparent movement. Despite dangers inherent with operating a vehicle during a tornado, given sufficient advance warning, mobile home <b>residents</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> instructed by the National Weather Service to drive to the nearest secure shelter during a warning.|$|E
5|$|The Malloch Building was {{featured}} in the 1947 film noir work titled Dark Passage. In the film, Humphrey Bogart, playing an escaped prisoner, is invited by Lauren Bacall into her apartment unit, Number 10 {{on the third floor}} of the Malloch Building. In the apartment, Bogart hides out while he heals from plastic surgery, and plots to clear his name. Bogart wearily ascends the nearby Filbert Steps in one scene, on his way to the Malloch Building. Modern-day <b>residents</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> known to put a cutout of Bogart in the street-facing window of Number 10.|$|E

5|$|The major {{agricultural}} products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water {{have reduced the}} productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of <b>residents</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Lincoln Center campus {{and some of the}} Upper West Side community <b>residents</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> strained, over campus development. In 2010 the New York State Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against Fordham brought by the Alfred Condominium Complex. The suit was filed in response to the University's expansion plans at Lincoln Center and their expected visual and auditory impact on the surrounding community. The Lincoln Center campus does, however, have a lively connection to the artistic scene in Manhattan through its dance and theater productions and visual art exhibitions.|$|E

It is set in Raccoon City, an American community whose <b>residents</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> transformed into zombies by the T-virus, a biological weapon developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. In their escape from the city, the two protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, encounter other survivors, and are confronted by William Birkin, the mutated creator of the even more powerful weaponized pathogen, the G-virus.|$|E

25|$|For {{three years}} in a row, more than 30 percent of Mississippi's <b>residents</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{classified}} as obese. In a 2006 study, 22.8 percent of the state's children were classified as such. Mississippi had the highest rate of obesity of any U.S. state from 2005 to 2008, and also ranks first in the nation for high blood pressure, diabetes, and adult inactivity. In a 2008 study of African-American women, contributing risk factors were shown to be: lack of knowledge about body mass index (BMI), dietary behavior, physical inactivity and lack of social support, defined as motivation and encouragement by friends. A 2002 report on African-American adolescents noted a 1999 survey which suggests that a third of children were obese, with higher ratios for those in the Delta.|$|E
25|$|Medicare {{funds the}} vast {{majority}} of residency training in the US. This tax-based financing covers resident salaries and benefits through payments called Direct Medical Education payments. Medicare also uses taxes for Indirect Medical Education, a subsidy paid to teaching hospitals in exchange for training resident physicians. For the 2008 fiscal year these payments were $2.7 and $5.7 billion respectively. Overall funding levels have remained at the same level over the last 10 years, so that the same number or fewer <b>residents</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> trained under this program. Meanwhile, the US population continues to grow older, which has led to greater demand for physicians. At the same time the cost of medical services continue rising rapidly and many geographic areas face physician shortages, both trends suggesting the supply of physicians remains too low.|$|E
50|$|In Ivanovo Province, the Kolyanovo Romani {{settlement}} was {{located near the}} disused Ivanovo airport. The <b>residents</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> evicted from Ivanovo city 15 years earlier.

5|$|Although {{the fame}} {{of the song}} means that {{it is one of}} the few things popularly {{associated}} with the island and it is evocative of island life, it was never sung by its <b>residents,</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> composed long after the evacuation.|$|R
25|$|Generally, however, {{relations}} between UNIFIL and local <b>residents</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> good. UNIFIL forces have offered various {{services to the}} locals, and have introduced elements of their own culture. India's UNIFIL contingent has carried out small-scale development projects, operates medical and dental clinics, veterinary care for local animals, and also runs entertainment camps for children and yoga classes. The Indonesian UNIFIL contingent (INDOBATT) also gained good reputation among the South Lebanese people, and this is achieved through the Civil Military Coordination (CIMIC) program implemented by the contingent. This program includes many society-based activities, such as conducting computer course for local residents, medical assistance and also technical assistance in rebuilding social facilities. The French contingent has taught poetry courses to local Francophone residents as well as French vocabulary and grammar to primary school students in 15 schools, the Italian contingent has given cooking lessons, the South Korean contingent has taught Taekwondo, and the Chinese contingent has taught Tai chi.|$|E
25|$|Slum {{relocation}} strategies rely on {{removing the}} slums and relocating the slum poor to free semi-rural peripheries of cities, sometimes in free housing. This strategy ignores several dimensions of a slum life. The strategy sees slum {{as merely a}} place where the poor lives. In reality, slums are often integrated with every aspect of a slum resident's life, including sources of employment, distance from work and social life. Slum relocation that displaces the poor from opportunities to earn a livelihood, generates economic insecurity in the poor. In some cases, the slum residents oppose relocation even if the replacement land and housing to the outskirts of cities is free and of better quality than their current house. Examples include Zone One Tondo Organization of Manila, Philippines and Abahlali baseMjondolo of Durban, South Africa. In other cases, such as Ennakhil slum relocation project in Morocco, systematic social mediation has worked. The slum <b>residents</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> convinced that their current location is a health hazard, prone to natural disaster, or that the alternative location is well connected to employment opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Successive city councils in the 1970s and 1980s {{prohibited}} {{the construction of}} freeways {{as part of a}} long-term plan. As a result, the only major freeway within city limits is Highway 1, which passes through the north-eastern corner of the city. While the number of cars in Vancouver proper has been steadily rising with population growth, the rate of car ownership and the average distance driven by daily commuters have fallen since the early 1990s. Vancouver is the only major Canadian city with these trends. Despite the fact that the journey time per vehicle has increased by one-third and growing traffic mass, there are 7% fewer cars making trips into the downtown core. In 2012, Vancouver had the worst traffic congestion in Canada and the second-highest in North America, behind Los Angeles. , Vancouver now has the worst traffic congestion in North America. <b>Residents</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more inclined to live in areas closer to their interests, or use more energy-efficient means of travel, such as mass transit and cycling. This is, in part, the result of a push by city planners for a solution to traffic problems and pro-environment campaigns. Transportation demand management policies have imposed restrictions on drivers making it more difficult and expensive to commute while introducing more benefits for non-drivers.|$|E
