40|$|The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> in engine diagnostics is a challenging task which {{is subject to}} several sources of error. Conduction error is predominant among these sources since <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors are embedded into a cooled strut for measurement. This study seeks to understand the effect of conduction error on <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> probe performance from an analytical and experimental standpoint and to provide an effective calibration procedure. The review of historical low-order models, as well as results from a developed thermal resistance model, indicates that conduction error is driven by dimensionless parameters, including the Biot, Nusselt, and Reynolds Numbers, {{as well as a}} non-dimensional temperature characterizing the flow/strut temperature difference.

An experimental investigation of the vortex street is carried out at a distance of six cylinder diameters downstream. Time resolved <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements reveal the presence of localised ‘hot spots’ of increased <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> at the edges of the wake and localised ‘cold spots’ of decreased <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> along the centre of the wake.

40|$|During annular cascade {{testing of}} a highly-loaded turbine stage of {{aggressive}} design, the nozzle blading experienced a redistribution of the downstream <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> field. In this ostensibly adiabatic arrangement, the central {{regions of the}} vane wakes exhibited {{a significant decrease in}} <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> and their edges showed an unexpected increase. To resolve these anomalous results and obtain detailed information over the Mach number range, the mid-span section of the nozzle was tested in a large scale transonic planar cascade. At high subsonic speeds, vortex shedding created energy redistribution in the wake. This was measured using an 80 kHz bandwidth temperature probe, making it possible to investigate wake <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> fluctuations in addition to fluctuations in total pressure, and hence entropy. 'Hot spots' of increased <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> were found to be located {{at the edge of the}} wake and 'cold spots' of decreased <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> were located close to the wake center line. The results from the turbine cascade were consistent with the phenomenon of energy separation behind bluff bodies. High base pressure losses were observed and were also related to the vortex shedding. The blade had a thick trailing edge and the high base pressure loss condition coincided with the peak of energy separation in the wake. The analysis indicates that in the subsonic speed range the phenomena of energy separation and of base pressure deficit are inextricably linked to, and are caused by, vortex shedding.
