25|$|In May 2008, Toyota {{issued a}} recall for 2003 and 2004 model year Corollas and Matrixes. The <b>recall</b> <b>notice</b> cites two bolts {{in each of}} the front doors as {{potentially}} causing the window to come off the track and break. This recall only applies to models equipped with power windows. General Motors issued a recall for the same problem on 2003 and 2004 Pontiac Vibes with power windows at the same time.|$|E
500|$|On August 10, 1978 three {{teenage girls}} of the Urlich family of Osceola, Indiana {{were killed when}} the 1973 Pinto they were in was {{involved}} in a rear-end collision. [...] The driver had stopped in the road to retrieve the car's gas cap which had been inadvertently left {{on the top of the}} car and subsequently fell onto the road. [...] While stopped the Pinto was struck by a Chevrolet van. [...] Ford sent the Urlichs a <b>recall</b> <b>notice</b> for the Pinto in 1979. A grand jury indicted Ford on three counts of reckless homicide. Indiana v. Ford was a landmark in product liability law as the first time a corporation faced criminal charges for a defective product, and the first time a corporation was charged with murder. [...] If convicted, Ford faced a maximum fine of $30,000 under Indiana's 1978 reckless homicide statute. [...] Ford's legal defense was vastly more ambitious than the effort mounted in the Grimshaw case. [...] The effort was led by James F. Neal with a staff of 80 and a budget of about $1 million; the Elkhart County state's attorney had a budget of about $20,000 and volunteer law professors and law students. A former head of the NHTSA, testifying on Ford's behalf, said the Pinto's design was no more or less safe than that of any other car in its class. In 1980 Ford was found not guilty. In 1980 a civil suit was settled for $7500 to each plaintiff.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} genre of toy safety recall messages. In 2007, {{also known as the}} 2 ̆ 2 Year of the Recall, 2 ̆ 2 the U. S. Consumer Products Safety Commission issued recalls for 80 toys {{affecting}} millions of families. Burns, holes in intestines, choking, toxicity [...] these {{are just some of the}} hazards associated with the faulty toys. To alert consumers about the recalls, toy manufacturers create safety notices that are displayed in retail settings. However, these toy safety <b>recall</b> <b>notices</b> often suffer from poor visual design choices and inadequate expression which impacts their overall effectiveness of communicating risk. Toy safety <b>recall</b> <b>notices</b> are a unique genre because they position themselves within three areas of rhetoric: visual design, negative messages, and risk communication. The larger purpose of this research is to examine toy safety <b>recall</b> <b>notices</b> from these three theoretical perspectives. This research also explores audience perceptions and the complex contexts in which the notices function...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, product recalls {{have become}} an {{inevitable}} problem striking companies and manufacturers. If no sufficient preparation is made, product recalls can easily affect the bottom line. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyse product <b>recall</b> <b>notices</b> and identify major issues of recall such as types of recalled products, causes of recall, recall initiators, and the relationship between products, recall initiators and causes of recall. This research provides an in depth analysis of recalls patterns through content analysis of historical <b>recall</b> <b>notices.</b> Analysis shows most food items are recalled due to manufacturing fault, for electrical appliances major causes of recall are design fault, and kids&# 039; products are recalled due to design and manufacturing faults, and for all types of products most recalls are initiated by the manufacturer. The result of this research will help manufacturers look at the root causes of recall and find solution to the quality issues of product design and manufacturing. This research can be further extended to incorporate data from various countries...|$|R

Most patients attend at least once each year, providing an opportunity to offer and/or perform indicated preventive care. If these opportunities are taken, only a few patients will ever need to be recalled for preventive care. Reliable, thorough and consistent opportunistic offering of preventive care depends on having an efficient information system that reminds the doctor of what care is due. Manual systems are too expensive to use for this task because of their high labour costs. Recalling all patients routinely for preventive care is inefficient, expensive and unrewarding. Electronic medical record systems can remind doctors of when preventive interventions are due and generate <b>recall</b> <b>notices</b> at the lowest cost...|$|R
