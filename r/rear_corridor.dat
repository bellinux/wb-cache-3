50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has suspended ceilings to several areas, with non-original partitions and fittings. The customer service and general office area has early, and some original, details including wide cornices, clerestory windows, architraves, picture rails and skirtings. An early strong room is located {{in each of the}} rear corners, and each strong room has a ladder which access a storage area above. A partition divides the rear of the room, and another earlier partition is located across the original board room which has some original surviving details. The <b>rear</b> <b>corridors</b> between the original section of {{the building}} and the later extensions are in the position of the original rear verandahs. The later extensions have internal partitions and sheeted walls and ceilings.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, anatomically {{accurate}} dummies {{were developed}} to produce a more biofidelic response to rear impacts. The detailed dummy geometry permits more comprehensive kinematic validation, which is typically accomplished through response corridors developed using human volunteers and cadavers. In the present investigation, ten intact head-neck cadaver specimens were subjected to 1. 8 and 2. 6 m/s <b>rear</b> impacts. Response <b>corridors</b> were developed for overall head to T 1 angulation, head retraction, and segmental angulations from C 2 –C 3 through C 6 –C 7 levels.

50|$|The {{high school}} campus {{is located on}} the north side of Huttleston Avenue (United States Route 6), a short way east of the Acushnet River and New Bedford Harbor. Its main {{building}} is a monumental masonry structure in an H-shaped layout, with two full stories, full basement, and a third floor and attic under its pitched slate roofs. It is predominantly brick, with an ashlar granite foundation and limestone belt courses. Designed by architect Charles Brigham, it is reminiscent of Tudor architecture with Gothic influences, with a picturesque roofline studded with gables topped by iron finials, and rich carved stonework including gargoyles, grotesques, and depictions of historic figures. A modern (1996) addition, designed by Flansburgh and Associates, is connected to the <b>rear</b> by a <b>corridor.</b>|$|R
60|$|Away! to a City of Palaces, to measureless halls, and arches, and domes, soaring {{one above}} another, till their {{flashing}} ruby summits are {{lost in the}} burning void, high overhead. On! through and through these mountain-piles, into countless, limitless <b>corridors,</b> <b>reared</b> on pillars lurid and rosy as molten lava. Far down the corridors rise visions of flying phantoms, ever at the same distance before us--their raving voices clanging like the hammers of a thousand forges. Still on and on; faster and faster, for days, years, centuries together, till there comes, stealing slowly forward to meet us, a shadow--a vast, stealthy, gliding shadow--the first darkness that has ever been shed over that world of blazing light! It comes nearer--nearer and nearer softly, till it touches the front ranks of our phantom troop. Then in an instant, our rushing progress is checked: the thunder-music of our wild march stops; the raving voices of the spectres ahead, cease; a horror of blank stillness is all about us--and as the shadow creeps onward and onward, until we are enveloped in it from front to rear, we shiver with icy cold under the fiery air and amid the lurid lava pillars which hem us in on either side.|$|R
40|$|Stage of the amphitheater of Aphrodisias {{seen in this}} image. It {{is located}} in the {{south-eastern}} corner of the ancient city of Aphrodisias with a seating capacity of 7, 000 persons. The two main components of the building are the auditorium, built up against a prehistoric settlement mound, and an elaborate three-storied marble stage building. It was built both for dramatic performances and for public meetings, but later on the theatre structure was altered to allow for gladiatorial combats and animal fights. The original theatre dates from the Late Hellenistic period, yet it was extensively renovated between 38 and 28 BC. An architrave inscription records that the remodeled theater was dedicated to Greek goddess Aphrodite and to the Demos (people) by G. Iulius Zoilos, during the reign of Octavian. In the historical records Zoilos was an Aphrodisian slave freed by Octavian and he had become wealthy and influential by the 30 s which coincides with the renovation of the theatre. Originally it comprised a three story stage building with a logeion, proskenion, and decorated scaenae front. It is suggested that there was no stone cavea at this point; the seating may have been made of wood except for marble prohedria (seats for wealthy and aristocratic guests) in the front row. In the 2 nd century AD certain structural changes were made to make the theatre suitable for gladiatorial combats. The stage building was enlarged and connected to the cavea, a room for the wild animals was opened in the <b>rear</b> and some <b>corridors</b> were added. 135 film (36 × 24 mm...|$|R

50|$|The building, {{which in}} 2011 is {{the office for}} Gympie Regional Council's Youth and Community Development, is {{generally}} square in plan and symmetrical in layout retaining its original partition walls with rooms opening off {{each side of the}} former waiting room and <b>rear</b> <b>corridor.</b> To the left, from front to back, are the former doctor's room and treatment rooms; and to the right are the former mother's retiring room, external female public toilet, nurse's bedroom/bathroom and kitchen. The former retiring room has been adapted as a store and the toilet remodelled. The nurse's bedroom incorporates a large storage cupboard. The kitchen retains its 1960s fitout and the former nurse's bathroom with raked ceiling is now used for storage. Most internal doors have been replaced with sliding doors but borrowed lights with obscure glazing remain. Ceiling are lined with fibrous cement sheeting.|$|E
40|$|The {{decline of}} Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) {{remains one of}} the major water {{management}} issues in the Sacramento River. Few field studies have been published on winter-run, leaving gaps in our knowledge about their life history. This is especially true in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta, which provides essential rearing and migratory habitats for winter-run, and serves as the center of water operations for California. Using long-term monitoring data that identified winter-run-sized fish (“winter-run”) using length-at-date criteria, we examined patterns of juvenile migration in terms of geographic distribution, timing, numbers, and residence times. We analyzed the role of flow, turbidity, temperature, and adult escapement on the downstream movement (“migration”) of winter-run. Winter-run passed Knights Landing (rkm 144 or 51 rkm upstream of the Delta) between October and April, with substantial variation in peak time of entry that was strongly associated with the first high flows of the migration season. Specifically, the first day of flows of at least 400 m 3 s- 1 at Wilkins Slough (rkm 190) coincided with the first day that at least 5 % of the annual total catch was observed at Knights Landing. While the period during which winter-run left the Delta spanned several months based on Chipps Island (rkm 29) catch data, the median catch typically occurred over a narrow window in March. Differences in timing of cumulative catch at Knights Landing and Chipps Island indicate that apparent residence time in the Delta ranges from 41 to 117 days, with longer apparent residence times for juveniles arriving earlier at Knights Landing. We discuss the potential importance of the Yolo Bypass floodplain as an alternative <b>rearing</b> and migratory <b>corridor,</b> contingent on the timing, duration, and magnitude of floodplain inundation. These results carry implications for habitat restoration and management of Sacramento River flows...|$|R
50|$|The {{ground storey}} {{is divided into}} a {{reception}} area, a small open-plan work area and two offices at the rear. To {{the front of the}} building, against the north-western side of the building, is a long storage space partly occupied by a single flight of polished timber stairs. A door surrounded by a deep cedar frame, connects this space with the reception area. To the rear of this is a stair that doubles back on itself in reaching the upper level. The strong room is still evident between the storage corridor, the front reception area and a <b>rear</b> <b>corridor.</b> A lining of double brick is visible on the interior of the door opening into the strong room. The floors in this room are unlined concrete, while those elsewhere on the same level are variously lined with carpet or vinyl.|$|E
50|$|When the {{building}} opened {{the ground floor}} contained: the main hall; main office; various laboratories and associated facilities including a mortuary. The library, laboratories, lecture rooms, associated offices and equipment rooms occupied the first floor. The second floor accommodated the main galleried lecture theatre, museum, two laboratories and associated support rooms. An animal house stood on the flat roof to the west. Consideration {{had been given to}} the provision of services and use of suitable materials to facilitate the effective operation of {{the building}}. All windows except those on the south-east were glazed with anti-actinic glass of a soft bluish-green to counteract the glare and reduce heat transmission. Other services and fittings included sound-proofing, ventilating systems, refrigeration, stainless steel and chromium-plated fittings, and specialised electrical and drainage systems. A double wall running the length of the building to the <b>rear</b> <b>corridor</b> houses horizontal and vertical service ducts. Furniture and fittings throughout the building are of Queensland timbers and were constructed in the Government's Ipswich Road Workshop.|$|E
