I <b>really</b> <b>must</b> add that he had earlier been in a state of terror. It is a word not commonly used in a Coroner's court but no other word would reflect his state of mind at the time.|$|E

Friday {{reported}} back for pre-season training in bad condition, and although Hurley claimed that Friday was trying hard to regain fitness, the forward was having trouble with his asthma, had lost some of his pace and was obviously unfit. Although his performances during August quickly improved, they were still not up to his previous standard and the Evening Post revealed on the 30th that Reading were preparing to sell him [...] "to a First Division club". After scoring in two successive Reading home wins on 4 and 7 September, against Walsall and Wrexham respectively, Friday {{took part in a}} third consecutive victory on the 13th, away against Northampton Town. After this he missed two matches, according to the Post because he was suffering from flu, and {{when he returned to the}} team was far from his best; [...] "Suddenly he had lost a yard and his control of the ball was not as good", Hurley recalled.|$|E
500|$|Maurice Thompson, who was {{literary}} editor of The Independent for twelve years, noted in 1891 that her poetry had [...] "a strange mixture of rare individuality and originality". Some critics hailed Dickinson's effort, but disapproved of her unusual non-traditional style. Andrew Lang, a British writer, dismissed Dickinson's work, stating that [...] "if poetry is to exist at all, it <b>really</b> <b>must</b> have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme. The {{wisdom of the}} ages {{and the nature of}} man insist on so much". Thomas Bailey Aldrich, a poet and novelist, equally dismissed Dickinson's poetic technique in The Atlantic Monthly in January 1892: [...] "It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and grotesque fancy. She was deeply tinged by the mysticism of Blake, and strongly influenced by the mannerism of Emerson ... But the incoherence and formlessness of her— versicles are fatal ... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (or anywhere else) cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar".|$|E

2500|$|However, not all {{reviews of}} the album were positive: Record Mirror in the UK awarded the album two stars out of five, deriding it as [...] "The same nothingy vocals, the same jangly guitar, the same plodding beat on almost every track. The Byrds <b>really</b> <b>must</b> {{try to get some}} {{different}} sounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{refuses to}} wear any symbol which may {{represent}} {{his views on}} air; in the run up to Remembrance Day, he condemned what he called [...] "poppy fascism" [...] because [...] "in the end there <b>really</b> <b>must</b> be more important things in life than whether a news presenter wears symbols on his lapels".|$|E
2500|$|U.S. Secretary of State Rice {{said that}} day [...] "the {{provisional}} ceasefire that was agreed to <b>really</b> <b>must</b> go into place.

Although Defence Secretary Gates accused the Russians of going [...] "far beyond reasserting the autonomy of Abkhazia and South Ossetia," [...] Gates nonetheless {{said that there was}} [...] "no prospect" [...] of US troops being deployed.|$|E

2500|$|Hillary Clinton, Wang Qishan, Timothy Geithner, Dai Bingguo and President Obama {{addressed}} {{the opening ceremony}} of the first S on July 27, 2009. President Hu sent a congratulatory message read out by Wang. Obama said in his speech, [...] "The relationship between the United States and China will shape the 21st century, which makes it as important as any bilateral relationship in the world. [...] That <b>really</b> <b>must</b> underpin our partnership. [...] That is the responsibility that together we bear."

2500|$|According to Kerouac, On the Road [...] "was {{really a}} story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. And we found him. I found him in the sky, in Market Street San Francisco (those 2 visions), and Dean (Neal) had God {{sweating}} out of his forehead all the way. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT FOR THE HOLY MAN: HE MUST SWEAT FOR GOD. And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and <b>really</b> <b>must</b> not be spoken about." [...] According to his [...] biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, On the Road has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, {{but the most important}} thing to comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.|$|E

2500|$|He {{interpreted}} the [...] "kara" [...] of Karate-dō to mean [...] "to purge oneself of selfish and evil thoughts ... for {{only with a}} clear mind and conscience can the practitioner understand the knowledge which he receives." [...] Funakoshi believed that one should be [...] "inwardly humble and outwardly gentle." [...] Only by behaving humbly can one be open to Karate's many lessons. This is done by listening and being receptive to criticism. He considered courtesy of prime importance. He said that [...] "Karate is properly applied only in those rare situations in which one <b>really</b> <b>must</b> either down another or be downed by him." [...] Funakoshi did not consider it unusual for a devotee to use Karate in a real physical confrontation no more than perhaps once in a lifetime. He stated that Karate practitioners must [...] "never be easily drawn into a fight." [...] It is understood that one blow from a real expert could mean death. It is clear that those who misuse {{what they have learned}} bring dishonor upon themselves. He promoted the character trait of personal conviction. In [...] "time of grave public crisis, one must have the courage... to face a million and one opponents." [...] He taught that indecisiveness is a weakness.|$|E
2500|$|With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in {{the last}} hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and {{defeated}} the Threshing Machines Bill. If your readers ask me why Mr. Biggar defeated the Threshing Machines Bill, I <b>really</b> <b>must</b> confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do – I mean it was daring in one to get up with the knowledge that you must talk for a half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, the honourable member for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, Sir Eric Phipps, the British Ambassador to Germany, {{complained to}} London about Ribbentrop's British {{associates}} in the Anglo-German Fellowship. He {{felt that they}} created [...] "false German hopes as in regards to British friendship and caused a reaction against it in England, where public opinion is very naturally hostile to the Nazi regime and its methods." [...] In September 1937, the British Consul in Munich, writing about the group Ribbentrop had brought to the Nuremberg Party Rally, reported {{that there were some}} [...] "serious persons of standing among them," [...] but that an equal number of Ribbentrop's British contingent were [...] "eccentrics and few, if any, could be called representatives of serious English thought, either political or social, while they most certainly lacked any political or social influence in England." [...] In June 1937, when Lord Mount Temple, the Chairman of the Anglo-German Fellowship, asked to see Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain after meeting Hitler in a visit arranged by Ribbentrop, Robert Vansittart, the British Foreign Office's Undersecretary, wrote a memo stating that:"The P.M. [...] should certainly not see Lord Mount Temple – nor should the S of S. We <b>really</b> <b>must</b> put a stop to this eternal butting in of amateurs – and Lord Mount Temple is a particularly silly one. These activities – which are practically confined to Germany – render impossible the task of diplomacy. After Vansittart's memo, members of the Anglo-German Fellowship ceased to see Cabinet ministers after going on Ribbentrop-arranged trips to Germany.|$|E
