40|$|Factors {{influencing}} {{sodium and}} water excretion in uremic man. Urinary excretion of sodium and water {{was investigated in}} patients with chronic end-stage renal disease before and after three different experimental manipulations: reduction in urea <b>solute</b> <b>load</b> by dialysis while extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) was maintained, dialysis without alteration in urea <b>solute</b> <b>load</b> or ECFV and reduction in ECFV without alteration in urea <b>solute</b> <b>load.</b> Sodium and water excretion significantly declined in association with a reduction in both urea <b>solute</b> <b>load</b> and ECFV, but not during a dialysis when reduction on both of these indexes was prevented.

Fractional sodium excretion (CNa/GFR) per level of UNESV/GFR in the low GFR group (GFR< 35 ml/min) was higher initially and increased at a steeper rate than noted in subjects with normal GFR. Thus subjects with low GFR appear to have an increased fractional excretion of sodium {{in response to a}} <b>solute</b> <b>load.</b> Fractional distal tubular sodium load (CH 2 O/GFR + CNa/GFR) was also higher initially in the low GFR group at every level of UNESV/GFR and increased at a more rapid rate in response to a <b>solute</b> <b>load.</b> Thus azotemic subjects have a decreased fractional reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule independent of fractional <b>solute</b> <b>load.</b> Nevertheless, an increase in <b>solute</b> <b>load</b> provokes a greater inhibition of fractional proximal tubular sodium reabsorption in these subjects than in normals. Fractional distal tubular sodium reabsorption (CH 2 O/GFR) in the low GFR group appeared to be lower at every level of fractional distal sodium load.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 88 - 94) The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} study guide of the pertinent literature concerning the nutritional care of the individual with early chronic renal insufficiency, and the type of nutritional support these patients require. The objective was to present material that dietetic students and dietitians working in health care could use in their educational sv-?? stem or place of employment. Recent clinical trials now give merit to the protective effects of dietary manipulation in the pre-dialysis phase of chronic renal insufficiency. New scientific evidence indicates that restriction of protein and phosphorus can slow or prevent the progressive loss of residual renal function in early stages of the disease. Careful attention is required to maintain the patient's nutritional status and to monitor dietary compliance. The role of the renal dietitian has now broadened to include the educational and nutritional support of this patient population. The therapeutic goals of the dietitian should include the following: nutritional assessment of the patient to fulfill energy requirements and maintain optimal electrolyte, vitamin, nineral and fluid levels. The clinician must observe closely the patient's protein status and design a diet which will reduce the total <b>renal</b> <b>solute</b> <b>load</b> to the smallest amount consistent with the nutritional welfare of the patient.

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of central diabetes insipidus (DI) with desmopressin in the neonatal period is challenging {{because of the}} significant risk of hyponatremia with this agent. The fixed anti-diuresis action of desmopressin and the obligate high fluid intake with milk feeds lead to considerable risk of water intoxication and hyponatremia. To reduce this risk, thiazide diuretics, part of the {{treatment of}} nephrogenic DI, were {{used in conjunction with}} low <b>renal</b> <b>solute</b> feed and were effective in a single case series of neonatal central DI. Aim: We evaluated the efficacy of early treatment of neonatal central DI with hydrochlorothiazide with low solute feed and investigated the clinical indicators for transition to desmopressin during infancy. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted at Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth of neonates diagnosed with central DI and treated with hydrochlorothiazide, between 2007 and 2013. Four newborns were identified. Mean sNa and mean change in sNa with desmopressin and hydrochlorothiazide treatment were recorded along with episodes of hyponatremia and hypernatremia. Length and weight trajectories during the first 12 months were assessed. Results: The mean change in sNa per day with hydrochlorothiazide and low <b>renal</b> <b>solute</b> feed was 2. 5 - 3 mmol/L; on desmopressin treatment, the mean change in sNa was 6. 8 - 7. 9 mmol/L.

To investigate this issue, seven rats were studied during a euvolemic control period and following continuous administration of pure, synthetic 24 amino acid atrial natriuretic factor. A 10 - 25 -fold increase in urinary sodium and chloride excretion occurred with a brisk kaliuresis but little bicarbonaturia. Atrial natriuretic factor caused whole kidney glomerular filtration rate to increase from 1. 17 +/- 0. 04 to 1. 52 +/- 0. 07 ml/min (P less than 0. 005). A parallel increase in single nephron glomerular filtration rate, from 34 +/- 1 to 44 +/- 2 nl/min (P less than 0. 001), and from 26 +/- 1 to 37 +/- 2 nl/min (P less than 0. 005) was measured at the end-proximal and early distal nephron sites, respectively. Appropriate for the higher flows were an increase in absolute proximal and loop reabsorptive rates for bicarbonate, chloride, and water, with a slight decrease in fractional solute and volume reabsorption in proximal and loop segments. To exclude the possibility that atrial natriuretic factor increased filtration rate only in anesthetized animals, eight unanesthetized rats were studied. Glomerular filtration rate increased by 45 %, from 2. 04 +/- 0. 17 to 2. 97 +/- 0. 27 ml/min (P less than 0. 005) without significant change in renal plasma flow, as reflected by 14 C-para-aminohippurate clearance (5. 4 +/- 0. 5 - 5. 6 +/- 0. 9 ml/min). The clearance and micropuncture data did not preclude changes in relative blood flow distribution to or in transport by deep nephron segments.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Myra Falls Price deposit is a zinc-rich volcanogenic massive-sulphide {{ore-body}} {{located in}} a mountainous region of central Vancouver Island, British Columbia. High rainfall and steep hydraulic gradients limit the water–mineral contact, which results in a low <b>solute</b> <b>load</b> in the oxygenated groundwater.

Zinc displays the strongest and most reliable anomaly contrasts in groundwaters associated with mineralization related to the Price deposit.

A threshold value of 20 µg/l was established, which includes an uncertainty that allows up to 10 % of the background population being defined as anomalous.

Indomethacin resulted in a slight increase in UOsm in normals, but a substantially greater rise in the patients. Following indomethacin a greater fall in FENa, fractional solute delivery to the diluting segment of the nephron [(CH 2 O + CNa+K) /GFR], fractional solute reabsorption in the diluting segment [CH 2 O/GFR] and the fraction of distally delivered solute reabsorbed [CH 2 O/(CH 2 O + CNa+K) ] was observed in the sickle cell patients than in the normal subjects. A similar trend, but of significantly lesser magnitude than that induced by indomethacin, was observed following sulindac in the sickle cell patient. The data imply that the supranormal GFR observed in the sickle cell patients was prostaglandin-mediated. The effects of NSAID's on <b>renal</b> <b>solute</b> and water handling in the sickle cell patients are compatible with a prostaglandin-dependent decreased salt reabsorption in the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle, together with a hyperfunctioning proximal tubule.

In one of these, Winberg [1] reported a reduced concentrating capacity, a finding later confirmed by others [2, 3]. The concentrating defect was proposed {{to be due}} to a damage of distal and collecting tubules [1, 4]. The concentrating capacity normalized within 4 to 6 weeks after treatment of the infection [1]. This seemingly rapid reversibility, which also can be demonstrated in experimental pyelonephritis [5], suggested a more transient defect than can be explained by structural damage. In experimental pyelonephritis in the rat [6 – 8], other explanations for the reduced concentrating ability have arisen. Among these explanations are an increased <b>solute</b> <b>load</b> per nephron due to a reduced nephron mass, a diminution of the tonicity of the medullary interstitium, or a failure to achieve osmotic equilibration.

Petrographic and paragenetic analyses, calcite and silica-phase stable isotopic analyses, and preliminary strontium tracer isotope and radiocarbon age analyses of these samples indicate that (1) {{an early stage of}} secondary mineralization consisting largely of chalcedony and quartz, but possibly with or slightly preceded by calcite, probably formed at warmer than ambient temperatures; (2) later secondary mineralization consisting of calcite and opal appears completely consistent with formation from percolation of surface infiltration whose <b>solute</b> <b>load</b> and carbon isotopic compositions reflect passage through the overlying soils; (3) based on textural studies, all unsaturated-zone secondary mineral occurrences exposed within the Exploratory Studies Facility tunnel, {{with the exception of the}} vapor-phase assemblages that formed at high temperatures during cooling of the tuffs, probably formed in unsaturated settings; and (4) calcite radiocarbon ages, based on preliminary results, have not been compromised by post-depositional exchange with carbon-bearing water and gases in the unsaturated zone...|$|R
40|$|Thermo-erosional river bank {{undercutting}} {{is caused}} by the combined action of thermal and mechanical erosion of the permafrost by Arctic rivers whilst the overlying sediment withstands collapse temporarily. Here, we report the discovery of a large thermo-erosional tunnel that formed in the banks of a meltwater-fed stream in northeast Greenland in summer 2015. The tunnel was observed over eight days (14 – 22 July), during which period the tunnel remained open but bank-side slumping increased. Stream <b>solute</b> <b>load</b> increased immediately downstream and remained high 800 m from the tunnel. Whilst this field observation was opportunistic and information somewhat limited, our study provides a rare insight into an extreme event impacting permafrost, local geomorphology and stream habitat. With accelerated climate change in Arctic regions, increased permafrost degradation and warmer stream water temperature are predicted thereby enhancing potential for thermo-erosional niche development and associated stream bank slumping. This change could have significant implications for stream physicochemical habitat and, in turn, stream benthic communities, through changes in aquatic habitat conditions. 熱侵食により川岸の下部が抉られる現象は、北極域の河川によって永久凍土が熱的および機械的な複合的侵食作用を受けた際、上部の堆積物が一時的に崩壊せずに持ちこたえることで生じる。ここでは、 2015 年夏にグリーンランド北東部において融雪水流の川岸に形成された大きな熱侵食トンネルの発見について報告する。このトンネルは 8 日間（ 7 月 14 日〜 22 日）開いたまま観測され、その間川岸の崩落が増大し続けた。河川水の溶質負荷はすぐ下流で増加し、トンネルから 800 mまでの範囲で高いままであった。この現地観測は偶然の機会によるもので情報は多少限定されるが、本研究は永久凍土、地形および水流流域の生息環境に影響を与える極端現象の一つについての稀な洞察を与えるものである。北極域の気候変動が加速することにより、永久凍土の劣化と河川における水温上昇が予測され、河岸の融解浸食進行とそれに伴う川岸崩壊の可能性が高まる。この変化は、このような小河川の物理化学環境を変え、水生生物環境に深刻な影響を及ぼす可能性がある...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} mammals to excrete urine either {{more or less}} {{concentrated}} than plasma permits them to maintain the osmolality of body fluids within the very narrow range compatible with normal cellular function {{in the face of}} wide variations in water and solute intake. This ability has played an essential role in the emergent evolution of mammals [1], permitting them to maintain homeostasis of body fluids in a terrestrial or even desert environment. Although in a general way it is clear that an increased <b>solute</b> <b>load</b> or restricted water intake demand production of a hypertonic urine and that a water load requires a dilute urine, the quantitative relations between urine flow and osmolality and changes in osmolality of body fluids are less obvious. In the next section we develop these ideas of whole body solute and water balance. Essentially the same conservation relations apply to the whole kidney or to any part of it, and mass balance relations applying to the whole kidney and to the renal medulla are developed in subsequent sections...|$|R
