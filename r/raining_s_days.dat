40|$|Understanding {{variations}} in rainfall in tropical regions is important {{due to its}} impacts on water resources, health and agriculture. This study assessed the dekadal rainfall patterns and rain days to determine intra-seasonal rainfall variability during the March–May season using the Mann–Kendall (M K) trend test and simple linear regression (S L R) over the period 2000 – 2015. Results showed an increasing trend of both dekadal rainfall amount and rain days (third and seventh dekads). The light <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> (<b>S</b> L R = 0. 181; M K = 0. 350) and wet <b>days</b> (<b>S</b> L R = 0. 092; M K = 0. 118) also depict an increasing trend. The rate of increase of light rain days and wet days during the third dekad (light <b>rain</b> days: <b>S</b> L R = 0. 020; M K = 0. 279 and wet days: S L R = 0. 146; M K = 0. 376) was slightly greater than during the seventh dekad (light <b>rain</b> days: <b>S</b> L R = 0. 014; M K = 0. 018 and wet days: S L R = 0. 061; M K = 0. 315) dekad. Seventy-four percent accounted for 2 – 4 consecutive dry days, but no significant trend was detected. The extreme rainfall was increasing over the third (M K = 0. 363) and seventh (M K = 0. 429) dekads. The rainfall amount and rain days were highly correlated (r: 0. 43 – 0. 72) ...|$|R

In this paper, we show that these conditions also guarantee that Xo is an isolated stationary point of the considered program provided a constraint qualification holds. This result has an interesting application to finite convergence of algorithms along the lines suggested by AI-Khayyal and Kyparisis. Key Words.

50|$|According to Frazer, {{the early}} Greek kings, who were {{expected}} to produce rain {{for the benefit of}} the crops, were in the habit of imitating thunder and lightning in the character of Zeus. At Crannon in Thessaly there was a bronze chariot, which in time of drought was shaken and prayers offered for <b>rain.</b> <b>S.</b> Reinach suggests that the story that Salmoneus was struck by lightning was due to the misinterpretation of a picture, in which a Thessalian magician appeared bringing down lightning and rain from heaven; hence arose the idea that he was the victim of the anger or jealousy of Zeus, and that the picture represented his punishment.|$|R
