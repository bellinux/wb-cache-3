However, reservations and uncertainty continue to surround the topic of dyslexia. Teachers are often unsure how to support the student with dyslexia in the classroom. Parents of {{children who have been}} assessed as having dyslexia will make every effort to be an advocate for the child in order to gain extra support.

40|$|International audienceTo {{evaluate}} the orthographic and phonological processing skills of developmental dyslexics, we (a) examined {{their abilities to}} exploit properties of orthographic redundancy and (b) tested whether their phonological deficit extends to spelling-to-sound connections for large-grain size units such as syllables. To assess the processing skills in dyslexics, we utilized the illusory conjunction paradigm to investigate the nature of <b>reading</b> <b>units</b> in French dyslexic and control children matched in reading age. In control children, <b>reading</b> <b>units</b> were defined by both orthographic redundancy and phonological syllable information. In dyslexics, however, <b>reading</b> <b>units</b> were defined only by orthographic redundancy. Therefore, despite their impairment in reading acquisition, developmental dyslexics {{have the ability to}} encode and exploit letter frequency co-occurrences. In contrast, their access to phonological syllables from letters was impaired, suggesting that their phonological deficit extends to large grain-size phonological units...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{meter reading}} is a {{monotonous}} and an expensive task. Now the meter reader people goes to each meter {{and take the}} meter reading manually to issue the bill which will later be entered in the billing software for billing and payment automation. If the manual meter reading and bill data entry process can be automated then it would reduced the laborious task and financial wastage. "Automatic Electric Meter Reading (AMR) System" is a metering system {{that is to be}} used for data collecting from the meter and processing the collected data for billing and other decision purposes. In this paper we have proposed an automatic meter reading system which is low cost, high performance, highest data rate, highest coverage area and most appropriate for Bangladesh perspective. In this AMR system there are four basic units. They are <b>reading</b> <b>unit,</b> communication unit, data receiving and processing unit and billing system. For <b>reading</b> <b>unit</b> we identified the disk rotation of the energy meter and stored the data in microcontroller. So it is not required to change the current analog energy meter. An external module will be added with the current energy meter. In the communication unit Wimax transceiver was used for wireless communication between meter end and the server end because of its wide coverage area. In the data receiving and processing unit meter reading will be collected from the transceiver which is controlled by another microcontroller. There will be a computer application that will take the data from the microcontroller. This will also help to avoid any tampering or break down of energy meter. There are various AMR system exists all over the world. Those systems were analyzed and we found they are not feasible for Bangladesh. Comment: 8 page...|$|E

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the follow-up Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study represent over 30 years of data collection among a cohort of participants across 27 clinical centers. The quality assurance plan is overseen by the Data Coordinating Center and is implemented across the clinical centers and central <b>reading</b> <b>units.</b> Each central unit incorporates specific DCCT/EDIC quality monitoring activities into their routine quality assurance plan. The results are reviewed by a data quality assurance committee whose function is to identify variances in quality that may impact study results from the central units as well as within and across clinical centers, and to recommend implementation of corrective procedures when necessary. Over the 30 -year period, changes to the methods, equipment, or clinical procedures have been required to keep procedures current and ensure continued collection of scientifically valid and clinically relevant results. Pilot testing to compare historic processes with contemporary alternatives is performed and comparability is validated prior to incorporation of new procedures into the study.

30|$|Lab Tech (Table  1) {{was founded}} in 2007 by a {{university}} researcher who {{had come up with}} a unique technology. The technology would allow the manufacturing of a chip that could improve health diagnostic systems. The chip would have the ability to conduct advanced diagnostics within this electronic chip, instead of more traditional lab machines which are both large in size and expensive to acquire. A single drop of fluid would be used to run numerous parallel assays, which would make it simple to diagnose many medical conditions. Lab Tech’s product would be able to perform many of these diagnostics without the use of a central lab, and this would allow for faster test results. The <b>reading</b> <b>unit</b> would be quite simple, while the actual diagnostic technology would be integrated into the chip. The chip would be consumable, and the sale of the consumable chip is where Lab Tech saw profit potential. After about 1  year in a technology incubator, one of the incubator coaches, who possessed previous startup experience as well as a business and engineering education, joined the firm as CEO. This was a move to complement the university researcher with more business experience.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{morphology}} {{in reading}} aloud was examined measuring naming latencies to pseudowords and words composed of morphemes (roots and derivational suffixes) and corresponding simple pseudowords and words. Three groups of Italian children {{of different ages}} and reading abilities, including dyslexic children, {{as well as one}} group of adult readers participated in the study. All four groups read faster and more accurately pseudowords composed of root and suffix than simple pseudowords (Experiment 1). Unlike skilled young and adult readers, both dyslexics and younger children benefited from morphological structure also in reading aloud words (Experiment 2). It is proposed that the morpheme is a unit of intermediate grain size that proves useful in processing all linguistic stimuli, including words, in individuals with limited reading ability (dyslexics and younger readers) who did not fully develop mastering of whole-word processing. For skilled readers, morphemic parsing is useful for reading those stimuli (i. e., pseudowords made up of morphemes), for which a whole-word lexical unit does not exist; where such whole-word lexical units do exist, skilled readers do not need to rely on morphological parsing because they can rely on a lexical (whole-word) <b>reading</b> <b>unit</b> that is larger than the morpheme.

40|$|A {{previous}} study (Burani et al., Cognition, 2008) reported that, similar to young and adult skilled readers, Italian developmental dyslexics read pseudowords {{made up of}} a root and a derivational suffix faster and more accurately than simple pseudowords. Unlike skilled readers, only dyslexic and reading-matched younger children benefited from morphological structure in reading words aloud. In this study, we show that word frequency affects the probability of morpheme-based reading, interacting with reading ability. Young skilled readers named low- but not high-frequency morphologically complex words faster than simple words. By contrast, the advantage for morphologically complex words was present in poor readers irrespective of word frequency. Adult readers showed no facilitating effect of morphological structure. These results indicate that young readers use <b>reading</b> <b>units</b> (morphemes) that are larger than the single-grapheme grain-size. It is argued that morpheme-based reading is important for obtaining reading fluency (rather than accuracy) in transparent orthographies and is useful particularly in children with limited reading ability who do not fully master whole-word processing...|$|R
