40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} a firm 2 ̆ 7 s decision to <b>redact</b> proprietary information from its material contract filings. Information redaction results when the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) grants a firm 2 ̆ 7 s request to withhold information from investors in its material contract filings, presumably because {{the information is}} proprietary. We hypothesize that when firms <b>redact</b> information, measures of adverse selection deteriorate. That is, the redaction of proprietary information from material contracts should be associated with: a larger adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread, reductions in market depth, and lower market turnover. In addition, we conjecture {{that the decision to}} <b>redact</b> depends on whether the firm plans on raising capital, the competitiveness of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s industry, and the performance of the firm. Overall the results of our analysis generally support our predictions. We find that when firms <b>redact</b> information, contemporaneous measures of the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread rise, and market depth and share turnover deteriorate; this suggests an increase in adverse selection. We also find firms are less likely to <b>redact</b> when they issue long-term debt {{and are more likely to}} <b>redact</b> when they are in a competitive industry or experience losses...|$|R

5|$|When Chuck returns, he and Ellie {{tell each}} other the truth, with Ellie {{revealing}} that she is still investigating her father's research, and Chuck revealing that {{he is still a}} CIA agent. Chuck then brings Ellie to Castle and demonstrates martial arts skills from the Intersect. When Chuck claims to be Agent X, the first human Intersect, Ellie informs him that, according to the laptop, someone had originally uploaded the Intersect to their brain before Chuck's birth. After Chuck repairs the computer, they find a <b>redacted</b> file on British scientist Hartley Winterbottom.|$|E
5|$|Existing {{negative}} {{views about}} Peribsen's existence {{are based on}} Ramesside king lists, such as the Abydos King List, the Saqqara King List and the Royal Canon of Turin, which all omit Peribsen's name. These, however, {{are known to have}} been <b>redacted</b> nearly 1,500 years after his death and several 4th dynasty tombs of priests performing the funerary cult for Peribsen have been uncovered. These tombs report Peribsen's name correctly and their existence demonstrate that Peribsen was seen as a legitimate pharaoh, not subject to damnatio memoriae as Akhenaten later would be. Historians and Egyptologists therefore consider the possibility that Peribsen's name was actually forgotten in time or that his name was preserved in a distorted, misspelled form.|$|E

5|$|There were minor {{differences}} between the original text and the version published by Princeton. In the Princeton publication, first and middle names were added instead of the previous use of abbreviations. In response to public concerns about radioactivity, Groves had text added to paragraph 12.18 explaining how {{the height of the}} explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki reduced fallout and allowed fission products to be drawn up into the upper atmosphere. He also had a one-sentence allusion to a poisoning effect of fission products in the production reactors <b>redacted.</b> This deletion was soon noticed by the Russian translators, and only served to highlight its importance to the Soviet atomic bomb project.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{there have been}} many well-publicized cases of source code leaking from {{different}} well-known companies. These leaks pose a serious problem when the source code contains sensitive information encoded in its identifier names and comments. Unfortunately, <b>redacting</b> the sensitive information requires obfuscating the identifiers, which will quickly interfere with program comprehension. Program comprehension is key for programmers in understanding the source code, so sensitive information is often left un-redacted. To address this problem, we offer a novel approach for <b>REdacting</b> Sensitive Information in Software arTifacts (RESIST). RESIST finds and replaces sensitive words in software artifacts in such a way to reduce the impact on program comprehension. We evaluated RESIST experimentally using 57 professional programmers from over a dozen different organizations. Our evaluation shows that RESIST effectively <b>redacts</b> software artifacts, thereby making it difficult for participants to infer sensitive information, while maintaining a desired level of comprehension...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} how {{to verify}} provenance {{and integrity of}} data in medical documents that are exchanged in a distributed system of health IT services. Provenance refers to the sources of health information within the document and integrity means that the information was not modified after generation by the source. Our approach allows intermediate parties to <b>redact</b> the document by removing information {{that they do not}} wish to reveal. For example, patients can store verifiable health information and provide subsets of it to third parties, while <b>redacting</b> sensitive information that they do not wish employers, insurers, or others to receive. Our method uses a cryptographic primitive known as a redactable signature. We study practical issues and performance impacts of building, <b>redacting,</b> and verifying Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs) that are protected with redactable signatures. Results show that manipulating redactable CCDs provides superior security and privacy with little computational overhead. ...|$|R
5|$|Amenemhat IV {{first came}} to power as a junior coregent of his {{predecessor}} Amenemhat III, whose reign marks {{the apex of the}} Middle Kingdom period. The coregency is well attested by numerous monuments and artefacts where the names of the two kings parallel each other. The length of this coregency is uncertain; it could have lasted from one to seven years, although most scholars believe it was only two years long. The Turin Canon, a king list <b>redacted</b> during the early Ramesside period, records Amenemhat IV on Column 6, Row 1, and credits him with a reign of 9 years, 3 months and 27 days. Amenemhat IV is also recorded on Entry 65 of the Abydos King List and Entry 38 of the Saqqara Tablet, both of which date to the New Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, {{a boxing}} venue was opened in a {{military}} facility known as Cuartel de Ballajá; a fight card was organized weekly. Legislator Lorenzo Coballes Gandía <b>redacted</b> a proposal to legalize boxing, which was signed by governor Horace Mann Towner in May 1927. Consequently, the Primera Comisión Atlética de Boxeo (The First Athletic Boxing Commission) was created; this became the first organization dedicated to sanctioned boxing in Puerto Rico. Estadio Universal (Universal Stadium) became the first venue to organize legal boxing cards. The first event featured a fight between Enrique Chaffardet and Al Clemens as the main event, which was declared a draw by the judges. New stadiums were built in Bayamón, Caguas, Mayagüez, Ponce, Aguadilla and San Juan. The first Puerto Rican to win a world championship was Sixto Escobar, who won it on June 26, 1934. During the 1960s and 1970s, {{there was an increase}} in the number of pugilists who achieved this recognition. Including Wilfred Benítez who on March 6, 1976, became the youngest world champion in history at 17 years old. This tendency continued during the following two decades, reaching its peak between the 1980s and 1990s. There was a slight decline in the 1990s. Félix Trinidad was Puerto Rico's most notable champion during this period. The 2000s brought another increase, as over a dozen boxers won world championships.|$|E
5|$|The first {{classic work}} about the Tang is the Old Book of Tang by Liu Xu (887–946) et al. of the Later Jin, who <b>redacted</b> {{it during the}} last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labelled the New Book of Tang) in order to {{distinguish}} it, which was a work by the Song historians Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072), Song Qi (998–1061), et al. of the Song dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060). Both of them were based upon earlier annals, yet those are now lost. Both of them also rank among the Twenty-Four Histories of China. One of the surviving sources of the Old Book of Tang, primarily covering up to 756, is the Tongdian, which Du You presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor Sima Guang (1019–1086). This historical text, written with 3 million Chinese characters in 294 volumes, covered the history of China {{from the beginning of the}} Warring States (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).|$|E
