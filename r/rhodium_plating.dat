5000|$|White gold's {{properties}} {{vary depending}} on the metals and proportions used. As a result, white gold alloys can be used for many different purposes; while a nickel alloy is hard and strong and therefore good for rings and pins, gold-palladium alloys are soft, pliable and good for white gold gemstone settings, sometimes with other metals like copper, silver, and platinum for weight and durability, although this often requires specialized goldsmiths. The term white gold is used very loosely in the industry to describe karat gold alloys with a whitish hue. It is a common misconception that the color of the <b>rhodium</b> <b>plating,</b> which is seen on many commercial pieces, is actually the color of white gold. The term [...] "white" [...] covers a large spectrum of colors that borders or overlaps pale yellow, tinted brown, and even very pale rose.

RNDr. Václav Nehasil, Dr., Department of surface and plasma science Abstract: In this work, {{we examined the}} suitability of rhodium deposited on a plasma sprayed substrate of titanium dioxide for catalysis reactions. With X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy method, the thermal stability of TiO 2 prepared with plasma spray technology on aluminum plate was tested at first. Then, rhodium was evaporated on substrate and thermal stability of the whole system Rh/TiO 2 was determined. Further methods of thermal desorption spectroscopy and molecular beam were used to study adsorption and desorption of CO and reaction of CO with oxygen. It was verified that the system Rh/TiO 2 ceases to adsorbing CO after heating above 620 K, also the CO reaction with oxygen exhibits considerably lower intensity after heating above 620 K. After calibrating on <b>rhodium</b> <b>plate,</b> {{it was determined that}} the intensity of CO 2 creation on Rh/TiO 2 is four times lower than intensity on the <b>rhodium</b> <b>plate.</b> Unprompted adsorption and desorption passivation of the system, however, seems to be the most significant problem.

40|$|The {{attention}} to a palladium- 103 radionuclide, including in Russia, has arisen rather {{for a long time}} (1 - 3) due to its nuclear- physical characteristics. It has a half-life 17 days (4) and irradiates KX-rays with an energy 20. 55 KeV (5). Palladium- 103 is interesting not only as a source of low energy radiation, but also as a generator of a radionuclide rhodium- 103 m (6). In the last years the interest in this radionuclide has increased sharply perhaps owing to definite success-es in applying of palladium- 103 in brachytherapy and in the treatment of prostate cancer (7, 8). In this connection we have developed the production technology of palladium- 103 with high specific activity and high chemical and radiochemical purity. The target represents a copper base, the <b>plate</b> from metallic <b>rhodium</b> is diffusively welded on which one. The technology of the target processing, based on literary publications, consists of following main stages: • separation of the irradiated <b>rhodium</b> <b>plate</b> from the copper base; • dissolution of the irradiated <b>rhodium</b> <b>plate</b> using alternating-current; • separation of palladium- 103 from rhodium by chloroform extraction of a complex of palladium with dimethylglyoxime; • transfer of palladium- 103 in solution of 1 N hydrochloric acid...|$|R

The wire used is 0. 625 micrometers diameter, 90 per cent platinum/ 10 per cent <b>rhodium,</b> <b>plated</b> with 30 - 40 micrometers diameter of silver. For construction, the plated wire is first bent into the appropriate shape, and then soldered onto stainless steel prongs.

Small portions of copper plating are then added to give the disired platinum/rhodium wire sensing length, and to insure that good mechanical and electrical connections exist to the sensor.

40|$|Summary ⎯We are {{calibrating}} {{the time}} of flight mass spectrometer of the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) instrument aboard the Cassini spacecraft.

Of special interest are the chemical composition of the particles in orbit about Saturn and/or its satellites {{that are expected to}} be captured by CDA during ring plane crossings and upon close encounter with the satellites. Upon impacting a <b>rhodium</b> <b>plate,</b> particles are expected to partially ionize and their chemical composition is expected to be determined from mass analysis of the positive ions. In order to optimize impact ionization calibration experiments using a light gas-gun launched microspheric particles, we have done initial testing with a short duration pulsed laser (4 ns duration nitrogen laser (337 nm)). The beam is focused to deliver the 300 µJ energy per laser pulse onto a 33 µm 2.

Easy for mass production, barrel <b>plating</b> <b>rhodium</b> electrode (Rh-BPE) is {{for the first time}} demonstrated for analytical application. Hydrazine was chosen as a model analyte to elucidate the electrocatalytic and analytical ability of the Rh-BPE system in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution. Flow injection analysis (FIA) of hydrazine showed a linear calibration range of 25 - 1000 ppb with a slope and a regression coefficient of 5 nA/ppb and 0. 9946, respectively. Twenty-two replicate injections of 25 ppb hydrazine showed a relative standard deviation of 3. 17 % indicating a detection limit (S/ N = 3) of 2. 5 ppb. The system can be continuously operated for I day without any alteration in the FIA signals and is tolerable to the interference of oxalic acid, gelatine, Triton X- 100, and albumin for even up to 100 times excess in concentration with respect to 400 ppb hydrazine. Since the fabrication cost of the electrode is cheap, it is thus disposable in nature.
