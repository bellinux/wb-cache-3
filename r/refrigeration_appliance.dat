The evaporators under study are tube-fin 'no-frost' heat exchangers with forced convection on the air-side and a staggered tube configuration. The calculation methodology was verified against experimental data for the heat transfer rate, thermal conductance and pressure drop obtained for two evaporators with different geometries. The average errors of the heat transfer rate, thermal conductance and pressure drop were 10 %, 3 % and 11 %, respectively.

40|$|To further {{increase}} the energy efficiency of domestic refrigeration systems, {{it is not}} sufficient anymore to optimize the single cycle components on their own. On the contrary, due to the strong system interactions, an integral consideration of the whole cooling cycle is necessary to capture the system dynamics in detail and to understand them.

In this work a transient model for the simulation of the evaporator and the condenser of domestic <b>refrigeration</b> <b>appliances,</b> based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) is presented.

40|$|Comprehensive {{knowledge}} about the heat transfer mechanisms and the temperature field inside hermetic compressors {{is very important for}} the thermal management and thus their performance. A numerical model to predict the temperature field in a hermetic reciprocating compressor for household <b>refrigeration</b> <b>appliances</b> is presented in this work. The model combines a high resolution three-dimensional heat conduction formulation of the compressorâ€™s solid parts, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach for the gas line domain and lumped formulations of the shell gas and the lubrication oil. Heat transfer coefficients are determined by applying CFD to the gas line side and correlations from the literature on the shell gas and oil side, respectively. The valve in the gas line simulation is modelled as a parallel moving flat plate. By means of an iterative loop the temperature field of the solid parts acts as boundary condition for the CFD calculation of the gas line which returns a cycle averaged quantity of heat to the solid parts. Using an iteration method which is based on the temperature deviation between two iteration steps, the total number of iterations and consequently the computational time can be reduced. The loop is continued until a steady-state temperature field is obtained. Calculated temperatures of the solid parts are verified against temperature measurements of a calorimeter test bench.

40|$|The {{preferred}} {{cooling process}} for household <b>refrigeration</b> <b>appliances</b> is a vapor compression refrigeration process with a capillary tube as expansion device. The vapor compression refrigeration system requires a phase {{change of the}} refrigerant inside the condenser and evaporator. Through a direct connection of condenser outlet and capillary tube inlet, which is commonly practiced for household refrigeration cycles, the condenser outlet defines directly the refrigerant state at the capillary tube inlet. Due to unsteady operation conditions the refrigerant state can change from subcooled liquid to saturated liquid with partially a vapor phase at the capillary tube inlet. The refrigerant flow inside the capillary tube is either adiabatic or non-adiabatic (by utilizing internal heat exchange). In both cases the refrigerants state changes during the expansion with an increase of vapor quality towards the capillary tube outlet. A variable vapor quality at the capillary tube inlet causes different flow patterns, especially at the capillary tube outlet. These flow patterns change periodically depending on the refrigerant state at the capillary tube inlet. Associated with the periodical changing flow patterns the occurrence of noise effects with the same periodicity and remarkable variations of the sound pressure level can be observed at the capillary tube outlet. Â This paper presents the experimental investigations on the simultaneous occurrence of refrigerant flow patterns and corresponding noise effects at the outlet of a capillary tube installed in a refrigeration test cycle. The discussion of the experimental results leads to an explanation of causal relation between distinguishable flow patterns and corresponding noise effects...|$|R

Although, a large amount research has been established in the refrigeration field for high mass flux systems, there is still ample opportunity to expand this application and knowledge in the <b>refrigeration</b> home <b>appliances</b> sector which require lower mass flux. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the design of liquid-vapor gravity separators for low mass flux systems (1. 5 â€“ 3. 5 Â lbm/ft^ 2 hr). In the experimental method, the independent parameters varied were: Inlet Quality, Inlet Pressure, Inlet Mass Flow, Top Branch Flow Ratio and Separator Geometry. The dependent parameter was determined as, x_ 2, the Outlet Vapor Branch Quality. The two separator geometries which were designed, fabricated, and tested varied in aspect ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the height to the body diameter of the separator. The aspect ratio of the first geometry was 10, and it consisted of a tall separator height (4. 125 in) with a narrow separator body diameter (0. 423 in). The second geometry had an aspect ratio of 2, and it consisted of a short separator height (1. 75 in) with a wide separator body diameter (0. 742 in). The separator body was made of clear PVC tubing material in order visualize the flow conditions at different operating points. The results of the study showed that both geometries perform similarly. At low and high liquid Reynolds number, the flows characteristically show no significant vapor shearing and no vapor exiting through the liquid branch, as long as a liquid build-up was visually present in the separator; this indicates that vapor phase momentum is not high enough to penetrate through the high bulk viscosity of the liquid phase. Therefore, evaluating the vapor quality through the vapor branch was explicitly carried out by assuming the vapor quality through the liquid branch as 0. Thus, the results indicate that the primary factor to influence separation in this study was the balance maintained between the inlet quality and top branch flow ratio. Overall, separation was not highly sensitive to the rest of the factors in the tested ranges applicable to small scale <b>refrigeration</b> <b>appliances.</b> When inlet quality was greater than top branch flow ratio, no clear liquid-vapor interface was present and the mixture entering the separator was characteristic of misty flow, thus no liquid buildup was found within the separator. Â However when the inlet quality was less than the top branch flow ratio, the liquid-vapor interface was visible and a liquid build-up was observed within the separator vessel...|$|R
40|$|Capillary tubes {{including}} a suction line heat exchanger are typical expansion devices used in nowadays domestic <b>refrigeration</b> <b>appliances.</b> To account for their functionality in transient cycle simulations, including the highly transient start-up and shut-down operations, different capillary tube models and their implementation {{in such a}} cycle are investigated. These non-adiabatic capillary tube models comprise dimensionless correlations, neural network methods and one-dimensional homogeneous models which stem partly from open literature and from previous work of the authors. The difficulty in application of capillary models during off-design conditions is when two phase flow or even superheated vapor which enters the capillary tube. These conditions {{are not covered by}} most of the schemes. In this work a transient cycle simulation {{including a}} 1 d formulation of the heat exchangers and a semi-empirical compressor model serves as virtual test bench for several capillary tube models. The range of parameters is chosen according to the need of domestic applications using R 600 a - mass flow rates range between 0 and 5 kg/h at inlet pressures up to 10 bar. The comparison of different implementation strategies is carried out in terms of speed, accuracy and stability in off-design. The predictability of the models is evaluated by steady state experimental data from literature and own experiments as well as an in-house 1 d model for the regions where no measurements exist. It is concluded that the direct implementation of the 1 d code bears the disadvantage of low speed, whereas common dimensionless correlations lose accuracy off its design point.

This work envisages {{on the development of}} an indoor solar simulator setup for operating PV panels and PV powered <b>refrigeration</b> <b>appliances</b> with a DC compressor. The use of DC powered devices helps in the elimination of inverters which aid reduction of cost and power loses. The solar simulator focuses on providing a test facility for a bottle cooler with a DC compressor solely powered from a PV panel of 125 W capacity. Halogen lamps are used in the simulator as they are inexpensive, readily available and their light intensity can be fully controlled by regulators. The lights in the solar simulator are arranged in a zig-zag pattern to obtain uniform illumination throughout the panel with minimum overlapping of light radiation. In order to perform various test conditions with respect to the light intensity, the distance between the simulator and the panel can be varied. The solar simulator is kept ON for a minimum of 30 minutes prior to the testing to obtain a steady state and uniform levels of irradiation. The compressor used in the bottle cooler is a DC powered Danfoss BD 35 K compressor which has an inbuilt control unit for smooth operation of the compressor during fluctuating solar irradiation and it works {{for a wide range of}} voltage of 10 to 45 V. The refrigerant used in the bottle cooler is iso-butane due to its low GWP and ODP values. An experimental comparison in the pull down characteristics of the DC powered bottle cooler and I-V characteristics of the PV panel used was performed using sun light and artificial solar simulator. In both cases, the bottle cooler unit is kept in the same environmental condition except for the PV panel that is kept in both conditions separately. The I-V characteristic experimentation was performed by applying load through a rheostat. Based on the I-V characteristics, the panel efficiency was found to be 9. 27 % under sunlight and 6. 93 % under the solar simulator setup. It is to be noted that the panel temperature was higher at outdoor conditions compared to that at indoor testing as fan cooling was provided during the test under the simulator. The average light intensity on the panel was lower at outdoor compared to indoor testing conditions. The pull down temperature was obtained by placing RTDs at various locations in the cabin and the average value was taken. The pull down time for the bottle cooler under the sunlight was 32. 78 minutes while it was 29. 5 minutes when tested under the solar simulator. Although the panel efficiency and the pull down time with the solar simulator is lower than the values observed from the open sun light, due to its consistency the simulator can be used as a test facility for PV powered DC appliances. cf 201...|$|R
