2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} governance standards are rights vote for {{who is on the}} board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A Draft Fifth Company Law Directive proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require two-tier board structures, although most EU member states have codetermination today with unified boards. The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 requires shareholders be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by institutional investors (primarily asset managers or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding [...] "other people's money". A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a 2013 people's initiative, or the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act 2010 in relation to brokers, the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for conflicts of interest where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with other people's money. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency, but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009 does suggest that investors in a mutual fund or ("collective investment scheme") should control the voting rights. The UCITS Directive 2009 is primarily concerned with creating a [...] "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a collective investment scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the banking crisis of 2007–08. Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014. These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 applies to other businesses selling financial instruments. It requires similar authorisation procedures to have a [...] "passport" [...] to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with clients. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100million, essentially hedge funds and private equity firms. Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic transparency requirements on products being sold, requirements in <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> for fund managers that are perceived to reduce [...] "risk" [...] or make pay [...] "performance" [...] related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on conflicts of interest, and specialised prohibitions on asset stripping. The Solvency II Directive 2009 is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in valuation of assets, again to avoid insolvency. The Capital Requirements Directives contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the European System of Financial Supervision was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, the European Banking Authority in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt.|$|E

Secondly, the committee recommended GOI equity in nationalized banks be reduced to 33% for increased autonomy. It also recommended the RBI relinquish its seats on the board of directors of these banks. The committee further added that given that the government nominees to the board of banks are often members of parliament, politicians, bureaucrats, etc., they often interfere in the day-to-day operations of the bank in the form of the behest-lending.

40|$|In the UK, the top {{executive}} <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> is not geared towards {{the creation of}} value but compensation revisions are rather driven by changes in corporate size, measured by sales growth. This suggests that managing larger firms requires special managerial skills. Even in UK companies with high concentration of control, no significant pay-for-performance relation has been discovered. In Spain, CEOs of larger firms receive higher cash-based compensation than those of small companies. For Spanish listed firms, we find that increases in corporate value are followed by increases in implicit (cash-based) CEO remuneration. However, this positive pay-for-share price performance elasticity is not present in all Spanish corporations: a <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> aiming at the maximisation of corporate value is present in companies {{with a high degree}} of shareholder control. Only strong blockholders seem to be able to impose their share price related compensation scheme upon management. It should be noted that share prices trigger increases in CEO remuneration only if the share price returns are higher than those of the industry peers. In Spanish firms without high control concentration, modifications in managerial remuneration depend upon changes in accounting returns in prior years: if the change in the firm's return on assets (ROA) outperforms the industry ROA, the executive directors' cash compensation increases in the subsequent period. In these companies, the lack of blockholders gives management mor...|$|R

40|$|In theory, {{for many}} small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises the introduction of performance-related pay might be beneficial: if implemented properly, it could help enterprises in selecting, hiring and motivating the right employees for the right jobs. So far, however, performance-related pay in SMEs has received little academic attention. One of the few studies that examined determinants of performance-related pay amongst SMEs found support for the presence of gender effects; not only regarding the gender of the employees, but also regarding the gender of the entrepreneur. In this paper we have further investigated these� gender effects in <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies.</b> The central idea is that female and male entrepreneurs make different choices regarding their human resource management practices, including <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies.</b> Amongst others, these choices are related to the risk aversion of the entrepreneur {{as well as of the}} employees. Generally speaking, women are more risk averse than men. This may apply to entrepreneurs as well as to employees. This leads to various hypotheses that are tested empirically. Generally speaking, the results provide only limited support for our hypotheses. Our results are fairly consistent with the standard assumption that employees are risk averse (and female employees more than male employees) while employers (entrepreneurs) are not. At the same time, the support for our hypotheses is so limited that we have conducted a critical re-examination of our basic assumptions. This suggests that gender effects in <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> may (also) be caused by gender differences in labour force attachment rather than in risk aversion. � �...|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} {{increased}} emphasis globally on nurses’ involvement in health policy and systems development. However, {{there has been}} limited scholarly attention on nurses’ participation in policy-making in South Africa. Objective: This paper analyses the dynamics, strengths, and weaknesses of nurses’ participation in four national health workforce policies: the 2008 Nursing Strategy, revision of the Scope of Practice for nurses, the new Framework for Nursing Qualifications, and the Occupation-Specific Dispensation (OSD) <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy.</b> Design: Using a policy analysis framework, we conducted in-depth interviews with 28 key informants and 73 frontline nurses in four South African provinces. Thematic content analysis was done using the Atlas. ti software. Results: The study found that nurses’ participation in policy-making is both contested and complex. The contestation relates to the extent and nature of nurses’ participation in nursing policies. There was a disjuncture between nursing leadership and frontline nurses in their levels of awareness of the four policies. The latter group was generally unaware of these policies {{with the exception of}} the OSD <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> as it affected them directly. There was also limited consensus on which nursing group legitimately represented nursing issues in the policy arena. Shifting power relationships influenced who participated, how the participation happened, and the degree to which nurses’ views and inputs were considered and incorporated. Conclusions: The South African health system presents major opportunities for nurses to influence and direct policies that affect them. This will require a combination of proactive leadership, health policy capacity and skills development among nurses, and strong support from the national nursing association...|$|R

The necessity of reforming the <b>policy</b> of employee <b>remuneration</b> in the budgetary sphere is substantiated.

With the aim of renewing the ratios for various categories and professional groups, it is important to reduce the gap between the subsistence minimum and the minimum wage. Prospects for further research should be the development of a methodology for evaluating positions and job for an objective comparison of the complexity of tasks and responsibilities of budgetary sector employees, substantiating qualification ratios in wages, forming indicators to determine the basic wages of employees within the developed ranges...|$|R
