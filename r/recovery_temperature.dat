40|$|From a one {{dimensional}} view of temperature alone variations at the Earth's surface manifest themselves in two cyclic patterns of diurnal and annual periods, due principally {{to the effects}} of diurnal and seasonal changes in solar heating as well as gains and losses of available moisture. Beside these two well known cyclic patterns, a third cycle has been identified which occurs in values of diurnal maxima and minima soil temperature extrema at 10 cm depth usually over a mesoscale period of roughly 3 to 14 days. This mesoscale period cycle starts with precipitation cooling of soil and is followed by a power curve <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery.</b> The <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> clearly depends on solar heating of the soil with an increased soil moisture content from precipitation combined with evaporation cooling at soil temperatures lowered by precipitation cooling, but is quite regular and universal for vastly different geographical locations, and soil types and structures.

Measurements of Nusselt numbers and <b>recovery</b> <b>temperatures</b> were carried out using small-diameter (0. 00038 to 0. 00254 cm.) tungsten wires in steam flow with Reynolds numbers ranging from about 1 to 12 and with nominal Mach numbers of 0. 5 to 1. 7.

40|$|International audienceExposing insects to a {{fluctuating}} thermal regime (FTR) {{compared with}} constant low temperature (CLT) significantly reduces cold-induced mortality. The beneficial effects of FTR result from physiological repair during warming intervals. The duration {{and the temperature}} experienced during the recovery period are supposed to strongly impact the resulting cold survival; however, disentangling the effects of both recovery variables had not been broadly investigated. In this study, we investigate cold tolerance (lethal time, Lt 50) of the polyphagous beetle Alphitobius diaperinus. We examined adult survival under various CLTs (0, 5, 10 and 15 1 C), and under 20 different FTR conditions, where the 0 1 C exposure alternated with various <b>recovery</b> <b>temperatures</b> (Rt) (5, 10, 15 and 20 1 C) combined with various recovery durations (Rds) (0. 5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h). Under CLTs, Lt 50 increased with temperature until no mortality occurred above the upper limit of cold injury zone (ULCIZ). Under FTRs, Lt 50 increased with both Rt and Rd. The magnitude of the survival gain was clearly boosted when Rt was above the ULCIZ (at 20 1 C). Based on a data matrix of lethal times with multiple Rt Rd combinations, a predictive model showed that cold survival increased exponentially with Rt and Rd. This model was subsequently validated with additional survival tests. We suggest that increasing recovery durations associated with optimal <b>recovery</b> <b>temperatures</b> eventually leads to a progressive chilling compensation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first study}} on how the unbalance of <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> after air charged has {{a significant effect on}} the accuracy and repeatability of air leak detection. From this viewpoint, <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> time is derived and affecting parameters are investigated. In a leak detection based on differential pressure measurement, the leak is detected by measuring pressure difference between a reference component, which is leak tight, and a tested component using a differential pressure sensor. When the tested component is leaking, the pressure inside it decreases and the pressure difference with the reference is measured. However, when the required <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> time is not satisfied, unbalance of <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> due to a possibly small difference of heat transfer coefficient between the reference and tested component can produce pressure difference that is similar in size as a real leak and larger uncertainty. This phenomenon is described theoretically and the experimental data are in satisfactory agreement with the calculated results...|$|R
5000|$|At {{high speeds}} through the air, the object's kinetic energy is {{converted}} to heat through compression and friction. At lower speed, the object will lose heat to the air through which it is passing, if the air is cooler. The combined temperature effect of heat from the air and from passage through {{it is called the}} stagnation temperature; the actual temperature is called the <b>recovery</b> <b>temperature.</b> These viscous dissipative effects to neighboring sub-layers make the boundary layer slow down via a non-isentropic process. Heat then conducts into the surface material from the higher temperature air. The result is an increase in the temperature of the material and a loss of energy from the flow. The forced convection ensures that other material replenishes the gases that have cooled to continue the process.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method that}} fuel-users control quality is {{by using the}} cetane index (CI), which is a {{calculated}} number based on the density and distillation range of the fuel. There are various versions of this, depending on whether metric or Imperial units are used, and how many distillation points are used. These days most oil companies use the '4-point method', ASTM D4737, based on density, 10% 50% and 90% recovery temperatures. The '2-point method' is defined in ASTM D976, and uses just density and the 50% <b>recovery</b> <b>temperature.</b> This 2-point method tends to overestimate cetane index and is not recommended. Cetane index calculations {{can not account for}} cetane improver additives and therefore do not measure total cetane number for additized diesel fuels. Diesel engine operation is primarily related to the actual cetane number and the cetane index is simply an estimation of the base (unadditized) cetane number.|$|E

40|$|Jet {{impingement}} cooling of a hypersonic airfoil {{leading edge}} is experimentally investigated using thermochromic liquid crystals (TLCS) to measure surface temperature. The experiment uses computer data acquisition with digital imaging of the TLCs to determine heat transfer coefficients during a transient experiment. The data reduction relies on {{analysis of a}} coupled transient conduction - convection heat transfer problem that characterizes the experiment. The <b>recovery</b> <b>temperature</b> of the jet is accounted for by running two experiments with different heating rates, thereby generating a second equation {{that is used to}} solve for the <b>recovery</b> <b>temperature.</b> The resulting solution requires a complicated numerical iteration that is handled by a computer. Because the computational data reduction method is complex, special attention is paid to error assessment. The error analysis considers random and systematic errors generated by the instrumentation along with errors generated by the approximate nature of the numerical methods. Results of the error analysis show that the experimentally determined heat transfer coefficients are accurate to within 15 %. The error analysis also shows that the <b>recovery</b> <b>temperature</b> data may be in error by more than 50 %. The results show that the <b>recovery</b> <b>temperature</b> data is only reliable when the <b>recovery</b> <b>temperature</b> of the jet is greater than 5 C, i. e. the jet velocity is in excess of 100 m/s. Parameters that were investigated include nozzle width, distance from the nozzle exit to the airfoil surface, and jet velocity. Heat transfer data is presented in graphical and tabular forms. An engineering analysis of hypersonic airfoil leading edge cooling is performed using the results from these experiments.

At high Reynolds numbers, the heat transfer data agree well {{with the results of}} Laufer and McClellan, which were obtained at lower Mach numbers. At lower Reynolds numbers, the results indicate a monotonic transition between continuum and free molecule heat transfer laws. The slope of the heat transfer correlation also appears to vary monotonically, with Nu=√Re at high Reynolds numbers and Nu Re for Re < < 1. Data on the wire <b>recovery</b> <b>temperature</b> (corresponding to zero net heat transfer) were obtained for free-stream Knudsen numbers between 0. 4 and 3. 0.

At the <b>recovery</b> <b>temperature</b> which is in the range of 100 oC- 400 oC, the behavior of stainless steel being investigated and the degree of softening, Xrec is calculated using Friedel’s model.

Using Friedel’s model, the activation energy, Q is calculated and being compared with other journal.
