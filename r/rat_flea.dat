5|$|The Great Plague {{killed an}} {{estimated}} 100,000 people—almost {{a quarter of}} London's population—in 18 months. The plague {{was caused by the}} Yersinia pestis bacterium, which is usually transmitted through the bite of an infected <b>rat</b> <b>flea.</b>|$|E
5|$|The banker Charles Rothschild devoted much of {{his time}} to entomology, {{creating}} a large collection of fleas now in the Rothschild Collection at the Natural History Museum, London. He discovered and named the plague vector flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, also known as the oriental <b>rat</b> <b>flea,</b> in 1903. Using what was probably the world's most complete collection of fleas of about 260,000 specimens (representing some 73% of the 2,587 species and subspecies so far described), he described around 500 species and subspecies of Siphonaptera. He was followed in this interest by his daughter Miriam Rothschild, who helped to catalogue his enormous collection of the insects in seven volumes.|$|E
5|$|Fleas {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, {{before moving on to}} other groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea is more or less a specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental <b>rat</b> <b>flea,</b> Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E

25|$|Wild rodents, {{including}} rats, {{can carry}} many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma gondii, and Campylobacter. The Black Death is traditionally {{believed to have}} been caused by the micro-organism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical <b>rat</b> <b>flea</b> (Xenopsylla cheopis) which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is the foot-and-mouth disease.|$|E
25|$|Yersinia pestis (formerly Pasteurella pestis) is a Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} coccobacillus, non mobile with no spores. It is a {{facultative anaerobic}} organism that can infect humans via the oriental <b>rat</b> <b>flea.</b> It causes the disease plague, which takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and bubonic plagues. All three forms {{were responsible for}} a number of high-mortality epidemics throughout human history, including: the 6th century's Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, which accounted for the death of at least one-third of the European population between 1347 and 1353, and the Third Pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Modern Plague, which began in the late 19th century in China and spread by rats on steamboats claiming close to 10 million lives. These plagues probably originated in China and were transmitted west via trade routes.|$|E
25|$|Bubonic plague is an {{infection}} of the lymphatic system, usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (the <b>rat</b> <b>flea).</b> In very rare circumstances, as in the septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. The flea is parasitic on house and field rats, and seeks out other prey when its rodent hosts die. The bacteria remain harmless to the flea, allowing the new host to spread the bacteria. The bacteria form aggregates in the gut of infected fleas and this results in the flea regurgitating ingested blood, which is now infected, into the bite site of a rodent or human host. Once established, bacteria rapidly spread to the lymph nodes and multiply.|$|E
40|$|Rickettsia typhi and R. felis, {{etiologic}} {{agents of}} murine typhus and fleaborne spotted fever, respectively, were detected in Oriental <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> (Xenopsylla cheopis) collected from rodents and shrews in Java, Indonesia. We describe {{the first evidence}} of R. felis in Indonesia and naturally occurring R. felis in Oriental <b>rat</b> <b>fleas.</b> Murine typhus (endemic typhus, fleaborne typhus), caused by Rickettsia typhi, is transmitted to humans by infected fleas and is relatively common wherever susceptible rodent hosts reside (1). Fleaborne spotted fever (cat flea typhus), caused by Rickettsia felis, is another zoonotic disease carried by fleas and appears to have an equally wide, cosmopolitan distribution; human infections with R. felis have a clinical syndrome {{similar to that of}} murine typhus (1 – 4). The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, has been identified as the primary arthropod vector of R...|$|R
25|$|The Black Death {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in the dry plains of Central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road, reaching Crimea by 1343.

Spreading throughout the Mediterranean and Europe.|$|R
50|$|Y. pestis {{was used}} as a {{biological}} weapon in World War II, when on October 4, 1940, a Japanese airplane flying over Chushien, Chekiang Province, China, released rice and wheat plus <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> carrying Y. pestis. A second plane load was released three weeks later. These actions led to a local plague that killed 121 people.|$|R
2500|$|Typhus {{is caused}} by rickettsia, which is {{transmitted}} to humans through lice. [...] The main vector for typhus is the <b>rat</b> <b>flea.</b> [...] Flea bites and infected flea feaces in the respiratory tract {{are the two most}} common methods of transmission. [...] In areas where rats are not common, typhus may also be transmitted through cat and opossum fleas. The incubation period of typhus is 7–14 days. [...] The symptoms start with a fever, then headache, rash, and eventually stupor. [...] Spontaneous recovery occurs in 80–90% of victims.|$|E
2500|$|McCormick has {{suggested}} that earlier archaeologists were simply {{not interested in the}} [...] "laborious" [...] processes needed to discover rat remains. Walløe complains that all of these authors [...] "take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat → <b>rat</b> <b>flea</b> → human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of Yersinia pestis infection could spread", whilst pointing to several other possibilities. Similarly, Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-commensal) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.|$|E

25|$|The third plague {{pandemic}} (1855–1859) {{started in}} China in the mid-19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 {{million people in}} India alone. Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia between 1900 and 1925 resulted in well over 1,000 deaths, chiefly in Sydney. This led {{to the establishment of}} a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> to humans via the bacillus Yersinia pestis.|$|R
500|$|Oriental <b>rat</b> <b>fleas,</b> Xenopsylla cheopis, {{can carry}} the {{coccobacillus}} Yersinia pestis. The infected fleas feed on rodent vectors of this bacterium, {{such as the}} black rat, Rattus rattus, and then infect human populations with the plague, as has happened repeatedly from ancient times, as in the Plague of Justinian in 541–542. [...] Outbreaks killed up to 200 million people across Europe between 1346 and 1671. The Black Death pandemic between 1346 and 1353 likely killed {{over a third of}} the population of Europe.|$|R
5000|$|From {{time to time}} plagues such as bubonic plague, caused {{mainly by}} <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> (Xenopsylla cheopis, a {{parasite}} found on brown rats), [...] "red" [...] dysentery and other scourges killed {{a great deal of}} Flensburg's population. Lepers were strictly isolated, namely at the St.-Jürgen-Hospital (Helligåndshspital, built before 1290), which lay far outside the town's gates, where the St. Jürgen Church is nowadays. About 1500, syphilis also appeared. The church hospital [...] "Zum Heiligen Geist" [...] ("To the Holy Ghost") stood in Große Straße, now Flensburg's pedestrian precinct.|$|R

Essentially a cardboard container, the E23 consisted of an internal actuator which simply reversed a plastic bag, expelling its contents. The E23 sub-munition also included a small parachute for use when dropped from the E77 cluster bomb. The weapon was deployed between 2,000 and 1,000 feet in altitude after its release from the cluster bomb.

500|$|At that time, {{bubonic plague}} {{was a much}} feared disease but its cause was not understood. The credulous blamed emanations from the earth, [...] "pestilential effluviums", unusual weather, {{sickness}} in livestock, abnormal behaviour of animals or {{an increase in the}} numbers of moles, frogs, mice or flies. It was not until 1894 that the identification by Alexandre Yersin of its causal agent Yersinia pestis was made and the transmission of the bacterium by <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> became known. Although the Great Plague in London had long been believed to be bubonic plague caused by Yersinia pestis, this was only definitively confirmed by DNA analysis in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is caused}} by the {{bacteria}} Rickettsia typhi, and is transmitted by the <b>fleas</b> that infest <b>rats.</b> While <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> are the most common vectors, cat fleas and mouse fleas are less common modes of transmission. These fleas are not affected by the infection. Human infection occurs because of flea-fecal contamination of the bites on human skin. Rats, cats, opossums maintain the rickettsia colonization by providing it with a host for its entire life cycle. Rats can develop the infection, and help spread the infection to other fleas that infect them, and help multiply the number of infected fleas that can then infect humans.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, the E23 was {{involved}} in [...] "Operation Big Itch". In September 1954 Big Itch aimed to determine coverage patterns and survivability of uninfected tropical <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> (Xenopsylla cheopis) for use in biological warfare as disease vector. In preliminary Big Itch tests {{approximately half of the}} E23 munitions failed to properly function. In one instance, the problems with the E23 led uninfected fleas to escape into the aircraft where they bit the pilot, bombardier and an observer. These problems led to the E23 being pulled off of Operation Big Itch. Despite the problems with the E23, the Big Itch field trials ultimately proved successful.|$|R
