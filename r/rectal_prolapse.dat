40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Rectal</b> mucosal <b>prolapse</b> syndrome, histologically {{characterized}} by fibromuscular obliteration in the lamina propria, hyperplastic glands and thickened muscularis mucosa, causes rectal bleeding. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune exocrinopathy that chiefly destroys the salivary and lacrimal glands by lympho-plasmacytic infiltration. Although various gastrointestinal manifestations {{have been reported}} in patients with Sjögren's syndrome, there have not been to our knowledge any case reports to date of <b>rectal</b> mucosal <b>prolapse</b> syndrome in association with Sjögren's syndrome. Case presentation A 68 -year-old Japanese woman with Sjögren's syndrome and long-term constipation consulted our hospital because of rectal bleeding. Because of dysphagia and xerostomia, she had consistently refused recommendations to take oral medicines including cathartics. Therefore, she frequently strained excessively during defecation. Colonoscopy and radiological examinations disclosed eroded flat protrusions of the rectum. Microscopic examination demonstrated inflamed mucosa with elongated tortuous glands and fibromuscular obliteration. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of <b>rectal</b> mucosal <b>prolapse</b> syndrome was made. Prohibition of straining during defecation and sulfasalazine suppository use were effective. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of defecation control in patients with Sjögren's syndrome. In the case presented, <b>rectal</b> mucosal <b>prolapse</b> syndrome following long-term excessive straining during defecation caused rectal bleeding. Clinicians should consider <b>rectal</b> mucosal <b>prolapse</b> syndrome as a gastrointestinal manifestation of Sjögren's syndrome. </p...|$|R

25|$|As with {{external}} <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapse,</b> {{there are a}} great many different surgical interventions described. Generally, a section of rectal wall can be resected (removed), or the rectum can be fixed (rectopexy) to its original position against the sacral vertebrae, or a combination of both methods. Surgery for internal <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapse</b> can be via the abdominal approach or the transanal approach.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} it {{represents}} the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapse.</b> The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception.

25|$|Rectal mucosal {{prolapse}} (mucosal prolapse, anal mucosal prolapse) is a {{sub-type of}} <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapse,</b> and refers to abnormal descent of the rectal mucosa through the anus.

Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) used as a negative control gave no skin reaction in any of the tested animals. In addition, simultaneous serological tests revealed low antibody levels against MO and MA. However, both agents could be routinely isolated from nasal swabs of the affected lambs.

25|$|Rosebud {{pornography}}, rosebudding or <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapse</b> pornography {{refers to}} an anal sex practice which occurs in some extreme anal pornography wherein a pornograhic actor or actress performs a <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapse</b> wherein {{the walls of the}} rectum slip out of the anus. A <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapse</b> is a serious medical condition that requires the attention of a medical professional. However, in rosebud pornography it is performed deliberately. Michelle Lhooq, writing for VICE, argues that rosebudding is an example of producers making 'extreme' content due to the easy availability of free pornography on the internet. She also argues that rosebudding is a way for pornographic actors and actresses to distinguish themselves. Repeated rectal prolapses can cause bowel problems and anal leakage and therefore risk the health of pornographic actors or actresses who participate in them. Lhooq also argues that some who participate in this form of pornography are unaware of the consequences.|$|E

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies have demonstrated that}} genetic deletion of the Muc 2 gene causes colorectal cancers in mice. The current study further showed that at the early stage (, 3 months) the Muc 2 knockout mice spontaneously developed chronic inflammation in colon and rectum, similar pathological features as human colitis; and at the late stage (. 3 months) the mice exhibited colorectal cancer, including a unique phenotype of <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapsed</b> (<b>rectal</b> severe inflammation and adenocarcinoma). Thus, the age of 3 months might be the key point of the transition from chronic inflammation to cancer. To determine the mechanisms of the malignant transformation, we conducted miRNA array on the colonic epithelial cells from the 3 -month Muc 22 / 2 and +/+ mice. MicroRNA profiling showed differential expression of miRNAs (i. e. lower or higher expression enrichments) in Muc 22 / 2 mice. 15 of them were validated by quantitative PCR. Based on relevance to cytokine and cancer, 4 miRNAs (miR- 138, miR- 145, miR- 146 a, and miR- 150) were validate and were found significantly downregulated in human colitis and colorectal cancer tissues. The network of the targets of these miRNAs was characterized, and interestedly, miRNA-associated cytokines were significantly increased in Muc 22 / 2 mice. This is the first to reveal the importance of aberrant expression of miRNAs in dynamically transformation from chronic colitis to colitis-associated cancer...|$|R

25|$|Surgical {{approaches}} in <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapse</b> {{can be either}} perineal or abdominal. A perineal approach (or trans-perineal) refers to surgical access to the rectum and sigmoid colon via incision around the anus and perineum (the area between the genitals and the anus).

Procedures for <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapse</b> may involve fixation of the bowel (rectopexy), or resection (a portion removed), or both.

40|$|During {{the past}} several years, an ovine {{coughing}} syndrome characterized by paroxysmal cough leading to <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapses</b> has been observed in Iowa and neighboring states. Preliminary studies conducted by Kaeberle and Eness (1) several years ago indicated the presence of relatively high levels of M. ovipneumoniae (MO) antibody in lambs from affected flocks. In the present study, serum samples obtained from six flocks around the state of Iowa, at various stages of the clinical disease, were compared by ELISA for antibody to MO and M. arginini (MA). Results indicated low antibody levels to MO in flocks sampled at {{the early stages of}} infection whereas increased levels of antibody were evident in lambs from flocks that had apparently recovered from the disease. On the other hand, antibody levels to MA were more likely to increase earlier in the disease process. Our results suggest that the chronic nature of this disease may result from the failure of the immune system to produce antibodies that are protective against MO infection. At such a time that appreciable levels of specific antibodies appear in the serum (several weeks following infection) lambs seem to recover from the clinical disease. In addition, this lack of circulating antibody levels against MO would not be inconsistent with a predominant IgE response during early stages of the clinical disease as we have suggested in another entry in this issue of Sheep Research Reports...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{promising}} approaches in the therapy of ulcerative colitis is administration of butyrate, an energy source for colonocytes, into the lumen of the colon. This study investigates {{the effect of}} butyrate producing bacterium Clostridium tyrobutyricum on dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) -induced colitis in mice. Immunocompetent BALB/c and immunodeficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice reared in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions were treated intrarectally with C. tyrobutyricum 1 week prior to the induction of DSS colitis and during oral DSS treatment. Administration of DSS without C. tyrobutyricum treatment led to an appearance of clinical symptoms – bleeding, <b>rectal</b> <b>prolapses</b> and colitis-induced increase in the antigen CD 11 b, a marker of infiltrating inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. The severity of colitis was similar in BALB/c and SCID mice as judged by the histological damage score and colon shortening after 7 days of DSS treatment. Both strains of mice also showed a similar reduction in tight junction (TJ) protein zonula occludens (ZO) - 1 expression and of MUC- 2 mucin depression. Highly elevated levels of cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -a in the colon of SCID mice and of interleukin (IL) - 18 in BALB/c mice were observed. Intrarectal administration of C. tyrobutyricum prevented appearance of clinical symptoms of DSS-colitis, restored normal MUC- 2 production, unaltered expression of TJ protein ZO- 1 and decreased levels of TNF-a and IL- 18 in the descending colon of SCID and BALB/c mice, respectively. Some of these features can be ascribed to the increased production of butyrate in the lumen of the colon {{and its role in}} protection of barrier functions and regulation of IL- 18 expressio...|$|R
