In particular, the miRNAs that participates in <b>radiation</b> induced <b>carcinogenesis</b> and the miRNAs that target the tumor suppressor gene Big-h 3 remain undefined. Here in this study, using a radiation induced thymic lymphoma model in BALB/c mice, we found that the tumor suppressor gene Big-h 3 is down-regulated and miR- 21 is up-regulated in radiation induced thymic lymphoma tissue samples. We also found inverse correlations between Big-h 3 protein and miR- 21 expression level among different tissue samples. Furthermore, our data indicated that miR- 21 could directly target Big-h 3 in a 3 &# 8242;UTR dependent manner. Finally, we found that miR- 21 could be induced by TGF&# 946;, and miR- 21 has both positive and negative effects in regulating TGF&# 946; signaling.

It is postulated short- and long-term effects of CNS exposure to galactic cosmic radiation are likely to pose significant neurological health risks to human long-term space travel. Estimates suggest considerable exposure to high energy heavy (HZE) ions as well as protons and secondary radiation during Mars or prolonged Lunar missions with estimates of whole body effective doses ranging from 0.17 to greater than 1.0 Sv. Given the high linear energy transfer potential of such particles, a considerable proportion of those cells exposed to HZE radiation are likely to die. Based on calculations of heavy ion fluences during space flight as well as various experimental cell models, as many as 5% of an astronaut’s cells might be killed during such missions. With respect to cells in critical brain regions, as many as 13% of such cells may be traversed at least once by an iron ion during a three-year Mars mission. Several Apollo astronauts reported seeing light flashes, although the precise biological mechanisms responsible are unclear. Likely pathways include heavy ion interactions with retinal photoreceptors and Cherenkov radiation resulting from particle interactions within the vitreous humor. This phenomenon has been replicated on Earth by scientists at various institutions. As the duration of the longest Apollo flights was less than two weeks, the astronauts had limited cumulative exposures and a corresponding low risk for <b>radiation</b> <b>carcinogenesis.</b> In addition, there were only 24 such astronauts, making statistical analysis of any potential health effects problematic.|$|E

We present a 58 -year-old male who was initially diagnosed to have low-grade glioma in an eloquent area of the brain by stereotactic biopsy.

Much {{of the evidence that}} underlies our understanding of secondary cancer risks and our risk estimates are derived from large epidemiologic studies and predictive models of earlier decades with large uncertainties. The modern era is characterized by more conformal radiotherapy technologies, molecular and genetic marker approaches, genome-wide studies and risk stratifications, and sophisticated biologically based predictive models of the carcinogenesis process. Four key areas that have strong evidence toward affecting secondary cancer risks are 1) the patient age at time of radiation treatment, 2) genetic risk factors, 3) the organ and tissue site receiving radiation, and 4) the dose and volume of tissue being irradiated by a particular radiation technology. This review attempts to summarize our current understanding on the impact on secondary cancer risks for each of these known risk factors. We review the recent advances in genetic studies and carcinogenesis models that are providing insight into the biologic processes that occur from tissue irradiation {{to the development of a}} secondary malignancy. Finally, we discuss current approaches toward minimizing the risk of radiation-associated secondary malignancies, an important goal of clinical radiation oncology.

After the irradiation the rats were given for 16 months with drinking water DFMO at a concentration of 2 g/l, tincture from biomass of tissue culture of ginseng root (bioginseng) at a concentration of 20 ml/l, tincture of Siberian ginseng root, or tincture of maral root rhizome at a concentration of 10 ml/l each.

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} recent {{experimental}} and modeling studies {{that attempt to}} define the physiological context in which high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation increases epithelial cancer risk and the efficiency with which it does so. <b>Radiation</b> <b>carcinogenesis</b> is a two-compartment problem: ionizing radiation can alter genomic sequence {{as a result of}} damage due to targeted effects (TE) from the interaction of energy and DNA; it can also alter phenotype and multicellular interactions that contribute to cancer by poorly understood non-targeted effects (NTE). Rather than being secondary to DNA damage and mutations that can initiate cancer, radiation NTE create the critical context in which to promote cancer. Systems biology modeling using compre-hensive experimental data that integrates different levels of biological organization and time-scales is a means of identifying the key processes underlying the carcinogenic potential of high-LET radiation. We hypothesize that inflammation is a key process, and thus cancer susceptibility will depend on specific genetic predispos-ition to the type and duration of this response. Systems genetics using novel mouse models can be used to identify such determinants of susceptibility to cancer in radiation sensitive tissues following high-LET radi-ation.

40|$|Studies of <b>radiation</b> <b>carcinogenesis</b> {{in animals}} allow {{detailed}} investigation {{of how the}} risk depends on age at exposure and time since exposure and of the mechanisms that determine this risk, e. g., induction of new pre-malignant cells (initiation) and enhanced proliferation of already existing pre-malignant cells (promotion). To assist the interpretation of these patterns, we apply a newly developed biologically based mathematical model to data on several types of solid tumors induced by acute whole-body radiation in mice. The model includes both initiation and promotion and analyzes pre-malignant cell dynamics on two different time scales: comparatively short-term during irradia-tion and long-term during the entire life span. Our results suggest general mechanistic similarities between <b>radiation</b> <b>carcinogenesis</b> in mice and in human atomic bomb survivors. The excess relative risk (ERR) in mice decreases with age at exposure up to an exposure age of 1 year, which corresponds to mid-adulthood in humans; the pattern for older ages at exposure, {{for which there is}} some evidence of increasing ERRs in atomic bomb survivors, cannot be evaluated using the data set analyzed here.

50|$|A {{carcinogen}} is any substance, radionuclide, or <b>radiation</b> {{that promotes}} <b>carcinogenesis,</b> {{the formation of}} cancer. This {{may be due to}} the ability to damage the genome or to the disruption of cellular metabolic processes.

Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke. Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances.

When the rats were sacrificed at the 12 th or 21 st week, the incidence of GST-P+ foci induction by radiation alone was very low. The neutron was more sensitive than the gamma ray at week 12 and the reverse phenomenon was observed in the groups at week 21. PB combination showed an increased incidence of GST-P+ foci in gamma ray irradiated groups. The neutron irradiation combined with PB did not show any significant difference compared with the corresponding PB untreated groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hairless mice that {{ingested}} arsenite {{in drinking}} water exhibited more than a 5 -fold enhancement of ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> (UVR) <b>carcinogenesis,</b> whereas arsenite alone was carcinogenically inactive. Dietary organoselenium blocked the cancer enhancement effect of arsenic but not cancer induction by UVR. OBJECTIVE: In this study we sought to explain selenium blockage of As enhancement by establishing the extent that As and Se tissue distributions are coincident or divergent. METHODS: We used the X-ray fluorescence microprobe at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) to probe sections of skin and liver from hairless mice exposed to a) UVR, b) UVR + As, c) UVR + organoselenium, or d) UVR + As + organoselenium.

50|$|MRI and {{computed}} tomography (CT) are complementary imaging technologies {{and each has}} advantages and limitations for particular applications. CT is more widely used than MRI in OECD countries {{with a mean of}} 132 vs. 46 exams per 1000 population performed respectively. A concern is the potential for CT to contribute to radiation-induced cancer and in 2007 it was estimated that 0.4% of current cancers in the United States were due to CTs performed in the past, and that in the future this figure may rise to 1.5-2% based on historical rates of CT usage. An Australian study found that one in every 1800 CT scans was associated with an excess cancer. An advantage of MRI is that no ionizing radiation is used and so it is recommended over CT when either approach could yield the same diagnostic information. Although the cost of MRI has fallen, making it more competitive with CT, there are not many common imaging scenarios in which MRI can simply replace CT, however, this substitution has been suggested for the imaging of liver disease. The effect of low doses of <b>radiation</b> on <b>carcinogenesis</b> also are disputed. Although MRI is associated with biological effects, these have not been proven to cause measurable harm.|$|R

Children are at the highest risk from <b>radiation</b> induced <b>carcinogenesis</b> and therefore dosimetry for paediatric CT recipients is essential in addressing the ionising radiation health risks of CT scanning. However, there is no well-defined method in the clinical environment for routinely and reliably performing paediatric CT organ dosimetry and there are numerous methods utilised for estimating paediatric CT effective dose. Therefore, in this study, eleven computational methods for organ dosimetry and/or effective dose calculation were investigated and compared with absorbed doses measured using thermoluminescent dosemeters placed in a physical anthropomorphic phantom representing a 10 year old child. Three common clinical paediatric CT protocols including brain, chest and abdomen/pelvis examinations were evaluated.

Differences in cell type, interindividual genetic differences and crosstalk occurring between signaling pathways may help to channel radiation stress signals between cell cycle delay, enhanced DNA repair, and apoptosis. These differences may in turn help determine the likelihood of late effects of <b>radiation</b> exposure, including <b>carcinogenesis</b> and fibrosis. The tools of the postgenomic era enable high-throughput studies of the multiple changes resulting from the interplay of radiation signaling pathways. Gene expression profiling, in parti-cular shows great promise, both in terms of insight into basic molecular mechanisms and for the future hope of biomarker development and individual tailoring of cancer therapy...|$|R
