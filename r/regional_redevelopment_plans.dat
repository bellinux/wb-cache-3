50|$|Once {{second only}} to Sydney’s Circular Quay as the busiest {{commuter}} port in Australia and hosting the largest seaplane airbase in the Southern hemisphere, Shute Harbour has faced many years of uncertainty as most ferry operations have moved to marinas in Airlie Beach. Shute Harbour Transit Facility is managed by the Whitsunday <b>Regional</b> Council. Major <b>redevelopment</b> <b>plans</b> for the facility have been flagged due to ageing infrastructure, however much uncertainty exists {{with the nature of}} these plans. There are regular bus and taxi services available to and from the port which take the winding road through Conway National Park towards the harbour.|$|R
