5|$|This {{ended in}} 1861, when a <b>reed</b> <b>organ</b> was {{purchased}} for Epsom Chapel, sparking a disagreement {{over the use}} of musical instruments in worship. A minority opposed to the idea joined the southern-leaning Methodist Protestant Church, withdrawing from Epsom Chapel to worship at Towson's Odd Fellows Hall during the Civil War. In 1867, the Methodist Protestants returned to Epsom Chapel, but met separately on Sunday afternoons.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{analysis}} the music scholar Jane Glover has divided Monteverdi's list of instruments into three main groups: strings, brass and continuo, with a few further items not easily classifiable. The strings grouping is formed from ten members of the violin family (viole da brazzo), two double basses (contrabassi de viola), and two small violins (violini piccoli alla francese). The viole da brazzo are in two five-part ensembles, each comprising two violins, two violas and a cello. The brass group contains four or five trombones (sackbuts), three trumpets and two cornetts. The continuo forces include two harpsichords (duoi gravicembani), a double harp (arpa doppia), two or three chitarroni, two pipe organs (organi di legno), three bass viola da gamba, and a regal or small <b>reed</b> <b>organ.</b> Outside of these groupings are two recorders (flautini alla vigesima secunda), and possibly one or more citterns—unlisted by Monteverdi, but included in instructions relating {{to the end of}} act 4.|$|E

500|$|A Llwybr Llaethog remix of [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] is {{included}} on the DVD version of Rings Around The World.

500|$|Free reed aerophone: The musical {{pipe organ}} {{employing}} metal piston bellows {{had a long}} history in the West, dating back to the Hellenistic period. However, the Western pipe organ did not make use of the reed, which the ancient Chinese mouth organ employed. The latter instrument, called a sheng and made traditionally of bamboo pipes, was first mentioned in the Shi Jing of the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC). The Chinese sheng is considered the ancestor of the harmonica, harmonium, concertina, accordion, and [...] A free <b>reed</b> <b>organ</b> was invented in the Arab world in the 13th century, while the German organ builder Heinrich Traxdorf (fl. 15th century) of Nuremberg built one around 1460 AD.

2500|$|The Great Peace of Montreal was in 1701 {{signed by}} the Governor of New France, {{representing}} King Louis XIV, and the chiefs of 39 First Nations. Then, in 1710, Aboriginal leaders were visiting personally with the British monarch; in that year, Queen Anne held audience at St. James' Palace with three Mohawk—Sa Ga Yeath Qua Pieth Tow of the Bear Clan (called Peter Brant, King of Maguas), Ho Nee Yeath Taw No Row of the Wolf Clan (called King John of Canojaharie), and Tee Yee Ho Ga Row, or [...] "Double Life", of the Wolf Clan (called King Hendrick Peters)—and one Mahicanin Chief—Etow Oh Koam of the Turtle Clan (called Emperor of the Six Nations). The four, dubbed the Four Mohawk Kings, were received in London as diplomats, being transported through the streets in royal carriages and visiting the Tower of London and St. Paul's Cathedral. But, their business was to request military aid for defence against the French, as well as missionaries for spiritual guidance. The latter request was passed by Anne to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Tenison, and a chapel was eventually built in 1711 at Fort Hunter, near present day Johnstown, New York, along with the gift of a <b>reed</b> <b>organ</b> {{and a set of}} silver chalices in 1712.|$|E
50|$|Alois Straub (1826 Baden, Germany - 1883) was a {{manufacturer}} of <b>reed</b> <b>organs.</b> He learned cabinet making and worked with the manufacturing of musical instruments in Germany before emigrating to the United States in 1849. Straub settled in Akron, Ohio, and, from about 1852 to 1856, made organs for H.B. Horton (Henry Bishop Horton; 1819-1885).

[...] He had alterations made by sculptor and designer friend Gordon Newell to the Kithara sketches he had made in England. [...] After taking some woodworking courses in 1938, he built his first Kithara at Big Sur, California, at a scale of roughly twice the size of Schlesinger's.
