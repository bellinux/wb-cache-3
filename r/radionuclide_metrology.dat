40|$|ABSTRACT. Liquid {{scintillation}} counting (LSC) {{is widely}} used for the standardization of radionuclides either by direct activity measurement using the triple-to-double coincidence ratio method or by efficiency tracing using the CIEMAT/NIST method (Grau Malonda and Coursey 1988). The calculation of the detection efficiency requires knowing {{the amount of energy}} transferred to the liquid scintillator. For radionuclide-emitting photons, the energy transferred to the scintillator must be calculated, and this calculation requires a precise knowledge of the photon absorption coefficients. These coefficients are generally evaluated from databases, but, even for well-characterized materials, the relative uncertainty on these coefficients can be higher than 10 % at low energy. Moreover, the precise composition of commercial LS cocktails is generally unknown, {{and the only way to}} improve the accuracy of the calculation is to measure these linear absorption coefficients. These meas-urements were undertaken at LNHB using an adjustable monoenergetic X-ray source, the SOLEX (Source of Low-Energy X-rays) (Bonnelle et al. 2004) facility. The LS cocktail is introduced into a specific cell with beryllium windows placed in the collimated X-ray beam. The flux is measured with and without the presence of the LS cocktail using a silicon X-ray detector, and the linear absorption coefficient is calculated from the ratio of the incident and transferred flux with the Beer-Lambert law. This paper describes the experiment and presents the results obtained for toluene and also for 2 commercial LS cocktails widely used in <b>radionuclide</b> activity <b>metrology...</b>|$|R

However, in most cases fluctuations associated with counting statistics can be reduced using sufficient computing power. Cross-section data have intrinsic uncertainties that induce correlations when apparently independent codes are compared. Their effect on the uncertainty of the estimated parameter is difficult to determine and varies widely from case to case.

40|$|The {{discipline}} of <b>radionuclide</b> <b>metrology</b> at national standards institutes started in 1913 with the certification by Curie, Rutherford and Meyer {{of the first}} primary standards of radium. In the early years, radium was a valuable commodity and {{the aim of the}} standards was largely to facilitate trade. The focus later changed to providing standards for the new wide range of radionuclides, so that radioactivity could be used for healthcare and industrial applications while minimising the risk to patients, workers and the environment. National measurement institutes responded to the changing demands by developing new techniques for realising primary standards of radioactivity. Looking ahead, there are likely to be demands for standards for new radionuclides used in nuclear medicine, an expansion of the scope of the field into quantitative imaging to facilitate accurate patient dosimetry for nuclear medicine, and an increasing need for accurate standards for radioactive waste management and nuclear forensics.

40|$|The 230 U decay series, {{coupled to}} target-selective carrier molecules, has been {{identified}} as a candidate tool for targeted alpha therapy (TAT). The alpha branching ratios, half-lives and energies for the major peaks of 230 U and its progenies have been deduced from only few experiments performed more than three decades ago. It was necessary to up-date these fundamental nuclear data and perform more accurate radiometric measurements that needed high quality 230 U alpha sources. The objective of this work was to prepare 230 U alpha sources with excellent spectral properties - high resolution, low tailing - and relatively high specific activity in order to accurately determine the relative alpha emission probabilities and half-lives via high-resolution alpha-particle spectrometry. The demands for source quality in <b>radionuclide</b> <b>metrology</b> are much higher than in applied spectrometry, e. g. for environmental analysis or geological studies.

The goals of the comparison were to (1) study differences in calculation results from different TDCR analysis programs, (2) investigate differences in analysis techniques and uncertainty assessment philosophies between laboratories, and (3) study the effect of not taking asymmetry of photomultiplier tube (PMT) efficiencies into account on the calculated activity To achieve this, a single set of TDCR data for the pure beta emitter 99 Tc, was distributed to the participants, who analyzed the data according to their normal procedures and report the activity concentration of the 99 Tc solution from their results. The {{results indicate that the}} presently used programs are generally able to calculate the same activity values, assuming that the correct input parameters are used and that not taking PMT asymmetry into account in the calculations can lead to significant (0. 6 % for 99 Tc) errors in reported results.

In 1924 H. Geiger and A.

40|$|General purpose, widely {{distributed}} Monte Carlo simulations for radiation transport have found many {{applications in the}} fields of <b>radionuclide</b> <b>metrology,</b> detector research and nuclear medicine. A full evaluation of the uncertainties due to the simulation of physical quantities and correction factors is required for model validation, uncertainty analysis and quality assurance, yet this evaluation is rarely explicitly carried out. The decay of the most important gamma and x-ray emissions of 123 I and 54 Mn in the ANSTO Triple-to-Double Coincidence Ratio (TDCR) liquid scintillation detector have been simulated using the radiation transport code Geant 4. The energy deposition spectrum in the scintillant and the interaction probability for each emission has been determined. Both of these calculated quantities are required for an absolute activity measurement of these nuclides using the TDCR method. A sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the simulation model with respect to these output parameters has been carried out and is presented here. The uncertainty in the simulation results due to the input parameter uncertainties was found to be several times larger than the statistical uncertainty component for a typical number of simulated decay events. The scintillant volume was the most sensitive input parameter to produce changes in the output quantities studied, indicating that the minimization of the uncertainty of this parameter would be most beneficial for reducing the uncertainty of the simulation outputs. The scintillant density and composition were also important, which is significant as the uncertainties associated with these input parameters are generally not well known. Estimates of the relative uncertainty associated with the simulation outputs due to the combined stochastic and input uncertainties are provided. Slovak Institute of Metrolog...|$|E

In Task 1 reference materials and standard sources for segregation of materials and for free release measurements needed to be produced and characterised. From a standard solution a mother dilution was made to obtain a solution with an activity concentration of around 100 Bq per 20 μL. The solution was dispensed in the cavity of 1120 metallic source holders making use of a precision pattern dispenser. After evaporation of the liquid, the cavity of the CMI source holders was mechanically closed. Before and during the source preparation, check sources in the shape of aluminium pills were produced in order to monitor the stability of the activity concentration of the mother solution. The activity of all the sources was determined by gamma-ray spectroscopic measurements using a NaI-well detector. Some outliers were identified and 1100 sources with certified activity content were selected and made available for further use in Work Package 2 of the project. On the basis of the activity calculations it can be stated that sources were successfully prepared according to the specifications and will be used as calibration standards for the calibration of a free release measurement facility to measure radioactive waste. They can also be used as calibration standard for the calibration of waste segregation facilities. One of the deliverables in the task was to develop a reference material for the calibration of a free release facility and testing facility for segregation of waste. The sources are in the form of 1100 steel and 1100 plastic balls with point sources of 152 Eu and 60 Co inside. The task of RN was to produce and standardise the 1100 60 Co point sources in a form of metal holders containing around 100 Bq of 60 Co each. These metallic source holders can be inserted in metallic or plastic balls in order to simulate contaminated waste.
