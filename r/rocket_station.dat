50|$|During the Cold War {{there was}} a radar station on the Kandrich for a Nike Hercules Rocket unit based near Dichtelbach. In 1982 this weapon system was {{replaced}} by Patriot air defence rockets, which were then based at the Kandrich in newly built positions. These positions have been largely renaturalised - only earth ramparts are still visible. On the forme Patriot <b>rocket</b> <b>station</b> there are now three wind generators.|$|E
50|$|The Rocket Tower {{situated}} at Cowden's yard on the Kilkeel side of Annalong is a listed building. Despite being derelict {{it is believed}} to be the only <b>rocket</b> <b>station</b> remaining in Ireland. The tower housed the pigeons which were used as couriers between the Coastguard stations and the garage housed a rocket launcher which fired ropes to boats which ran aground during the smuggling in the 18th-19th centuries.|$|E

5000|$|Herman Potočnik was {{the first}} to publish the concept of placing a {{geosynchronous}} satellite in geostationary orbit, in 1928. [...] Arthur C. Clarke popularized this concept even further in 1945, in a paper entitled [...] "Extra-Terrestrial Relays — Can <b>Rocket</b> <b>Stations</b> Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?", published in Wireless World magazine. [...] Clarke described the concept as useful for communications satellites.|$|R
50|$|Following Dawseys death {{a meeting}} was held, {{presided over by}} the Mayor of Douglas, at which {{it was decided that}} a {{monument}} was to be erected in his memory through public subscription.The monument was erected by W. Cathcart of Glasgow and is made of Aberdeen granite. It was originally a drinking fountain and water trough with the water issuing from the mouth of a stone lion. In the panel above the lion is a sculpture typifying one of Dawseys rescues. Originally situated at the apex of the Pier Buildings on the Victoria Pier the monument was unveiled by the Deputy Governor of the Isle of Man, Deemster Thomas Kneen, on Thursday 8 June 1905. Numerous civic dignitaries were in attendance and {{during the course of the}} ceremony two certificates from the Royal Humane Society were awarded to Samuel Webb, in recognition for his rescue of a young boy whos fallen into the sea off Douglas Promenade, and to G. Cowin for rescuing an elderly lady from Douglas Harbour. At the moment of the unveiling salutes were fired from the Douglas <b>Rocket</b> <b>Station</b> and Douglas Head Lighthouse.|$|E

2500|$|Clarke {{contributed to}} the {{popularity}} of the idea that geostationary satellites would be ideal telecommunications relays. [...] He first described this {{in a letter to the}} editor of Wireless World in February 1945 and elaborated on the concept in a paper titled Extra-Terrestrial Relays – Can <b>Rocket</b> <b>Stations</b> Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?, published in Wireless World in October 1945. The geostationary orbit is now sometimes known as the Clarke Orbit or the Clarke Belt in his honour.|$|R

40|$|The diurnal {{component}} in meridional wind is estimated for each season at twelve <b>rocket</b> <b>stations.</b> Amplitudes and phases {{are presented as}} a function of height-latitude or as vertical profiles. Many of the gross features of the tide persist throughout the year, but as they migrate in height and latitude the amplitude or phase at a given location may undergo large changes with season. Longitudinal variations in the diurnal tide are found in the mid-stratosphere, and it is suggested they are coupled with longitudinal variations in the tropospheric temperature structure...|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} reopened again in August 1959 by the US Army {{as part of}} its network of {{sounding}} <b>rocket</b> <b>stations.</b> In September 1959 it was used to test CARDE's new solid fuel propellant systems with PVT-1, the vehicle that would evolve into the Black Brant. However, in late 1960 a fire destroyed many of the facilities. It was announced that the Black Brant test series would be continued with an additional twelve launches at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility during 1961-62, while the facilities at Churchill were rebuilt.|$|R
