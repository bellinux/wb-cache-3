40|$|Introduction: Fire {{is one of}} the fearful and morbid {{accident}} {{for each}} of members in the <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> team and important destructive accidents for each surgery patient that may occur during surgery. This study has been carried out to evaluate awareness of <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> staff about fire sources and its prevention methods in <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> Methods and Materials: In this cross-sectional study a number of 48 persons of <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> staff from Shahroud Imam Hossein and Fatemiyeh hospitals were chosen and their awareness about fire sources (ignition Sources, oxygen sources and fuel sources) and ways of fire prevention in <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> were assessed using designed questionnaire related to prevention and fire safety in the <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> Mean of participation’s awareness about above-mentioned fields, upon 0 - 100 was divided to three levels: poor, intermediate and good. The data were analyzed using SPSS, software. Results: Based on the results, 97. 9 % of participants declare that educational program related to prevention and fire safety in <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> is necessary and all of them told these programs are useful and important. 85. 4 % of participants declare that never passed any educational course related to prevention and fire safety in <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> Mean of participation’s awareness about prevention and fire safety in <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> was estimated 15. 7 in anesthesiologist, 13. 1 <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> technicians, 12. 4 anesthesia technicians and 10. 9 surgeons. In general 60. 4 % of <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> staff had intermediate awareness, 33. 3 % poor awareness and 6. 3 % good awareness about fire and its prevention in <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> Conclusion: According to the results, unfortunately majority of <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> staff are not aware of fire sources and its prevention methods in <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> Thus further research for improving awareness of <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> staff about prevention and control of fire in <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> is recommended...|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of the <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurse is hidden from most nurses and patients behind {{the doors of the}} theatre suite. This 'hidden' world, shrouds <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nursing practice in an air of mystery. Nurses outside the <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> may only guess at how the day to day reality of nursing practice in the <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> is constructed. The role of the <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurse is described within the literature as having a 'perioperative' focus which encompasses <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nursing care throughout the patient's experience of surgery. The question driving this thesis asks <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses how they describe their practice and explores the day to day {{practice of}} these nurses through the stories they tell. Using an ethnographic methodology, six <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses share their stories which depict their understandings of the nurse's role in the <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> and communicate their experiences of practice. Within the data chapters the nurses tell stories of coming to theatre and their understandings {{of the role of the}} <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurse. With the exception of one nurse, the understandings of the nurses in the focus group contrast sharply with the notions of the 'perioperative' role contained within the professional literature. The second of the data chapters focuses on the stories the nurses tell of their experiences in <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nursing practice. The stories communicate the biomedical influence on nursing practice in the <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> as the nurses' views of the 'object body' are revealed. The nurse's role is also exposed to be a series of tasks which are directed to the support of the surgical team...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{illuminate}} <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses´ skills in managing unexpected events in the <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> Background: <b>Operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses are working in a high-tech, high-risk environment where unexpected events are common. <b>Operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses are responsible for acting fast and correctly on these occasions; in order to sustain patients´ safety, prevent major complications and secure a successful outcome. Method: Four focus group interviews with 23 <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses working in two Norwegian hospitals were conducted. A method of systematic text condensation developed by Malterud was used to analyze the data. Findings: The main theme that emerged in the interpretation of the interviews was: being prepared for the unexpected. Four sub- themes were identified: being in control, flexibility and improvisation, teamwork and professional confidence. Conclusion: <b>Operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses tried to be prepared to manage all kinds of unexpected events in the <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> Comprehensive knowledge and experience, technical-, cognitive- and social skills enabled <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses to manage these events, which increased their personal and professional confidence...|$|R

40|$|Five {{hundred and}} twenty-five primary arthroscopic {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction cases were retrospectively evaluated at our hospital with respect to <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> time, <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> cost, and hospital charges. Three main areas were financially analyzed: outpatient vs inpatient surgery, meniscus tears, and ACL grafting techniques. Patients who had their surgery done as an outpatient had, on average, a 21 -minute faster <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> time, a $ 477 lower <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> cost, and an $ 840 lower hospital charge per case compared with patients who were admitted overnight (P = 0. 001). Surprisingly, {{no statistically significant difference}} in <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> time or <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> cost was detected in ACL surgeries involving partial meniscectomy or meniscus repair compared with ACL surgeries without meniscus tears. When examining the 2 most popular ACL grafting techniques, 4 -strand hamstring graft cases were, on average, 23 minutes faster, had $ 565 lower <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> costs, and had $ 1015 lower hospital charges compared with bone–patella tendon–bone cases (P = 0. 001). <b>Operating</b> <b>room</b> time is a significant component of the overall cost of and charges for ACL surgery, and the 23 -minute faster hamstring technique produced more savings than outpatient surgery...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{has been carried out}} in order to determine anger expression and anger management styles in <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses. By applying an in-depth interview technique on <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses working in a private hospital, a qualitative study has been performed in order to determine anger expression and anger management styles in <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses. The interview consisted of ten questions such as demographic questions addressing the workers’ age, sex, education level and duration of employment in the organization they work, aiming to determine their anger expression and anger management styles. Since <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> environments contain various risk factors, and require active team work in a stressful dynamic setting under excessive workload,, it has been found that <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> nurses display their anger through loud speaking, fail to settle their anger positively, fail to control their anger in a behavioural pattern despite their cognitive awareness in anger management.

Thus, this study aimed to compare the trace concentrations of the inhalational anesthetics isoflurane and sevoflurane in <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> with and without central scavenging system. Method Waste concentrations of isoflurane and sevoflurane were measured by infrared analyzer at different locations (near the respiratory area of the assistant nurse and anesthesiologist and near the anesthesia station) and at two times (30 and 120 min after the start of surgery) in both <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> types. Results All isoflurane and sevoflurane concentrations in unscavenged <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> were higher than the US recommended limit (2 parts per million), regardless of the location and time evaluated. In scavenged <b>operating</b> <b>room,</b> the average concentrations of isoflurane were within the limit of exposure, except for the measurements near the anesthesia station, regardless of the measurement times. For sevoflurane, concentrations exceeded the limit value at all measurement locations and at both times. Conclusions The exposure to both anesthetics exceeded the international limit in unscavenged <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> In scavenged <b>operating</b> <b>room,</b> the concentrations of sevoflurane, {{and to a lesser extent}} those of isoflurane, exceeded the recommended limit value.
