50|$|The {{first race}} started from Southampton in September 1992 with 10 {{identical}} 67 ft boats sailed by a skipper and 13 crew. There {{were a number}} of serious <b>rigging</b> <b>screw</b> failures in the Southern Ocean and British Steel II , after the initial success of winning the first leg of the race, was dismasted in mid-Southern Ocean, but managed to motorsail safely to Hobart under jury rig. She was re-rigged in time to rejoin the race for the next leg to Cape Town.|$|E
50|$|Project Title: Male Elephant Building Location: Sydney, Australia Owner: Taronga Zoo Architect: Jackson Teece Year of construction: 2009 Taronga Zoo {{features}} Structural Dynamic’s ‘Strudyna’ 16.0mm 1 X 19 {{stainless wire}} strand together with AM swage toggles and PBI rigging screws. The PBI range of rigging screws {{were selected because}} of their bronze inserts and large surface area locking nuts, giving the maintenance staff the ability to adjust the tensions when needed. A very simple but effective system customised to match the required breaking strength of the compound design with the redesigned swage studs for the <b>rigging</b> <b>screw</b> bodies.|$|E
50|$|Rigging- wire or rod {{used to hold}} up a mast. Since the 1960s {{stainless}} steel wire has become universal in the developed world. Elsewhere galvanized wire or even rope may be used because of its availability and cheapness.3 types of {{stainless steel}} wire are commonly used. Type 1 x 19 is a non-flexible wire used for standing rigging such as stays. Type 7 x 7 is a semi flexible wire used for luff wires in sails, halyards (sometimes plastic coated) trapeze wires and light halyards. Type 7 x 19 is used for all halyards, wire sheets, vangs and strops that must run through a pulley (sheave). The common way of attaching wire is to form a small loop at the end which is fixed in place by clamping a soft metal swage over the free ends. Talurite is a common brand of swagging. The wire loop is then fastened to a <b>rigging</b> <b>screw</b> with a bow shackle to the chain plate. Kevlar rope is sometimes used in place of wire in small sailboats.|$|E
6000|$|... "I feel rather {{dull and}} think I won't go ashore. Perhaps {{you had better}} stay, Bob, and we'll fit the new <b>rigging</b> <b>screws.</b> The others look as if the hooks might draw in a hard breeze." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nicolas Baudin is {{reported}} {{as being the}} first European to describe the islet, however he did not name the islet. The islet was surveyed in May 1838 by HMS Pelorus {{under the command of}} Captain Francis Harding RN. It {{is reported}} that Harding named the islet after the ship. [...] The Pelorus Islet is reported as being the site of the wrecking of You Yangs on 14 June 1890. You Yangs was a 672 gross tonnage barque <b>rigged</b> <b>screw</b> steamer owned by Howard Smith and Sons.|$|R
5000|$|A mafer {{is a tool}} used in filmmaking {{to secure}} lights or <b>rigging.</b> Cam <b>screw</b> tightening, {{mounting}} attachments include: baby stud or flex arm. In addition to this, mafers have a padded grip surface which combine one flat jaw and a v-notched jaw.|$|R
25|$|SS Ellengowan was a {{schooner}} <b>rigged,</b> single <b>screw</b> steamer {{built by}} Akers Mekaniske Verksted in Christiania (Oslo) Norway, under her original name, Nøkken. The vessel was powered by sail and a vertical direct acting steam engine. Ellengowan sank at its moorings, unmanned, {{during the night}} of 27 April 1888 in Port Darwin and was abandoned. 103 years later, in 1991, she was discovered by divers making it the oldest known shipwreck in Darwin Harbour.|$|R
50|$|Fairlie {{brought a}} number of other {{innovative}} and highly effective features to the design. For instance, the forestay is bolted right through the hull and secured with a bolt hidden at the centre of a bronze casting of a thistle which becomes a feature of the bow. The shrouds and backstay are secured to u-bolts through the deck, eliminating the need for <b>rigging</b> <b>screws.</b> The u-bolts provide a compression packing that can be screwed down tight, and owners report that they seldom leak. The deck is moulded with a lip that turns up to fit inside the hull moulding, and after being glued and glassed in, the join is covered with a custom-designed vinyl moulding that eliminates the common problem of deck/hull leaks, and also serves as a practical rubbing strake. The mast is deck-stepped on an aluminium channel that sits above the two main internal bulkheads - a solution that allows easy passage below decks to the forecabin, while ensuring a solid base for the mast. Many of the boats were delivered with an outboard engine that was mounted in a cutout in the rear cockpit bench seat and could be removed and stowed below the cockpit - a configuration that was later adopted in other production yachts. These models were also delivered with an arch in the companionway cutout instead of a sliding hatchway, thus simplifying construction, retaining bulkhead strength and removing another possible source of leaks.|$|R
50|$|She was {{an early}} example of a screw-propelled vessel, though she also possessed a fully {{functional}} sail <b>rig,</b> and her <b>screw</b> could be feathered when she was required to travel under sail. This operation could be conducted within 7 minutes from stopping the engines. The screw could also be raised for inspection while at sea if required. During trials she {{turned out to be}} a fine sailer, achieving a speed of 10 kn.|$|R
40|$|Subject of investigation: {{development}} of {{the design of the}} <b>rig</b> of a <b>screw</b> submersible pump with a surface drive for enhancing the effectiveness of operation of wells with complicated conditions. Analytical dependences are obtained for pressure losses for the hydraulic resistance in the screw hyrotor-type pump, and for the maximum permissible rotational speed of the rotor, which interconnect the technological and operational factors. Consideration is given to the energy balance of the rig. The investigation deals with the influence of the fluid viscosity on the pump characteristic with a kinetic ratio of 9 : 10. Field tests of the <b>rig</b> of the <b>screw</b> submersible pump with the surface drive were carried out. The production prototype of the screw submersible pump with the surface drive is put into use. The positive results of the tests were appropriately certified. The use of the developed rigs makes it possible to reduce the cost of the production of high-viscosity oil with a high sand and gas content from shallow wells and from low-production wells.

50|$|HMS Orlando was a Mersey-class wooden-hulled steam-powered (although fully <b>rigged</b> with sails) <b>screw</b> frigate {{built for}} the Royal Navy from 1856 to 1858 but not {{commissioned}} until 1861. Orlando and her sister ship Mersey were the longest wooden warships {{built for the}} Royal Navy. At 336 feet in length, Orlando was nearly twice the length of Victory, the flagship of Admiral Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar. At 5,643 tons displacement, she was certainly a large and impressive looking ship in her day. She was heavily armed, and in comparison to many of her counterparts was quite fast with an approximate speed of 12½ knots, achieving 13½ on trials.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{started when}} Grant McIntire and Andrew Champion {{were at a}} coffee shop {{complaining}} {{about the state of}} the local music scene and their friend Shea Walters walked up and told them to, [...] "Stop whining and start their own band". Grant and Andrew had been in two bands previously and had been friends since grade school when Grant moved to the Bay Area from New York. Doug Sangalang was playing at the time with Jesse Michaels (of Operation Ivy) current project, Big <b>Rig,</b> and joined <b>Screw</b> 32 a few weeks into the bands rehearsal endeavors and resulted as a key role in sculpting Screw 32's melodic blend of D.C.-style hardcore and L.A. punk. Jimi Cheetah and Josh Kilbourn were the original rhythm section.|$|R
