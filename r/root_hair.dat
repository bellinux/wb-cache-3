5|$|The {{occurrence}} of Boletopsis nothofagi {{seems to be}} strongly connected to the {{occurrence of}} the southern beech Nothofagus fusca, a species of Fagales that is endemic to New Zealand. B.nothofagi has been found exclusively in N.fusca forests spread through New Zealand below 37° S. The fungus forms a mycorrhizal association with the trees of N.fusca, in which the hyphae of the fungal mycelium wrap around {{the roots of the}} tree and penetrate the cortex, but not its cells. Subsequently, B.nothofagi takes over the function of the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> and directs water and soil nutrients to the tree. In return, the fungus can, through contact with the root tissue, access the products of the tree's photosynthesis. The fruit bodies of the species have so far always been found in May, the end of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|When dissected, the {{arrangement}} of the cells in a root is <b>root</b> <b>hair,</b> epidermis, epiblem, cortex, endodermis, pericycle and, lastly, the vascular tissue in the centre of a root to transport the water absorbed by the root to other places of the plant.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{encapsulating}} {{nature of}} the mantle, {{the root of the}} plant symbiont is often affected developmentally. EcM fungal partners characteristically suppress <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> development of the host plant with which they are involved. Also, through the induction of altered levels of cytokinins in the phytosymbiont, root branching can be increased. These branching patterns can become so extensive that a single consolidated mantle can envelop many root tips at a time, yielding tuberculate or coralloid ectomycorrhizas.|$|E

40|$|<b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> are tubular {{extensions}} {{from the}} root surface that expand by tip growth. This highly focused type of cell expansion, combined with position of <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> {{on the surface}} of the root, makes them ideal cells for microscopic observation. This chapter describes the method that is routinely used in our laboratory for live cell imaging of Arabidopsis <b>root</b> <b>hairs...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> {{are also}} vital in the {{development}} of nodules in legumes. The <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> curl around the bacteria which allows for the formation of an infection thread through into the dividing cortical cells to form the nodule.|$|R
25|$|In some cases, the {{addition}} of fungal exudates alone partially mimicked {{the effect of the}} mantle in terms of root proliferation, <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> development and dichotomous branching. Some of these exudates act synergistically upon hyphal morphology, as with rutin (a flavonol) and zeatin (a cytokinin). However, some other metabolites act antagonistically, demonstrated by root development stemming from the release of hypaphorine and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). IAA must be tightly regulated in ectomycorrhizal symbioses due to its ability to inhibit root development above certain concentrations.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which mycorrhizae increase absorption include some that are physical and some that are chemical. Physically, most mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root or <b>root</b> <b>hair,</b> and thus can explore soil material that roots and root hairs cannot reach, and provide a larger surface area for absorption. Chemically, the cell membrane chemistry of fungi {{differs from that of}} plants. For example, they may secrete organic acid that dissolve or chelate many ions, or release them from minerals by ion exchange. Mycorrhizae are especially beneficial for the plant partner in nutrient-poor soils.|$|E
25|$|Unlike passive transport, {{which uses}} the kinetic energy and natural entropy of {{molecules}} moving down a gradient, active transport uses cellular energy {{to move them}} against a gradient, polar repulsion, or other resistance. Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs, such as ions, glucose and amino acids. If the process uses chemical energy, such as from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it is termed primary active transport. Secondary active transport {{involves the use of}} an electrochemical gradient. Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cells of plants.|$|E
40|$|Both arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungi and <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> play {{important roles}} in plant uptake of water and mineral nutrients. To reveal {{the relative importance of}} mycorrhiza and <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> in plant water relations, a bald root barley (brb) mutant and its wild type (wt) were grown with or without inoculation of the AM fungus Rhizophagus intraradices under well-watered or drought conditions, and plant physiological traits relevant to drought stress resistance were recorded. The experimental results indicated that the AM fungus could almost compensate for the absence of <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> under drought-stressed conditions. Moreover, phosphorus (P) concentration, leaf water potential, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency were significantly increased by R. intraradices but not by <b>root</b> <b>hairs,</b> except for shoot P concentration and photosynthetic rate under the drought condition. <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> even significantly decreased root P concentration under drought stresses. These results confirm that AM fungi can enhance plant drought tolerance by improvement of P uptake and plant water relations, which subsequently promote plant photosynthetic performance and growth, while <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> presumably contribute to the improvement of plant growth and photosynthetic capacity through an increase in shoot P concentration...|$|R

Transgenic poplars constitutively overexpressing AaXEG 2 grown {{in a field}} also had reduced xyloglucan content and had fewer <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> than wild-type poplars (Kaida et al., unpublished data). <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> are important for plant to uptake nutrients and water from soil. Therefore, reduction of {{the growth rate of}} the transgenic poplars in the field trial is thought to be associated with decreased <b>root</b> <b>hairs.</b> The ratio of branch mass to aboveground mass of the transgenic lines was significantly lower than that of wild-type trees in the present study (Table  2). These lower ratios of branch mass might be also associated with the low growth capacity of transgenic poplars.|$|R
40|$|Lipochitooligosaccharides, Nod factors {{secreted}} by Rhizobium bacteria, are signal {{molecules that}} induce deformation of <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> of their host plant.

500|$|The {{complex is}} found in {{cellular}} regions characterized by dynamic actin filament activity: in macropinocytic cups, in {{the leading edge of}} motile cells (lamellipodia), and in motile actin patches in yeast. In mammals and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum [...] it is required for phagocytosis. The complex has also been shown {{to be involved in the}} establishment of cell polarity and the migration of fibroblast monolayers in a wound-healing model. In mammalian oocytes, the Arp2/3 complex is involved in oocyte asymmetric division and polar body emission, which result from the failure of spindle migration (a unique feature of oocyte division) and cytokinesis. Moreover, enteropathogenic organisms like Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella use the Arp2/3 complex for actin-polymerization- dependent rocketing movements. The Arp2/3 complex also regulates the intracellular motility [...] of endosomes, lysosomes, pinocytic vesicles, and mitochondria. Moreover, recent studies show that the Arp2/3 complex is essential for proper polar cell expansion in plants. Arp2/3 mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana result in abnormal filament organization, which in turn affects the expansion of trichomes, pavement cells, hypocotyl cells, and <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cells.|$|E

2500|$|As in legumes, {{nodulation}} {{is favored}} by nitrogen deprivation and is inhibited by high nitrogen concentrations. Depending {{on the plant}} species, two mechanisms of infection have been described: The first is observed in [...] casuarinas or alders and is called <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> infection. In this case the infection begins with an intracellular infection of a <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> and {{is followed by the}} formation of a primitive symbiotic organ lacking any particular organization, a prenodule. The second mechanism of infection is called intercellular entry and is well described in Discaria species. In this case bacteria penetrate the root extracellularly, growing between epidermal cells then between cortical cells. Later on Frankia becomes intracellular but no prenodule is formed. In both cases the infection leads to cell divisions in the pericycle and the formation of a new organ consisting of several lobes anatomically similar to a lateral root. This organ is the actinorhizal nodule also called actinorhizae. Cortical cells of the nodule are invaded by Frankia filaments coming from the site of infection or the prenodule. Actinorhizal nodules have generally an indeterminate growth, new cells are therefore continually produced at the apex and successively become infected. Mature cells of the nodule are filled with bacterial filaments that actively fix nitrogen.|$|E

Attachment of the rod-shaped bacteria to clover root cells occurred in a polar, end-on fashion. Viable or heat-killed R. trifolii cells precoated with a clover lectin having 2 -deoxyglucose specificity had increased adsorption to clover roots. Adsorption of bacteria to roots was not increased if the clover lectin was inactivated by heat or 2 -deoxyglucose treatment prior to incubation with R. trifolii. Adsorption of R. trifolii to clover <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> was inhibited by 2 -deoxyglucose (30 mM) but not by 2 -deoxygalactose or alpha-D-glucose. Adsorption of R. meliloti cells to alfalfa <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> was not affected by 2 -deoxyglucose at that concentration. These results suggest that expression of host specificity in the Rhizobium-clover symbiosis involves a preferential adsorption of infective cells to clover <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> through a 2 -deoxyglucose-sensitive receptor site...|$|R
30|$|<b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> are tip-growing {{extensions}} {{that arise}} from specialized epidermal cells (Leavitt 1904). They have pivotal roles in taking up nutrients and water from the rhizosphere and serve as sites of interactions with soil microorganisms (Dazzo et al. 1984; Gilroy and Jones 2000). By increasing the external surface area of the roots or interacting with rhizobacteria, <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> directly and indirectly promote plant growth and yield (Curl and Truelove 1986; Bowen and Rovira 1999; Mukerji et al. 2006; Hayat et al. 2010).

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} direct {{evidence}} {{of the importance of}} <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> on pore structure development at the root-soil interface during the early stage of crop establishment. This was achieved by use of high resolution (~ 5 μm) synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SRCT) to visualise both the structure of <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> and the soil pore structure in plant-soil microcosms. Two contrasting genotypes of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), with and without <b>root</b> <b>hairs,</b> were grown for 8 days in microcosms packed with sandy loam soil at 1. 2 g cm- 3 36 dry bulk density. <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> were visualised within air filled pore spaces, but not in the fine-textured soil regions. - We found that the genotype with <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> significantly altered the porosity and connectivity of the detectable pore space (> 5 μm) in the rhizosphere, as compared with the no-hair mutants. Both genotypes showed decreasing pore-space between 0. 8 mm and 0. 1 mm from the root surface. Interestingly the root-hair-bearing genotype had a significantly greater soil pore volume-fraction at the root-soil interface. - Effects of pore structure on diffusion and permeability were estimated to be functionally insignificant under saturated conditions when simulated using image based modelling...|$|R
50|$|<b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> {{cells can}} survive for 2 to 3 weeks and then die off, {{at the same}} time new <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cells are {{continually}} being formed {{at the tip of the}} root.

This ensures equal and efficient distribution of the actual hairs on these cells.|$|E
50|$|Nodules are growths on {{the roots}} of leguminous plants where the {{bacteria}} reside. The plant roots secrete amino acids and sugars into the rhizosphere. The rhizobia move toward the roots and attach to the root hairs. The plant then releases flavanoids, which induce the expression of nod genes within the bacteria. The expression of these genes results {{in the production of}} enzymes called nod factors that initiate <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> curling. During this process, the rhizobia are curled up with the <b>root</b> <b>hair.</b> The rhizobia penetrate the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cells with an infection thread that grows through the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> into the main root. This causes the infected cells to divide and form a nodule. The rhizobia can now begin nitrogen fixation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{formation}} of the symbiotic relationship involves a signal exchange between both partners that leads to mutual recognition and development of symbiotic structures. The most well understood mechanism {{for the establishment of}} this symbiosis is through intracellular infection. Rhizobia are free living in the soil until they are able to sense flavonoids, derivatives of 2-phenyl-1.4-benzopyrone, which are secreted by the roots of their host plant triggering the accumulation of a large population of cells and eventual attachment to root hairs. These flavonoids then promote the DNA binding activity of NodD which belongs to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators and triggers the secretion of nod factors after the bacteria have entered the <b>root</b> <b>hair.</b> [...] Nod factors trigger a series of complex developmental changes inside the <b>root</b> <b>hair,</b> beginning with <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> curling and followed by the {{formation of}} the infection thread, a cellulose lined tube that the bacteria use to travel down through the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> into the root cells. The bacteria then infect several other adjacent root cells. This is followed by continuous cell proliferation resulting in the {{formation of the}} root nodule. A second mechanism, used especially by rhizobia which infect aquatic hosts, is called crack entry. In this case, no <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> deformation is observed. Instead the bacteria penetrate between cells, through cracks produced by lateral root emergence.|$|E
