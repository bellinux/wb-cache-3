40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} conduct risk assessments of complex incentive systems, using {{a case study of}} the normative Peer Review Process (PRP). This research centers on appliances and adaptations of the Conflicting Incentives Risk Analysis (CIRA). First as an approach to Root Cause Analysis of a known incident, and then for a full assessment of the incentives in the PRP together with possible <b>risk</b> <b>treatments.</b> CIRA uses an alternative notion of risk, where risk modeling is in terms of conflicting incentives between the risk owner and the stakeholders concerning the execution of actions. Compared to traditional risk assessment approaches, CIRA provides an insight into the underlying incentives behind a risk, and not just the technical vulnerability, likelihood and consequence. The main contributions of this work are an approach to obtain insight into incentives as root causes, and an approach to detecting and analyzing risks from incentives in the normative PRP. This paper also discusses <b>risk</b> <b>treatments</b> in terms of incentives to make the PRP more robust, together with a discussion of how to approach risk analysis of incentives...|$|R

40|$|Despite high {{tuberculosis}} (TB) treatment success rate, treatment adherence {{is one of}} {{the major}} obstacles to tuberculosis control in Kenya. Our objective was to identify patient-related factors that were associated with time to TB treatment interruption and the geographic distribution of the <b>risk</b> of <b>treatment</b> interruption by county. Data of new and retreatment patients registered in TIBU, a Kenyan national case-based electronic data recording system, between 2013 and 2014 was obtained. Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank tests were used to assess the adherence patterns. Mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards modeling was used for multivariate analysis. Records from 90, 170 patients were included in the study. The cumulative incidence of treatment interruption was 4. 5 % for new patients, and 8. 5 % for retreatment patients. The <b>risk</b> of <b>treatment</b> interruption was highest during the intensive phase of treatment. Having previously been lost to follow-up was the greatest independent <b>risk</b> factor for <b>treatment</b> interruption (HR: 4. 79 [3. 99, 5. 75]), followed by being HIV-positive not on ART (HR: 1. 96 [1. 70, 2. 26]) and TB relapse (HR: 1. 70 [1. 44, 2. 00]). Male and underweight patients had high <b>risks</b> of <b>treatment</b> interruption (HR: 1. 46 [1. 35, 1. 58]; 1. 11 [1. 03, 1. 20], respectively). High rates of treatment interruption were observed in counties in the central part of Kenya while counties in the northeast had the lowest <b>risk</b> of <b>treatment</b> interruption. A better understanding of <b>treatment</b> interruption <b>risk</b> factors is necessary to improve adherence to treatment. Interventions should focus on patients during the intensive phase, patients who have previously been lost to follow-up, and promotion of integrated TB and HIV services among public and private facilities...|$|R
