5|$|This {{interpretation}} is corroborated by the different rhetoric {{and actions of}} Ibn al-Ash'ath and his followers, {{as reported in the}} sources: the former was <b>ready</b> <b>and</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> compromise with the Umayyads, and continued to fight only because he had no alternative, while the great mass of his followers, motivated by discontent against the Umayyad regime couched in religious terms, were far more uncompromising and willing to carry on the struggle until death. Al-Hajjaj himself seems to have been aware of the distinction: in suppressing the revolt, he pardoned the Quraysh, the Syrians, and many of the other Arab clans, but executed tens of thousands among the mawālī and the Zutt of the Mesopotamian Marshes, who had sided with the rebels.|$|E
5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, <b>ready</b> <b>and</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with paregoric to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E

Effy is pretty, popular, but also quiet and distant, attempting to keep her own troubles hidden. Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell) is her friend, having appeared {{for the first time}} in a second series episode. She is innocent to the sexual and narcotic world in which Effy indulges, but is <b>ready</b> <b>and</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> explore it. Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) is an immigrant from DR Congo, with a morally upright outlook and good-hearted nature, and his storyline sees him becoming romantically involved with Pandora.|$|E

500|$|..... (T)he strong arguable {{inference}} is that, by {{waving the}} banner of individual rights and disparaging the legitimacy and constitutionality of efforts to restrict the availability of sexually explicit materials, the Government not only excited petitioner's interest in sexually explicit materials banned by law, but also exerted substantial pressure on petitioner to obtain and read such material {{as part of a}} fight against censorship and the infringement of individual rights ... The evidence that petitioner was <b>ready</b> <b>and</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> commit the offense came only after the Government had devoted 2½ years to convincing him that he had or {{should have the right to}} engage in the very behavior proscribed by law.|$|E

After Flower's death in the third series, Zaphod continued to perform the duties as the group's dominant male and would chase off any roving males trying to reach new dominant female Rocket Dog. As meerkats will not mate with first generation relatives, he eventually left the group and became a roving male. [...] He returned after two episodes and still acted as the group's dominant male as of the end of series three. At the start of the fourth series, Zaphod was shown with his own radio collar. He left the Whiskers again to become a rover, then took over as dominant male of the Aztecs in the second episode of the series. As Maybelline was also one of his daughters, Zaphod was still without a mate. On 4 March 2011, Zaphod died of old age. He was 12 years old.|$|E

2500|$|In 1952 Hellman {{was called}} to testify before HUAC, which had heard {{testimony}} that she had attended Communist Party meetings in 1937. She initially drafted a statement that said her two-year membership in the Communist Party had ended in 1940, {{but she did not}} condemn the party nor express regret for her participation in it. Her attorney, Joseph Rauh, opposed her admission of membership on technical grounds because she had attended meetings, but never formally become a party member. He warned that the committee and the public would expect her to take a strong anti-communist stand to atone for her political past, but she refused to apologize or denounce the party. Faced with Hellman's position, Rauh devised a strategy that produced favorable press coverage and allowed her to avoid the stigma of being labeled a [...] "Fifth Amendment Communist". On May 19, 1952, Hellman authored a letter to HUAC that one historian has described as [...] "written not to persuade the Committee, but to shape press coverage." [...] In it she explained her willingness to testify only about herself and that {{she did not want to}} claim her rights under the Fifth Amendment–"I am <b>ready</b> <b>and</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> testify before the representatives of our Government as to my own actions, regardless of any risks or consequences to myself." [...] She wrote that she found the legal requirement that she testify about others if she wanted to speak about her own actions [...] "difficult for a layman to understand." [...] Rauh had the letter delivered to the HUAC's chairman Rep. John S. Wood on Monday.|$|E
