50|$|The state {{government}} accepted {{the demands of}} the protesters from the Kashmir valley region by revoking the land transfer decision on 1 July 2008. Hindu groups in the Jammu region reacted by mounting their own counter-protests against the revocation and called for the cancellation of the <b>revocation</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E
5000|$|European patent [...] {{was granted}} on March 5, 1997, {{and related to}} a digital mobile {{telephone}} system using of a single-user multi-identity IC card (multi-identity SIM card). The patent was opposed and was revoked on lack of inventive step by the Opposition Division. The patent proprietor, Comvik GSM AB, appealed the <b>revocation</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Despite the protests, {{the state}} {{government}} has not annulled the <b>revocation</b> <b>decision.</b> Central Government moved hundreds of security forces into the region. Indian authorities restored the Amarnath pilgrimage route after a brief disruption. [...] Opposition party BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said on 2 August 2008 that “It seems the Centre only understands {{the voices of the}} valley and not of the Jammu region. It is trying to find a solution through force and is not initiating a dialogue”. [...] The prime minister Manmohan Singh spoke to BJP president Rajnath Singh and sought his party’s help in finding a solution to the issue.|$|E
50|$|The board {{currently}} operates under {{legislative changes}} made in 2003 that replaced the 18-member board with a chairman/presiding officer and six board members. Parole commissioners {{were added to}} assist the board with release <b>decisions,</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>decisions</b> and imposition of special parole conditions. The chair/presiding officer and board members are appointed by the governor with approval from the senate. Parole commissioners, currently 14 with two serving in each of seven board offices, are hired by the presiding officer.|$|R
50|$|At first Peter IV {{sought to}} resolve the {{situation}} by resorting to diplomacy: Cortes convened in Zaragoza and gave their <b>revocation</b> of his <b>decision</b> and instead agreed to confirm the privileges of the Union of 1287. From that moment, the only possible solution was armed conflict.|$|R
40|$|Quantified {{decision-making}} {{refers to}} the scaling of factors such as crime seriousness, risk assessment, violation severity, and punitive responses or intensity of surveillance. As such, it is largely based on the justice principle, according to which the punitive response should be commensurate with the crime committed. This study consequently looks at the applicability of a retributive stance towards probation, and suggests a quantified, or structured, approach to decision-making in probation with special reference to the South African situation. Referring to historical and ideological precedents, it is maintained that the current crisis in corrections - referring to the congestion of prison facilities and the negative spin-offs related to it - can, to a large extent, be ascribed to an over reliance on imprisonment as a sentencing option. It is argued that imprisonment {{can be seen as}} a failure in terms of both its basic motives, and more importantly, with regard to its unintended consequences, necessitating a search for viable sentencing alternatives. With regard to probation, and Intensive Supervision Probation (ISP) in particular, this study recognizes its limitations, but maintains that probation still holds the greatest potential as a workable alternative to incarceration. In view of South African corrections, that is plagued by prison overcrowding, on the one hand, and certain structural shortcomings, on the other, a structured probation system is proposed that will evade the weaknesses of subjective decisionmaking, which often act to intensify the crisis. It is proposed that quantified decision-making tools be developed that will replace both sentencing and <b>revocation</b> <b>decisions.</b> It is further suggested that an effective risk prediction instrument be developed to guide the probation process.

50|$|There are 3 judges, a chief referee {{and three}} sub referees. The chief judge is {{positioned}} inside the ring, whereas the sub referees {{are located on}} the outside of the ring, one to the right and others to the left. If an unfair judgment is called or the chief referee is unable to render a decision, the sub referees can request a <b>revocation</b> of the <b>decision</b> or a rematch. In addition, they can recommend the cessation of the match when an injury occurs. The referees’ decisions throughout the competition are absolute and held in the highest regard, meaning that athletes cannot challenge any judgments declared during the match.|$|R
50|$|In its trial {{decision}} the Patent Office (Trial Decision No. 20103 of 1996) {{ruled that}} if a demand for a trial for invalidation is submitted within an exclusion period and the particular statutory provisions providing the grounds for invalidation are specified in the demand, and if within the period ordered for an amendment the demand is supplemented with a detailed account and evidence, even if the date on which these amendments are submitted falls after the lapse of the exclusion period, the amendment of the demand for a trial for invalidation ought to be allowed. The Patent Office held that since the demand for the trial decision {{in this case was}} made within the exclusion period, it should not be dismissed on procedural grounds. On that basis the JPO ruled on the substance of the claim, and it issued a decision of invalidation on the grounds that X's Trademark was in breach of Article 4(1)(xv). In response X brought court proceedings for the <b>revocation</b> of this <b>decision.</b>|$|R
40|$|The law of {{probation}} revocation developed rapidly over the eighteen years preceding this article’s 1989 appearance. While its development has slowed substantially since then, {{it continues to}} evolve. The overall field of Nebraska probation revocation remains essentially unchanged from {{the way it was}} in 1989 when this article first appeared. The case law has neither burgeoned dramatically nor altered the scenery in major ways, although, it has added a few refinements. But important procedural and substantive wrinkles have appeared through 2003 statutory amendments to the steps probation officers must take in responding to probationers’ violations of the conditions of their probation sentences. 2 Less important changes appear in the county attorneys’ and trial courts’ responses. Probation remains a sentence under which a person found guilty of a crime or adjudicated delinquent or in need of special supervision is released subject to court imposed conditions and subject to supervision. 3 A probation sentence remains a final order for purposes of appeal. 4 However, upon proof of a violation {{of probation}}, the sentencing court may revoke the 2 ̆ 2 final 2 ̆ 2 probation sentence and impose a new sentence within the statutory limits or may decline to revoke probation and modify the terms of the probation sentence as originally imposed. 5 Probation revocation proceedings occupy a procedural class of their own with elements of both criminal and civil procedure. Even though probation revocation cannot occur without a precedent criminal proceeding and even though a new sentencing proceeding following a probation revocation is considered a critical stage of the precedent criminal case, the probation revocation proceeding itself is not considered to be a stage of the precedent criminal case. The basic rules governing probation revocations in Nebraska were developed by the Nebraska Legislature, the United States Supreme Court, the United States Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Nebraska Supreme Court, each body acting independently, as is the nature of our system, and sometimes adopting inconsistent approaches. The roles played by the United States Supreme Court and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals have faded substantially since 1989. 6 But the Nebraska Court of Appeals, which came into existence only in 1992, now plays a major role. In 1989 there was no other single reference work for discovering the esoteric rules relating to probation revocation in the state courts of Nebraska nor is there one in 2007. Hopefully, this article filled that void over the last eighteen years and will do so again for a reasonable length of time. Probation revocation is a narrow, specialized type of proceeding. Defense counsel are frequently thrust into probation revocation defense by court appointment. The area does not generate a great deal of fee activity. The income incentive for most lawyers to devote the necessary time to finding and synthesizing the law of probation revocation is not high. Yet, most alleged probation violators face imprisonment on revocation. The stakes are high for them. Actual probation violators are people who generally have put themselves on the fast track to correctional facilities. Once there, they have nothing to lose by filing liability claims against their former defense counsel. Following the constitutional Morrissey-Gagnon rules and Nebraska statutes is not optional and the failure to do so can affect negatively both any revocation proceedings and later criminal proceedings as well, as State v. Pawling 7 demonstrates. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide to the bench, bar and probation officers a probation revocation primer with the dual goals of improving the quality of probation revocation representation (on both sides), as well as the quality of judicial probation <b>revocation</b> procedures and <b>decision</b> making, and offering a convenient basic reference on the law of probation revocation in Nebraska courts. This revised article will discuss the statutory framework for probation revocation actions as it existed in 1989 and as it exists now, the pre- 1971 Nebraska case law, the revolution in probation revocation law resulting from the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 8 and the post- Gagnon decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Nebraska Supreme Court and the Nebraska Court of Appeals. This article examines developments relating to each component of the probation revocation process...|$|R
