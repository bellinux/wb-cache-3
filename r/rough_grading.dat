Many aircraft shipped from the United States were assembled at Finschafen and then flown to other airfields for operations.|$|E
50|$|A skid-steer loader can {{sometimes}} be used {{in place of a}} large excavator by digging a hole from the inside. The skid loader first digs a ramp leading {{to the edge of the}} desired excavation. It then uses the ramp to carry material out of the hole. The skid loader reshapes the ramp making it steeper and longer as the excavation deepens. This method is particularly useful for digging under a structure where overhead clearance does not allow for the boom of a large excavator, such as digging a basement under an existing house. Several companies make backhoe attachments for skid-steers. These are more effective for digging in a small area than the method above and can work in the same environments.

40|$|OBJECTIVE The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the first case series in which an exclusive endoscopic transcanal transpromontorial approach (EETTA) was used to treat small vestibular schwannomas (VSs) and meningiomas of the internal auditory canal (IAC). METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of patients who had undergone surgery using an EETTA to the IAC at 2 university tertiary care referral centers during the period from November 2011 to January 2015. RESULTS Ten patients underwent surgery via an EETTA for the treatment of VS in the IAC at the University Hospital of Modena or the University Hospital of Verona. The patients had Koos Grade I or II tumors and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Class D hearing status preoperatively. Gross-total resection was achieved in all patients. No major complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage or hemorrhage were reported. In 7 of 10 (70 %) patients, facial nerve function was normal immediately after surgery (<b>Rough</b> <b>Grading</b> System [RGS] Grade I). Two patients presented with a transitory facial palsy immediately after surgery (RGS Grade II-III) but experienced complete recovery during the follow-up period. The mean follow-up was 10 months. CONCLUSIONS The EETTA proved to be successful for the removal of VS or meningioma involving the cochlea, fundus, and IAC, with possible lower complication rates and less invasive procedures than those for traditional microscopic approaches. The potential for the extensive and routine use of this approach in lateral and posterior skull base surgery will depend on the development of technology and surgical refinements and on the diffusion of skull base endoscopic skills among the otolaryngological and neurosurgical communities...|$|E

40|$|An {{essential}} tool in {{the truck}} development process {{is the ability to}} quantify and grade vehicle dynamic behavior. Today this is performed either through subjective or objective tests. Subjective tests have the disadvantage that numerous factors influence test drivers’ opinions while objective measures have the advantage of repeatability. However, objective methods of today are often only able to provide a <b>rough</b> <b>grading</b> of vehicles. The main objective with this thesis is to develop more sensitive objective methods for ride comfort evaluation. An effective test procedure to measure driver perception sensitivity to small differences in vehicle ride is suggested and utilized. The driver sensitivity is tested on dynamic behavior that is typically graded in vehicle development. Cab motions from a truck are first measured and then recreated in a simulator where a test driver is seated. The perception threshold for small changes in typical vehicle motion is established in this way for each test person. The perception sensitivity tests indicate that humans are quite sensitive to transients in vehicle motion. One problem with many common vehicle ride measures is that the impact of transient behavior is small due to the averaging used to condense the measurement data into scalar measures. A new evaluation method for ride comfort, with influences from the well known handling diagram, is suggested. This method has four main advantages: it is fairly simple to interpret, it shows the absolute vibration level, it considers transient events separately and it shows changes in vehicle character with increasing excitation. Promising results from both measurements and simulations are derived. New technology has made it possible to vary vehicle suspension parameters during vehicle ride. In order to prescribe different damping for different vehicle modes, modal motion estimates are needed. A system identification approach is suggested. It yields improved estimates of vehicle modal motion compared to previous work. QC 2010122...|$|E

Furthermore, in the <b>graded</b> <b>rough</b> set model, macroscopic and microscopic algorithms are proposed and analyzed to calculate rough set regions; then, the conclusion is drawn that macroscopic and microscopic algorithms have advantages {{in time and space}} complexities, respectively, and a medical example is provided to illustrate the rough set regions and the 2 algorithms. In addition, 3 new properties of the 2 models are investigated, which are the results of extending the classical rough set model, i. e. the relationships between approximations and the basic set, the power actions of approximation operators, and the modifications of approximation operator actions on set operations. Finally, the classical rough set model is used to obtain many corresponding results, and moreover, the relationship and transformation between the 2 models is investigated.

The idea is to outsource the grading task to the students themselves as follows. After {{the end of an}} exam, each student is asked to rank [...] -in terms of quality [...] - a bundle of exam papers by fellow students. An aggregation rule will then combine the individual rankings into a global one that contains all students. We define a broad class of simple aggregation rules and present a theoretical framework for assessing their effectiveness. When statistical information about the grading behaviour of students is available, the framework can be used to compute the optimal rule from this class with respect to a series of performance objectives. For example, a natural rule known as Borda is proved to be optimal when students grade correctly. In addition, we present extensive simulations and a field experiment that validate our theory and prove it to be extremely accurate in predicting the performance of aggregation rules even when only <b>rough</b> information about <b>grading</b> behaviour is available.

40|$|A sawmill cuts logs into {{lumber and}} sells this lumber to {{secondary}} remanufactures. The price a sawmiller can charge for {{a volume of}} lumber depends on its grade, For a number of species {{the price of a}} given volume of material can double in going from one grade to the next higher grade. Thus, accurately establishing the grade of a volume of hardwood lumber is very important to both seller and purchaser of this material. Currently, the grading of hardwood lumber is done by human inspectors. Unfortunately, they often lack consistency in their grading of lumber. Hence, there is a strong motivation for wanting to develop an automatic lumber grading system. The research reported in this paper is aimed at developing a computer vision system that will be used to automatically <b>grade</b> <b>rough</b> hardwood lumber. The purpose of the computer vision system is to locate and identify grading defects in a speciesindependent manner.

40|$|During the {{commissioning}} {{phase of}} Prominent Hill, periods of reduced recovery were experienced with higher-grade ore blends. This was unexpected {{and as part}} of the process to identify the cause, surveys were conducted in May 2009, with two different ore blends (copper grades: 1. 94 per cent Cu (blend 1) and 2. 49 per cent Cu (blend 2)). Metallurgical performance was assessed in terms of <b>rougher</b> recovery and <b>grade</b> with consideration of both pulp and froth effects. In addition, hydrodynamic measurements (gas hold up, bubble size, superficial gas velocity) as well as measurements of bubble load and top-of-froth grade were taken during the surveys and full mineralogical assessment of selected streams completed to characterise the nature of the differences. The metallurgical results showed that the lower performance was obtained with blend 2 which contained the higher amount of chalcocite and was higher-grade. Analysis of the survey data showed that for both ore blends {{more than half of the}} copper loss occurred in the + 38 Jlm size fractions. Almost 30 per cent of the copper in the + 38 Jlm fractions that reported to the rougher tails during processing of blend 2 was liberated compared to less than five per cent for blend 1. Additionally almost 60 per cent of the copper in the + 38 J. Lm fraction of blend 2 was chalcocite compared with approximately 20 per cent in blend 1. This paper discusses the sensitivity of the chalcocite-to-surface chemistry effects causing marked reductions in recovery either through reduced pulp recovery or froth phase (detachment) effects. The reagent suite and operating conditions were subsequently changed and the recoveries increased substantially and the sensitivity to ore changes eliminated. It should be noted that subsequent optimisation work, which focused on recovery improvement, has led to copper recoveries of over 90 per cent being achieved...|$|R

40|$|Trithiocarbonates (TTCs) {{with less}} than six carbon atoms per {{molecule}} historically {{have proved to be}} better bulk sulphide mineral collectors than conventional dithiocarbonates (DTCs). However, high vapor pressures of the short-chain mercaptan decomposition products prevented them from general industrial use. Impala’s commitment in TTC development changed in 2002 when the nC 12 -trithiocarbonate indicated strong synergism when added to their existing flotation suite. A concerted research effort at the University of Utah followed, and in particular on their surface chemistry. To compliment current research and development at Impala, fundamental work regarding the surface hydrophobicity of pyrrhotite under electrochemically controlled conditions was undertaken at Utah University. Controlled contact angle measurements showed that the surface hydrophobicity of pyrrhotite can be increased by small additions of nC 12 -trithiocarbonate to SIBX. It was also found that this improvement in the surface hydrophobicity with the SIBX-TTC mixture was more significant at lower oxidation potentials. Work at Utah University further showed that a C 12 decomposition product {{may or may not be}} present with an adsorbed TTC molecule. External reflectance infrared spectroscopy in the mid infrared region suggested a “crowding” of the collectors at the surface when SIBX and TTC are combined. This was based on an increase in the absorbance of the -CH 2 - peaks in the mixed collector system. In bench scale flotation tests on PGM bearing samples from the Merensky reef, it was found that a 5 molar percent replacement of SIBX with nC 12 -trithiocarbonate improved the flotation activity relative to the standard SIBX-DTP mixture. Improvements were in the recoveries of PGMs, copper and nickel. The addition of TTC also increased the flotation rates of both slow and fast floating valuables as is predicted by the Kelsall equation. The optimum mixture for the pilot plant trials was thus a 5 molar percent replacement of the current collector suite with nC 12 -TTC. Based on the bench flotation results, research was extended to a pilot plant trial. At a depressant dosage of 100 g/ton, the PGM concentrate grades from the first rougher cell improved from 120 g/ton to 175 g/ton when the TTC was introduced. This was achieved without any effect on the recovery from the first cell. This increase in concentrate grade is believed to arise from the nature of both: The mineral-collector surface state, and The bubble surface interaction. Overall, the standard SIBX-DTP collector combination and the new SIBX-DTP-TTC collector combination (both at 100 g/ton depressant) was also compared to pilot plant tests with SIBX-DTP at high (350 g/ton) depressant dosages. The latter suite forms the currents reagent suite at Impala Platinum. When comparing the first two trials, at 100 g/ton depressant, the addition of TTC as a ternary collector resulted in a recovery improvement of approximately 2. 2 % with a simultaneous increase in final concentrate grade from 57 g/ton to 73 g/ton. The result was a reduction in solids recovery from 5. 3 % to 4. 1 %. When comparing the TTC trial to the standard collector suite at high depressant dosages, only a small reduction (3. 6 % vs. 4. 1 %) in solids recovery was achieved with a final concentrate grade of 85 g/ton. The PGM recoveries were very similar. Based on current Merensky milling rates, depressant and TTC costs, and calculated replacements based on the pilot plant tests, a projected cost saving on chemicals is R 9. 6 million per annum. Financial impacts on processing, grade and kinetics have not been made. It was also concluded that the detrimental effect of mild steel milling on the flotation activity of SIBX-DTP was diminished with the addition of the long-chain TTC with SIBX and DTP. As part to this research, a preliminary plant trial on UG- 2 underground material showed a reduced primary <b>rougher</b> chromite <b>grade</b> as well as a significant increase in PGM concentrate grade for the first two primary rougher cells. This is an important finding, especially for the melting process. In this final study a partial (5 molar percent) replacement of the standard collector used was also made. What was further realised was a significant increase in the final concentrate grade when compared to the standard conditions.
