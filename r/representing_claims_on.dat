Assuming that foreign assets trade at a cost, agents hold relatively more domestic assets. Consequently, agents have larger claims to domestic over foreign consumption. Moreover, foreign assets turn over faster than domestic assets because the former have desirable liquidity properties, but represent inferior saving tools. Our mechanism offers {{an answer to}} a long-standing puzzle in international finance: {{a positive relationship between}} consumption and asset home bias coupled with higher turnover rates of foreign over domestic assets. ...|$|R

40|$|In most African economies, both {{agricultural}} {{production and the}} terms- of-trade are highly uncertain. This paper re-examines the implications of such uncertainty for the optimal mix of production and trade under alternative assumptions about international capital flows. The ultimate objective is to explore the possible effects of increased financial integration on real economic activity in developing countries. In the presence of uncertainty and limited international capital flows, diversifying production [...] and exports [...] rather than specializing according to comparative advantage may be desirable depending on a country’s degree of risk aversion. Once international borrowing and lending becomes available, however, it may provide a more efficient mechanism for coping smoothing consumption {{in the face of}} income fluctuations than does diversifying production and exports. The ability to trade equity securities (which <b>represent</b> <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> uncertain future production) in world capital markets permits additional risk sharing possibilities. In some circumstances where equities trade is well- developed, production diversification completely unnecessary. That is, production and price uncertainty can be efficiently hedged through portfolio diversification instead of production diversification. uncertainty. trade, capital flows, Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R

We focus on the choice between chartering a parent banks foreign a ¢ liates as separately capitalized institutions (i. e., subsidiaries), or expanding abroad via a branch network, so that the liabilities of the branches <b>represent</b> <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> the parent bank. We show that the optimal organizational structure depends on {{the relative importance of}} macroeconomic/credit risk over political risk. When political risks are the preva-lent source of uncertainty, a branch-based structure is preferable as it keeps capital in the home country, thus shielding it from expropriation by the foreign government. However, when credit risk is of greater consequence, a subsidiary-based structure is preferable since it shields the parent company from losses accruing on the a ¢ liate. We also examine how factors such as cross-country risk correlation, the degree to which bank creditors price risk, and the competitive conditions in which banks operate a¤ect the relative pro 8 ̆ 5 tability of the branch-based and the subsidiary-based structures.

5000|$|The {{shares of}} the DLC parents <b>represent</b> <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> exactly the same {{underlying}} cash flows. In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the DLC parents should therefore move in lockstep. In practice, however, large differences from theoretical price parity can arise. For example, in the early 1980s Royal Dutch NV was trading at a discount of approximately 30% relative to Shell Transport and Trading PLC. In the academic finance literature, Rosenthal and Young (1990) and Froot and Dabora (1999) show that significant mispricing in three DLCs (Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever, and Smithkline Beecham) has existed {{over a long period}} of time. Both studies conclude that fundamental factors (such as currency risk, governance structures, legal contracts, liquidity, and taxation) are not sufficient to explain the magnitude of the price deviations. Froot and Dabora (1999) show that the relative prices of the twin stocks are correlated with the stock indices of the markets on which each of the twins has its main listing. For example, if the FTSE 100 rises relative to the AEX index (the Dutch stock market index) the stock price of Reed International PLC generally tends to rise relative to the stock price of Elsevier NV. De Jong, Rosenthal, and van Dijk (2008) report similar effects for nine other DLCs. A potential explanation is that local market sentiment affects the relative prices of the {{shares of the}} DLC parent companies. Because of the absence of [...] "fundamental reasons" [...] for the mispricing, DLCs have become known as a textbook example of arbitrage opportunities, see for example Brealey, Myers, and Allen (2006, chapter 13).|$|R

The purpose of the dissertation is to determine the effect of variables hypothesized to be most important in changing the strength of tax expenditure <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> state financial resources and to determine if some types of tax expenditure claims might respond differently to those variables. Tax expenditures are conceptualized as features of tax policy that eliminate or reduce the tax liability of certain groups or categories of taxpayers. They <b>represent</b> <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> financial resources, just like budget requests that receive direct appropriations. They are "weak" or "strong" {{to the extent that they}} are successful in becoming and/or remaining part of the tax code. A market-based theory of budgeting was employed to deduce causal variables and hypotheses. Four causal variables [...] fiscal condition, the tax burden, legislative budget procedures that expose tax expenditures to scrutiny and competition, and the availability of information about tax expenditures [...] when found in certain ideal combinations, were hypothesized to either minimize or maximize the strength of tax expenditure claims. A comparative case study methodology was used to evaluate the effect of the causal variables <b>on</b> tax expenditure <b>claims.</b> Four states were selected for study: Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Changes in tax expenditure provisions were examined in the four states over a fourteen-year period, 1980 - 1993. The case studies also examined income tax revisions where tax expenditures were repealed in order to reduce marginal rates. The four causal variables were found to be influential in determining the strength of tax expenditure claims. However, tax expenditure claims can also be weakened when states attempt to reduce the burden in one tax by repealing tax expenditures that apply to another tax, thus shifting the tax burden from one tax to another. Tax expenditures that are targeted at increasing investment to spur economic development can be very strong claims, even when the combination of causal variables predicts weak tax expenditure claims. Efforts to reduce high marginal income tax rates were also found to weaken tax expenditure claims...|$|R

A possible reason for the increase is that the minimum bid-ask spread is wider after a split and brokers have more incentive to promote a stock. I document a large number of small buy orders following Nasdaq and NYSE/Amex splits during 1993 - 1994. I also find strong evidence that trading costs increase, and weak evidence that costs of market making decline following splits. This is consistent with splits acting as an incentive to brokers to promote stocks. 1 Stock splits seem to be purely cosmetic changes with no real economic consequences. After a two-for-one split, each shareholder has twice as many shares, but each <b>represents</b> a <b>claim</b> <b>on</b> only half as much of the corporation's assets and earnings.
