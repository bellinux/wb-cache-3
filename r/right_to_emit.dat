50|$|With {{collaborators}} Humberto Llavador and Joaquim Silvestre, Roemer has elaborated {{a formal}} theory of sustainability, which the authors {{apply to the}} problem of climate change (Llavador, Roemer, and Silvestre 2010 and 2011). Rather than maximizing a sum of discounted generational utilities into the future, which is the virtually ubiquitous practice of economists working on climate change, the authors maximize an objective which sustains welfare at the highest feasible level, or sustains growth in welfare at a chosen growth rate. Roemer (2011) critiques the discounted utilitarian approach. In Llavador, Roemer, and Silvestre (2012) the authors propose how the bargaining problem between the global North and South can be resolved, over the allocation of <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>emit</b> greenhouse gases. The proposal does not begin from an ethical position which postulates an a priori distribution of pollution <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> nations, but rather with a politically motivated postulate that the authors argue is necessary and sufficient for an agreement to be reached.|$|R

40|$|The {{trading of}} <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>emit</b> carbon dioxide has not officially been {{sanctioned by the}} United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, but it is of {{interest}} to investigate the consequences, both for industrial (Annex B) and developing countries, of allowing such trades. The authors examine the trading of caps assigned to Annex B countries under the Kyoto Protocol and compare the outcome with {{a world in which}} Annex B countries meet with their Kyoto targets without trading. Under the trading scenario the former Soviet Union is the main seller of carbon dioxide permits and Japan, the European Union, and the United States are the main buyers. Permit trading is estimated to reduce the aggregate cost of meeting the Kyoto targets by about 50 percent, compared with no trading. Developing countries, though they do not trade, are nonetheless affected by trading. For example, the price of oil and the demand for other developing country exports are higher with trading than without. The authors also consider what might happen if developing countries were to voluntarily accept caps equal to Business as Usual Emissions and were allowed to sell emission reductions below these caps to Annex B countries. The gains from emissions trading could be big enough to give buyers and sellers incentive to support the system. Indeed, a global market for <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>emit</b> carbon dioxide could reduce the cost of meeting the Kyoto targets by almost 90 percent, if the market were to operate competitively. The division of trading gains, however, may make a competitive outcome unlikely: Under perfect competition, the vast majority of trading gains go to buyers of permits rather than to sellers. Even markets in which the supply of permits is restricted can, however, substantially reduce the cost to Annex B countries of meeting their Kyoto targets, while yielding profits to developing countries that elect to sell permits.

Preventing the worst {{effects of climate change}} and compensating those who will suffer are tasks that should be taken up by individuals, firms and states, tasks that constitute a burden. In this thesis I suggest the use of particular principles for justly allocating this "climate burden". I first defend my use of an orthodox ethical approach from Dale Jamieson’s challenge that the ethics of climate change must be revisionary. I also reply to Luc Bovens’ Lockean argument that a history of high emitting justifies giving past polluters more <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>emit.</b> Then, I propose a two-track theory under which the climate burden is divided in two. These two different parts are allocated by a contribution-based "polluter pays" principle and by an "ability to pay" principle. The "fault burden" is the burden from greenhouse gas emissions produced since it became reasonable to suppose that such emissions were harmful, except for the emissions from the very poor, which are not included. The fault burden should be allocated to those who have contributed to it, in proportion to their contribution. The "no fault burden" is the remaining portion. The no-fault burden should be allocated by an "ability to pay" principle which requires all parties (except for the very poor) to shoulder burdens that constitute an equal drop in whatever goods we deem most relevant. Finally I defend the two track theory from the claim that a "beneficiary pays" principle better allocates the burden caused by past emissions...|$|R

40|$|Urban and Environmental Economics are two {{branch of}} Economics {{that are more}} and more tightly {{interconnected}} and always should be. Trying to study how population is distributed across cities is a key point for several issues, either from a theoretical point of view or from a policy implementation point of view. Among the policies possibly affected by population distribution, policies dealing with climate change {{are one of the most}} affected, as people keep attributing a growing importance to the quality of their life, to the protection to natural risks and, then, policy makers have to care about how people are spread across cities. Viceversa, an effective climate policy should try to improve people’s life quality and to leave at least unaltered the population distribution, as it can cause, for example, job losses due to company relocation, which can alter in a substantial way the way in which population distributes in cities. In this thesis work, we aim to provide the international scientific community with new insights on some of the most relevant topics in these two branches: What is the actual distribution of population in cities of a country and what were the processes leading to it?

The most well known {{of these is the}} proposal of Anil Agarwal and Sunita Narain (1991),. The GDRs authors group felt that the per-capita emission rights approach lacked a systematic treatment of “national circumstances,” and attempted to solve this problem with a “Per-capita Plus” approach. They eventually concluded that, despite the obvious importance of the per-capita principle, it is not a viable foundation for a robust approach to a fair climate regime, not, at least, in a world where most all the “atmospheric space” has already been consumed. The Per-capita Plus approach was eventually abandoned in favor of GDRs (which is based not on per-capita rights but rather the UNFCCC principles of responsibility and capacity).GDRs debuted at a side event at the Tenth Conference of Parties (COP10) in Argentina in December 2004, with a paper and presentation entitled Cutting the Gordian Knot. The final, reworked version of this paper was published on April 15, 2005, under the title Cutting the Knot: Climate Protection, Political Realism, and Equity as Requirements of a Post-Kyoto Regime. The first edition of the GDRs book and model were published in 2007 by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, and was presented at COP-13 in Bali. The GDRs second edition book and model were released at COP 14 in Poznan. The GDRs framework continues to evolve. It can best be tracked at the project website.|$|R

40|$|International Trade {{has become}} an all {{encompassing}} feature of the modern world. Trade across national boundaries now regularly involves the movement of harvested and manufactured goods, finance, information, services, and even the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>emit</b> pollution. Sustainable development can be considered the dominant framework for analysing the relationship between trade and the environment. This position is heavily influenced by neoclassical economics and involves an acceptance that growth and freedom in trade is necessary to achieve sustainability. Exploration of the mainstream framework finds it to be incomplete in that it fails to recognise the existence of power relationships influential in shaping investment, trade, environmental degradation and ongoing poverty. An alternative political ecology framework with the capacity to build on and critique the sustainable development position, and explore the wider political and economic issues involved in the trade and environment interface is therefore developed. This thesis details a case study regarding {{the expansion of the}} pulp and paper industry in Indonesia to investigate the assumptions apparent in the sustainable development position and the wider issues suggested by the adoption of a political ecology framework. The research indicates that the environmental problems of poorer countries such as Indonesia are not just the result of domestic policy failure, but closely related to broader political and economic forces associated with global capitalism and trade. Increasing the permeability of national boundaries to capital, companies and goods has unleashed global economic forces that systematically punish ecologically sound practices and initiatives while rewarding destructive patterns of behaviour. International trade increases the spatial distance between destructive behaviour and the end point of usage. It is the conduit through which many countries obtain the resources necessary for continued economic expansion beyond immediate geographic constraints and is a powerful homogenising influence on economies and cultures. International trade as it is currently practiced has significant political ramifications as it increases the power of wealthy states, markets, corporations and individuals. International trade should be recognised as a closely regulated system built on the uses of hegemonic power. Reformulating the rules of world trade by allowing countries to discriminate against goods which are produced in an unsustainable manner, ending subsidies and implementing cost internalisation and controls on capital flows would do much to mitigate the negative environmental consequences of international trade...|$|R
