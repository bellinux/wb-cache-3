The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue.

25|$|In a {{counterinsurgency}} situation, {{the perception}} of the government (i.e., McCormick's CF) violating the human rights of the population causes Eisenstat's legitimacy gap to widen. The Phoenix program in South Vietnam was criticized for a lack of precision in its targeting, and caused a further loss in legitimacy of the government, regardless of the damage done to the Viet Cong infrastructure. Marighella recommended that urban guerillas deliberately provoke the government into overreaction, as a means of reducing its legitimacy; the doctrine of having FID trainers counsel <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> has pure military, not just humanitarian, justification.|$|E

25|$|Colombia–United States {{relations}} are the bilateral {{relations between the}} Republic of Colombia and the United States of America. The {{relationship between the two}} states evolved from mutual cordiality during most of the 19th and early 20th centuries to a recent partnership that links the governments of both nations around several key issues; this includes fighting communism, the War on Drugs, and the threat of terrorism due to the September 11 attacks in 2001. During the last fifty years, different American governments and their representatives have become involved in Colombian affairs through the implementation of policies concerned with the issues already stated. Some critics of current US policies in Colombia, such as Law Professor John Barry, claim that US influences have catalyzed internal conflicts and substantially expanded the scope and nature of human rights abuses in Colombia. Supporters, such as Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman, defend the idea that the United States has promoted <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> {{and the rule of law}} in Colombia; in addition, adding to the fight against drugs and terrorism.|$|E
