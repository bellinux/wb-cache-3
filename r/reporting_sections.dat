50|$|Under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA), {{fair dealing}} {{is limited to}} the {{following}} purposes: research and private study (both must be non-commercial), criticism / review / quotation, and news <b>reporting</b> (<b>sections</b> 29, 30, 178); as well as parody, caricature and pastiche (section 30A) and illustration for teaching. Although not actually defined as a fair dealing, incidental inclusion of a copyrighted work in an artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast or cable programme doesn't infringe copyright.

5000|$|During October 1958, [...] "Exercise Nightbird", a joint {{air defence}} and nuclear fallout exercise, saw ROC {{personnel}} undertaking operational duties at the ADOC {{for the first}} time. Subsequently, operational RAF Command and Group HQs in the UK received nuclear fallout information over 2 broadcast circuits from the ADOC, with Fallout Reporting Section map displays at each site being updated by local ROC Special Duties Teams. This system of Fallout <b>Reporting</b> <b>Sections</b> was enhanced further when nuclear burst and fallout data was distributed by ROC Group HQs directly to what became formally designated as ROC Nuclear Reporting Cells (NRC). Nuclear Reporting Cells {{would go on to}} be located within several major armed forces HQ throughout the UK, with ROC personnel being responsible for providing the Army, Royal Navy and RAF with comprehensive visual displays and interpretation of data provided by ROC controls.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to issues}} {{surrounding}} RAF personnel shortages and training restrictions, HQ Fighter Command formally requested that HQROC assist in providing suitably qualified ROC personnel to staff the Fallout <b>Reporting</b> <b>Sections</b> {{at both the}} ADOC and at Fighter Command's Sector Operations Centres, (SOCs). Apart from wartime ROC/RAF Liaison Officers, {{this was to be}} the first occasion whereby ROC personnel would undertake their duties within a wholly military operational environment. In case of the ADOC at RAF Bentley Priory, sixteen ROC personnel were required to staff the Fallout Reporting Section, with the operation itself consisting of marking the position of nuclear bursts, and plotting both the reported and predicted path of fallout onto a large, vertical, transparent (perspex) map display. (Two Observers working {{at the rear of the}} display would plot and update data by writing in 'reverse', thereby enabling an unobstructed view of the front of display). Actual reports of fallout were drawn onto initial templates which, when combined with meteorological forecasts, were used to extrapolate the predicted path and intensity of the fallout. This system enabled initial and subsequent predictions of fallout to be drawn, together with identifying those areas actually being affected.|$|E

We suggest that database technology can {{play an important role in}} assisting compliance with the internal control provisions of the Act. The core components of our solution include: (i) modeling of required workflows, (ii) active enforcement of control activities, (iii) auditing of actual workflows to verify compliance with internal controls, and (iv) discovery-driven OLAP to identify irregularities in financial data. We illustrate how the features of our solution fulfill Sarbanes-Oxley requirements using several real-life scenarios. In the process, we identify opportunities for new database research...|$|E
40|$|The {{accounting}} policy of enterprise {{and the manner}} of its formation is a rather complex process, which should not only involve the selection of several accounting options but also act {{within the framework of}} existing legislation. The {{accounting policy}} of enterprise is the backbone of any activity of an economic entity, as it establishes an accounting procedure based on a comprehensive analysis of the possible options. The article is aimed at developing the contents of accounting policy, which will provide for creating a workable document, using experience of leading scientists. Since the accounting policy of enterprise is primarily intended to provide true and full coverage of the activity of economic entity, which is implemented in practice through preparation of financial reporting, it would be appropriate to generate its contents in terms of the <b>reporting</b> <b>sections.</b> That is, in a general way, the issues to be reflected in the accounting policy of enterprise should have a separate structure for each item of financial reporting: for the constituent assets, the capital and liabilities; the estimate on the balance sheet date; the estimate on decrease; the estimate on revenues and costs...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} sought to test if the principles {{used in the}} National Forestry Inventory (NFI) to monitor the habitat resource (forest) through Earth Observation (EO) might be extended to a wider suite of habitat types. The NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) was asked to focus the selection of habitat types and review the understanding of how EO data could aid the identification of changed land use and management. CEH was also asked {{to draw up a}} plan for a practical test of how the project findings could be carried out. The approach comprised five steps, which are described within the present report. Step 1 (<b>Report</b> <b>Section</b> 2. 1) : Appraisal of relevant extant and ongoing projects that have reviewed EO based techniques for condition monitoring of specific habitats. Step 2 (<b>Report</b> <b>Section</b> 2. 2) : Comprehensive assessment of condition measures assessment as theyit areis applied to all UK habitats, both at a Broad and Priority scale (see Appendix 4 and Summary Table 3). CEH identified those habitats for which existing data are most detailed, and where knowledge of the mechanisms of habitat change and their causes are best understood, and thus where EO-derived measures appeared most relevant. Step 3 (<b>Report</b> <b>Sections</b> 3. 1, 3. 2 and 3. 3) : Examination of detection of change by EO at a broad scale across the UK through both passive and active approaches, followed by a systematic appraisal of the condition measures identified in Step 2. Step 4 (<b>Report</b> <b>Sections</b> 3. 4 and 3. 5) : The project then described how a system might operate in practice, using a theoretical example for monitoring grassland condition, based upon the readiness of each method and whether parameters required calibration/ validation. Step 5 (<b>Report</b> <b>Section</b> 4) : A detailed outline is included for a practical test to be conducted on the application of the project findings. Four pilot studies are considered, each reviewed in terms of relevant EO variables and condition measures, together with their readiness for application...|$|R
