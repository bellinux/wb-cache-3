40|$|A {{new method}} {{to detect and}} track an object having a unique {{movement}} out of general moving background comprised {{of a number of}} moving areas is reported here. After an overall picture movement is detected and normalized from local movements of an image, the moving object becomes detectable by applying a time sequential processing on the difference between frames. Thus, the detection of moving object out of a moving background can be carried out highly efficiently. As an example of applications, a detection of man walking in a <b>panned</b> <b>background</b> is demonstrated in this report. 1...|$|R
5000|$|These color {{cartoons}} {{were often}} augmented with Fleischer's patented three-dimensional effects promoted as [...] "The Stereoptical Process," [...] {{a precursor to}} Disney's Multiplane. This technique used 3-D model sets replacing flat <b>Pan</b> <b>Backgrounds,</b> with the animation cels photographed in front. This technique was used to the greatest degree in the two-reel Popeye Features Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor (1936) and Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves (1937). These double-length cartoons demonstrated Fleischer's interest in animated feature films. While Fleischer petitioned for this for three years, {{it was not until}} the success of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) that Paramount executives realized the value of Max's proposals and ordered one for a 1939 Christmas release. But this request came at an awkward time.|$|R
5000|$|Now {{forced to}} make the movie, Da Peng {{recruits}} Xiaoxiao, his personal assistant <b>Pan,</b> <b>background</b> actor Ma Tao and paparazzi photographer Hu. Da Peng tells them about the script he wrote, named [...] "Jian Bing Man" [...] (Pancake Man). The titular character is a superhero who fights against a large global crime organization that has kidnapped many people, including his beloved. Because he does not actually have money to hire any well-known actors, Da Peng sets various actors up in situations resembling the scenarios in the script, and gets them to unknowingly act out his story, all while secretly filming them. He successfully shoots scenes with many actors like Sandra Ng, Eric Tsang, Yue Yunpeng and Deng Chao, all of them oblivious to their plot. As the filming progresses, Da Peng reveals to his crew that [...] "Jian Bing Man" [...] {{is not just a}} simple film, but a story based on his childhood dream of becoming a superhero. Motivated by his dedication, the crew continue with filming and vow to make this movie a success.|$|R
5000|$|Nickelodeons ME:TV had a [...] "Youre {{watching}} ME:TV" [...] interstitial clip with Ryan Knowles impersonating Max Headroom on the webwall. In the clip, Ryans {{hair was}} combed back like Maxs, and he stutters occasionally and the <b>background</b> <b>panned</b> vertically with purple and blue neon stripes.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the <b>backgrounds</b> <b>panning.</b> Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|R
50|$|For the re-release, {{the prestigious}} Polish {{director}} Zbigniew Rybczyński was recruited. In the video, Tennant is again {{dressed in a}} suit and hat, while Lowe wears the hard hat, jeans, soiled shirt, and work gloves of a construction worker, depicting the two roles spoken of in the lyrics. The camera <b>pans</b> over a <b>background</b> of city skylines and clouds rendered in neon lines as Tennant and Lowe appear duplicated repeatedly, passing to each other symbols of the different statuses they represent — including a top hat, a trophy, a brick, and a sledgehammer.|$|R
50|$|In addition, Mogoeng was {{nominated}} {{ahead of the}} expected appointee, Dikgang Moseneke, who had served the Constitutional Court for nine years and as Deputy Chief Justice for six. Moseneke had already been overlooked once before, when Sandile Ngcobo was appointed Chief Justice, and his second snubbing was attributed to his <b>Pan</b> Africanist Congress <b>background</b> and remarks at a social occasion distancing himself from the ruling African National Congress (ANC). Mogoeng's own meteoric rise under the Zuma administration raised concerns about his independence. His nomination ahead of Moseneke reminded many of the notorious supersession by L. C. Steyn, a National Party favourite, of Oliver Schreiner. Finally, whereas Moseneke had {{been active in the}} struggle against apartheid, COSATU said it was concerning that Mogoeng had been a prosecutor for a bantustan.|$|R
50|$|On {{the island}} of Lesbos, in a meadow {{at the edge of}} a sacred wood stands a grotto hewn out of rock, at the {{entrance}} of which is an antique sculpture of three Nymphs. Somewhat toward the background, to the left, a large rock vaguely resembles the form of the god <b>Pan.</b> In the <b>background</b> sheep are grazing. It is a bright spring afternoon. When the curtain rises, the stage is empty. Youths and girls enter, carrying gifts for the Nymphs in baskets. Gradually the stage fills. The group bows before the altar of the Nymphs. The girls drape the pedestals with garlands. In the far background, Daphnis is seen following his flock. Chloé joins him. They proceed toward the altar and disappear at a bend. Daphnis and Chloé enter at the foreground and bow before the Nymphs.|$|R
5000|$|T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews {{felt that}} {{director}} Kobayashi Makoto and scriptwriter Akimoto Yasushi failed {{in their efforts}} to create a viewable film. Among the film's attributes that were <b>panned</b> were the <b>background</b> music sounding [...] "eerily similar to the background of the Care Bears Movie, ethereal and fluffy and jarring and likely the result of a five-year-old banging on a synthesizer," [...] the casting of Mamiya Kurumi as the mecha mascot, Link, who reminding the reviewer of Jar Jar Binks [...] "but with a squeaky Japanese woman's voice," [...] and otherwise talented actresses playing the voices of the Guard of Rose being [...] "uniformly mediocre and less interesting than the girls of the Gall Force", and character designs being bad and characterizations worse. [...] The reviewer ended his enumeration of multiple flaws by stating (sic) [...] "This really IS the worst anime I've ever seen. 6 Angels has all the elements that could have made a great movie, except for the greatness." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{several aspects of}} the {{cardiological}} evaluation of patients with cerebral ischemia are described; its usefulness for diagnosis and treatment is discussed. The aim of this thesis is to approach the clinical and epidemiological aspects of patients with cerebral ischemic events, while recogoizing the existence of beanbrain interactions in atherosclerotic disease [22]. The general {{idea is that the}} organism shonld be considered as a whole; the philosophical term for this idea is 'holism' [23, 24, 25]. In biology the holistic idea can be confirmed by the existence of generalized diseases such as atherosclerosis [26, 27, 28]. A cerebral ischemic event can be considered as a 'Gestalt'. 1 bis 'Gestalt' consists of a figure and a background [21]. In the figure the special or local relationship of atherosclerosis with one patt of the organism is expressed: in cerebral ischemia the brain is the affected organ. The figure, however, may never be considered apatt from its background. In brain ischemia, the background is formed by atherosclerosis existiog in the whole organism; coronary sclerosis is <b>pan</b> of this <b>background.</b> The extent to which the specific or local charaCter of an event manifests itself, depends on the influence of the local event on the phenomenon as a whole and vice vers...|$|R
40|$|Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) is a {{critical}} atmospheric reservoir for nitrogen oxide radicals, and it plays a lead role in their redistribution in the troposphere. We analyze new Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) PAN observations over North America during July 2006 to 2009. Using aircraft observations from the Colorado Front Range, we demonstrate that TES can be sensitive to elevated PAN in the boundary layer even {{in the presence of}} clouds. In situ observations have shown that wildfire emissions can rapidly produce PAN, and PAN decomposition is an important component of ozone production in smoke plumes. We identify smoke-impacted TES PAN retrievals by co-location with NOAA Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke plumes. We find that 15 – 32  % of cases where elevated PAN is identified in TES observations (retrievals with DOF >  0. 6) overlap smoke plumes. A case study of smoke transport in July 2007 illustrates that PAN enhancements associated with HMS smoke plumes can be connected to fire complexes, providing evidence that TES is sufficiently sensitive to measure elevated PAN several days downwind of major fires. Using a subset of retrievals with TES 510  hPa carbon monoxide (CO) >  150  ppbv, and multiple estimates of <b>background</b> <b>PAN,</b> we calculate enhancement ratios for tropospheric average PAN relative to CO in smoke-impacted retrievals. Most of the TES-based enhancement ratios fall within the range calculated from in situ measurements...|$|R
