5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations the <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans. When Taraki realized {{the degree of}} popular dissatisfaction with the reform he quickly abandoned the policy. However, the land <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> gradually implemented under the later Karmal administration, although the proportion of land area impacted by the reform is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the reform had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The reform's goal was to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy to an even greater extent. This <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that the <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the reform never came to fruition. The reform is seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 2012 eurozone leaders {{agreed to}} permit loans by the European Stability Mechanism {{to be made}} {{directly}} to stressed banks rather than through eurozone states, to avoid adding to sovereign debt. The <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> linked to plans for banking regulation by the European Central Bank. The <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> immediately reflected by a reduction in yield of long-term bonds issued by member states such as Italy and Spain and a rise in value of the Euro.|$|E
40|$|Administrative <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} {{perceived as}} dramatic organizational changes solving administrative problems {{once and for}} all. In this article it <b>is</b> argued that <b>reforms</b> reflect organizational stability more than organizational change. <b>Reforms</b> <b>are</b> driven by problems, solutions and forgetfulness, which are all common phenomena in modern organizations. <b>Reforms</b> <b>are</b> also driven by <b>reforms</b> [...] <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> highly self-referential. Organizations may have reasons for avoiding reforms, for instance because reforms may increase a preference for values that the organization has particular difficulty in achieving rather than improving performance. Paradoxically, one effective way of stopping <b>reforms</b> <b>is</b> to try to implement them and to propose new <b>reforms,</b> which <b>is</b> a further reason of why <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> common in organizations.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether a}} country’s economic <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> affected by <b>reforms</b> adopted by other countries. A simple model of economic <b>reforms</b> <b>is</b> developed to motivate the econometric work. Unsurprisingly, the model predicts that <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> more likely when {{factors of production}} are internationally mobile and <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> pursued in other economies. More interesting is the finding that <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> not driven by greater trade openness. Using {{the change in the}} Index of Economic Freedom as the measure of marketliberalising reforms and panel data 144 countries and the years 1995 - 2006, we identify the most important channels through which <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> transmitted from country to country. We find evidence of the importance of reforms in other countries. Moreover, consistent with our model international trade is not a vehicle for the diffusion of economic reforms, rather the most important mechanism is geographical or cultural proximity...|$|R

5|$|The scandal was {{followed}} by a number of attempts to adopt campaign finance reform—spearheaded by U.S. Sen. David Boren (D-OK)—but most attempts died in committee. A weakened <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> passed in 1993. Substantial campaign finance <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> not passed until the adoption of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. Bennett would later write that the Keating Five investigation did make a difference, as members of Congress were afterward far less likely to intercede with federal investigations on behalf of contributors.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{territorial}} truncation, 14th-century Poland experienced {{a period of}} accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development of towns and their greater role in briskly growing trade, mining and metallurgy.

5|$|From 1851 to 1973, Greenlandic {{was written}} in a {{complicated}} orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time. The <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> effective and {{in the years following}} it, Greenlandic literacy received a boost.|$|E

5|$|That {{exposed the}} fact that {{domestic}} firms could not compete with foreign imports because of the overvalued currency and long-term structural problems.

5|$|The abolishment of the apothecaries' system {{meant that}} doctors' {{prescriptions}} {{had to take}} place in terms of the current civil weight: grammes and kilograms. This was considered unfeasible by many, and the state received numerous protests and asked for expertises. Nevertheless, by 1868 §4 of the earlier <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> finally put into force.|$|E
5|$|After the LCL lost {{government}} in 1970, primarily {{owing to the}} electoral reform, Hall managed to be re-elected as leader. He convinced {{a majority of the}} party's membership that <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> needed, and sought to remove the influence that the party's representatives in the Legislative Council held. When the Dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce universal suffrage to the council, Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly, but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the Legislative Council supported the bill. Internally, there was much opposition to any electoral reform when the matter was debated at party conferences.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did not itself achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E
5|$|An equally {{important}} <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, {{and the right to}} tax local areas.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. Education <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E
50|$|The reforms {{resulted}} in significant {{restructuring of the}} administrative structure and the composition of its personnel. The <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> intended to stimulate manufacturing and technology to modernize Spain. In Spanish America, the <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> designed to make the administration more efficient and to promote its economic, commercial, and fiscal development. The crown did so, hoping {{that it would have}} a positive effect on the economy of Spain. Furthermore, the Bourbon <b>Reforms</b> <b>were</b> intended to limit the power of Creoles and re-establish Spanish supremacy over the colonies.|$|R

5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930 s, <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> {{gradually}} legislated by the British; Congress won {{victories in}} the resulting elections. The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|Formed in late 1853, the Conciliation cabinet {{faced the}} Parliament {{only when it}} {{gathered}} in May 1854. Paraná presented a bill to reform the Code of Criminal Procedure, which had already been reformed in 1841. In search of support, Paraná {{went as far as}} to aid Liberal candidates in the 1854 provincial elections. The opposition by most saquaremas to this judicial <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> so fierce that a year later, Paraná (who had been raised from Viscount to Marquis in late 1854) backed down and implicitly withdrew the bill.|$|E
5|$|Healthcare <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> a major topic {{during the}} 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, {{attention}} focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's proposal would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy but rejected {{the use of an}} individual mandate.|$|E
5|$|In Prussia, {{a reform}} in 1816 defined the Prussian civil pound {{in terms of}} the Prussian foot and {{distilled}} water. It also redefined the apothecaries' pound as 12 ounces, i.e. 3/4, of the civil pound: 350.78g. This <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> not popular with apothecaries, because it broke the uniformity of the apothecaries' pound in Germany at a time when a German national state was beginning to form. It seems that many apothecaries did not follow this reduction by 2%.|$|E
