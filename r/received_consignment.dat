40|$|There {{has been}} concern {{in recent years}} {{regarding}} the efficiency of marketing of fruits and vegetables, {{and that this is}} leading to high and fluctuating consumer prices and only a small share of the consumer rupee reaching the farmers. Marketing of horticultural crops is complex especially because of perishability, seasonality and bulkiness. The study seeks to examine different aspects of their marketing, focusing particularly, on the wholesale markets for fruits and vegetables which have been established to overcome deficiencies and improve the marketing efficiency. Results indicate that in Ahmedabad the direct contact between commission agents and farmers is very low. For vegetables this is 50 percent and for fruits only 31 percent.

In the {{modelling}} of {{the flow}} of commodities from dispatching firms to <b>receiving</b> firms, <b>consignments</b> of differing amounts of the one homogeneous commodity and perceived heterogeneity across the available receiving firms in each zone are accounted for by using an information-theoretic approach with probabilities disaggregated {{in terms of the number}} of unit shipments in any consignment, conditional upon the receiving capacity of the firms. It is shown how these results may be approximately aggregated to yield results similar to those obtained via statistical mechanics. As the model does not enforce full utilization of the capacity of the receiving firms, it is potentially responsive to the consideration of impacts of factors such as differential pricing and credit conditions. Certain criteria are presented for guaranteeing good numerical properties of the solution...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we have empirically {{analyzed}} {{the factors that}} lead to longer business relationships in the logistics industry. The main conclusions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, the terms of relationships observed between the consignors and the trucking carriers that <b>receive</b> <b>consignment</b> of the transportation of the consignor’s main products have significantly positive associations {{with the level of}} information exchanged and consignments of distribution processing operations proposed by the consignee. Transaction cost economics implies that long-term relationships facilitate investment in relation-specific assets so as to improve efficiency. Then, we have sound reason to assume that the content of the shared information and the equipment for distribution processing have a significantly relation-specific nature, and accumulation of the related human capital, such as skill in workers and know-how, is important to improve efficiency of the whole logistics system. At the same time, these assets may function as hostages to maintain the long-term relationships. In regard to all of these points, the same mechanism is at work as in the commercial distribution market. The second conclusion is that the long-term business relationship is affected by the demand volatility of the consignor’s product. Consignors who belong to industries with a large volatility of demand tend to rely on transportation services procured from spot logistics markets with a shorter contract term. This finding is also consistent with previous research in the commercial distribution market. These results suggest that the mechanism to minimize transaction costs by establishing long- term business relationships is likely to exist in the logistics market. This is the same mechanism which is pointed out in the commercial distribution market. Generally, assets consisting of a system with a network structure tend to be sunken. Therefore, in order to save coordination costs which are incurred to make the whole distribution market function efficiently, long-term business relationships are indispensable. Thus, relationships between companies in the logistics market are likely to be affected by the shortening of the delivery time in the commercial distribution market. transaction cost, logistics, Japanese system, long-term relationship...|$|R
