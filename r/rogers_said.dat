500|$|Dr. Christopher Rogers {{testified in}} the trial against Dr. Conrad Murray that, in his opinion, Jackson [...] "was {{healthier}} than the average person of his age." [...] <b>Rogers</b> <b>said</b> the arteries around Jackson's heart were free of fat and cholesterol, which is unusual for a 50-year-old individual.|$|E

Davies announced RRP as the scheme architects on 16 October 1998. Richard <b>Rogers</b> <b>said</b> [...] "The idea was that steps rise {{out of the water}} and there is a whole public domain where people meet each other and look down on the Assembly Members." [...] Richard Rogers had previously designed the Lloyd's building in London and the Pompidou Centre in Paris with Renzo Piano. 11 days later, Davies resigned as Secretary of State for Wales.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, music blog This Must Be Pop {{predicted}} the song as a post-Christmas UK hit. John Watson, who co-manages Gotye with Danny <b>Rogers,</b> <b>said</b> of the single's success: [...] "We've {{never seen any}} song make a deeper or more immediate connection with so many people. It's a really special recording and video". Talking about the overwhelming reception {{and the amount of}} coverage received, Gotye commented that [...] "I don't really feel like it [...] belongs to me anymore." [...] He further explained that [...] "sometimes I feel like I'm a bit sick of it. My inbox, on any given day, has at least five covers or parodies or remixes of it and there's only so many times you can listen to the one song." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} focused on the theme of motherhood. In [...] "Mothers and Daughters/Aging and Dying", Claire Sprague wrote that Lessing often dwells on the theme of mothers passing their {{behaviours}} onto their daughters, and how the cycle of daughters fighting their mothers permeates each generation. The British novelist Jane <b>Rogers</b> <b>said</b> that The Good Terrorist [...] "is as unsparing and incisive about motherhood as it is about the extreme left", and that motherhood here [...] "is terrible": Alice's mother is reduced to despair continually yielding to her selfish daughter's demands; Alice mothers Jasper, and has a similar despairing relationship with him. Rogers added that motherhood is depicted here as a compulsion to protect the weak, despite their propensity to retaliate and hurt you.|$|E

500|$|The British singer-songwriter {{unveiled}} the album at an industry playback in London, where EMI UK and Ireland president Andria Vidler hosted the event. Mark Sutherland from Billboard {{said that the}} album [...] "marks a return to Williams' trademark pop sound after 2006's more experimental – and commercially under-performing – Rudebox". Sutherland felt {{that even though the}} lead single 'Bodies', [...] "features a refinement of the more electronic sound debuted on Rudebox, much of the album returns to the fertile, adult pop ground of Williams' previous smash hit albums Escapology and Intensive Care". He felt that the album highlights are the [...] "lush ballads 'Morning Sun' and 'You Know Me', the intricate wordplay of 'Blasphemy' and the 1980s sound of 'Last Days of Disco'", while also noting that [...] "a confident-sounding Williams also experiments with some light psychedelia on 'Deceptacon' and electronic dance music on the anthemic 'Starstruck' and 'Difficult for Weirdos'." [...] Jude Rogers from The Quietus said that the song [...] "Do You Mind?" [...] "puts Status Quo, Slade and a gallon of glam-rock in a bottle, shakes it up, and make an interesting, if rather peculiar, froth." [...] <b>Rogers</b> <b>said</b> that on the track [...] "Starstruck" [...] "Goldfrapp's Felt Mountain, The Ipcress File soundtrack and the shadow of Broadcast fall over the first ten seconds of this song about our obsession with celebrity". [...] "Deceptacon" [...] contains a [...] "peculiar set of lyrics, floating on waves of reverb, sad strings and icy keyboards" [...] <b>Rogers</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "It's an unshowy meditation the shallowness of fame, with a fantastic, mournful outro." [...] Mike Diver from BBC Music said that [...] "Bodies" [...] is [...] "A strange brew of string flourishes, rumbling low end, oriental undertones and even an Enigma-style break into Gregorian territory", Diver also said that [...] "Last Days of Disco" [...] is [...] "reminiscent of Eurythmics".|$|E
500|$|The {{next two}} singles from Steers & Stripes both made number 1 as well: [...] "Only in America" [...] and [...] "The Long Goodbye", {{the latter of}} which was written by Irish pop singers Ronan Keating and Paul Brady. After it, the duo charted at number 5 with [...] "My Heart Is Lost to You" [...] and number 12 with a cover of Kim Richey's [...] "Every River", {{featuring}} a backing vocal from Richey. All of these other singles also made the pop charts. [...] "Only in America" [...] was later used by George W. Bush in his 2004 re-election campaign, and again in 2008 by Barack Obama in his campaign. Noting that the song was used by both a Republican and a Democrat candidate, Brooks (who wrote the song with Cook and Ronnie <b>Rogers)</b> <b>said</b> that it was [...] "very flattering to know our song crossed parties and potentially inspires all Americans." ...|$|E
500|$|Rogers co-founded Action Button Entertainment {{while working}} on Ziggurat, which began with an idea Rogers had while playing Angry Birds about pushing back a swarm of bats by {{shooting}} projectiles at them. He decided {{that he could not}} make the game alone. Rogers put out a call for artists on Twitter with a submissions request of [...] "fan art of the Japanese box art of Phantasy Star II", and Action Button artist Brent Porter replied in under an hour with an entry Rogers called [...] "incredible". In mid 2011, Rogers decided to work on an iPhone game for a few weeks as a break from a larger project. <b>Rogers</b> <b>said</b> the team was convinced by his design document—this game would become Ziggurat. Rogers contacted an Internet acquaintance who had previously mocked up a design idea from Rogers's Kotaku column, programmer Michael Kerwin, who came through with a rough draft within a week. Andrew Toups converted a soundtrack created by Rogers's rock band into an 8-bit soundtrack. After six months of hiatus and working at a social games company, Rogers rekindled development and the team finished the Ziggurat, which was released in February 2012 for iOS platforms.|$|E

We {{have a really good}} car, we just had to learn to stay in the pits. We just lost too many spots on pit road that we couldn't overcome that track position. I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave <b>Rogers</b> <b>said</b> of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. I thought we had one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E
500|$|Rogers {{continued}} {{to work as a}} video game design consultant and met Bob Pelloni (of Bob's Game) at the 2010 Game Developers Conference. The two worked on games (including Ziggurat) together.

In mid 2011, Rogers decided to work on an iPhone game for a few weeks as a break from a larger project. While Pelloni was against the buttonless iPhone as a platform, <b>Rogers</b> <b>said</b> the team was convinced by his design document. He contacted an Internet acquaintance who had previously mocked up a design idea from Rogers's Kotaku column, programmer Michael Kerwin, who came through in a week with a version without graphics or sound, which was later added. Rogers recorded [...] "some insane and rough music" [...] with his band, Large Prime Numbers, that Andrew Toups converted into an 8-bit soundtrack in the [...] "original Nintendo sound format" [...] that Rogers found [...] "breathtaking". His friend, QWOP creator Bennett Foddy deemed the game [...] "sort of interesting".|$|E
500|$|Action Button Entertainment {{was founded}} by Tim Rogers. The studio {{consists}} of Tim Rogers, Brent Porter, Michael Kerwin, and Nicholas Wasilewski, who have built all of the studio's four games from Ziggurat through Videoball.

2500|$|In June 2014, Alexander's {{recently}} installed successor as the NSA's director, U.S. Navy Admiral Michael S. <b>Rogers,</b> <b>said</b> {{that while}} some terrorist groups had altered their communications to avoid surveillance techniques revealed by Snowden, the damage done overall did not lead him to conclude that [...] "the sky is falling."

2500|$|When {{asked how}} long he planned to {{continue}} coaching, <b>Rogers</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You just don't know how you're going to feel {{from one year to}} the next".

2500|$|Even Wordsworth's {{close friend}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge said (referring {{especially}} to the [...] "child-philosopher" [...] stanzas VII and VIII of [...] ) that the poems contained [...] "mental bombast". Two years later, however, many were more positive about the collection.

Critics were rebutted by public opinion, and the work gained in popularity and recognition, as did Wordsworth.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, {{her aunt}} Emilie Loew {{died in the}} U.S. Although {{virtually}} retired from the motion-picture industry since the mid-1950s, Colbert was still financially solvent enough to maintain an upscale lifestyle.

Adman Peter <b>Rogers</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Claudette was extravagant; I never, ever saw her question the price of anything."
