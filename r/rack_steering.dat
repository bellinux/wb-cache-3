5000|$|As the {{automobile}} became more known and accepted, the IAA became a fixed event in Germany, {{with at least}} one held every year, usually in Berlin. In 1902 the show was held for the first time by the Association of German Automotive Industrialists (Verein Deutscher Motorfahrzeug-Industrieller) at Berlin Friedrichstraße station. The 7th exhibition in 1905 was inaugurated by Emperor Wilhelm II and until 1907, there were even two shows per year, as production had increased to an industrial level. In the next years, however, the show was suspended, due to the outbreak of World War I. With a pause after the war, the IAA was then reinstated and returned to a newly built exhibition hall in Berlin Westend in 1921, with 67 German automobile manufacturers displaying 90 vehicles under the motto [...] "comfort", including the Rumpler Tropfenwagen and a Bosch electric car horn. More than 600 exhibitors participated in the 15th IAA in 1923 and the next year's show saw the premiere of economy cars like the Hanomag 2/10 PS or the Opel 4 PS (Laubfrosch). The 1927 IAA was held at Cologne (under pressure from Mayor Konrad Adenauer), followed by the 20th IAA in Leipzig in March 1928, nevertheless, the 21st exhibition was again held in Berlin in November. It featured the first German vehicle with a <b>rack</b> <b>steering</b> and independent suspension (Röhr 8) as well as the eight-cylinder Opel Regent luxury car and a crank operated window by Brose. The 1929, 1930, and 1932 IAA were cancelled due to the Great Depression. Despite the still perceptible after-effects of the global recession, the 22nd IAA was held in Berlin in 1931 with a total of 295,000 visitors. For the first time the exhibition included front-wheel drive vehicles like the DKW F1. The 23rd IAA was held from 11 to 23 February 1933, {{a few days after the}} Nazi seizure of power. It was inaugurated by Chancellor Adolf Hitler, who announced tax benefits for car owners, a major road construction programme and state-funded motorsport events. New models introduced included the Ford Köln, the Standard Superior, as well as the twelve-cylinder Maybach Zeppelin DS 8, then the most expensive German car ever built. In the following years, the annual exhibition developed to a national hall of fame of German engineering skill, essentially influenced by Nazi propaganda. Pushed by extensive billboard and screen advertising, the IAA finally became a mass event, with more than 600,000 visitors in 1934. In his inaugural speech, Hitler promised the construction of a cheap, simple car for the masses. He also proclaimed the idea of economic autarky, illustrated by the display of wood gas generators based on the patent of Georges Imbert or a steam car designed by Henschel. Nevertheless, the launch of the stream-lined Tatra 77 attracted greater attention.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} the stress {{analysis}} of Steering <b>Rack.</b> <b>Steering</b> Rack Bending CAE analysis technology is indispensable for developing and mass-producing the Steering Gear assembly. By using Finite Element method, a stress analysis has been carried out. Steering Rack Deflection and Bending stresses are found. These stresses are compared with analytical results. Comparison study shows good agreement of analytical results and CAE results. Modeling {{has been done by}} Creo 1. 0 and Analysis has been done by Creo Simulation...|$|E
50|$|The <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> has {{a bearing}} {{situated}} at the yoke - the interface between the <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> and the <b>steering</b> column. The yoke is designed to prevent {{the separation of the}} <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> from the <b>steering</b> column, whilst allowing the <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> to move freely the in transverse direction. The yoke determines a motorist’s ability to feel the road surface and the vehicle’s maneuverability. With their PTFE liner, composite bearings reduce friction in the steering yoke.|$|R

50|$|<b>Rack</b> and pinion <b>steering</b> may be {{susceptible}} to kickback, as the <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> transmits forces in either direction. A steering box design, such as worm and sector or recirculating ball, {{is much less}} sensitive. Despite this, the other advantages of <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering</b> have led to its almost universal adoption, at least for light automobiles.|$|R
50|$|BMW {{began to}} use <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering</b> systems in the 1930s, and many other European {{manufacturers}} adopted the technology. American automakers adopted <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering</b> beginning with the 1974 Ford Pinto.|$|R

Besides {{the design of}} steering system, the right position of steering wheel was choosen, regarding to ideal ergonomy conditions.

50|$|There {{are also}} reports {{that along with}} the ECU changes, the rev limit was raised to 7100 rpm to support the power {{increase}} at the upper rev range to support a stronger top end.

Also, the 2.0-liter EJ207 that is standard for Japanese STI's has been retained specifically for the Japanese market in the new 2015 WRX STI.|$|R

The new car entered production in early 1963 and was designated Mark II. The <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column came from the VW Beetle.

50|$|The Camargue shared its {{platform}} with the Rolls-Royce Corniche and Silver Shadow. It was {{powered by the}} same 6.75 L V8 engine as the Silver Shadow, although the Camargue was slightly more powerful. The transmission was also carried over — a General Motors Turbo-Hydramatic 3-speed automatic. The first 65 Camargues produced used SU carburettors, while the remaining 471 used Solex units. The Camargue was fitted with the Silver Shadow II's power <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering</b> <b>rack</b> in February 1977. In 1979, it received the rear independent suspension of the Silver Spirit.|$|R
50|$|Issigonis' design {{included}} the same ideas he had {{proposed for the}} Ten before the war: independent suspension and <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering,</b> plus the continued use of unitary construction. In {{the case of the}} Mosquito, Issigonis was inspired by the Citroën Traction Avant, a car he greatly admired, and he proposed using torsion bars on each wheel, as on the Citroën, rather than the usual coil spring system. The French car, launched in 1934, had also been an early example of the use of <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering</b> {{provides}} {{a minimum of}} play and friction. The light weight assures light steering without power assistance, even with very large tyres. The ratio is quick.|$|R

50|$|It changed name to Alforder Newton Ltd (1959) {{as it was}} {{acquired}} by Standard Motor Company, a purchase that financially troubled the buyer greatly.http://www.kingswayrc.com/txtr/Resources.pdf. A <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering</b> setup {{was used in the}} Triumph TR4 and Triumph Spitfire which, together with the Herald steering column, {{became one of the most}} widely used assemblies in the British specialist car industry during the 1950s and 1960s, including Turner and TVR. Even the Lotus lineup - Elan, Plus2, Europa - used the Alford & Alder <b>steering</b> <b>rack,</b> column and uprights. They also made suspension components for the Maserati 3500.|$|R

50|$|The chassis {{included}} <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>steering,</b> {{independent suspension}} with struts in front, {{as well as}} 4-links and coil springs in back. Disc brakes {{were used in the}} front and Drum Brakes were used in the rear.|$|R
