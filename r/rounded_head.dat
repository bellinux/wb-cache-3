5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, <b>rounded</b> <b>head</b> crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E

25|$|English Shepherds {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to Border Collies and Australian Shepherds. English Shepherds usually have tails and a less <b>rounded</b> <b>head</b> than many Aussies. English Shepherds are never merle as Aussies frequently are. They are generally not square in body like an Aussie. English Shepherds tend to be larger than Border Collies but are most readily distinguished from Border Collies by their very different upright, loose-eyed herding style.|$|E
25|$|The toothless lower jaws of Gigantoraptor are fused into a broad shovel-like mandibula. They {{indicate}} that the unknown skull was over half a metre long and toothless also, probably equipped with a horny beak. The front tail vertebrae have very long neural spines and are heavily pneumaticised with deep pleurocoels. The middle section of the relatively short tail is somewhat stiffened by long prezygapophyses. The back tail vertebrae are lightened by spongeous bone. The front limb is rather long because of an elongated slender hand. The humerus is bowed outwards to an exceptionally large extent and has a very <b>rounded</b> <b>head.</b> The first metacarpal is very short and carries a strongly diverging thumb. The hindlimb is also long because of an elongated lower leg. The thighbone is relatively slender and short with a distinct head and neck. The foot is robust with large and strongly curved toe claws.|$|E

25|$|Like other angel sharks, S. caillieti has a flattened, ray-like {{form with}} greatly {{enlarged}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The horizontal {{edges of the}} broad, <b>rounded</b> <b>head</b> bear enlarged folds of skin. The large nostrils are teardrop-shaped and preceded by flaps of skin enlarged into two cylindrical barbels that overhang the mouth. The eyes are horizontally oval and placed relatively close together. Behind the eyes are crescent-shaped spiracles, which are spaced further apart than the eyes and bear prominent papillae (nipple-shaped structures) along their posterior inner rims. The mouth is wide and terminally placed on the snout, with furrows at the corners {{and the center of}} the upper lip forming a rounded arch. The upper and lower jaws contain 10 and 9 tooth rows respectively on either side; the teeth are small, conical, and sharp. The five pairs of gill slits are laterally situated on the head.|$|E
25|$|Basal forms have a forelimb that {{is still}} {{functionally}} differentiated, in some details resembling the arm of their land-dwelling forebears; the ulna and radius are elongated and somewhat separated; the carpals are rounded, allowing the wrist to rotate; the number of phalanges is within the range shown by land animals. Ichthyosaurs proper, to the contrary, have a forelimb that is fully adapted to its function as a flipper. However, the adaptations are very variable. Triassic species typically have a very derived humerus, changed into a disc. Jurassic species {{tend to have a}} more elongated humeral form with a <b>rounded</b> <b>head,</b> narrow shaft, and expanded lower end. The radius and ulna are always strongly flattened, but can be circular, with or without notch, or have a waist. Notches can be homologous to the original shafts, but also be newly formed. Jurassic forms no longer have a space, the spatium interosseum, between the radius and ulna. Often, the latter bones gradually merge into lower, disc-shaped elements - the up to four carpals which again differ little in form from the up to five metacarpals.|$|E

However, unlike bowfin which are native to North America, the northern snakehead is considered an invasive species and environmentally harmful.

500|$|Amongst the {{artefacts}} {{dated to}} the later Pictish period is a bone pin with a <b>rounded</b> <b>head</b> probably {{used as a}} hair or dress pin. It has been dated to AD 500–800.

One of only two Pictish symbol stones found in Shetland was found here, exhibiting a double disc shape and a Z-rod. Pottery finds include buff ware from the period after AD 10, including bowls with flat rims. The quality of the pots appears to decline in the period prior to Viking settlement, becoming thinner-walled and generally more crude in design.|$|E
500|$|The cheetah [...] (Acinonyx jubatus) {{is a large}} felid of the {{subfamily}} Felinae {{that occurs}} mainly in eastern and southern Africa and a few parts of Iran.

The cheetah is characterised by a slender body, deep chest, spotted coat, a small <b>rounded</b> <b>head,</b> black tear-like streaks on the face, long thin legs and a long spotted tail. Its lightly built, slender form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of the big cats, making it more similar to the cougar.
