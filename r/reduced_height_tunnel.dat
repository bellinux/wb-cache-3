50|$|Eagle's Nest Tunnel and Sha Tin <b>Heights</b> <b>Tunnel</b> are road tunnels in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Both tunnels were officially {{opened on}} 21 March 2008. The tunnels connect Cheung Sha Wan through Eagle's Nest hill to Tai Wai, and are linked by a shared toll plaza. Eagle's Nest Tunnel is {{connected}} at its southern end to Stonecutters Bridge and Ching Cheung Road, whereas Sha Tin <b>Heights</b> <b>Tunnel</b> is linked {{at the northern}} end to Che Kung Miu Road and Tai Po Road. The tunnels {{are part of the}} Tsing Sha Highway of Route 8, and were constructed in anticipation of future traffic demands generated by development in the northeast New Territories. The combined toll for the two tunnels is HK$8 (for private cars).|$|R

40|$|Phased array antennas {{with high}} {{directivity}} {{have a variety}} of applications. One of their applications is in RF heating for magnetically confined plasma fusion research. Among these RF heating schemes, waveguide arrays with careful phase control on each waveguide can act as a phased array antenna to deliver megawatts of power for heating fusion plasmas in the lower-hybrid range of frequencies (1 GHz- 10 GHz). In order to achieve compactness, it is common to stack <b>reduced</b> <b>height</b> waveguide together to form the waveguide array. As long as the delivered power does not cause arcing in the waveguide, the waveguide height can be quite small. Due to this confined space in a stack of <b>reduced</b> <b>height</b> waveguides, power detection of the incident and reflected wave in the <b>reduced</b> <b>height</b> waveguide is extremely difficult. A new compact probe, which employs current loops, to monitor the incident and reflected wave from the narrow side of the <b>reduced</b> <b>height</b> waveguide has been developed. Its theory and performance will be reported in this paper...|$|R

50|$|A similar {{phenomenon}} exists {{with the}} Lion Rock Tunnel between Sha Tin New Town (and {{the rest of}} the eastern and northeastern New Territories) and New Kowloon.

Juveniles exhibit greater stunting than adults, leading us to conclude that smallpox was not a proxy for overcrowding.

40|$|Mistrust {{of others}} may build upon {{perceptions}} of the self as vulnerable, consistent with an association of paranoia with perceived lower social rank.

Height was manipulated within an immersive virtual reality simulation. Sixty females who reported paranoia experienced a virtual reality train ride twice: at their normal and <b>reduced</b> <b>height.</b> Paranoia and social comparison were assessed. <b>Reducing</b> a person's <b>height</b> resulted in more negative views of the self in comparison with other people and increased levels of paranoia.
