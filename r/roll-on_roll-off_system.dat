40|$|Regular {{maritime}} {{lines with}} <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> vessels must offer a reliable service without substantial cost increases {{in order to}} be competitive. Port terminals {{need to be able to}} respond quickly to any disturbance that might appear and return to a smooth operational state in the minimum amount of time (resilient terminals). In this paper a complete taxonomy of the disturbances affecting the operational processes in a <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> terminal is introduced together with a system able to assess the performance of any measure used to mitigate them. The study is based on an overview of the existing literature on the topic, a detailed diagram of the operational processes of the terminal, and an exhaustive set of interviews of the staff involved in the processes occurring in a <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> terminal, together with field measurements. The main vulnerabilities are identified and possible corrective and preventive measures are pointed out. Postprint (published version...|$|R
