5|$|Frustrated at {{negotiations}} with the Republic and believing it weakened by both the Darul Islam and Madiun insurgencies, the Dutch launched a military offensive on 19 December 1948 which it termed 'Operatie Kraai' (Operation Crow). By the following day it had conquered the city of Yogyakarta, {{the location of the}} temporary Republican capital. By the end of December, all major Republican held cities in Java and Sumatra were in Dutch hands. The Republican President, Vice-President, and all but six <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> ministers were captured by Dutch troops and exiled on Bangka Island off the east coast of Sumatra. In areas surrounding Yogyakarta and Surakarta, Republican forces refused to surrender and continued to wage a guerrilla war under the leadership of Republican military chief of staff General Sudirman who had escaped the Dutch offensives. An emergency Republican government, the Pemerintahan Darurat Republik Indonesia (PDRI), was established in West Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Sarumpaet {{was born}} on 16 July 1949 in Tarutung, North Tapanuli Regency, North Sumatra. She was the fifth of ten {{children}} born to Saladin Sarumpaet, Minister of Defence in the Revolutionary Government of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> rebel government, and Julia Hutabarat, a women's rights activist. Both were also prominent in the Christian community. Three of her siblings– Mutiara Sani, Riris Sarumpaet and Sam Sarumpaet– {{are members of the}} Indonesian art community. As a teenager she moved to Jakarta to study there, finishing her high school studies at PSKD Menteng. In his biography, her classmate Chrisye recalled that Sarumpaet was very confident; he noted that she enjoyed writing poetry and then reading it in a loud voice while other students were engaging in other activities.|$|E
5|$|Republican-controlled Java and Sumatra {{together}} {{formed a}} single state in the sixteen-state RUSI federation, but accounted for almost half its population. The other fifteen 'federal' states had been created by the Netherlands since 1945. These states were dissolved into the Republic over {{the first half of}} 1950. An abortive anti-Republic coup in Bandung and Jakarta by Westerling's Legion of Ratu Adil (APRA) on 23 January 1950 resulted in the dissolution of the populous Pasundan state in West Java, thus quickening the dissolution of the federal structure. Colonial soldiers, who were largely Ambonese, clashed with Republican troops in Makassar during the Makassar Uprising in April 1950. The predominantly Christian Ambonese were from one of the few regions with pro-Dutch sentiments and they were suspicious of the Javanese Muslim-dominated Republic, whom they unfavourably regarded as leftists. On 25 April 1950, an independent Republic of South Maluku (RMS) was proclaimed in Ambon but this was suppressed by Republican troops during a campaign from July to November. With the state of East Sumatra now being the only federal state remaining, it too folded and fell in line with the unitary Republic. On 17 August 1950, the fifth anniversary of his declaration of Indonesian independence, Sukarno proclaimed the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> as a unitary state.|$|E
50|$|In October 1945, Laskar Hitam, a Muslim militia was {{established}} in Tangerang. The goal of this movement was to establish an Islamic nation in Indonesia.

25|$|Efforts by the Dutch to find {{a federal}} {{solution}} for Indonesia included {{the establishment of the}} State of East Indonesia or Negara Indonesia Timur (NIT) in 1946. Mononutu {{became a member of the}} NIT parliament and headed the group of parliament members who were pro-republic. He focused his efforts to persuade other members of parliament to support the notion of unifying NIT with the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia.</b> After the Dutch military offensive against the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> called Operation Product or Agresi Militer Belanda I in 1947, Mononutu established the Unified Struggle for Indonesian Independence or Gabungan Perjuangan Kemerdekaan Indonesia. This organization sought to highlight the actions of the Dutch to keep Indonesia as its colony. In February 1948, he led a delegation of NIT officials to visit and meet with the leaders of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> in Yogyakarta. In 1949, NIT became a constituent of the newly formed United States of Indonesia or Republik Indonesia Serikat (RIS), which was then dissolved on 17 August 1950 and replaced by a unitary <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia.</b>|$|E

25|$|In February 1958 a {{coup attempt}} was made by pro-U.S. forces amongst the {{military}} and the political right-wing.

50|$|During the Indonesian National Revolution, the KNIL's {{officers}} were still largely Dutch and Eurasians {{although most of}} its troops were recruited from predominantly Christian eastern Indonesia, particularly the South Moluccas, Timor and Manado. Although there were smaller numbers of Javanese, Sundanese, Sumatran and other Muslim troops in Dutch service, these received comparatively lower rates of pay than their Christian counterparts, leading to resentment and distrust. The Dutch sought {{to take advantage of}} these ethnic tensions by claiming that the Ambonese would lose their special privileges and pensions under a Javanese-dominated government. As noted above, these factors contributed to clashes between demobilised KNIL units and the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia's</b> military throughout 1950.|$|R
