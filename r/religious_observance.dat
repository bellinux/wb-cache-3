5|$|Despite these {{frightening}} character traits, however, Edward's contemporaries {{considered him}} an able, even an ideal, king. Though not loved by his subjects, he was feared and respected. He met contemporary expectations of kingship {{in his role}} as an able, determined soldier and in his embodiment of shared chivalric ideals. In <b>religious</b> <b>observance</b> he also fulfilled the expectations of his age: he attended chapel regularly and gave alms generously.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Olga {{frequently}} went on {{hikes in}} the forests around Gatchina with their father, who {{took the opportunity to}} teach them woodsmanship. Physical activities such as equestrianism were also taught at an early age, as was <b>religious</b> <b>observance.</b> Though Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, Lent was strictly observed—meat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided. Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof Palace and with Michael's grandparents in Denmark.|$|E

5|$|Smuts's <b>religious</b> <b>observance</b> was unsurprising in one who whose moral outlook {{was based}} {{exclusively}} upon Biblical teachings {{and who was}} destined for a future in the Church. Yet, though religion continued to serve in this central role, his studies at Stellenbosch, with their decidedly scientific bias, led Smuts towards a more critical examination of his faith. From this time onwards Smuts was, by gradual degrees, to start {{to move away from}} the uncompromisingly Calvinist outlook within which he had been raised.|$|E
5|$|Kraków {{contains}} also {{an outstanding}} collection of monuments of Jewish sacred architecture unmatched anywhere in Poland. Kraków was an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, with all its manifestations of <b>religious</b> <b>observance</b> from Orthodox to Chasidic and Reform flourishing side by side. There were at least 90 synagogues in Kraków active before the Nazi German invasion of Poland, serving its burgeoning Jewish community of 60,000–80,000 (out of the city's total population of 237,000), established since the early 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Section116 of the Constitution of Australia precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (i.e., {{the federal}} parliament) from making laws for {{establishing}} any religion, imposing any <b>religious</b> <b>observance,</b> or prohibiting {{the free exercise}} of any religion. Section116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The product of a compromise in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions, Section116 is based on similar provisions in the United States Constitution. However, Section116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the states of Australia from making such laws.|$|E

5|$|With the {{emergence}} of the Second Polish Republic, Kraków resumed its role as a major academic and cultural centre, with the establishment of new universities such as the AGH University of Science and Technology and the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, including a number of new and essential vocational schools. It became an important cultural centre for the Polish Jews with a Zionist youth movement relatively strong among the city's Jewish population. Kraków was also an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life, with all its manifestations of <b>religious</b> <b>observance</b> from Orthodox, to Chasidic and Reform flourishing side by side.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} {{position of}} Islamic scholars {{had been that}} a Muslim could not stay {{in a country where}} rulers made proper <b>religious</b> <b>observance</b> impossible: therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave when they were able to. Even before the systematic forced conversion, religious leaders had argued that Muslims in Christian territory would be subject to direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from eroding. Ahmad al-Wansharis, the contemporary North African scholar and leading authority on Spanish Muslims, wrote in 1491 that emigrating from Christian to Muslim lands was compulsory in almost all circumstances. Further, he urged severe punishment for Muslims who remained and predicted that they would temporarily dwell in hell in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Sviatoslav's family life. It is {{possible}} {{that he was not}} the only (or the eldest) son of his parents. The Russo-Byzantine treaty of 945 mentions a certain Predslava, Volodislav's wife, as the noblest of the Rus' women after Olga. The fact that Predslava was Oleg's mother is presented by Vasily Tatishchev. He also speculated that Predslava was of a Hungarian nobility. George Vernadsky was among many historians to speculate that Volodislav was Igor's eldest son and heir who died at some point during Olga's regency. Another chronicle told that Oleg (? - 944?) was the eldest son of Igor. At the time of Igor's death, Sviatoslav was still a child, and he was raised by his mother or under her instructions. Her influence, however, did not extend to his <b>religious</b> <b>observance.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The 1992 cookbook, Who's Your Mama, Are You Catholic and Can You Make a Roux, by Cajun chef Marcelle Bienvenue, {{outlines}} long-standing {{beliefs that}} Cajun identity {{was rooted in}} community, cuisine, and very specifically, devout Roman Catholicism. Traditional Catholic <b>religious</b> <b>observances</b> such as Mardi Gras, Lent, and Holy Week are integral to many Cajun communities. Likewise, these traditional Catholic <b>religious</b> <b>observances</b> may further be understood from Cultural Catholicism in Cajun-Creole Louisiana by Marcia Gaudet which tells that such traditional <b>religious</b> <b>observances,</b> although {{they may not be}} [...] "strictly theological and liturgical forms", are still integral and necessary to many and remain religiously valid as [...] "unofficial religious customs and traditions are certainly a part of Roman Catholicism as it is practiced".|$|R
5|$|For George III, Pitt's {{appointment}} {{was a great}} victory. It proved {{that he was able}} to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of <b>religious</b> <b>observance</b> and virtue. When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Oran fatwa, the {{predominant}} position of Islamic scholars {{had been that}} a Muslim could not stay {{in a country where}} rulers made proper <b>religious</b> <b>observance</b> impossible. Therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave, when they were able to do so. Even before the systematic forcible conversion, religious leaders had argued that Muslims in Christian territory would be subject to direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from erosion.

25|$|In Europe, {{there has}} been a general move away from <b>religious</b> <b>observance</b> and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards secularism. The Enlightenment is largely {{responsible}} for the spread of secularism. Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism, attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant countries. In North America, South America and Australia Christian <b>religious</b> <b>observance</b> is much higher than in Europe. United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other developed countries. South America, historically Roman Catholic, has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries.|$|E
