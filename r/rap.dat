5|$|Gangsta <b>rap</b> {{is a kind}} of hip hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality and a dangerous, criminal image. Though the origins of gangsta <b>rap</b> {{can be traced back to}} the mid-1980s raps of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style is usually said to have begun in the Los Angeles and Oakland area, where Too Short, NWA and others found their fame. This West Coast <b>rap</b> scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta <b>rap</b> lyrics with a thick and hazy tone, often relying on samples from 1970s P-funk; the best-known proponents of this sound were the breakthrough rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.|$|E

Though the origins of gangsta <b>rap</b> {{can be traced back to}} the mid-1980s style of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country, to rappers from New York, such as Notorious B.I.G and influential hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, and to rappers on the West Coast, such as Too Short and N.W.A. A distinctive West Coast <b>rap</b> scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta <b>rap</b> lyrics with a thick and hazy sound, often from 1970s funk samples; the best-known proponents were the rappers 2Pac, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. Gangsta <b>rap</b> continued to exert a major presence in American popular music through the end of the 1990s and early into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|In late 1991, {{the group}} had the problem of having spent more money on {{production}} than was covered by returns. The group decided that its gangsta <b>rap</b> style was the cause: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, {{making it difficult for}} Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. Referring to local rapper Esham's horrorcore style, Bruce suggested the band adapt this genre, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid <b>rap,</b> much as Los Angeles represented gangsta <b>rap.</b> The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to <b>rap</b> openly about Satan, which Esham often did.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of collecting <b>rapping</b> system in electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and controlling the relevant damage under impact loading, fatigue durability of this system is analyzed in the present study based on the numerical and experimental results considering fatigue damage growth and vibration acceleration in the collecting system because of the successive impact of <b>rapping</b> hammers.
