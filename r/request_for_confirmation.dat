40|$|Abstract in Undetermined This study {{examined}} the relationship between speech recognition, working memory and conversational skills in a group of 13 children/adolescents with cochlear implants (CIs) between 11 and 19 years of age. Conversational skills were assessed in a referential communication task where the participants interacted with a hearing peer of the same age and gender. The measures were the number of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification produced, time used to solve the task and the proportion of the different types of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification made by the participants with CIs. The results revealed that speech recognition correlated significantly with the general measures of conversational skills (time to solve the task and the total number of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification used). General working memory was associated with certain types of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification. The participants with better working memory capacity used more <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation</b> of new information (i. e. made more suggestions of their own) and fewer <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation</b> of already given information compared to the participants with poorer working memory.

40|$|Some pragmatic markers have {{specific}} interpersonal functions, such as confirming shared assumptions and requesting confirmation (Brinton 1996 : 38). This {{is the case}} of the three cognate discourse markers (also referred to as pragmatic marker or discourse particle) hé/hè in Dutch, hein in French and eh in Italian, which express confirmation and/or <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation.</b> From an onomasiologic exploratory research based on corpus dialogues excerpts gathered from the CGN (spoken Dutch from Belgium and the Netherlands), the Clapi (spoken French from France), the Valibel (spoken French from Belgium) and the LIP (spoken Italian) corpora, it emerged that these three markers are used as devices to ask the interlocutor to agree on something and/or to check that he/she is following the thread of discourse. In addition, these three markers are particularly likely to occur in the right periphery, that is, the portion of utterance following the verbal dependency structure. (1) A: da 's raar hé (that's weird, huh) B: ja (yes) [CGN] (2) A:il est resté dedans hein (he stayed in, eh) B: oui |- hein (yes-huh) [Valibel] (3) A: ahah in alto mare eh (ahah {{we have a long way}} to go, huh) B: gomme siamo in alto mare (tires we have a long way to go) [LIP] The right periphery is a strategic position where discourse markers tend to express modal (Traugott 2007, Waltereit & Detges 2007) or interpersonal (Brinton 1996) functions rather than information structuring ones. It is the best place to comment on the message and to express attitudes because the stated message is accessible to both the speaker and the hearer (Waltereit & Detges 2004). In the right periphery, the interlocutors can take, give or even keep the turn. This explains why, in this position, creativity and/or diplomacy are required (Auer 1992 : 52). The right periphery forms a “stress point” in the fabric of discourse, where discourse structure is negotiated among speakers. Following this line, discourse markers are one of the devices useful to hold or give the turn. This is why we take into account both the end of turn and the right periphery in order to analyze the selected discourse markers. There is evidence that the right periphery favors the expression of metadiscursive/intersubjective meanings (Barth-Weingarten & Couper-Kuhlen 2002; Kuno 1974; Mulder & Thompson 2008; Strauss & Xiang 2009; Traugott 2007, 2010; Verstraete 2004; Waltereit & Detges 2007). Concerning the interpersonal function of discourse markers, we conceive it as the way by which the speaker and the hearer mutually rely on shared assumptions and express attention towards the addressee (Traugott 2010). The aim of this paper is to explore the issue of interpersonal meaning in the right periphery: does the discourse marker impose the function to the right periphery or does the discourse marker absorb the function of the right periphery. In order to understand whether discourse markers occurring in the right periphery inherit interpersonal meanings from the position in which they stand or if, in contrast, they carry interpersonal meaning on their own, we propose to compare the study of the three cognates discourse markers hé/hè, hein and eh to the occurrences in the right periphery of three other cognate discourse markers, namely dan in Dutch, alors in French and allora in Italian. The second set of markers is more versatile with respect to the position and the meaning (among other functions, they are also used as (<b>request</b> <b>for)</b> <b>confirmation</b> markers). In addition, this second set of markers differs from the first one because the markers are connective in nature and their core meaning is not interpersonal, while hé/hè, hein and eh are punctuators with strong interpersonal meaning. Our approach is top-down since we focus on specific discourse markers as well as their position to find the (<b>request</b> <b>for)</b> <b>confirmation</b> function. Given the interpersonal nature of the markers under investigation, we chose to focus on spontaneous conversations, where these markers are more likely to occur, especially in the right-periphery. In this paper, we will show the results of 50 randomly selected occurrences of each discourse marker studied: - Dutch discourse markers hé/hè and dan extracted from the CGN corpus; - French discourse markers hein and alors extracted from the Valibel corpus, and from the CLAPI corpus; - Italian discourse makers eh and allora extracted from the LIP corpus. The methodology adopted is a parametric analysis (cf. Degand & Bestgen 2004; Spooren & Degand 2010), in which the variables are clearly defined in order to avoid ambiguous variables and maximize the replicability of the study. The parameters of variation we will focus on are: - the position of the marker (right position – end of the turn); - the collocation; - the speech functions (to open or to sustain by continuing or reacting); - the (<b>request</b> <b>for)</b> <b>confirmation</b> meaning...|$|E
40|$|This study uses {{conversation}} {{analysis to}} investigate questions and question-response sequences in a semi-casual conversation like prank calls. The {{conversation in the}} Gotcha prank calls are built upon question-response sequences. The study aims {{to find out what}} types of questions are constructed in Gotcha calls and to what extent would the negotiation of questions and responses show power in Gotcha calls. Thirty Gotcha prank calls related to financial issues were selected for the analysis. The analysis of the question-response sequences was done based on an adapted coding scheme by Stivers & Enfield (2010) and Wang (2006). The questions were categorised based on the functions of the questions in the conversation. Thus, the questions were grouped based on the social action of the question which was either to request for information, <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation,</b> to suggest, make assessment or initiation of repair. The findings show that request for information was primarily used to get facts related to the fabricated situations. Questions were also divided into Yes/No questions and Wh-questions while the responses were divided into answers, non answers or no response. The Yes/No questions restrict the responses and show authority while the answers prove to have the authoritative questions accomplishes its demands. The pranksters dominated majority of the calls using their institutional power while the victims of the calls also dominated some calls using their strong knowledge schema to demonstrate authority over the pranksters.

40|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of 350 questions and their responses in a corpus of ordinary interactions, this paper gives a descriptive overview of the ways Dutch interactants formulate their utterances to make them recognizable as doing questioning and the options they rely on to respond to these questions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates repetitional utterances mobilized {{in response}} to yes/no polar questions in Korean conversation. In {{an effort to keep}} the initiating action constant, the questions were restricted to those that primarily request confirmation. Repetitional responses in such sequences can be categorized into two types: minimal repeats and non-minimal repeats. Research indicates that minimal repeats tend to promote a closure of the current sequence, with the respondents not elaborating further on the response. By doing so, the respondents signal that they have understood the question as a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation</b> and that they will orient to the question precisely as such. Non-minimal repeats carry “extra” components that can be omitted without damaging the comprehensibility of the turn. The findings of this study have shown that these extra elements are not randomly chosen but are closely related to what the response attempts to do beyond confirming the question. Furthermore, non-minimal repeats tend to be followed by further talk from the respondents. Repetition in disaffirmative responses has also been analyzed. As a dispreferred action, repetitional responses for disconfirmation show different sequential development patterns than their affirmative counterparts. Disconfirmatory repetitional responses have thus been examined with reference to specific grammatical structures with which they are frequently deployed, such as -(nu) ntey ‘but’ and -i/ka aniko ‘{it} is not - but. ’By examining ways in which repetition comes into play in responsive turns, this dissertation demonstrates 1) the systematicity underlying the deployment of repetitional responses in Korean question-answer sequences, 2) the relationship between the forms and functions of repetitional responses, and 3) the interactional functions of repetition as a resource for question recipients to display their understanding and orientation vis-?-vis the prior question...|$|E
40|$|The {{confirmation}} of surrogate motherhood agreements {{has become a}} focus point of attention since the reporting of the judgment in Ex parte WH (2011 6 SA 514 (GNP) (for which see, Carnelley "Ex parte WH 2011 6 SA 514 (GNP) " 2012 De Jure 179; Pillay & Zaal "Surrogate motherhood confirmation hearings: The advent of a fundamentally flawed process" 2013 THRHR 475; Bonthuys & Broeders "Guidelines for the approval of surrogate motherhood agreements: Ex parte WH" 2013 THRHR 485; Louw "Surrogacy in South Africa: Should we reconsider the current approach? 2013 THRHR 564; Nicholson C "Surrogate motherhood agreements and their confirmation: A new challenge for practitioners?" 2013 De Jure 510). There seems to be general consensus that the judgment has not provided the anticipated, much needed guidance. The discrepancy between what the court preached and what it practiced (as succinctly phrased by Pillay & Zaal 2013 THRHR 483) {{as far as the}} enforcement of the surrogacy provisions is concerned, forms a central theme throughout the published comments which, without exception, have been negative to varying degrees.

40|$|Background: This study {{investigates the}} use of {{requests}} for clarification in conversations between teenagers with a cochlear implant (CI) and hearing peers. So far very few {{studies have focused on}} conversational abilities in children with CI. Aims: The aim was to explore co-construction of dialogue in a referential communication task and the participation of the teenagers with CI in comparison with individually matched hearing children and teenagers (HC) by studying {{the use of}} requests for clarification. Methods & Procedures: Sixteen conversational pairs participated: eight pairs consisting of a child with CI and his/her hearing conversational partner (CIP); and eight pairs consisting of an HC and a conversational partner (HCP). The conversational pairs were videotaped while carrying out a referential communication task requiring the description of two sets of pictures depicting faces. The dialogues were transcribed and analysed with respect to the number of words and turns, the time it took for each pair to complete the tasks, and the occurrence and different types of requests for clarification that were used in each type of conversational pair and in each type of dialogue. Outcomes & Results: The main finding was that the teenagers with CI produced significantly more requests for clarification than the HCs. The most frequently used type of request for clarification in all dialogues was <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation</b> of new information. Furthermore, there was a trend for the teenagers with CI to use this type of request more often than the HC. In contrast, the teenagers with CI used significantly fewer requests for confirmation of already given information and fewer requests for elaboration than the HC. Conclusions & Implications: The deaf teenagers with CI in the study seem to be equally collaborative and responsible conversational partners as the hearing teenagers. The interpretation is that certain conditions in this study facilitate their participation in conversation. Such conditions might be a calm environment, a task that is structured and without time limits and that the partner is well known to the teenager with CI...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study investigates {{responses}} to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification in conversations between children/adolescents with cochlear implant (CI) and normally hearing peers. Earlier studies have interpreted a more {{frequent use of}} requests of confirmation (yes/no interrogatives) in the CI group as a conversational strategy used to prevent communication breakdowns and control {{the development of the}} conversation. This study provides a continuation of this line of research, now focusing on {{responses to}} <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification. Aims: The aim was to examine the type and distribution of responses to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification in a referential communication task. In addition, we analysed the compliance between the type of response and the type of request as a measure of mutual adaptation. Methods & Procedures: Twenty-six conversational pairs aged 10 - 19 years participated: 13 pairs consisting of a child/adolescent with CI (CI) and a conversational partner (CIP); and 13 pairs consisting of a normally hearing control (NH) and a conversational partner (NHP). The pairs performed a referential communication task requiring the description of faces. All occurrences of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification and their responses in the dialogues were identified and categorized. We also analysed how the different types of requests and responses were combined and the type-conformity of the responses to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation.</b> Outcomes & Results: The results showed no significant group differences regarding type, distribution or type-conformity of responses. In all four groups (CI, CIP, NH and NHP), a discrepancy between the request and the response was found, indicating that the response provided information that was not explicitly <b>requested.</b> <b>Requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation</b> constituted 78 - 90 % of the requests, whereas only 54 - 61 % of responses were confirmations. Conversely, the proportion of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> elaboration was 6 - 15 %, whereas the proportion of elaborated responses was 34 - 40 %. Conclusions & Implications: The children/adolescents with CI contribute equally to the conversation regarding type and distribution of responses to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification. The frequent use of elaborated responses indicates common ground for the conversational partners and a shared understanding of the objective of the task. The context creates facilitative conditions, with positive interactional consequences. The results have implications for the design of intervention, where tasks such as this {{can be used to make}} children with CI more aware of the role of questioning strategies in interaction...|$|R

In spite of the attempt of the local elite to prove that the Noble council of Nin was equal in its prerogatives to other estate corporations of nobility in Dalmatia during Venetian and First Austrian government of Dalmatia, this action did not reach a favourable end, since the Vienna Court took firm stand that belonging to the Noble council of Nin and consequently nobility of Nin is not accepted as nobility within the borders of Austrian Empire, as was allowed to the nobility of the cities of Zadar, Trogir, Split, Kotor and the nobility of former Republic of Dubrovnik. Confirmation of nobility of Nin was requested for 52 noble families, whose members were listed by their names in the attached list.

I then show additional features that characterize their actual implementation in conversation such as their minimality (often the subject or the verb is only implied) and the usual occurrence of speaker gaze towards the recipient during questions.

40|$|The {{retelling of}} a {{familiar}} story is analyzed as a narrative event, particularly when {{the story is told}} by more than one person in a group. Three important functions of retelling a familiar story are identified: (1) to foster group rapport; (2) to ratify group membership; and (3) to;onvey group values. Often the three functions co-exist in the same narrative event, while one function may dominate a whole narrative or section of it. For each function, the analysis draws on one or more narratives or narrative segments, transcribed here, and focuses on forms of interaction, turn-taking, verb forms, and use of language. Familiar stories are tellable under different circumstances from original stories, depending on the dynamics of the narrative event itself rather than on its newsworthiness. Structural markers of re-told tales include prefaces such as "the story about " and questions beginning with "remember. " Participants check their own recollection of the story with open-ended statements and <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation.</b> Retelling often serves an informing function because participants gain new insights into the events narrated through dynamic give-and-take.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive classification of basic illocutions in Modern Greek, extracted following the linguistic choices speakers make when they formulate an utterance, provided such choices {{form part of}} a language’s grammar. Our approach lies on the interface between Morphosyntax, Pragmatics and Phonology and allows for basic illocutions to be established depending on the particular verb mood, particle, number, person, aspect and segmental marker, {{as well as the}} prosodic contour used when an utterance is realized. Our results show that Indicative uses, for example, are mostly associated with propositional illocutions, consisting of declarative uses, including assertions, miratives, and assertions in disguise; interrogative uses, including polar and content interrogatives; and behavioral illocutions i. e. exhortations (expressed in first person plural only). Secondary sentence types, (involving additional segmental marking) include <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation,</b> wondering, expression of uncertainty and proffer. In this paper we discuss propositional uses only. Such a theoretical approach can have a direct impact on applications involving Human-Computer Interaction, including intention-based dialogue systems’ modeling, natural language interfaces to Data Bases and Intelligent Agents as well as Belief, Desire and Intention systems, which require the computer to be able to interpret what a user’s objective (intention) is, so that the users’ needs can be best served...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to discuss how ?soliciting? (non-native speakers? {{requests}} of native speakers for help in how to express themselves in a foreign language) may play a part in the triggering of SPAs (Séquences Potentiellement Acquisitionnelles or ?learning?teaching sequences?). The beneficial effect of SPAs for learning is still controversial, since no correlation has yet been shown between the occurrence of SPAs and the development of linguistic competence. The present study discusses how the form of the SPA, as an interactional sequence, may vary with the type of soliciting by which it may be triggered. The corpus examined consists of exolingual interactions between six Swedish learners of French and two native speakers of French. The interactions consist of semi-guided interviews, two elicitation tasks and a spoken-translation task (from Swedish to French). After an introductory chapter, situating both the notion of soliciting and the SPA in the general framework of the socio-interactionist perspective on language learning (Chapter 2), a detailed presentation of the corpus analysed is made (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 describes different types of soliciting on which the analyses in Chapters 5 to 7 are based. Chapter 5 deals with the study of the relationship between the different ways of soliciting and the development of interaction. This chapter concludes with a description of the different interactional formats triggered by soliciting. Chapter 6 discusses, in the light of Activity Theory, the relationship between soliciting and task. Since soliciting is considered as an action taken by the learner to reach a goal, the question is whether differences can be seen between tasks and interview in terms of the learners? goals. Chapter 7 is a longitudinal study of soliciting. With reference to the socio-cultural perspective of learning, the question asked is whether a development in terms of the way of soliciting occurs and, if so, whether it has implications for the format of the interactional sequences which develop. A further question which is treated is the relationship between the potential development in soliciting and the development of other competencies (lexical, linguistic and interactional). In this study, a link is shown between the way learners solicit information and the interactional sequences which develop. While <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> information and for judgement/evaluation tend to be followed by SPAs, <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation</b> are followed by ?limited sequences? where a backchannel signal (hm, oui) constitutes the native speaker's answer. Concerning the impact of context on soliciting, differences have been observed in the way of soliciting which are individual rather than task-related and seem to be related to the learners? goals: while a few learners seem to consider the different types of interaction (tasks, interview) they are engaged in as a potential way of learning, others seem to be motivated simply by completing the task. Finally, a mainly qualitative development as regards soliciting in some of the learners was found in the longitudinal study: while soliciting is mainly done through <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> information in the first interview recordings, an evolution towards <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>confirmation</b> tends to take place in the later recordings. As far as the relationship with other competencies is concerned, no direct parallels could be drawn...|$|R
