5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E

Cooper returned to Harvard after his father's death, but soon discovered that he could not simultaneously pursue a law degree and manage his family's affairs. He was admitted to the bar by examination in 1928 and opened a legal practice in Somerset. Over the next 20 years, he sold his father's remaining assets, paid off the family debts, and financed a college education for his six siblings.|$|E

An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the wood and paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify.

5|$|Major modern {{economic}} statistics, such as {{unemployment and}} GDP, were not compiled {{on a regular}} and standardized basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, {{it is difficult to}} compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions. No <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> the post-World War II era has come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1941 and was caused by the 1929 crash of the stock market and other factors.|$|E

Two dimensional and unconfined sand-model with two spray-nozzles for artificial rainfall was prepared to generate baseflow experimentally.

As a result, the authors obtained the following conclusions. (a) A few inflection points (these points show the changes <b>of</b> <b>recession</b> rate <b>of</b> baseflow) found on the <b>recession</b> curve <b>of</b> baseflow will be caused by the changes <b>of</b> the <b>recession</b> rate <b>of</b> recharge from the unsaturated zone.

(c) The baseflow from an unconfied aquifer during <b>recession</b> period consists <b>of</b> two different <b>recession</b> states. Namely, the baseflow shows a recession curve in an exponential function as given by Eq.
