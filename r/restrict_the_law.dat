40|$|Both {{in dealing}} with the {{semantic}} paradoxes and {{in dealing with}} vagueness and indeterminacy, there is some temptation to weaken classical logic: in particular, to <b>restrict</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of excluded middle. The reasons for doing this are somewhat different in the two cases. In the case of the semantic paradoxes, a weakening of classical logic (presumably involving a restriction of excluded middle) is required if we are to preserve the naive theory of truth without inconsistency. In the case of vagueness and indeterminacy, there is no worry about inconsistency; but a central intuition is that we must reject the factual status of certain sentences, and it hard to see how we can do that while claiming that the law of excluded middle applies to those sentences. So despite the different routes, we have a similar conclusion in the two cases. There is also some temptation to connect up the two cases, by viewing the semantic paradoxes as due to something akin to vagueness or indeterminacy in semantic concepts like ‘true’. The thought is that the notion of truth is introduced by a schema that might initially appear to settle its extension uniquely...|$|E

40|$|For a {{claim to}} lie in unjust enrichment, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> {{requires}} that <b>the</b> defendant's enrichment must have been gained ‘at the claimant's expense’.

40|$|Naive truth theory is, roughly, {{the theory}} of truth that in {{classical}} logic leads to well-known paradoxes (such as the Liar paradox and the Curry paradox). One response to these paradoxes is to weaken classical logic by <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of excluded middle and introducing a conditional not defined from the other connectives in the usual way. In "New Grounds for Naive Truth Theory " ([12]), Steve Yablo develops {{a new version of}} this response, and cites three respects in which he deems it superior to a version that I’ve advocated in several papers. I think he’s right that my version was non-optimal in some of these respects (one and a half of them, to be precise); however, Yablo’s own account seems to me to have some undesirable features as well. In this paper I will explore some variations on his account, and end up tentatively advocating a synthesis of his account and mine (one that is somewhat closer to mine than to his). 1 Background.

5000|$|Three {{weeks after}} the shooting, Florida Governor Rick Scott {{commissioned}} a 19-member task force to review the Florida statute that deals with justifiable use of force, including the Stand Your Ground provision. After holding seven public hearings around the state, and reviewing more than 11,000 comments submitted by the public—nearly {{three times as many}} of which were opposed to <b>the</b> <b>law</b> as were in support of it, the task force recommended against repealing the statute, saying that Florida residents have a right to defend themselves with deadly force without a duty to retreat if they feel threatened.Critics said that the members appointed to the task force had been chosen to heavily bias the panel against any significant changes in <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> and that, as a result, the panel's conclusions were no surprise. The task force did suggest that law enforcement agencies and the courts increase training on <b>the</b> self-defense <b>law</b> to ensure <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is applied fairly, and that the legislature more clearly define the role of neighborhood watch participants to avoid vigilantism and fund a study of how <b>the</b> <b>law</b> had been applied, examining effects such as race, ethnicity, and gender. However, the task force largely rejected recommendations of Miami-Dade County State Attorney Katherine Fernandez-Rundle (one of the task force members) that would have <b>restricted</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> including a recommendation to limit immunity from prosection to defendants who have not provoked a confrontation. In January 2013, Martin's mother joined two Democratic lawmakers in Florida and called for the repeal of the state's [...] "stand your ground" [...] law.

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} {{recent changes in}} policy {{and the spread of}} in-store medical clinics favor the {{provision}} of medication therapy management (MTM) services by large chain pharmacies while creating the potential for con-flicts of interest from employed prescribers. First, MTM is now required by Medicare Part D, but the program may be more practical for community pharmacy chains than independent pharmacies. Second, in-store clinics have proliferated, which may accommodate the provision of MTM services in these community locations. Third, while physician ownership of pharmacies is <b>restricted,</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> has not anticipated the in-store clinic situations in which the pharmacy employs a prescriber on-site. MTM Required Under Medicare Part D In an important policy shift, pharmacists can now seek reim-bursement for cognitive clinical consulting services from plans that contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide Medicare Part D benefits. 1, 2 This change is the outcome of 2 major <b>laws.</b> <b>The</b> Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA 2003) man-dated that Part D Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) or Medicare Advantage Plans (MA-PDs) provide MTM services using pharma-cists “or other qualified healthcare providers. ” 3 Earlier, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 included pharmacy and all health professions in the definition of health data transmission, which inspired the formation of a pharmacy coalition to lobby for billing codes for professional services. 4 The billing codes for MTM services were implemented in 2006. CMS monitors the PDPs, but less is known about the details of service delivery to patients in the community. One recently published study in JMCP made use of private-sector data for 7 years of MTM services, within and without Part D, and suggested that MMA 2003 inspired the type of MTM services to move from education involving acute medications to consultative services for chronic therapy, with attributable cost avoidance. ...|$|R
