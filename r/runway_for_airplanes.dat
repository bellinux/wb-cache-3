50|$|The castle lies 12 km {{from the}} town of Bečej and about 60 km from Novi Sad and today it is used as a tourist destination, where it serves as a hotel with restaurant.

50|$|Buder Park {{is located}} {{on the other side of}} the Meramec River and is {{considered}} a St. Louis County/Valley Park park. This park offers fishing access to the river, and open fields for flying kites, or playing football, soccer, or baseball. However, it is best known for its model plane activities. People from all over St. Louis and the surrounding counties come to this park to fly their model planes or fly tight lines. It has two tight lining tracks and a full <b>runway</b> <b>for</b> model <b>airplanes.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the road}} between Montego Bay and Negril was {{improved}} {{in the early}} 1970s, it helped to increase Negril's status as a new resort location. It was a two-lane paved road that ran approximately 100 yards m inland from two white coral sand beaches, {{at the southern end}} of which was a small village. The long paved road from the village ran north to Green Island, home to many of the Jamaican workers in Negril, and was straight enough to double as a <b>runway</b> <b>for</b> small <b>airplanes,</b> which was why there were lengths of railroad track standing on end along the side of the road - to discourage drug smugglers from landing on the road to pick up cheap cargos of marijuana.|$|R
50|$|As {{the very}} first runways had soft surface, it made them {{unavailable}} for takeoffs and landings during spring and autumn seasons. Therefore, only seaplanes stationed at Lake Ülemiste were {{able to carry out}} flights, and during winter months, it was possible to use the frozen surface of the lake as a <b>runway</b> <b>for</b> small <b>airplanes.</b> The concrete paved runways of the first stage, inaugurated together {{with the opening of the}} airport, were about 40 metres wide and 300 metres long. As they were arranged in a form of a triangle, they allowed takeoffs and landings in six directions. These were the first concrete-paved runway in Estonia, it was needed some 5,396 cubic meters of stone, 4,100 cubic meters of construction aggregate and 137 tons of cement to construct them.|$|R
5000|$|November to December 2013 - Antarctica. Four Arctic Trucks vehicles, two AT44 Hilux and two AT44 Hilux 6x6 {{supported}} a ski race between three teams of wounded soldiers, Walk With The Wounded. The vehicles {{and the support}} team drove ahead 2000 km {{and set up a}} <b>runway</b> <b>for</b> the ski <b>airplane</b> bringing in the ski teams. After supporting and filming the ski race and both the film crew and skiers flown back to Novo runway but the car team was split in two, two vehicles went on to Ross Iceshelf to support Maria Leijerstam (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Leijerstam) in her cycle attempt and the other two returned to Novo runway, laying out fuel depots for a Massey Ferguson expedition the following season.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of head-wind profiles and mean head-wind velocities on <b>runway</b> landing capacity <b>for</b> <b>airplanes</b> flying constant-airspeed and constant-groundspeed approaches. It was determined that when the wind profiles were encountered with the currently used constant airspeed approach method, the landing capacity was reduced. The severity of these reductions increased as the mean head-wind value of the profile increased. When constant-groundspeed approaches were made in the same wind profiles, there were no losses in landing capacity. In an analysis of mean head winds, it was determined that in a mean head wind of 35 knots, the landing capacity using constant-airspeed approaches was 13 % less than for the no wind condition. There were no reductions in landing capacity with constant-groundspeed approaches for mean head winds less than 35 knots. This same result was observed when the separation intervals between airplanes was reduced...|$|R
50|$|Stavanger Airport has two {{passenger}} terminals, one <b>for</b> <b>airplanes</b> and one <b>for</b> helicopters. When {{the present}} terminal {{was put into}} use 28 January 1987, {{it was the first}} airport in Norway to have jet bridges, nine in total. The old terminal was then converted into a heliport. The airport has two crossing runways: the main runway, north/south (18/36) and the main <b>runway</b> <b>for</b> helicopters, which is oriented northwest-southeast (11/29).|$|R
50|$|Citing {{increased}} {{landing fees}} {{and other costs}} due to the work at the airport, Southwest Airlines threatened in 2005 to move to nearby Boeing Field. This plan ran into several problems. Boeing Field is a public airport and each airline {{would have to have}} equal access, requiring more capacity than available on the airport's single <b>runway</b> suitable <b>for</b> large <b>airplanes.</b> (Boeing Field has a parallel, smaller runway used by smaller aircraft and has cookies in the main terminal.) Major renovations would have been required. While Southwest did indicate willingness to pay for upgrades, there were problems with the transportation infrastructure around Boeing Field, which was not designed to handle traffic {{in and out of a}} major passenger airport. It eventually became clear that Southwest Airlines would not fund the necessary transportation improvements and the plan was rejected by King County Executive Ron Sims. Furthermore, there were concerns that the high costs of operating the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport would be increased even further if some airline service were moved to Boeing Field, which was expected to be less expensive to operate for the airlines.|$|R

50|$|During busy periods, {{outbound}} flights use the western <b>runway</b> <b>for</b> take-off, while inbound flights use the eastern <b>runway</b> <b>for</b> landing.
