25|$|By 1610 {{the short}} novel of love had largely disappeared, as tastes {{returned}} to longer adventure novels (romans d'aventures) and their clichés (pirates, storms, kidnapped maidens) {{that had been}} popular since the Valois court. Amadis of Gaul was the favorite <b>reading</b> <b>matter</b> of Henri IV; Béroalde de Verville was still writing, and Nicolas de Montreux had just died in 1608. Both Nervèze and Des Escuteaux in their later works attempted multi-volume adventure novels, {{and over the next}} twenty years the priest Jean-Pierre Camus adapted the form to tell harrowing moral tales heavily influenced by the histoire tragique. The best known of these long adventure novels is perhaps Polexandre (1629–49) by the young author Marin le Roy de Gomberville.|$|E
25|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose power depended on letters as well as arms, and she {{was familiar with the}} writing of Erasmus, among others, on the subject. She enjoyed and collected books, and moved the royal collection to the Louvre, her principal residence. She delighted in the company of learned men and women, and her court was highly literary. Her government officials, such as secretary-of-state Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy, whose wife translated the epistles of Ovid, were perfectly at home in literary circles. When she could find the time, Catherine occasionally wrote verses herself, which she would show to the court poets. Her reading was not entirely highbrow, however.

30|$|For example, {{drill and}} {{practice}} may march through copy, recognition, and recall {{as exemplified by}} techniques used by Fletcher and Atkinson (1972) to teach beginning reading (pre-K through grade 3). That program used Model 33 teletypewriters, headphones, and an early application of digitized audio to teach beginning reading. It {{was based on the}} assumption that most 5 -year-olds have a strong command of their native language and that reading starts by matching the language in their heads with graphemes on the printed page (or screen). It began by teaching the letters of the alphabet followed by common English language spelling patterns (e.g., AT as in FAT CAT MAT). Later, the program moved to sight word vocabulary, spelling pattern anomalies (e.g., “Wind the watch in the wind”), and other beginning <b>reading</b> <b>matters,</b> thereby establishing a progression from copy, to recognition, recall, and, finally, some of the many exceptions in English orthography.|$|R

500|$|Poles were forbidden, under {{penalty of}} death, to own radios. The press was reduced from over 2,000publications to a few dozen, all censored by the Germans. All pre-war {{newspapers}} were closed, and the few that were published during the occupation were new creations under the total control of the Germans. Such a thorough destruction of the press was unprecedented in contemporary history. The only officially available <b>reading</b> <b>matter</b> was the propaganda press that was disseminated by the German occupation administration. Cinemas, now {{under the control of}} the German propaganda machine, saw their programming dominated by Nazi German movies, which were preceded by propaganda newsreels. The few Polish films permitted to be shown (about 20% of the total programming) were edited to eliminate references to Polish national symbols as well as Jewish actors and producers. Several propaganda films were shot in Polish, although no Polish films were shown after 1943. As all profits from Polish cinemas were officially directed toward German war production, attendance was discouraged by the Polish underground; a famous underground slogan declared: [...] "Tylko świnie siedzą w kinie" [...] ("Only pigs attend the movies"). A similar situation faced theaters, which were forbidden by the Germans to produce [...] "serious" [...] spectacles. Indeed, a number of propaganda pieces were created for theater stages. Hence, theatrical productions were also boycotted by the underground. In addition, actors were discouraged from performing in them and warned that they would be labeled as collaborators if they failed to comply. Ironically, restrictions on cultural performances were eased in Jewish ghettos, given that the Germans wished to distract ghetto inhabitants and prevent them from grasping their eventual fate.|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, the pocket-sized sea, Western, railway, circus, gold-digger, {{and other}} adventures were an instant success. Author Armin Jaemmrich observes that Alexis de Tocqueville's theses in Democracy in America (1835) {{says that in}} {{democratic}} and socially permeable societies, {{like that of the}} U.S., the lower classes were not [...] "naturally indifferent to science, literature, and the arts: only it must be acknowledged that they cultivate them after their own fashion, and bring to the task their own peculiar qualifications and deficiencies." [...] He found that in aristocratic societies education and interest in literature were confined to a small upper class, and that the literary class would arrive at a [...] "sort of aristocratic jargon, ... hardly less remote from pure language than was the coarse dialect of the people." [...] According to Tocqueville, due to the heterogeneity of its population, the situation in the U.S. was different, and people were asking for <b>reading</b> <b>matter.</b> Since, in his view, practically every American was busy earning a living with no time for obtaining a higher education let alone for timeconsuming distractions, they preferred books which [...] "may be easily procured, quickly read, and which require no learned researches to be understood ... they require rapid emotions, startling passages .... Small productions will be more common than bulky books ... The object of authors will be to astonish rather than to please, and to stir the passions more than to charm the taste." [...] Written twenty-five years prior to the emergence of the dimes, his words read like an exact anticipation of their main characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|The century {{also saw}} Birmingham {{emerge as the}} centre of a vibrant and {{sophisticated}} culture of popular street literature, as the town's printers produced increasing numbers of the broadsides and chapbooks that formed the primary <b>reading</b> <b>matter</b> of the poor. Cheaply printed and carrying traditional songs, newly written ballads on topical matters, simple folk-tales with wood-cut illustrations, and news – particularly salacious coverage of gruesome crimes, executions, riots and wars – broadsides and chapbooks were sold or exchanged by itinerant chapmen – also called [...] "patterers" [...] or [...] "ballad-mongers" [...] – who often displayed their goods in the street on a small table or pinned to a wall. Although much of this work was by its nature ephemeral and low in literary quality, Birmingham was unusual in that the town's high level of social mobility meant that printers of street literature often overlapped with printers of weightier material, some writers of street literature were highly educated and of respectable social standing, and several writers of Birmingham broadside ballads had a lasting influence on the town's literary culture. Job Nott – probably a pseudonym of Theodore Price of Harborne – was a largely conservative figure who produced {{a wide range of}} pamphlets and broadsides on topical matters, attracting imitators as far afield as Bristol. John Freeth's influence was even greater: nearly 400 of his political ballads were published and distributed nationally in a dozen separate collections between 1766 and 1805, the best-known being his 1790 collection The Political Songster. An outstanding figure in the radical circles of the late-Georgian town, he hosted the Birmingham Book Club at John Freeth's Coffee House, giving him a national political importance and placing him at the heart of Birmingham's developing political self-consciousness during the upheavals of the American Revolution.|$|E
