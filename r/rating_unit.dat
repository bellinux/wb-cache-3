50|$|Understanding what {{comprises}} {{a single}} <b>rating</b> <b>unit</b> is important when rates {{such as a}} Uniform Annual General Rate (see below) is imposed on each <b>rating</b> <b>unit.</b> The concept of <b>rating</b> <b>unit</b> is defined in the Rating Valuations Act 1998.|$|E
50|$|A second related {{concept is}} that of {{determining}} a count of Separately Used or Inhabited Parts of a <b>Rating</b> <b>Unit</b> (SUIP). It is possible that one <b>rating</b> <b>unit</b> might have multiple SUIPs on it - for example, {{a piece of land}} with three condo/apartments on it. This becomes relevant when general rates such as Uniform Annual General Charges are imposed, not per <b>rating</b> <b>unit,</b> but per SUIP.|$|E
50|$|Generally, each {{separate}} {{certificate of}} title {{is considered to be}} its own <b>rating</b> <b>unit.</b> But if multiple certificates of title are owned by the same person or persons, are used jointly as a single unit, and are either contiguous (i.e. next to each other) or separated only by a road or rail line or body of water, then they can be deemed a single <b>rating</b> <b>unit.</b> So, for example, a farmer with land on four different titles, on both sides of a road that goes through the middle of his property, would most likely have his four titles deemed to be a single <b>rating</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

50|$|Another example {{might be}} a water rate - {{possibly}} a flat fee per <b>rating</b> <b>unit</b> that is connected to a central water service, and/or possibly a fee per cubic metre of water provided. A related rate would be a sewage disposal rate, often calculated {{on the basis of}} the number of toilet bowls or urinals present in each <b>rating</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Water {{and sewage}} rates can have three 'states' {{associated}} with them. If a <b>rating</b> <b>unit</b> {{does not have}} that service available, then the first state (i.e. no charge) would apply. If a <b>rating</b> <b>unit</b> has the service available, but the service is not being used, then one level of rate might be imposed, and if the service is available and being used, then a second higher level of rate might be imposed.|$|E
5000|$|Councils {{can also}} levy flat charges per <b>rating</b> <b>unit</b> (i.e. each lot of land, with some {{exceptions}} where multiple adjacent lots {{may be considered}} one <b>rating</b> <b>unit</b> if in common ownership, or where multiple dwelling units are on a single lot) - generally called a uniform annual general charge. [...] Other methodologies also exist, such as a charge per toilet bowl or urinal, or a water charge per cu metre of water supplied.|$|E

50|$|The Act allows local {{authorities}} to remit {{all or part}} of the rates on a <b>rating</b> <b>unit</b> if the local authority has established a formal policy allowing itself to do so.|$|E
50|$|The act allows local {{authorities}} to postpone {{all or part}} of the rates on a <b>rating</b> <b>unit,</b> again if there is an existing formal policy allowing such postponement. The policy may set a fee that applies in such cases, but if a fee is applied, it can not exceed the actual administrative and financial costs involved.|$|E
50|$|There {{are nine}} matters {{that can be}} considered, for example, where the land is located, or the use to which the land is put.

40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{described}} for predicting the handling qualities of an aircraft in pitch. Both methods {{are based on}} minimizing a pilot rating expression with respect to free pilot parameters. In one case the pilot rating expression was developed from a set of moving base simulation data. In the other case, the pilot rating expression was developed from a set of fixed base simulation data. In both cases pilot rating is primarily a function of pitch attitude and pitch rate; however, in the moving base case, the pilot rating is more sensitive to pitch rate than in the fixed base case. For each method, predicted pilot ratings and performance measures agree well with the measured data corresponding to that case. Both methods are used to predict pilot ratings {{for a set of}} flight test configurations and the results of the two methods agree to within one half a <b>rating</b> <b>unit.</b> The predicted ratings in both cases correlate well with the actual pilot ratings from the flight tests...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{telematics}} {{data from}} a Belgian portfolio of young drivers who underwrote a pay-as-you-drive insurance product in between 2010 and 2014. Using installed black box devices, telematics data are collected on how many kilometers are driven, during which time slots and on which type of roads. Car insurance is traditionally priced based on self-reported information from the policyholder, most importantly: age, license age, postal code, engine power, use of the vehicle, and claims history. However, these observable risk factors are only indirect indicators of the accident risk and don’t reflect the real driving behavior. By constructing predictive models for the claim frequency, we compare the performance of different sets of predictor variables (e. g. traditional vs purely telematics) and discover the relevance and impact of adding telematics insights. In particular, we contrast the use of time and distance as exposure-to-risk, the basic <b>rating</b> <b>unit</b> underlying the insurance premium. We show how to incorporate the divisions of the distance driven by road type and time slots as compositional predictors in the model and how to interpret their effect on the average claim frequency. We find that the telematics variables increase the predictive power and render the use of gender as a discriminating rating variable redundant. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Route {{charges are}} fees that {{airlines}} pay {{in order to}} utilize the Air Navigation Services (ANS) of a European state. The fee is based on three values; {{the weight of the}} aircraft, the length of the flight, and the state’s specific <b>unit</b> <b>rate.</b> The <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> of each state is in turn based on the forecasted costs of providing ANS for that state and the amount of traffic forecasted for the year to come. This makes for different <b>unit</b> <b>rates</b> for different states, which leads to different costs for flying different routes in the European airspace. A state having costs that are increasing faster than the amount of traffic is increasing will lead to a higher <b>unit</b> <b>rate.</b> A higher <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> may lead to airlines avoiding the state’s airspace due to higher costs, thus accounting for even less traffic and an increase in <b>unit</b> <b>rate.</b> This thesis examines the relationship between <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> and amount of traffic, and specifically tries to find out how much the <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> affects the traffic count. This has been done by reading previous papers on the subject, and creating a model to easily present facts found. The result of the thesis suggests that states actually profits more by increasing the <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> rather than actively trying to reduce it. This contradicts the idea of lowering prices always being a good thing. There is a limit to how much the <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> can be increases however, at which all traffic will choose to circumnavigate the airspace. Finding a good balance between traffic lost and <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> increased is suggested as the best way to go...|$|R

50|$|A {{gyroscope}} was attached, via mechanical linkage, to {{an optical}} monocular sight {{to form the}} gyro <b>rate</b> <b>unit</b> or GRU. Gyroscopes, when spinning, keep their spin axes pointed in a given direction if they are undisturbed. As the cross-hairs of the optical sight are kept centred on the moving aircraft the mechanical linkage will pull the gyroscope {{in the direction of}} the aircraft movement. The force required to move the gyroscope is proportional to the observed target movement across the line of sight. This force was measured by the deflection of a spring-loaded device and the deflection measurement was combined with rangefinder, and/or, radar measured target range and altitude in a specialized computer, the gyro <b>rate</b> <b>unit</b> box (GRUB).|$|R

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the atomization process of a liquid jet across a high-speed airstream, the spray shape, the mass flow <b>rate</b> per <b>unit</b> {{area and the}} Sauter mean diameter were measured. Under an airstream velocity of 140 m/s or 70 m/s and injection velocity of 10 m/s, 20 m/s or 40 m/s, the Sauter mean diameter and the maximum liquid mass flow <b>rate</b> per <b>unit</b> area in the spray hardly changed with the liquid injection velocity. However, with increasing air velocity, the Sauter mean diameter decreased and the maximum liquid mass flow <b>rate</b> per <b>unit</b> area increased.

40|$|New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) is in {{the process}} of {{certifying}} removal efficiencies of total suspended solids (TSS) for various manufactured treatment devices (MTDs). Prior to the certification, the removal efficiencies are verified by New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology (NJCAT) under some specific laboratory testing and field monitoring conditions. However, the TSS removal performance is expected to vary with operating flow <b>rates,</b> <b>unit</b> sizes, and laboratory or field evaluation techniques. Several technical issues related to the uniform certification have been researched. Among them are difference between TSS and suspended sediment concentration (SSC), extrapolation of operating flow <b>rates,</b> <b>unit</b> size scaling, impacts of particle size and influent concentration, and possibility of bottom sediment re-suspension. NJDEP has made amendments to the TARP field monitoring protocol to further constrain the field monitoring conditions and to additionally require the particle size measurements and the sediment re-suspension tests.
