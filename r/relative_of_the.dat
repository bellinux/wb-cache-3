50|$|The shinpan (親藩) daimyōs were lords {{who were}} certain <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tokugawa shoguns <b>of</b> Japan. While all shinpan were <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shogun, not all <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shogun were shinpan; an example <b>of</b> this is <b>the</b> Matsudaira clan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Okutono Domain. Non-daimyo relatives, {{such as the}} Gosankyō, were also known as kamon - thus the shinpan lords were {{alternatively}} known as kamon daimyō (家門大名). Shinpan included the Gosanke, <b>the</b> Matsudaira clan <b>of</b> Aizu and <b>the</b> Matsudaira clan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fukui Domain.|$|R

5|$|Analysis of mtDNA {{sequences}} {{has confirmed}} morphological and biogeographical studies {{suggesting that the}} razorbill is the closest living <b>relative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great auk. The great auk also was related closely to the little auk (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often {{was placed in the}} genus Alca, following Linnaeus.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's second wife, Theodora (whom the Lignages d'Outremer {{mentioned}} as Irene) was a <b>relative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Historian Charles M.

According to the Lignages d'Outremer, Theodora gave birth to a daughter, Constance, who was not mentioned in other sources.|$|E
5|$|Constance {{was given}} in {{marriage}} to Raymond of Poitiers in 1136. During the subsequent years, Raymond ruled Antioch while Constance gave birth to four children. After Raymond was murdered after a battle in 1149, Fulk of Anjou's son, Baldwin III of Jerusalem, assumed the regency. He tried to persuade Constance to remarry, {{but she did not}} accept his candidates. She also refused to marry a middle-aged <b>relative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenus. Finally, she found a love interest and was married to Raynald of Châtillon, a knight from France, in 1153.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} members of its genus, the phylogenetic {{position}} of the blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest <b>relative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blacktip reef shark was the nervous shark (C.cautus). Leonard Compagno's 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only between this species and the nervous shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve their relationships further. A 1998 allozyme analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, finding that the blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other Carcharhinus species.|$|E

The marriage was unusual because he was a widower of fifty, while the bride was only seventeen. Very few details are known of their domestic life.

In November 2001 Home Secretary David Blunkett banned all marches in Peterborough for three months as it was feared violence would be caused by the Anti-Nazi League and National Front who both sought to hold protests on the same day.|$|E

When he was about 10, Buffalo and his parents moved from La Pointe to the vicinity of what now is Buffalo, New York, and lived there until about he was about 12. The family relocated to the Mackinac Island area for a while before returning to La Pointe. In his youth, Kechewaishke was admired as a skilled hunter and athlete.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil {{bones of}} the Mascarene grey parakeet found on Mauritius were first {{described}} in 1973 as belonging to a smaller <b>relative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broad-billed parrot in the genus Lophopsittacus. Apart from their size, the bones were {{very similar to those}} of other Mascarene parrots. The subfossils were later connected with 17th- and 18th-century descriptions of small grey parrots on Mauritius and Réunion, together with a single illustration published in a journal describing a voyage in 1602, and the species was instead reassigned to the genus Psittacula.|$|E

5|$|The Atlantic puffin is {{a species}} of seabird in the order Charadriiformes.

The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) and the puffins are closely related, together composing the tribe Fraterculini. The Atlantic puffin is the only species in the genus Fratercula {{to occur in the}} Atlantic Ocean. Two other species are known from the northeast Pacific, the tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata) and the horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata), the latter being the closest <b>relative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic puffin.|$|E

5|$|The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless {{bird that}} was endemic {{to the island}} of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.
