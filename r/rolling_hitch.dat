2500|$|The taut-line hitch is an {{adjustable}} loop knot {{for use on}} lines under tension. [...] It is useful when {{the length of a}} line will need to be periodically adjusted in order to maintain tension. [...] It is made by tying a <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> around the standing part after passing around an anchor object. [...] Tension is maintained by sliding the hitch to adjust size of the loop, thus changing the effective length of the standing part without retying the knot.|$|E
60|$|I {{called to}} her, and the mast moved easily and accurately. Straight toward the square {{hole of the}} step the square butt descended; but as it descended it slowly twisted so that square would not fit into square. But I had not even a moment’s indecision. Calling to Maud to cease lowering, I went on deck and made the watch-tackle fast to the mast with a <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch.</b> I left Maud to pull on it while I went below. By {{the light of the}} lantern I saw the butt twist slowly around till its sides coincided with the sides of the step. Maud made fast and {{returned}} to the windlass. Slowly the butt descended the several intervening inches, at the same time slightly twisting again. Again Maud rectified the twist with the watch-tackle, and again she lowered away from the windlass. Square fitted into square. The mast was stepped.|$|E
50|$|Though {{effective}} for moderate loads, the <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> cannot be depended on to hold fast under all conditions. Using stiff and slippery modern fiber ropes, the <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> {{may be difficult}} to make hold at all. Friction hitches with additional wraps and more complex structure may provide more security.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> is a knot (see also Magnus hitch) used {{to attach}} a rope to a rod, pole, or another rope. A simple {{friction}} hitch, it is used for lengthwise pull along an object rather than at right angles. The <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> is designed to resist lengthwise movement for only a single direction of pull.|$|E

50|$|The magnus hitch is a knot {{similar to}} a <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> or clove hitch, used to tie a rope or line to a pole, spar, or another line. It is tied {{similarly}} to a <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> but with the final hitch in the opposite direction. It can be more tricky to snug up, since both lines emerge from {{the same side of}} the hitch, but it has less tendency to twist under load.|$|E

50|$|The August 2009 {{edition of}} Practical Sailor {{magazine}} tested various knots used for lengthwise tension applications, {{and came to}} the conclusion that when using modern synthetic rope the <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> could not be regarded as secure. They recommended the Icicle hitch as a replacement.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> or Magnus hitch is {{tied around}} the {{standing}} {{part of the}} rope to form an adjustable loop, it {{is often referred to}} as a taut-line hitch or one of several other names, although some sources fail to differentiate by using a separate name.|$|E

50|$|The pipe hitch {{will not}} slip when tied {{correctly}} to a pipe or pole. This knot {{is considered to}} be similar to and a variation of the <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> knot. It also comes undone quickly and with ease once it is released. This knot can be used with a rope to pull a pipe or spar out of the ground, or to hoist a pipe or beam.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rolling</b> <b>Hitch</b> a C1-M-AV1, renamed MS Hoegh Aronde sank in 1963. She started leaking off {{the coast}} of Morocco at 31.30N 10.45W, {{steaming}} from Sassandra to Valencia with a cargo of 3000 tons of phosphates and 2000 tons logs. She sent out a SOS with a message [...] "sinking fast", but of the Norwegian crew of 32, 14 survivors were found in the sea.|$|E
50|$|The taut-line hitch is an {{adjustable}} loop knot {{for use on}} lines under tension. It is useful when {{the length of a}} line will need to be periodically adjusted in order to maintain tension. It is made by tying a <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> around the standing part after passing around an anchor object. Tension is maintained by sliding the hitch to adjust size of the loop, thus changing the effective length of the standing part without retying the knot.|$|E
50|$|In knots {{that are}} meant to grip other objects, failure {{can be defined as}} the knot moving {{relative}} to the gripped object. While the knot itself does not fail, it ceases to perform the desired function. For instance, a simple <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> tied around a railing and pulled parallel to the railing might hold up to a certain tension, then start sliding. Sometimes this problem can be corrected by working-up the knot tighter before subjecting it to load, but usually the problem requires either a knot with more wraps or a rope of different diameter or material.|$|E
50|$|The {{gripping}} sailor's hitch is a secure, jam-proof friction hitch used to tie one rope to another, or a rope to a pole, boom, spar, etc., {{when the}} pull is lengthwise along the object. It will even grip a tapered object, {{such as a}} marlin spike, {{in the direction of}} taper, similar to the Icicle hitch, but superior. It is much superior to the <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> for that purpose. It is similar to the Michoacan-Martin friction knot used in climbing; The finishing wrap for Michoacan-Martin is in the opposite direction of the Gripping Sailors knot, both ends are then made to carry weight.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{slightly}} different hitches commonly {{known by the}} name of [...] "rolling hitch". The Ashley Book of Knots identifies these two variations as [...] "Rolling Hitch(1)" [...] and [...] "Rolling Hitch(2)" [...] and numbers them #1734 and #1735 respectively. Despite the potential for confusion with the older usage, Ashley chose the name [...] "Magnus Hitch" [...] to refer to knot #1736, which is simply #1734 tied with the final hitch made in the opposite direction. [...] Since two distinct variations of the <b>rolling</b> <b>hitch</b> are widely referred to by the same name, and Magnus hitch now may refer to a different knot than it used to, the use of Ashley reference numbers for these related hitches can eliminate ambiguity when required. These hitches are pictured at the right.|$|E
