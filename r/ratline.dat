25|$|A Croatian priest, Krunoslav Draganović, {{organizer}} of the San Girolamo <b>ratline,</b> was authorized by Perón to assist Nazi operatives to come to Argentina and evade prosecution in Europe after World War II, in particular the Ustaše. Ante Pavelić became a security advisor of Perón, before leaving for Francoist Spain in 1957.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Hudal {{was one of}} {{the main}} Catholic {{organizers}} of the <b>ratline</b> nets, along with Monsignor Karlo Petranović, himself an Ustasha war criminal who fled to Austria and then to Italy after 1945, Father Edward Dömöter, a Franciscan of Hungarian origin who forged the identity of Eichmann's passport, issued by the Red Cross in the name of Ricardo Klement, and Father Krunoslav Draganović, a Croatian professor of Theology.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, Argentina {{became a}} haven for Nazi war criminals, with {{explicit}} protection from Perón. Author Uki Goñi alleges that Axis Power collaborators, including Pierre Daye, met with Perón at Casa Rosada (Pink House), the President's official residence. In this meeting, a network would have been created with support by the Argentine Immigration Service and the Foreign Office. The Swiss Chief of Police Heinrich Rothmund and the Croatian Roman Catholic priest Krunoslav Draganović also helped organize the <b>ratline.</b>|$|E

2500|$|During {{the first}} six months at VMI, New Cadets are called [...] "Rats," [...] the {{accepted}} term (since the 1850s) for a New Cadet. The VMI <b>ratline</b> is a tough, sometimes brutal, and old-fashioned indoctrination-system which dates back to the Institute's founding. All [...] "Rats" [...] refer to their classmates, male or female, as [...] "Brother-Rats." [...] The term [...] "Brother Rat" [...] is a term of endearment which lasts a lifetime amongst VMI graduates. Legend has it that when Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) students and VMI cadets drilled together in the 1830s, the students called the cadets [...] "Rats" [...] perhaps because of their gray uniforms. The cadets responded in kind calling the neighboring students [...] "Minks" [...] perhaps because many of them were from wealthy backgrounds. The purpose of the <b>Ratline</b> is to teach self-control, self-discipline, time-management, and followership as prerequisites for becoming a VMI cadet.|$|E
2500|$|The plaintiffs {{sought an}} {{accounting}} and restitution of the Ustaše Treasury that, {{according to the}} US State Department, had allegedly been transferred illicitly to the Vatican, the Franciscan Order and other banks {{after the end of}} the war, in order to further the goals of the Ustaše regime in exile and fund the Vatican <b>ratline.</b> [...] The principal movers were allegedly Fr. Krunoslav Draganovic, Fr. Dominik Mandic OFM, and the war criminal Ante Pavelić.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>Ratline,</b> VMI has other traditions that are emblematic {{of the school and}} its history including the new cadet oath ceremony, the pageantry of close-order marching, and the nightly playing of [...] "Taps". An event second only to graduation in importance is the [...] "Ring Figure" [...] dance held every November. During their junior year, cadets receive class rings at a ring presentation ceremony followed by a formal dance. Most cadets get two rings, a formal ring and a combat ring; some choose to have the combat ring for everyday wear, and the formal for special occasions.|$|E

50|$|In {{the most}} {{traditional}} ships, the futtock shrouds {{can be used}} {{to gain access to the}} tops. Sailors ascend <b>ratlines</b> on the ordinary shrouds until nearly at the top, then transfer to the futtock shrouds which will be reaching upwards and outwards above them. Using the futtock shrouds involves climbing the underside of an overhanging rope at about 45 degrees. Futtock shrouds may or may not have <b>ratlines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Named after noted free soloist John Bachar, [...] Bachar ladders {{typically}} {{consist of}} PVC rungs joined by webbing or cord {{to create an}} unstable structure similar to the <b>ratlines</b> of a sailing ship. However, unlike ascending <b>ratlines</b> leaning inward using one's legs for upward progress and arms for steadying, the Bachar Ladder is typically hung at an overhanging angle of 20-45° and climbed from below using only the arms.|$|R
2500|$|The Secretariat of Intelligence (SI) was {{established}} by President Juan Perón in 1946 as the State Information Coordination Secretariat (CIDE); it was renamed SIDE in 1958, and SI in 2001. Its first director was Rodolfo Freude, {{one of the principal}} figures in the ODESSA Nazi post-war <b>ratline.</b> Since its inception, the SI was responsible for spying on politicians, journalists, intellectuals and trade unionists; gathering information that even today remains [...] "classified". As both the Cold War and leftist political violence intensified in the early 1970s, however, the SIDE would acquire a prominent role in the persecution, murder, and disappearance of thousands of people during Argentina's Dirty War in the mid 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{entire body}} of Rats during the <b>Ratline</b> {{is called a}} [...] "Rat Mass." [...] Since Rats are not officially fourth classmen until after Breakout, the Rat Mass is also not officially {{considered}} a graduating class until that time either. Prior to Breakout, the Rat mass is given a different style of year identifier to emphasize this difference. The year identifier starts with {{the year of the}} current graduating class (their dykes' class), followed by a [...] "+3" [...] to indicate the anticipated year of their own class. For example, Rats that make up the Class of 2020 were considered the [...] "Rat Mass of 2017+3" [...] as the members of their dykes' class will graduate in 2017 and they themselves will graduate three years onward from then.|$|E
2500|$|Draganović, a {{smuggler}} of fascist and Ustasha {{war criminals}} {{who had also}} been involved in pro-Fascist espionage, was recycled by the U.S. during the Cold War – his name appears in the Pentagon payrolls in the late 1950s and early 1960s – and was eventually granted immunity, ironically, in Tito's Yugoslavia, where he died in 1983 at age 79. Monsignor Karl Bayer, Rome's Director of Caritas International after the war, also cooperated with this ring. Interviewed in the 1970s by Gitta Sereny, Bayer recalled how he and Hudal had helped Nazis to South America with the Vatican's support: [...] "The Pope [...] did provide money for this; in driblets sometimes, but it did come". Hudal's <b>ratline</b> was supposedly financed by his friend Walter Rauff, with some funds allegedly coming from Giuseppe Siri, the recently appointed Auxiliary Bishop (1944) and Archbishop (1946) of Genoa. Siri was regarded as [...] "a hero of the Resistance movement in Italy" [...] during the German occupation of northern Italy. Siri's involvement remains unproven.|$|E

2500|$|According to Uki Goñi, [...] "some of the {{financing}} for Hudal's escape network {{came from the}} United States", precising that the Italian delegate of the American National Catholic Welfare Conference provided Hudal [...] "with substantial funds for his 'humanitarian' aid". Since the works of Graham and Blet were published, historian Michael Phayer, a professor at Marquette University, has alleged the close collaboration between the Vatican (Pope Pius XII and Giovanni Battista Montini, then [...] "Substitute" [...] of the Secretariat of State, and later Paul VI), {{on the one side}} and Draganović and Hudal on the other, and has claimed that Pius XII himself was directly engaged in <b>ratline</b> activity. Against these allegations of the direct involvement of Pope Pius XII and his staff, there are some opposing testimonies and the denial by Vatican officials of any involvement of Pius XII himself. According to Phayer, Bishop Aloisius Muench, an American and Pius XII's own envoy to occupied western Germany after the war, [...] "wrote to the Vatican warning the pope to desist from his efforts to have convicted war criminals excused". The letter, written in Italian, is extant in the archives of Catholic University of America.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Ratline</b> {{experience}} culminates with Resurrection Week {{ending in}} [...] "Breakout," [...] an event where the Rats are formally [...] "welcomed" [...] to the VMI community. After the {{successful completion of}} Breakout, Rats are officially fourth class students and {{no longer have to}} strain in the barracks or eat [...] "square meals." [...] Many versions of the Breakout ceremony have been conducted. In the 1950s, Rats from each company would be packed into a corner room in the barracks and brawl their way out through the upperclassmen. From the late 1960s through the early 1980s the Rats had to fight their way up to the fourth level of the barracks through three other classes of cadets determined not to let them get to the top. The stoops would often be slick with motor oil, packed with snow, glazed with ice, greased, or continuously hosed with water. The barracks stairs and rails were not able to take the abuse, so the Corps moved the breakout to a muddy hill, where Rats attempt to climb to the top by crawling on their stomachs while the upper classes block them or drag them back down. The Rats no longer breakout in the mud but instead participate in a grueling day of physical activity testing both physical endurance and teamwork.|$|E

60|$|All held. The whale {{struck the}} Mary Turner just aft of the fore-shroud. A score of things, which no eye could take in simultaneously, happened. A sailor, {{in the main}} rigging, carried away a <b>ratline</b> in both hands, fell head-downward, and was {{clutched}} by an ankle and saved head-downward by a comrade, as the schooner cracked and shuddered, uplifted on the port side, and was flung down on her starboard side till the ocean poured level over her rail. Michael, on the smooth roof of the cabin, slithered down the steep slope to starboard and disappeared, clawing and snarling, into the runway. The port shrouds of the foremast carried away at the chain-plates, and the fore-topmast leaned over drunkenly to starboard.|$|E

50|$|According to Aarons and Loftus, Hudal's private {{operation}} was small scale {{compared to what}} came later. The major Roman <b>ratline</b> was operated by a small, but influential network of Croatian priests, members of the Franciscan order, led by Father Krunoslav Draganović, who organized a highly sophisticated chain with headquarters at the San Girolamo degli Illirici Seminary College in Rome, but with links from Austria to the final embarcation point {{at the port of}} Genoa. The <b>ratline</b> initially focused on aiding members of the Croatian Ustaše including its leader (or Poglavnik), Ante Pavelić.|$|E
