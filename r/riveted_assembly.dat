In particular, {{the authors would like to}} thank Florent Braure, Guillaume Ruiz and Nicolas Gehin. In most industrial design processes, the approaches used to obtain a design solution that best fits the specification requirements result in many iterations of the “trial-and-error” type, starting from an initial solution. In this paper, a method is proposed to formalize the decision process in order to automate it, and to provide optimal design solutions. Two types of knowledge are formalized. The first expresses the satisfaction of design objectives, relating to physical behaviors of candidate design solutions. This formalization uses three models, an observation one, an interpretation one and an aggregation one; every design solution is qualified through a single performance variable (a single objective function). The second model is related to modifications that may or may not be applicable to the pre-existing solution. The Designer is often able to define preferences concerning design variables. Some modifications related to this pre-existing solution, can be preferred to other ones. A hierarchy of design variables is proposed to formalize these preferences. The concept of arc-elasticity is introduced as a post-processing indicator to qualify candidate solutions through a trade-off between the performance improvement and their relative distances to the initial solution. The proposed method is used and applied to a <b>riveted</b> <b>assembly,</b> and a genetic algorithm is used to identify optimal solutions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{inspection}} of {{materials used in}} aerospace is a critical issue for the safety. The industry claims for faster, more sensitive, more flexible and reliable nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques for the detection and characterization of potential flaws nearby rivet. For heavy carrier such as the AIRBUS A 380, the panel assembly gets thicker and requires more sensitive NDT tools {{for the detection of}} potential flaws deeply embedded into the fastened structure. Eddy current (EC) is currently the operational tool for the {{inspection of}} <b>rivet</b> <b>assembly.</b> In order to reduce the development time and to optimise the design and the performances assessment of an inspection procedure, the CEA and EADS have started a collaborative work aimed to extend the modeling features of the CIVA non destructive simulation plate-form to the case of rivet structure inspection. This contribution presents the recent progresses in developing models which have the capability to predict quickly the signal of an eddy current probe used in NDT. Simulations and experimental data of the response of eddy current probes to a fastener hole in a multi-layered slab are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Blind rivets, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "pop" [...] rivets (POP is the brand name of the original manufacturer, now owned by Stanley Engineered Fastening, a division of Stanley Black & Decker) are tubular and are supplied with a mandrel through the center. The <b>rivet</b> <b>assembly</b> is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially designed tool is used to draw the mandrel into the rivet. This expands the blind end of the rivet and then the mandrel snaps off. These types of blind rivets have non-locking mandrels and are sometimes avoided for critical structural joints because the mandrels may fall out, due to vibration or other reasons, leaving a hollow rivet that has a lower load-carrying capability than solid rivets. Furthermore, because of the mandrel they are more prone to failure from corrosion and vibration. Unlike solid rivets, blind rivets can be inserted and fully installed in a joint from only one side of a part or structure, [...] "blind" [...] to the opposite side.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of <b>riveted</b> <b>assemblies</b> for full-scale complete aircraft crashworthiness. Many comparisons between experiments and FE computations of bird impacts onto aluminium riveted panels have shown that macroscopic plastic strains were not sufficiently developed (and localised) in the riveted shell FE in the impact area. Consequently, FE models never succeed in initialising and propagating the rupture in the sheet metal plates and along rivet rows as shown by experiments, without calibrating the input data (especially the damage and failure properties of the riveted shell FE). To model the assembly correctly, it appears necessary to investigate on FE techniques such as Hybrid-Trefftz finite element method (H-T FEM). Indeed, perforated FE plates developed for elastic problems, based on a Hybrid-Trefftz formulation, {{have been found in}} the open literature. Our purpose is {{to find a way to}} extend this formulation so that the super-element can be used for crashworthiness. To reach this aim, the main features of an elastic Hybrid-Trefftz plate are presented and are then followed by a discussion on the possible extensions. Finally, the interpolation functions of the element are evaluated numerically...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Finite Element (FE) {{computations}} {{of complete}} aircraft structures subjected to impact loads requires {{the use of}} ``super-elements'' for the modelling of the <b>riveted</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Macro-elements for the fastener have been developed and validated, but, the structural embrittlement caused by holes in the sheets is not taken into account in this modelling. Some {{of the authors of the}} paper formulated and validated a hybrid-Trefftz perforated super-element able to take into account the stress concentrations due to the hole. The hole boundary however was intrinsically a load-free analytical boundary making impossible the interaction of the super-element for the perforated plate with the rivet macro-models. In this paper, a new 16 -node hybrid-Trefftz perforated super-element featuring 8 nodes on the hole boundary is formulated in order to model this interaction thanks to the new nodes and the FE hole boundary. The new perforated super-element is first validated by considering no loads applied on the nodes of the hole boundary. It is shown that the results obtained with the new super-element are very accurate whatever the test-case considered (e. g., tension, shear) and that the super-element is cost-efficient. The second step of the validation, which consists in considering, in the test-cases, nodal concentrated forces applied on the hole boundary, is in progress...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMaintenance {{of ancient}} road and railway {{metallic}} bridges {{has become a}} major concern for governmental agencies in the past few decades.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of <b>riveted</b> <b>assemblies</b> for full-scale complete aircraft crashworthiness. To perform computations aiming at locating rupture initiation in a structure featuring more than 100000 rivets, {{it is necessary to}} model the assembly areas using super-elements. If rivet elements have been developed, perforated plate super-elements are still lacking. Thus, the paper focuses on plate super finite element formulations featuring defects, in particular holes. An original eight-node plate element containing a hole has been selected to discuss on the possibility to extend its formulation from linear (elasticity) to non-linear problems (impact). However, since {{little is known about the}} features of super-elements containing a hole, it is first attempted to clarify the properties of the selected existing super-element. This kind of element is defined according to the introduced nomenclature, and the features of its interpolation functions are highlighted. The location of stress fields computed by this super-element is proved to be in close agreement with results provided by standard FE calculations. This super-element exhibits also computational efficiency. These features encourage one to pursue the extension of this super-element formulation to large high plastic strains and strain rates, aiming at localising rupture initiation when performing crashworthiness computations of structures with many rivets and holes.

40|$|This project {{attempts}} to reduce manufacturing costs incurred to Cherry Aerospace by variance in material properties. To track and predict the shear strength of PH 15 - 7 Mo stainless steel rivet stems throughout the heat treatment process, samples {{were taken from}} several steps in the manufacturing process and experimental heat treatments were performed {{across a range of}} temperatures. The supplied rivet stems were heat treated for four hours at temperatures from 520 °C to 560 °C, in increments of 10 °C. Double shear testing in accordance with ASTM 1312 - 13 A revealed that there is no apparent correlation between the strength of the supplied wire and final shear strength of the wire. It is recommended that samples be tested for impact toughness to better understand the shear behavior of the rivet stem due to the break notch. When examining the effects of composition on mechanical properties, {{there is a lack of}} evidence to suggest that any correlation can be made. Even with constant composition, different lots of wire exhibit variances in shear strength in the fully heat treated condition. It is concluded that the variances in mechanical properties of the rivet stems are influenced by other factors. These could include manufacturing operations that are not included in the scope of this project, such as stackup of tolerances in the <b>rivet</b> <b>assembly</b> or effects of cold work of the wire prior to procurement by Cherry Aerospace...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} fatigue problem on riveted {{structures}} and the correlated experimental tests. The term “fatigue” denotes the cracking of metals under repeated loading. The technique of riveting structures is obsolete {{due to the}} low level of standardization in the construction process. Knowledge concerning riveted structure’s ability to withstand fatigue has not been investigated to the same extent as for modern structures assembled by welding. Nevertheless, many riveted structures are still in service after over 100 years. Clamping force originates when the hot rivet is placed into the hole of the plates and the rivet shorten in length due to cooling. In Europe, a large number of railway bridges are riveted. Moreover, all over the world, the <b>rivet</b> <b>assembly</b> technique has been largely used for different types of buildings. The riveted structures are subjected, evidently, to fatigue degradation as all the other steel structures. The riveted joint complexity and the non-uniform realization lead to a structure-specific consideration. In Europe, current regulations recognise only one fatigue class for riveted structures neglecting the clamping force effect. This approach is characterized by an elevated standard deviation for the assessed results. This research aims to improve the riveted structures fatigue comprehension and to propose appropriate tests. Some elements have been extracted from a dismantled railway bridge located near San Stino di Livenza (Venice). An innovative clamping test (TCT) has been conceived: applying a torsional moment to the rivets and evaluating the sliding friction, the clamping force has been estimated. Contrary to traditional clamping tests, this setup, at an affordable price, provides good precision. Moreover, the test is in-site and does not provoke damages to the examined structure. Fem models of rail bearer have been realized taking into account rivets, holes and multilayer plates section inertia. A specific laboratory set up has been designed with the intention to calibrate the fem models. Frictions and clamping force have been taken into account in the rail bearer models. There is a close correspondence between the non-linear models and the experimental tests. The clamping assumptions, derived from the TCT, have been verified. A full scale fatigue test has been prepared and the first cycles have been monitored. Full scale fatigue tests are sophisticated and involve many parameters. For this test, a specific metallic frame has been designed and realized using advanced fatigue models. An advanced analysis (hot spot method) has been carried out, for the frame, in order to evaluate the stress into the welds. This frame will be used by the DICEA laboratory to test, principally, specimens extracted from bridges...|$|R

40|$|MCD 2016, 8 th Rilem International Conference on Mechanisms of Cracking and Debonding in Pavements, Nantes, FRANCE, 07 -/ 06 / 2016 - 09 / 06 / 2016 Old steel bridges made in {{mild steel}} or wrought iron were {{assembled}} by <b>riveting,</b> an <b>assembly</b> technique {{which is no}} longer used today. This one induces stress concentration, residual stresses creation and leads to fatigue prone details in such bridges. Cracking that propagates from a rivet hole, hidden by rivet head, is the typical phenomenon of fatigue damage of riveted members. Thus, especially because of increase traffic, fatigue is among the major issues for old steel highway and railway bridges (over 100 years old). Moreover, these structures are often considered as historical ones and modifications of the original element must be limited. For all these reasons, CFRP composites {{seem to be a}} good solution that could lead to fatigue life increase. Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) has been widely used to strengthen concrete structures and has a great potential to strengthen steel structures. However, limited amount of research has been done on the application of these materials to old steel materials. This paper deals with the study of cracked steel elements and their reinforcement by adhesively bonded carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) under fatigue loading. Studied specimens have typical dimensions encountered in old steelriveted joints. A real crack is propagated {{at the edge of the}} hole under fatigue loading and composites materials are then bonded taking into consideration the size of the rivet head. Several different CFRP systems were tested and their efficiency compared.

5000|$|Brake linings are {{composed}} of a relatively soft but tough and heat-resistant material with a high coefficient of dynamic friction (and ideally an identical coefficient of static friction) typically mounted to a solid metal backing using high-temperature adhesives or <b>rivets.</b> The complete <b>assembly</b> (including lining and backing) is then often called a brake pad or brake shoe. The dynamic friction coefficient [...] "µ" [...] for most standard brake pads is usually {{in the range of}} 0.35 to 0.42. This means that a force of 1000 Newtons on the pad will give a resulting brake force close to 400 Newtons. There are some racing pads that have a very high µ of 0.55 to 0.62 with excellent high-temperature behaviour. These pads have high iron content and will usually outperform any other pad used with iron discs. Unfortunately nothing comes for free, and these high µ pads wear fast and also wear down the discs at a rather fast rate. However they are a very cost effective alternative to more exotic/expensive materials.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{prediction}} {{of the dimensions}} of an assembly has concentrated on the variation of the constituent components and fixtures.

40|$|One of most {{demanding}} tasks {{in the manufacturing}} field is controlling the variability of parts as it may affect strongly the deliverability of key characteristics defined at the final (product) assembly level. Current CAT systems offer a good solution to the tolerance analysis/synthesis task, but to handle flexible objects with shape errors more effort is needed to include methods able to capture the elastic behaviour of parts that adds more variability on the final assembly. Usually, sheet metal assemblies require dedicated fixtures and clamps layout to control the gap between parts in the specific location where a join must be placed. Due to the variability of parts the position of clamps can also be varied. The paper describes a FEM-based method able take into account part flexibility and shape error to parametrically analyse sheet metal assemblies by acting on some key parameters {{to look for the}} optimal clamp layout that guarantee the gap between parts to be under control after joining parts together. This method offers, with respect to commercial solutions, the ability to model fixtures, clamps and different joint types with no matter on the mesh nodes’ position. Locations of such elements are based on the shape functions defined at element (shell) mesh level and modelled as local constraints. So the user can generate a mesh without a previous knowledge of the exact positions of clamps, for example. This allows to conduit a faster parametric analysis without remeshing the surfaces and with no need to physically model the clamps.

Design of the substructure includes determining placement of secondary stiffeners {{and the number of}} <b>rivets</b> required for <b>assembly</b> [...] In this optimization, several considerations are taken into account. The primary objective was to raise the primary natural frequencies of the structure such that the Pallet Lander primary structure does not significantly couple with the launch vehicle.

A third objective is that the calculated stress does not exceed the allowable strength of the material. These design requirements must be met while, minimizing the overall mass of the spacecraft.
