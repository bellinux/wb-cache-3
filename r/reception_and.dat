5|$|A {{strike by}} NFL players and an eye injury limited Delaney's playing {{time in the}} 1982 NFL season. He {{underwent}} surgery to repair a detached retina, and only registered 380 rushing yards in the eight-game shortened season, which the Chiefs finished with a 3–6 record. Delaney averaged 4.6 yards per carry, 9.1 yards per <b>reception,</b> <b>and</b> registered 1,811 all-purpose yards during his career with three touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|As a {{response}} to the poor <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> claims that the system could not handle the original game, Simon Thomley, who later assisted with the development of the 2013 mobile port, released an unofficial, proof-of-concept version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the system.

5|$|The {{principal}} entrance hall, <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> family bedrooms {{were placed}} on the first floor above a low semi-basement containing service rooms. The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single broad flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south. These staircases have since been replaced by simpler designs.|$|E
5|$|The sensory {{nervous system}} is {{involved}} with the <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> processing of sensory information. This information is received through the cranial nerves, through tracts in the spinal cord, and directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood. The brain also receives and interprets information from the special senses (vision, smell, hearing, and taste). Mixed motor and sensory signals are also integrated.|$|E

5|$|A {{junior and}} infant {{department}} opened in September 1997 after {{the closure of}} St Audrey's Convent school. St Audrey's was a feeder school, and its closure allowed the then headmaster, Robert Repper, to transfer most of the teaching staff to the new junior school. The junior and infant school {{has now become a}} preparatory school for the senior school. It was retitled as Magdalene House in 2005, a reference to a 17th-century scholarship which allowed two Wisbech Grammar School pupils to study at Magdalene College, Cambridge. There were 177 pupils registered in 2008, of whom 23 were in <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> the rest in years 1 to 6.|$|E

50|$|Although Hernandez's stats were {{eclipsed by}} Gronkowski, Hernandez still {{ranked in the}} top 5 in <b>receptions,</b> yards, <b>and</b> touchdowns among tight ends. According to NBC Sports, Hernandez and Gronkowski were the first pair of tight ends in NFL history to catch at least five touchdowns each in {{consecutive}} seasons for the same team. Both {{ranked in the top}} 20 among all receivers in number of catches. In 2011, they also set NFL records for yardage, <b>receptions,</b> <b>and</b> touchdowns by tight ends on one team, combining for 169 <b>receptions,</b> 2,237 yards, <b>and</b> 24 touchdowns. The previous records for <b>receptions</b> <b>and</b> yards by multiple tight ends on a single team was set in 1984 by the San Diego Chargers, who had four tight ends combine for 163 <b>receptions</b> <b>and</b> 1,927 yards; the 24 touchdowns eclipsed the record of 18 touchdowns caught by Gronkowski, Hernandez, and Alge Crumpler in 2010.|$|R
5|$|Additional {{factors that}} affect the BFO are a {{translation}} made at the ground station between the <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite oscillators due to drift and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone calls were made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU. The signals associated with these calls could not be analysed to generate a BTO value, but BFO values of these signals can {{be considered in the}} analysis with the other BTO and BFO data.|$|E
5|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, Alabama took a 3–0 lead {{early in}} the second quarter on a 25-yard Cade Foster field goal. On their next possession, the Crimson Tide scored their first touchdown on a two-play drive that saw a 42-yard Kevin Norwood <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> a one-yard Drake touchdown run for a 10–0 lead. Alabama then extended their lead to 24–0 at halftime after touchdown runs of 24-yards from Yeldon and one-yard from Drake on their final two possessions of the half.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the response is received. This measure is twice {{the distance from the}} ground station to satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{this general}} {{support for the}} concept of wind power in the public at large, local {{opposition}} often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects. For example, there are concerns that some installations can negatively affect TV and radio <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> Doppler weather radar, as well as produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values. Potential broadcast-reception solutions include predictive interference modeling {{as a component of}} site selection. A study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} July 2006 after work was {{completed}} on Titan Quest, with preparatory work beginning prior to this. Staff members returned while assuming different roles {{to the original}} game: Michael Verrette produced, Michael Sheidow acted as art director, the script was written by Dean O'Donnell, while Arthur Bruno took over as main designer. Scott Morton returned to compose new tracks. The concept was to both expand upon the narrative of Titan Quest and improve the gameplay experience. It also went for a darker aesthetic compared to the original. Announced in November 2006, it released to a positive critical <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> favorable sales.|$|E
