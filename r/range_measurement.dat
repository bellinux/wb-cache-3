All beams of each group were powered simultaneously. Except for being controlled by a master timing signal, {{each of the eight}} channels operated independently of the others. Each transmitter was on a slightly different frequency to prevent interaction with the others. The transmitted pulse, 2000 microseconds long, was coded, or tagged, by being passed through a tapped delay line which may reversed the phase at 20-microsecond intervals. Upon reception the returned signal was passed through the same tapped delay line and compressed 100:1, to 20 microseconds in order to increase the accuracy and resolution of the <b>range</b> <b>measurement,</b> which was of course a function of the interval between transmission and return.|$|E

IEEE 802. 15. 4 a wireless networks offer an inexpensive facility for localizing mobile devices by time-based <b>range</b> <b>measurements.</b> The main problems of time-based <b>range</b> <b>measurements</b> in indoor environments are errors by multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal propagation. This paper describes indoor tracking using <b>range</b> <b>measurements</b> and an Extended Kalman Filter with NLOS mitigation.

30|$|The easiest {{method for}} dealing with NLOS {{conditions}} is simply to place APs at additional locations and select those from LOS, {{but one of the}} objectives {{of this paper is to}} deploy a wireless localization system in a common and unmodified wireless network. Therefore, the PNMC technique [16] is implemented to correct the NLOS errors in <b>range</b> <b>measurements.</b> The PNMC technique was created to correct the NLOS errors in open areas. Its performance has been evaluated by simulations in [16], but as it will be shown in this paper, it also works under indoor environment conditions. Based on a statistical process, the PNMC technique corrects the NLOS effect from a record of <b>range</b> <b>measurements</b> taken through a time window in a previous stage to the positioning process. This processing relies on the statistical estimate of the NLOS <b>range</b> <b>measurements</b> ratio present in the record. The ratio is used to identify the NLOS recorded <b>range</b> <b>measurements.</b> Subsequently, the NLOS <b>range</b> <b>measurements</b> are classified in segments according to the NLOS statistical distribution. Finally, the correction is carried out by subtracting the expected NLOS errors for each segment. For a detailed explanation on the PNMC technique, see [16].|$|R
