40|$|Abstract—A <b>reticulate</b> network N of {{multiple}} phylogenetic trees may have nodes {{with two or}} more parents (called reticulation nodes). There {{are two ways to}} define the reticulation number of N. One way is to define it as the number of reticulation nodes in N [13]; in this case, a <b>reticulate</b> network with the smallest reticulation number is called an optimal type-I <b>reticulate</b> network of the trees. The better way is to define it as the total number of parents of reticulation nodes in N minus the number of reticulation nodes in N [18]; in this case, a <b>reticulate</b> network with the smallest reticulation number is called an optimal type-II <b>reticulate</b> network of the trees. In this paper, we first present a fast fixed-parameter algorithm for constructing one or all optimal type-I <b>reticulate</b> networks {{of multiple}} phylogenetic trees. We then use the algorithm together with other ideas to obtain an algorithm for estimating a lower bound on the reticulation number of an optimal type-II <b>reticulate</b> network of the input trees. To our knowledge, these are the first fixed-parameter algorithms for the problems. We have implemented the algorithms in ANSI C, obtaining programs CMPT and MaafB. Our experimental data show that CMPT can construct optimal type-I <b>reticulate</b> networks rapidly and MaafB can compute better lower bounds for optimal type-II <b>reticulate</b> networks within shorter time than the previously best program PIRN designed by Wu [18].

40|$|<b>Reticulate</b> {{ridges of}} reefs and {{sediment}} in Holocene lagoons are usually {{interpreted as an}} inheritance of antecedent karst topography. Satellite imagery served as a template for integrating plan-view geometry with published data from coring, drilling and seismic surveys to test the antecedent-karst hypothesis. The link between karst morphology and overlying reef patterns can be demonstrated convincingly for a rather limited number of examples, particularly those on a substrate of tower karst with high relief. On very young limestones, doline karst with <b>reticulate</b> patterns develops very slowly {{because of the high}} porosity. Moreover, karst control can be ruled out for the significant number of <b>reticulate</b> reefs that are founded on terrigenous sediment or on demonstrably flat pre-Holocene rock surfaces. One likely cause of <b>reticulate</b> patterns is biotic self-organization that has been shown to generate <b>reticulate</b> and labyrinthic patterns of mussel beds on tidal flats and tree cover of arid ecosystems. Another pathway to <b>reticulate</b> reefs may be the colonization of <b>reticulate</b> hydrodynamic bedforms by reef builders.

40|$|Motivation: <b>Reticulate</b> {{network is}} a model for {{displaying}} and quantifying the effects of complex <b>reticulate</b> processes on the evolutionary history of species undergoing <b>reticulate</b> evolution. A central computational problem on <b>reticulate</b> networks is: given a set of phylogenetic trees (each for some region of the genomes), reconstruct the most parsimonious <b>reticulate</b> network (called the minimum <b>reticulate</b> network) that combines the topological information contained in the given trees. This problem is well known to be NP-hard. Thus, existing approaches for this problem either work with only two input trees or make simplifying topological assumptions. Results: We present novel results on the minimum <b>reticulate</b> network problem. Unlike existing approaches, we address the fully general problem: there is no restriction {{on the number of}} trees that are input, and there is no restriction on the form of the allowed <b>reticulate</b> network. We present lower and upper bounds on the minimum number of reticulation events in the minimum <b>reticulate</b> network (and infer an approximately parsimonious <b>reticulate</b> network). A program called PIRN implements these methods, which also outputs a graphical representation of the inferred network. Empirical results on simulated and biological data show that our methods are practical {{for a wide range of}} data. More importantly, the lower and upper bounds match for many datasets (especially when the number of trees is small or reticulation level is low), and this allows us to solve the minimum <b>reticulate</b> network problem exactly for these datasets.

It was ascertained by electron microscopy that purified preparations of <b>reticulate</b> bodies obtained were almost entirely free of host-cell components and of infectious elementary bodies of MP microorganisms. Purified <b>reticulate</b> bodies were easily disrupted by mechanical agitation, and it was observed in shadowed preparation that ribosome-like particles 15 mμ in diameter were scattered from broken <b>reticulate</b> bodies.

40|$|In many phylogenetic problems, {{assuming}} that species have {{evolved from a}} common ancestor by a simple branching process is unrealistic. <b>Reticulate</b> phylogenetic models, however, have been largely neglected because the concept of <b>reticulate</b> evolution have not been supported by using appropriate analytical tools and software. The <b>reticulate</b> model can adequately describe such complicated mechanisms as hybridization between species or lateral gene transfer in bacteria. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm for inferring <b>reticulate</b> phylogenies from evolutionary distances among species. The algorithm is capable of detecting contradictory signals encompassed in a phylogenetic tree and identifying possible <b>reticulate</b> events that may have occurred during evolution. The algorithm produces a <b>reticulate</b> phylogeny by gradually improving upon the initial solution provided by a phylogenetic tree model.

Up to the 1970s, Carrick's growth was limited by the lack of town sewerage—which restricted the minimum allotment size—and reluctance of landowner's to subdivide property.
