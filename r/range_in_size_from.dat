5|$|Collegiate teams {{participating}} in the IARC have come primarily from the United States and the Peoples Republic of China, but also from Germany, England, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, Chile, Qatar, Iran, and India. Teams <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> several students, up to twenty or more. Both undergraduate and graduate students populate the teams, but some teams have been composed entirely of undergraduates or postgraduates. Industry is not permitted to enter, but it may assist the student teams with funding and equipment.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{vary greatly}} in size. They include the {{smallest}} primates {{in the world}} and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> about 30g (1.1oz) for Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae) up to 7–9kg (15–20lb) for the indri (Indri indri) and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema). When recently extinct species are considered, the size range extended up {{to that of a}} gorilla at 160–200kg (350–440lb) for Archaeoindris fontoynonti.|$|E
5|$|Lentigines — Reddish-brown to {{dark brown}} macules (surface skin lesion) {{generally}} occurring {{in a high}} number (10,000+) over {{a large portion of}} the skin, at times higher than 80% coverage. These can even appear inside the mouth (buccal), or on the surface of the eye (scleral). These have irregular borders and <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> 1mm in diameter to café-au-lait spots, several centimeters in diameter. Also, some areas of vitiligo-like hypopigmentation may be observed.|$|E
5|$|Saturn is {{probably}} {{best known for the}} system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique. The rings extend from 6,630km to 120,700km outward from Saturn's equator, average approximately 20meters in thickness and are composed of 93% water ice with traces of tholin impurities and 7% amorphous carbon. The particles that make up the rings <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> specks of dust up to 10m. While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.|$|E

5|$|Strangelets {{are small}} {{fragments}} of strange matter—a hypothetical form of quark matter—that contain roughly {{equal numbers of}} up, down, and strange quarks and that are more stable than ordinary nuclei (strangelets would <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> a few femtometers to a few meters across). If strangelets can actually exist, {{and if they were}} produced at the LHC, they could conceivably initiate a runaway fusion process in which all the nuclei in the planet would be converted to strange matter, similar to a strange star.|$|E
5|$|The county {{colleges of}} New Jersey {{represent}} 56% of all undergraduate {{students in the}} state and offer studies in 1,700 degree and certificate programs. Reflecting long-term trends nationwide, the male-to-female ratio of students in the system is 41% male to 59% female, and 48% of students are over the age of 24. Overall, the system enrolls more than 350,000 students each year on campuses that <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> 1,300 students at Salem Community College to over 15,000 students at Bergen Community College.|$|E
5|$|Uranus's {{irregular}} moons <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> 120–200km (Sycorax) {{to about}} 20km (Trinculo). Unlike Jupiter's irregulars, Uranus's show no correlation of axis with inclination. Instead, the retrograde moons {{can be divided}} into two groups based on axis/orbital eccentricity. The inner group includes those satellites closer to Uranus (a < 0.15 rH) and moderately eccentric (~0.2), namely Francisco, Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo. The outer group (a > 0.15 rH) includes satellites with high eccentricity (~0.5): Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos, and Ferdinand.|$|E

5|$|Aerodrome is a {{collective}} term for any location from which flying operations take place, although more specific terminology {{can be used}} to characterise its purpose. The CAA strategic review of GA applies the term airport to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations, and airfield to locations which predominantly support GA operations. The General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study (GASAR) analysed 687 aerodromes in England which come under the scope of GA, classifying 374 into six types. These <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> regional airports to the smallest farm strip, although 84 per cent of GA flights operate from 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> small individuals {{less than half a}} centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} have {{a single}} circular chromosome that can <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> only 160,000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacteria Candidatus Carsonella ruddii, to 12,200,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacteria Sorangium cellulosum. The genes in bacterial genomes are usually a single continuous stretch of DNA and although several different types of introns do exist in bacteria, these are much rarer than in eukaryotes. Some bacteria, including the Spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia are a notable exception to this arrangement. Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease, contains a single linear chromosome and several linear and circular plasmids.|$|E

5|$|Termites {{are among}} the most {{successful}} groups of insects on Earth, colonising most landmasses except for Antarctica. Their colonies <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals. Termite queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world, with some queens reportedly living up to 30 to 50 years. Unlike ants, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, each individual termite goes through an incomplete metamorphosis that proceeds through egg, nymph, and adult stages. Colonies are described as superorganisms because the termites form part of a self-regulating entity: the colony itself.|$|E
5|$|The first LARPs {{were run}} in the late 1970s, {{inspired}} by tabletop role-playing games and genre fiction. The activity spread internationally during the 1980s and has diversified into {{a wide variety of}} styles. Play may be very game-like or may be more concerned with dramatic or artistic expression. Events can also be designed to achieve educational or political goals. The fictional genres used vary greatly, from realistic modern or historical settings to fantastic or futuristic eras. Production values are sometimes minimal, but can involve elaborate venues and costumes. LARPs <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> small private events lasting a few hours to large public events with thousands of players lasting for days.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids are {{the most}} {{numerous}} family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. They <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> the giant petrels, which are almost {{as large as the}} albatrosses, to the prions, which are as small as the larger storm petrels. They feed on fish, squid and crustacea, with many also taking fisheries discards and carrion. All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long trans-equatorial migrations. They are colonial breeders, exhibiting long-term mate fidelity and site philopatry. In all species, each pair lays a single egg per breeding season. Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds.|$|E

A number of specialized designs exist: some can unload their own cargo, some depend on port facilities for unloading, and some even package the cargo as it is loaded. Over half of all bulkers have Greek, Japanese, or Chinese owners {{and more than a}} quarter are registered in Panama. South Korea is the largest single builder of bulkers, and 82% of these ships were built in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Once a queen has {{excavated}} a chamber, {{she will}} lay around 20 eggs that develop into larvae {{in less than}} a month. These eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults. Mature nests <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>size,</b> <b>from</b> a few hundred to over 300,000 workers. Most colonies are monogyne, meaning it only has a single queen, but some colonies can have as many as four. Oligogynous colonies also exist, in which multiple queens are present, but they are tolerated equally by workers birthed from different mothers and antagonism exists among queens. Brood discrimination is known based on recognition of kin, and queens will look after their own brood and neglect other brood laid by different queens. Queens display intolerance to each other when the first generation of workers is present, and the queens will separate from each other once the colony grows to a certain size.|$|E
