Drag force is highly correlated with an athlete's frontal area, so {{in this paper we}} describe a system to segment an athlete from the very challenging background found in a standard racing environment. Given an accurate segmentation, a front-on view, and the athlete's position (for scaling), one can effectively count the pixels and thereby measure the moving area. The method described does not rely on alteration of the track lighting, background, or athlete's appearance.

Depending on the number of harmonics in Fourier series, n, a set of 2 n+ 1 coupled equations is assembled, yielding the solution for the whole <b>representative</b> <b>period</b> rather than just a single time instant.

ERCOFTAC centrifugal pump test case is a 2 D case consisting of a single rotor and stator.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] 2. 0. CO; 2 A diagnostic model is proposed to use digitized satellite cloud brightness data to estimate objectively the large-scale flow patterns over data-void tropical regions. The model utilizes a linear barotropic vorticity equation with two primary assumptions: 1) that the area-averaged cloud brightness is positively correlated with large-scale divergence in the tropical upper troposphere; and 2) that the large-scale tropical flow is quasi-barotropic and quasi-non-divergent. It {{is designed to be}} used at any upper tropospheric level where divergence is important in determining the vorticity field. Three types of information are required: 1) boundary conditions determined from surrounding wind reports, 2) a mean zonal flow determined from climatology, and 3) an equivalent divergence forcing function constructed empirically from the brightness data. The model is tested daily over a western North Pacific region for July-August 1971. Results for an 8 -day <b>representative</b> <b>period</b> are presented and discussed. In general for 25 % of the days tested, the model produces a flow field which accurately resembles the major features of the streamfunction field analyzed by the National Meteorological Center. In another 30 % of the days it provides some valuable information about the flow patterns which would be difficult to obtain from boundary information alone. Experiments are also performed for two days in which the brightness data are enhanced by time-interpolated satellite infrared data. The resultant fl. ow fields bear better resemblance to the NMC analysis. It is thus suggested that improved results may be expected when infrared and other types of advanced satellite data are available...|$|E
