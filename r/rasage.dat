5000|$|After Shave ( [...] Beyrouth Après <b>Rasage)</b> is {{an award}} winning 2005 Lebanese short film by the Lebanese {{director}} Hany Tamba. This movie won The 2006 César Awards for best short film.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system which}} integrates computer vision and rapid manufacturing technologies to scan physical objects and to replicate the reconstructed shapes as steel faced dies using shaping deposition processes. A light-stripe range finder is used to scan the 3 -D data of the object. <b>Rasage</b> data is then processed in order to generate a solid model representation. A simulation process is incorporated to display the reconstructed object so th dat quality is checked and refined before proceeding to the fabrication process, as well as viewing object in aiternative materiMs and colors. The computer model is then replicated as a plastic prototype with stereolithography. Final[y, this prototype {{is used as a}} pattern in a thermal spray process to build a metal-faced die replica of the original object. The system is demonstrated by scanning huma face which is then replicated as a stainless-steel sculpture...|$|E
