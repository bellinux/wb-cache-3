5|$|September 15, 2003- Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Henri produce heavy rainfall over portions of Delaware, including a peak of 9.02inches (229mm) in Hockessin. The flooding damages hundreds of houses, and traps motorists in submerged vehicles. Several bridges are destroyed or damaged due to rising flood waters, including the <b>Red</b> <b>Clay</b> Creek which peaks at 17.27feet (5.2m). Damage totals $16.1million (2003USD, $18.9million 2008USD). Due to the damage, President George W. Bush declares the state a disaster area.|$|E

5|$|Having secured patent {{protection}} for his designs and general adoption by the Brandywine millers, Evans now {{turned his attention}} outside Delaware. His brother Joseph travelled widely to promote Evans's work, and according to some sources, by 1792 over one hundred mills were operating Evans machinery. When George Washington called upon Joseph Tatnall in 1790 {{to thank him for}} the flour he provided to feed the Continental Army during the War of Independence, he saw Evans's technology at work in the mills in Brandywine Village and was so impressed that had his own gristmill at Mount Vernon converted to the Evans system in 1791, the completion of which was overseen by Evans's brothers. In 1793, Evans sold his share in the <b>Red</b> <b>Clay</b> Creek mill and moved his family from Wilmington to Philadelphia, where he opened a store for milling supplies.|$|E
50|$|Erosion {{following}} the Miocene wore away the contiguous basalt nappes, which originally reached {{as far as}} the area of the Lower Main, back to isolated deposits in the central complex. Under tropical to subtropical conditions, the volcanic rocks were turned into <b>red</b> <b>clays</b> by lateritic weathering. In many places, <b>red</b> <b>clays</b> collected and bauxite was formed; moreover, the iron contained in basalt was concentrated to form iron ore. These deposits were mined {{over a long period of}} time in order to produce raw materials for industry, and the basalt was and still is a highly popular raw material for gravel and natural stone production.|$|R
40|$|Red clays from Cenozoic palaeosols of the Eastern Alps record {{periods of}} stagnating uplift and {{decrease}} of relief. Tropical to sub-tropical weathering of a crystalline substratum formed dominant or abundant kaolinite, reflecting Paleogene and Early Miocene conditions, respectively. Abundant illite and chlorite, but {{a lack of}} kaolinite in <b>red</b> <b>clays</b> on the plateaus of the Northern Calcareous Alps reflects feldspar-poor compositons of the Cenozoic siliciclastic cover. The presence of high Ba/Sr and Rb/Sr ratios and vermiculite in these <b>red</b> <b>clays</b> indicates high precipitation and temperate weathering conditions, respectively, during the Late Miocene and Early Pilocene on the uplifting plateaus of the Northern Calcareous Alps...|$|R

5|$|In North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, {{rainfall}} {{was generally}} light, {{with the exception}} of a few areas receiving over 3inches (75mm). Henri produced greater amounts of rain in Delaware and Pennsylvania, with a peak of 9.02in (229mm) in Hockessin. In Downingtown, Pennsylvania, over eightinches (203mm) of rain fell in around sixhours, while Doppler Radar estimated that Kennett Square received over 10inches (255mm) in a five-hour period. The heavy rainfall led to record discharge rates along the <b>Red</b> <b>Clay</b> Creek, which also had a record crest peaking at just below 26feet (8m). Parts of the creek saw a 500-year flood, which has a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year. Numerous rivers in southeastern Pennsylvania also crested above their flood stage.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus {{is known}} from three {{specimens}} {{collected in the}} lowlands of the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region in southeastern Nicaragua. The first, an old male, was collected on November5, 1904, in a banana plantation with very moist <b>red</b> <b>clay</b> on the Río Escondido near El Rama. The second, a young adult male, was caught on July26, 1966, in dense cane on the south bank of the Río Mico at El Recreo, 15km (9mi) west from {{the location of the}} first specimen, along with three other rice rats (O.couesi, Melanomys caliginosus, and Oligoryzomys fulvescens), the cotton rat Sigmodon hirsutus, and the cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus brasiliensis. The third was caught at a stream near Bluefields. Reid suggested that the species is semiaquatic, spending some time in the water, like other Oryzomys.|$|E

40|$|Visual {{examination}} of the cores and microscopic {{examination of}} smear slides of {{the wide variety of}} sediments cored on Leg 1 revealed an equal range of particle origins, modes of transport, and manner of deposition. Brown deep-sea clays characterize the uppermost (Pliocene-Pleistocene) sediments of the Atlantic sites, and <b>red</b> deep-sea <b>clay</b> was cored below Middle Eocene sediments at Site 7. The main mineral constituents are clay minerals and quartz. The color results mainly from iron and manganese minerals. Manganese oxides are present in small nodules in theses <b>red</b> <b>clays.</b> The X radiographs of Site 4 and Site 7 commonly show a distinct granular texture, presumably because of the X-ray opaque limonite and pyrite grains. For Site 4 they also show larger ferruginous and possibly manganiferous nodules, some of which appear to be mineralized pumice fragments. With certain exceptions, the general composition of the brown and <b>red</b> <b>clays</b> cored on Leg 1 (the presence of much kaolinite and quartz, and scarcity of zeolite) suggests a largely terrigenous origin...|$|R

5|$|Oliver Evans {{was born}} in Newport, Delaware on September 13, 1755 to Charles and Ann Stalcop Evans. His father was a cordwainer by trade, though he {{purchased}} a large farm {{to the north of}} Newport on the <b>Red</b> <b>Clay</b> Creek and moved his family there when Oliver was still in his infancy. Oliver was the fifth of twelve children; he had four sisters and seven brothers. Little else is known of Evans's early life, and surviving records provide few details as to his formative years. The nature and location of his early education has not been preserved, however his literacy was demonstrably strong from a young age, both as a writer and an avid reader on technical subjects. Aged 17, Evans was apprenticed to a wheelwright and wagon-maker in Newport. An anecdote from the period recalls that his master, an illiterate and extremely frugal man, forbade Evans the use of candles to illuminate his reading in the evenings. Evans found another way by collecting scraps and shavings of wood from his work during the day to serve as fuel for small fires. The Revolutionary War began when Evans was 19. He enlisted in a Delaware militia company, but saw no active service during the war.|$|E

40|$|In Castaiiar Cave (Caceres, Spain), {{coatings}} of <b>red</b> <b>clays</b> {{cover the}} walls of the chambers, coexisting with diverse speleothems of aragonite, calcite, huntite and dolomite. The mineralogy of the clays is mainly illite, chlorite, kaolinite, smectite, quartz and Fe oxides and hydroxides such as goethite. They can be transported into the cave by infiltration waters or form by in situ alteration of the host rock: layers of dolomite rich in Fe and magnesite interbedded with greywackes and shales. Present-day hydrological conditions in the cave and conditions during the formation of speleothems have determined that the clays have not been transported by any flooding or seepage, but mostly staying in situ, and not included into carbonate crystal forms. Thus, most of the well-preserved speleothems are white and not stained, conforming an interesting chromatic contrast with the <b>red</b> <b>clays</b> that represent an additional attraction in this show cave...|$|R
