5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of race and}} of ethnic relations is {{the area of the}} discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of racism, residential segregation, and other complex social processes between different <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups.</b> This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism. Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is found among all social, <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> {{and has been}} reported {{in all parts of the}} world; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females. The tics of Tourette syndrome begin in childhood and tend to remit or subside with maturity; thus, a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults, and observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults. As children pass through adolescence, about one-quarter become tic-free, almost one-half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level, and less than one-quarter have persistent tics. Only 5 to 14% of adults experience worse tics in adulthood than in childhood.|$|E

40|$|This article extends Stratford's brief {{observations}} about the problematic status of <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> statistics {{to a discussion}} of the relationship among these statistics, public policy, and the conceptual status of race and ethnicity. Federal statistics are organizational products that are socially constructed. They represent the implementation of public policies that govern political, social, and economic life. It is the interaction between politics and the subjective meaning of race and ethnicity that is responsible for the continual modification of <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> statistics. The article discusses the premises on which <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> statistics have been based and illustrates how they were implemented in the instructions of the decennial censuses for classifying the race and ethnicity of the population. The article then summarizes some of the empirical evidence from recent research conducted by federal agencies and social scientists to show that <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> statistics produced by government record keeping systems have no objective status. The meaning of race and ethnicity is contextual, situational, and subjective, and, thus, how respondents and observers define these concepts has significant consequences for the quality of federal statistics...|$|R

25|$|Aversive {{racism is}} a form of {{implicit}} racism in which a person's unconscious negative evaluations of racial or ethnic minorities are realized by a persistent avoidance of interaction with other <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups.</b> As opposed to traditional, overt racism, which is characterized by overt hatred for and explicit discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, aversive racism is characterized by more complex, ambivalent expressions and attitudes. Aversive racism is similar in implications to the concept of symbolic or modern racism (described below), which is also a form of implicit, unconscious, or covert attitude which results in unconscious forms of discrimination.|$|E
40|$|Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity," {{formerly}} known as "Statistical Policy Directive 15," is a classification system that has {{formed the basis of}} the U. S. government's collection and presentation of data on race and ethnicity since 1977. During the mid- 1990 s, it underwent a public evaluation to determine whether the <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> categories should be revised. This article examines the history of Statistical Policy Directive 15 from its origins through October 1997 and evaluates its consequences on political, economic, and social life. Among the many lessons that government information specialists can take away from the history of Statistical Policy Directive 15 is that classification systems are not neutral tools that objectively reflect and measure the empirical world. Classification systems cannot be isolated from the larger political setting. They are tightly linked to public policies, and, in the case of <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> classification, they constitute highly contested social policy about which there is little public consensus...|$|R

Race is a complex concept, and the two major competing theories of race use biological definitions and social construction to define racial difference. Although this relationship can vary depending on the definitions used, race is generally used in the context of health research as a fluid concept to group populations of people according to various factors that include {{but are not limited to}} ancestry, social identity, visible phenotype, and genetic makeup. Determinants of health include environmental, social, and genetic factors, as well as the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.|$|E
