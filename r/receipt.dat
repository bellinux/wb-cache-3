This introduces an errors-in-variables bias causing the estimated income effect of child support on hours worked to be biased toward zero. When one replaces actual <b>receipts</b> with predicted permanent <b>receipts,</b> such income effect is found to be statistically indistinguishable from that of other non-wage income.
