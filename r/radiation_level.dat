They conducted contamination and <b>radiation</b> <b>level</b> surveys and found that there was no contamination, but the radiation dose rate was as high as 10 mSv/h near the source, which kept them from getting close enough to determine what the source was. Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night. The scrapyard and immediate vicinity were cordoned off, but evacuation was deemed unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{isolation of}} Callisto {{means that it}} has never been appreciably tidally heated, which has important consequences for its internal structure and evolution. Its distance from Jupiter also means that the charged-particle flux from Jupiter's magnetosphere at its surface is relatively lowabout 300 times lower than, for example, that at Europa. Hence, unlike the other Galilean moons, charged-particle irradiation has had a relatively minor effect on Callisto's surface. The <b>radiation</b> <b>level</b> at Callisto's surface is equivalent to a dose of about 0.01 rem (0.1 mSv) per day, which is over ten times higher than Earth's average background radiation.|$|E

The radiation levels near the filter cartridge replacement valves reach 4.7 millisieverts per hour after just 5 hours of operation, reportedly due to oil and sludge in the water which contained more radioactivity than expected.|$|E

At the bottom of the primary containment structure, 60 centimeters of water was found, instead of the 3 meters expected at that place. The <b>radiation</b> <b>level</b> measured was 72.9 Sievert per hour. Because of this, the endoscope could only function a few hours at this place.

25|$|Prior to the accident, {{the maximum}} {{permissible}} dose for Japanese nuclear workers was 100mSv in any one year, but on 15 March 2011, the Japanese Health and Labor Ministry enforced the permitted 250mSv limit, {{in light of the}} situation at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. However, the workers at Fukushima plant declined the elevated 250mSv limit and kept adopting the previous 100mSv. Tokyo Enesys, a TEPCO's subsidiary, adopts 80mSv to manage the <b>radiation</b> <b>level</b> monitoring with some buffer. Kandenko, Kajima and Taisei Corporation adopted 100mSv. Hitachi rewrote internal rule as 200mSv. TEPCO decided to move workers around 200mSv to low-radiated site while its subsidiaries, Tokyo Enesys and Kandenko, adopted limits around 100mSv. Over 30 workers were radiated beyond 100 mSv by 23 April 2011.|$|E
25|$|Size is not {{the only}} factor in making red dwarfs {{potentially}} unsuitable for life, however. On a red dwarf planet, photosynthesis on the night side would be impossible, since it would never see the sun. On the day side, because the sun does not rise or set, areas in the shadows of mountains would remain so forever. Photosynthesis as we understand it would be {{complicated by the fact that}} a red dwarf produces most of its radiation in the infrared, and on the Earth the process depends on visible light. There are potential positives to this scenario. Numerous terrestrial ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis, for instance, which would be possible in a red dwarf system. A static primary star position removes the need for plants to steer leaves toward the sun, deal with changing shade/sun patterns, or change from photosynthesis to stored energy during night. Because of the lack of a day-night cycle, including the weak light of morning and evening, far more energy would be available at a given <b>radiation</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

A questionnaire survey was administered to a random sample of non-evacuee community residents from 49 municipalities of Fukushima prefecture from February to April 2016, and data from 1684 respondents (34. 4 %) were analyzed. Environmental <b>radiation</b> <b>levels</b> {{at the time of the}} accident were ascertained from survey meter data, while environmental <b>radiation</b> <b>levels</b> at the time of the survey were ascertained from monitoring post data. In the questionnaire, immediate fear/anxiety after the accident, current radiation anxiety, and psychological distress were measured using a single-item question, a 7 -item scale, and K 6, respectively. Multilevel linear or logistic regression models were applied to analyze the determinants of radiation anxiety and psychological distress. The findings showed that environmental <b>radiation</b> <b>levels</b> at the time of the survey were more strongly associated with radiation anxiety than <b>radiation</b> <b>levels</b> immediately after the accident. Disaster-related experiences, such as direct damage, disaster-related family stress, and fear/anxiety after the accident, and demographic characteristics (e. g., younger age, being married, low socioeconomic status) were significantly associated with radiation anxiety. Environmental <b>radiation</b> <b>levels</b> at the time of the accident or survey were not significantly associated with psychological distress. Radiation anxiety largely mediated the association between fear/anxiety after the accident and psychological distress.
