500|$|Carol Swiderski of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that}} {{although}} saying [...] "have a nice day" [...] {{may not be}} sincere, the speaker has acknowledged that the recipient is there. She argued [...] "ave we become so analytic that we can't accept these little niceties without asking ourselves, 'Did he <b>really</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it?</b> Does she really care if I have a nice day?'" [...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot". She encouraged people to respond to [...] "have a nice day" [...] with [...] "you have a nice day, too" [...] because she hoped that when {{a sufficient number of}} people do this, there could be a time when people will sincerely intend it.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, while {{promoting}} her eighth studio album Damita Jo, Jackson made surprise {{performances of}} [...] "Together Again" [...] and [...] "All Nite (Don't Stop)" [...] at New York's Gay Pride March. [...] "Together Again" [...] {{was one of}} her older songs on the 2008 Rock Witchu Tour, her first tour in seven years. It was at the middle of the setlist. She was dressed in a gold and black glam hip hop-inspired track suit, and one gold glove. Variety magazine's Phil Gallo likened her vocals in the song to that of Diana Ross's. Rap-Up noted the audience [...] "went wild" [...] during the song. While reviewing the Vancouver concert, Marsha Lederman of Globe and Mail noted that the most memorable moment of the show was when Jackson [...] "stopped on the catwalk after her hit Together Again, listened to the crowd roar its approval, and became emotional – really emotional. We're talking tears. 'Thank you,' she said – seeming to <b>really</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it,</b> as she waved her hands, begging the audience to stop", she completed. While promoting her second greatest hits album Number Ones, the singer performed an eight-minute medley of six hits during the American Music Awards of 2009. It included [...] "Control", [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", [...] "If", [...] "Make Me", and finished with [...] "Together Again". For the latter's performance, Jackson stood alone at center stage, smiling, as the received applauses and standing ovation from the audience. It also was the closing song of her concert at Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, in July 2010, which she headlined. [...] "Together Again" [...] was again performed as a closing number on her [...] 2011 tour as a dedication to her late brother, Michael Jackson, wearing a tight white one-piece disco suit. MTV News' writer Vaughn Schoonmaker noted that the song appeared to be the biggest hit of the show. Jackson also included the song on her 2015-16 Unbreakable World Tour. Writing for the Hartford Courant, Thomas Kintner pointed out that [...] "A finale of 'Together Again', offered as a simple tribute that recalled her brother again, proved the evening's highlight, a relaxed trip through the sort of juicy pop Jackson has stockpiled throughout her career, and which still charms when she lets it run". The song is also included on the 2017 State of the World Tour.|$|E
