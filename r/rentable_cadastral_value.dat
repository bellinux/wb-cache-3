40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is {{to address the issue}} of social {{inequity}} in Italy due to property taxation. The European Union has declared the fact that <b>cadastral</b> <b>values</b> used to define property taxation in Italy do not reflect market prices. In this paper, we analyze the discrepancies between <b>cadastral</b> <b>values</b> and listing prices. Furthermore, we find empirical coefficients to apply to current <b>cadastral</b> <b>values</b> to reduce the spread between current <b>cadastral</b> <b>values</b> and market prices. The procedure used is very simple and could easily be applied by local public administrations in order to correct the inequity produced by the current property taxation system within the same city and among various cities...|$|R

The modernization of cadastral and land register systems creates new possibilities of defining taxes based on real estate ownership. The system of real estate tax is going to be modified. The tax based on estate area is suggested to be changed into the tax based on estate’s value, that is defined in the polish law system as <b>cadastral</b> <b>value.</b> <b>Cadastral</b> <b>value</b> calculation as the basis for due estate tax is going to take place in the whole country.

Materials and methods. The objectives of the article are: the rules of law in assessment activities; the results of the cadastral valuation of real estate in settlements of Russia; comparative analysis of the factors determining the market (<b>cadastral)</b> <b>value</b> of real estate. Results. Formulated the axiom about the market (cadastral) cost of the reproducible factors of a single property. It is shown that in the theory and practice of measurement in market (<b>cadastral)</b> <b>value</b> of real estate of Russia violated article 3 of the law 135 -FZ of 29. 07. 1998. As a consequence, the market (cadastral) cost of the capital construction objects 2 - 5 times overestimated, and the market (<b>cadastral)</b> <b>value</b> of land in the 2 - 15 times underestimated.

The conclusion is made about the negative impact of exclusion of independent appraisers from the process of cadastral valuation of real estate. The proposed amendment to the draft law “On state cadastral evaluation” changes {{in the structure of the}} Commission on dispute resolution, which in addition to representatives of administrations of municipalities should include representatives of the business community and independent evaluators in equal proportions. It is recommended to develop less longlasting mechanism for dealing with disputes about the size of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>value</b> of real estate in the commissions and courts, returning powers from the courts of common use in arbitration courts, as well as to make decision which would make the processes more transparent and objective. For the calculation of the taxable base of real estate it is proposed to use two different systems of determining the <b>cadastral</b> <b>value</b> of real estate: for objects of taxation on which there is a civil turnover on the real estate market (residential, trading and business centers, offices, commercial facilities and catering facilities) based on the market value of real estate; for objects of taxation on which there is no civil, there is no market data about similar transactions (industrial buildings and structures, objects of incomplete construction, agricultural, and other buildings), through the establishment of <b>cadastral</b> <b>value</b> of the normative legal acts of bodies of state and municipal authorities...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse the currently existing problems in state cadastral registration and land valuation in the Russian Federation, both at the Federal and regional levels. In the present paper, information on the results of the cadastral valuation of land parcels in the Sverdlovsk region is presented. Based on an analysis of the data, it is possible to distinguish the following problems in this area: the imperfection of the methods of valuation and regulatory framework, the lack of accurate land boundaries: secrecy and opacity in the system of assigning information. The main stages of professional cadastral registration in the Russian Federation are reviewed. The approaches taken to determine the <b>cadastral</b> <b>value</b> of land according to Russian practices are discussed.

40|$|Abstract. The current {{difficulties}} of the Italian public budget are likely to lead it to exceed the European limit that sets a deficit not superior to 3 % of the GDP. It seems that the council property tax regulations, adopted by Legislative Decree 102 / 2013 last August, will not be transformed into law. The regulations included {{the abolition of the}} council tax (IMU), which currently affects buildings in relation to their land value and not their market value. This study – developed in equal parts by the two authors – is based on the difference, abnormal in the Italian case, between these two values as well as the social and economic inequalities it generates. It proposes an expeditious model capable of reducing the inequality inherent in the mechanism of tax, ensuring the differentiation of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>value</b> at least with respect to the location of the housing, which-together with the construction characteristics – contributes to the diversification of the market value of the property...|$|R

The effectiveness of the model, which requires the definition of a value function according to the evaluation logic of typical values procedure, is tested through an application to an urban area on municipal scale...|$|R

Particular attention {{is given to the}} use of the service "Public cadastral map', available on the portal of the Federal Service for State Registration, Cadastre and Cartography: advantages and disadvantages of the use of undeveloped and sparsely populated areas of service information. Clarified what objects other than those required by regulatory and technical documents and regulations can be obtained by using the public cadastral map using its various functions: cadastral division maps, raster maps Russian and available on a portal of Earth Remote Sensing Data. In the article it is assumed that the accuracy of the image contour of the situation and the relief map material from open sources corresponds to map scale is larger than 1 : 100 000 with the height of the relief section of not less than 20 meters. Mass assessment is based on {{the possibility of}} placing some or all of the seven species of water potential in the waters of hydroelectric complex. Potential benefits of each of the water users, attributable to the land plot is set on the basis of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>value</b> of land corresponding to each type of water. The area used by each of the water users, established in accordance with its requirements to the bottom topography, the provisions of water and nature protection legislation. Justification is made on the basis of the calculation of measurement error plot area used by water users in their economic activity, taking into account the errors in the image of the contour of the situation on these maps. It was found that the error introduced by cartographic materials used in certain methods of mass estimation of cost of land area, reserved for the construction of multi-purpose reservoirs does not exceed 0. 6 - 1. 3 %. In accordance with the provisions on the determination of the estimated cost of construction of unique structures allowable error should be no more than 10 %. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{authenticated}} deeds {{include the}} transaction {{prices for the}} groups of estates or estates with complicated structure. Prices obtained from authenticated deeds neither {{can be used for}} market analysis, nor for similar estates value estimation. The need for the whole estate price separation into unit transaction prices appears then. Finding solution of this problem enables using information from authenticated deeds in the estates market analysis. It also helps in applying this data into similar estates <b>cadastral</b> and market <b>value</b> estimation. The model of estate transaction price (from authenticated deed) dividing into particular elements prices is presented in this paper. Number of transactions is often smaller then deliberated estate elements number, so the conditional estates unit prices model should be used for estimation. The deliberated real estates are grouped according to its destination in the local spatial development plan, building type and the building usage. The conditional equations should be set to separate the whole transaction price into elements prices, for every group of similar estates...|$|R
40|$|Fra i temi affrontati dalla legge 11 marzo 2011, n. 23, recante delega al governo per un sistema fiscale più equo, spiccano le questioni fondamentali della riforma catastale e della fiscalità energetico-ambientale, di cui si tratta nel presente studio. La nuova riforma del catasto dei fabbricati aspira a realizzare un sistema fiscale più perequato at-traverso la rimozione della disparità fra redditi (e valori) catastali e redditi (e valori) osservabili nei mercati immobiliari. Il tema catastale è rilevante per i molteplici effetti fiscali che ne derivano, e il divario esistente fra i valori di mercato e quelli catastali, hanno suscitato un grande interesse degli studiosi di estimo, stimolando la produzione di una mole di interventi di natura teorica, sulle finalità ed obiettivi del catasto, ed operativa, con sperimentazioni e proposte di procedimenti estimativi immobiliari professionali o appositamente concepiti per le applicazioni ca-tastali. Questi studi affrontato le tematiche suddette principalmente in rapporto agli immobili a destinazione ordinaria e ai fondi agricoli. Le problematiche di equità fiscale che la legge delega intende affrontare mediante la riforma del catasto dei fabbricati emergono, tuttavia, non soltanto nell’ambito delle {{categorie}} di immobili a destinazione ordinaria, ma altresì per gli immobili a destinazione speciale. Questo contributo approfondisce il tema in rapporto agli impianti per la produzione energetica da fonti alternative diffuse sul territorio (irraggiamento solare e vento). Il diverso “potenziale energetico locale” dei vari siti geografici, consente di rilevare una “rendita solare” differenziale che si concretizza in una variegata redditività di analoghi impianti a fonti rinnovabili diffuse installati su territori con localizzazione geografica differente. Alla luce di tale osservazione, si evidenziano i li-miti del procedimento adottato dal sistema normativo italiano e dalla prassi catastale per la stima della rendita catastale degli impianti a fonti rinnovabili e si proporre un rimedio coerente con gli obiettivi di incentivazione delle produzioni energetiche a più elevata qualità ambientale, da perseguire anche mediante un’adeguata fiscalità energetica, come prescrive l’art. 15 della legge delega in oggetto. Among {{the topics}} {{addressed by the}} Law of 11 March 2014 n. 23, delegating to the government for a fairer tax system, there are two fundamental issues which {{are the subject of}} this study, the cadastral reform and the energy and environmental taxation. The new reform of the cadastre of buildings aspires to achieve a more equalized tax system by removing the disparity between cadastral incomes (and assessable values) and incomes (and property values) observable in real estate markets. The Law n. 23 / 2014 also introduces the necessity of defining an energy-environmental taxation in order to promote the growth of green economy. The definition of an energy and environmental taxation is very broad issue. It includes many aspects related to the activities of production and consumption. However, with regard {{to the development of the}} electric energy market from renewable sources, it is referable to the theme of greater correspondence between <b>cadastral</b> incomes and <b>values</b> and respective incomes and values in actual market. The disparity in the definition of <b>cadastral</b> incomes and <b>values</b> affects the whole system of taxation that comes from them. It is the whole system of real estate taxation, including on property taxes or taxes on other real rights on real estate, the taxes due in the sale and transfer by gift or inheritance of properties and also the income tax of individuals. For the resulting consequences on the tax system, the gap between real estate market <b>values</b> and <b>cadastral</b> <b>values</b> have aroused great interest of appraisal scholars, that agree on the need for similarity of assessed values registered in the cadastre and values detectable on actual market. This condition must be satisfied in order to allow the cadastre to perform properly its own fiscal function. The cadastral estimation applied to buildings in ordinary destination generates inequalities arising in part from the macroscopic analysis of the built environment - which set aside an accurate segmentation of the housing market - and in part by the application of the estimation procedure "for classes and rates", in which the linking scales of real estate earnings and the linking scale of municipalities allow us to attribute to individual real estate units the relative rates of cadastral estimation. These apply to consistencies of the surface obtained, in their turn, with automatic coefficients for the conversion of the cadastral rooms. Issues of tax equity similar to those that the delegating law wants to address through the reform of the cadastre of buildings belonging to ordinary cadastral categories (A, B and C) emerge also in relation to real estate immovable for special purposes and for lands. For what concerns power plants using renewable energy sources, the theme of the lack of fairness in taxation for real estate properties for special purpose is of great importance for supporting the development of green economy in Italy. The present contribution deals with the theme of equity in attribution of cadastral incomes to installations for the production of electric energy using alternative sources scattered on the land (solar irradiation and wind power). A remedy for reducing inequality of incomes attributed according to current cadastral praxis is proposed. In Italy, the electricity production market from renewable sources was still negligible at the end of the nineties. Following the impetus provided by incentive policies adopted since 2001, the program "Photovoltaic roofs" and the five subsequent versions of the so-called "Energy Account", it has developed rapidly in the fields of photovoltaic and wind power. With the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (PAN) and the recent National Energy Strategy (SEN), developed in the context of energy and environmental policies promoted by the Euro-pean Union, Italy has made specific commitments on development of use of renewable energy sources and on the reduction of the production of greenhouse gases. These commitments require, among other things, a new increase in the produc-tion of electric energy by technologies free from production of greenhouse gases. Therefore, the issue of fairness in the attribution of cadastral income to installations producing electric energy by renewable sources, already involving a large number of plants, will affect in the short to medium term a growing number of installations, and most importantly, a significantly higher in-stalled power, with considerable effects on tax revenues resulting from the tax base of cadastral nature. In general, the photovoltaic and wind power plants belong to the cadastral category "D/ 1 - factories", unless they have a modest power and are in-tended for self-consumption or are classifiable in the category "D/ 10 " of "factory buildings for the production functions related to agricultural activities". Operational difficulties related to the lack of active markets for lease and sale of property units intended for special and particular use are found more so in the still latent market for solar and wind power installations. This circumstance makes it inapplicable, in cadastral praxis, the direct estimation procedure of the cadastral income for derivation from the gross average annual lease fee. A similar difficulty arises in the application of the indirect estimating method of the cadastral income derived from the capital <b>value.</b> Therefore, the <b>cadastral</b> praxis commonly resorts to the indirect process deriving income from the capital value expressed by the value of the reconstruction cost. Therefore, the annual income of wind and photovoltaic power plants surveyed in the cadastral category D/ 1 is determined by multiplying the reconstruction cost of the installation by an appropriate fruitfulness rate. Based on the in-dications of the prevailing case law, the latter is assumed to be equal to 2...|$|R
