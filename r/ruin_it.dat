5|$|During the Civil War, and {{the siege}} of Basing House between 1643 and 1645, the town played host to large numbers of Parliamentarians. During this time, St. Michael's Church was damaged whilst being used as an {{explosive}} store and lead was stripped {{from the roof of}} the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, Basingstoke leading to its eventual <b>ruin.</b> <b>It</b> had been incorporated in 1524, but was effectively out of use after the Civil War. The 17th century saw serious damage to much of the town and its churches, because of the great fires of 1601 and 1656. Cromwell is thought to have stayed here towards the end of {{the siege of}} Basing House, and wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons addressed from Basingstoke.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{deteriorated}} {{through the}} 18th century, and by 1800 Doune was a roofless <b>ruin.</b> <b>It</b> remained so until the 1880s, when George Stuart, 14th Earl of Moray (1816–1895) began repair works. The timber roofs were replaced, and the interiors, including the panelling in the Lord's Hall, were installed. The castle is now maintained by Historic Scotland, having been donated to a predecessor organisation by Douglas Stuart, 20th Earl of Moray, in 1984, and {{is open to}} the public. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and is a Category A listed building, the highest levels of protection for nationally important built heritage in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the battle}} was shot at Ústí nad Labem in the Czech Republic. Only the {{entrance}} to Aslan's How was built on location. Adamson wanted Peter and Miraz's duel to feel unique and not like a controlled, overly choreographed fencing match: Moseley and Castellitto began training for the scene in November 2006. The stunt coordinator Allan Poppleton doubled for Castellitto in some shots because they are similar in size. For claustrophobic shots, cameras were built into their shields. The main camera was placed on a 360 degree track surrounding the <b>ruin</b> <b>it</b> takes place on. The filmmakers dug a large {{hole in the ground}} for the scene where the Narnians cause the pillars supporting the growth near Aslan's How to collapse on the Telmarines. The earth was then restored following completion of the scene. They also had to restore the grass after filming numerous cavalry charges. 18,000 fern plants were imported to the Czech Republic to create a forest. A scene shot in Poland, which involved building a cliff face, also had to leave no trace behind. Filming finished by September 8, 2007.|$|E

500|$|Craigmillar Castle is {{a ruined}} medieval castle in Edinburgh, Scotland. It is [...] {{south-east}} {{of the city}} centre, on a low hill {{to the south of}} the modern suburb of Craigmillar. The Preston family of Craigmillar, the local feudal barons, began building the castle in the late 14th century and building works continued through the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1660 the castle was sold to Sir John Gilmour, Lord President of the Court of Session, who made further alterations. The Gilmours left Craigmillar in the 18th century, and the castle fell into <b>ruin.</b> <b>It</b> is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} abbey {{had been allowed}} to fall into <b>ruin,</b> <b>it</b> began to attract the {{attention}} of artists and writers, and was a popular subject throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1755, the antiquarian Horace Walpole praised the ruins in his letters following a visit with the poet Thomas Gray, claiming they were [...] "In short, not the ruins of Netley, but of Paradise". In 1764, George Keate wrote The Ruins of Netley Abbey, A poem, which showed a romantic appreciation of the ruins and evoked sympathy for the life formerly led there by the monks. He prefaced his poem with a heartfelt plea for the preservation of the remains.|$|E
500|$|In 1802, the Barbaulds {{moved to}} Stoke Newington where Rochemont {{took over the}} {{pastoral}} duties of the Chapel at Newington Green. Barbauld herself was happy to be nearer her brother, John, because her husband's mind was rapidly failing. Rochemont developed a [...] "violent antipathy {{to his wife and}} he was liable to fits of insane fury directed against her. One day at dinner he seized a knife and chased her round the table so that she only saved herself by jumping out of the window." [...] Such scenes repeated themselves to Barbauld's great sadness and real danger, but she refused to leave him. Rochemont drowned himself in the nearby New River in 1808 and Barbauld was overcome with grief. When Barbauld returned to writing, she produced the radical poem Eighteen Hundred and Eleven (1812) that depicted England as a <b>ruin.</b> <b>It</b> was reviewed so viciously that Barbauld never published another work within her lifetime, although it is now often viewed by scholars as her greatest poetic achievement. Barbauld died in 1825, a renowned writer, and was buried in the family vault in St Mary's, Stoke Newington. After Barbauld's death, a marble tablet was erected in the Newington Green Chapel with the following inscription: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{her earlier}} episodes, {{producers}} {{set up a}} rivalry between Babe and her brother-in-law Stan Carter, portrayed by Timothy West. The reason for their shared hatred was not explained until Sylvie arrived, when {{it was revealed that}} Babe was in love with Stan and believed Sylvie stole Stan when they were younger. Vicky Prior of the Metro described that there is [...] "no love lost" [...] between Babe and Stan, and speculated that Babe and Stan may have had an affair. Katy Brent-Stacey of the Daily Mirror said Babe's life was [...] "wasted" [...] because she spent it [...] "hoping that Stan would notice her". Miller (Daily Express) described Babe as being [...] "madly in love" [...] with Stan. All About Soap said that [...] "all those years of unrequited love [...] made Babe pretty bitter". Shelley (Daily Mail) was critical of Babe's feelings for Stan, writing, [...] " [...] only made worse by the scriptwriters' occasional, predictable, attempts at trying to evoke viewers' sympathy over her lovelorn feelings for her sister's husband Stan." [...] When Stan is diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, Babe is [...] "devastated" [...] at the prospect of losing him. Stan becomes engaged to Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) and when his health deteriorates, they decide to marry quickly. Babe attempts to <b>ruin</b> <b>it</b> by bringing Sylvie to see Stan, but they decide to marry nevertheless. Babe is delighted when Stan is physically unable to say his vows, but is devastated when he dies. Gary Gillatt of Inside Soap expressed his approval of Babe's rivalry with Cora and said, [...] "there's a hot new rivalry in Walford – and we can't get enough if it!" ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{military}} historian Allen Brown Rochester's keep is [...] "among the finest and oldest in all England". Since its construction it underwent limited alteration, {{aside from the}} rebuilding of one corner, and although now {{in a state of}} <b>ruin</b> <b>it</b> remains significantly intact and {{is considered one of the}} most important surviving 12th-century keeps in England and France. The keep was richly decorated with hangings and furnishings. Dating from the second quarter of the 12th century, it is Rochester Castle's dominant feature. It had a square plan, and measures [...] externally with pilaster buttresses at each corner. The keep was built in the castle's southern corner, close to the curtain wall. The primary building material was local Kentish Ragstone, although Caen stone used to face the keep was imported from Normandy. The same material was imported for the Tower of London's White Tower in the 11th century. The tops of the turrets rise [...] above the ground, 12ft above the battlements. Below the latter are rectangular holes, marking where wooden hoarding would have been attached. Though 12ft thick at the base, the walls of the keep taper to 10ft at the top. It is the tallest keep in England, and only those at Dover, the Tower of London, Colchester, and Norwich are larger. During John's siege of Rochester in 1215, the south-east corner collapsed; during HenryIII's reign it was rebuilt as a cylinder. The windows increase in size higher up the walls, although only the uppermost were decorated. A spiral staircase in the north-east corner provided access to all floors, and another in the south-west corner went from the first floor to the top floor. The north-west corner tower contains small chambers, and the south-east probably had a similar layout before it was rebuilt.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, {{the period}} of {{economic}} prosperity for Venezuela was relatively short-lived.
