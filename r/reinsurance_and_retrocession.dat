40|$|In recent years, {{the global}} {{reinsurance}} market has undergone rapid evolution. A series of {{mergers and acquisitions}} has led to dramatic consolidation, while the development of insurance-based securities has begun offering new ways to enhance and/or compete with traditional reinsurance products. In this article, we employ the insurance market game framework of Powers, Shubik, and Yao (1994, 1998) and Powers and Shubik (1999) to study the design of an optimal reinsurance/retrocession market. Using price in the primary insurance market as our primary objective function, we analyze market configuration {{in terms of both}} the need for additional levels of reinsurance/retrocession, and the optimal number of firms at a given level. 1. Overview In recent years, the global reinsurance market has undergone rapid evolution. A series of mergers and acquisitions has led to dramatic consolidation, while the development of insurance-based securities has begun offering new ways to enhance and/or compete with traditional reinsurance products. These changes naturally give rise to questions such as: • Is a reinsurance market really necessary? • What is the optimal number of reinsurers? • What is the role of retrocession (i. e., the insuring of reinsurers) ? • Is there a theoretical upper bound on the optimal number of retrocession levels? As a practical matter, it is difficult to assess the effects of the number and size of primary insurers on the price and availability of insurance in a given market. This is because empirical studies of scale economies can evaluate only the relative efficiencies of firms of different sizes under a fixed market configuration, and theoretical studies of market equilibrium are often restricted by traditional assumptions of competitive equilibrium with infinite numbers of buyers and sellers. The problem for <b>reinsurance</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrocession</b> markets is magnified by even greater limitations on industry data, and the general lack of a formal modeling structure. 1. 1.

This paper presents the findings from a survey of reinsurers' views on this issue. Reinsurers give EMSs a cursory consideration in their pollution risk assessments because they inadequately appraise pollution liability, have no explicit requirements regarding risk management and there is little evidence to show that they are effective at reducing environmental risks. Reinsurers' underwriting assessments and post-loss investigations are poorly developed concerning public liability insurance. <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>and</b> EMSs are currently weak methods to prevent and control pollution risks. ...|$|R
