40|$|A {{model for}} {{describing}} <b>radar</b> sea <b>clutter</b> is proposed. It {{consists of two}} parts, an oceanographic and an electromagnetic one.

50|$|The radar {{provides}} 300 degree {{coverage and}} has an instrumental range of 450 km and detection range of 350 km in a dense hostile electronic warfare environmentâ€”in heavy <b>radar</b> <b>clutter</b> and at low target altitudes. In addition to this, the radar is also capable of identifying friends or foes, and has a sea surveillance mode.|$|E
50|$|The {{launch of}} Explorer 1 by the United States in 1958 {{suggested}} another application: space-based radar systems for detecting and tracking aircraft, ships, armored vehicles, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. These systems required {{the development of}} special techniques for canceling the <b>radar</b> <b>clutter</b> seen from space, nulling ground-based jammers, and compensating for Doppler shifts experienced by fast-moving satellites.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{reflections}} {{appear in}} almost all radar. Ground clutter generally appears in a circular region within a radius of about 25 miles near ground-based radar. This distance extends much further in airborne and space <b>radar.</b> <b>Clutter</b> results from radio energy being reflected from the earth's surface, buildings, and vegetation. Clutter includes weather in radar intended to detect and report aircraft and spacecraft.|$|E

5000|$|Recent {{interest}} has accumulated in developing radars which operate in these low frequencies to help counter the advancement in stealth technology by applying advanced {{digital signal processing}} to these bands {{in order to reduce}} <b>radar</b> <b>clutter.</b> If the radar wavelength is roughly twice the size of the target, a half-wave resonance effect can still generate a significant return. However, low-frequency radar is limited by shortage of unused frequencies, lack of accuracy given the long wavelength, and by the radar's size, making it difficult to transport and making for an easy target. A long-wave radar may detect a target and roughly locate it, but not identify it, and the location information lacks sufficient weapon targeting accuracy ...|$|E
50|$|By flying {{low to the}} sea, {{missiles}} {{decrease the}} range at which the target ships can detect them by a significant amount. Flying at a lower altitude increases {{the amount of time}} the missile is under the horizon {{from the perspective of the}} target ship, making it harder to detect due to <b>radar</b> <b>clutter</b> from the sea and similar effects. The real-life success of sea skimming depends on its exact implementation, the sophistication of the detection equipment, as well as the infrared and radar signature of the missile. Sea skimming can significantly reduce the available response time that a ship's missile defenses have to work within, making these missiles significantly harder to defend against. Sea skimming can also increase the range of a missile, by relying on ground effects.|$|E
50|$|In total {{at least}} {{eighteen}} missiles were launched by Type 42 destroyers, six by Invincible, and two by Bristol. Out of five missiles fired against helicopters or high flying aircraft, four were successful, {{but only two}} of nineteen fired at low level aircraft hit: just eleven percent; however a number of missiles were fired without guidance to deter low level attacks. Exeters success can be partially attributed to being equipped with the Type 1022 radar, which was {{designed for the system}} and provided greater capability than the old Type 965 fitted to the earlier Type 42s. The Type 965 was unable to cope with low level targets as it suffered multiple path crossings and targets became lost in <b>radar</b> <b>clutter</b> {{from the surface of the}} South Atlantic. This resulted in Sea Dart being unable to lock onto targets at distance obscured by land, or fast-moving low-level targets obscured in ground clutter or sea-returns.|$|E

50|$|If the Clutter Return Power {{is greater}} than the System Noise Power then the <b>Radar</b> is <b>clutter</b> limited and the Signal to Clutter Ratio must be equal to or greater than the Minimum Signal to Noise Ratio for the target to be detectable.|$|R
5000|$|For {{ground-based}} <b>radar,</b> <b>cluttered</b> returns {{tend to be}} at DC, {{making them}} easily discriminated by Moving Target Indication (MTI). Thus, a notch filter at the zero-Doppler bin can be used. Airborne platforms with ownship motion experience relative ground clutter motion dependent on the angle, resulting in angle-Doppler coupling at the input. In this case, 1D filtering is not sufficient, since clutter can overlap the desired target's Doppler from multiple directions. The resulting interference is typically called a [...] "clutter ridge," [...] since it forms {{a line in the}} angle-Doppler domain. Narrowband jamming signals are also a source of interference, and exhibit significant spatial correlation. Thus receiver noise and interference must be considered, and detection processors must attempt to maximize the signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR).|$|R
40|$|A new {{training}} algorithm of {{a single}} neuron of KNN is formulated to get optimal improvement factor and applied to the adaptive suppression of <b>radar</b> <b>clutter.</b> On the basis of this, a method is proposed based on the network for adaptive clutter rejection and target detection.

Kohonen neural network is a kind of selforganized network, and there have already been many interesting results and theory [1] in it. <b>Radar</b> <b>clutter</b> rejection is an important problem in radar signal processing.

40|$|Using the RFC {{technique}} to estimate refractivity parameters {{is a complex}} nonlinear optimization problem. In this paper, an improved cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is proposed {{to deal with this}} problem. To enhance the performance of the CS algorithm, a parameter dynamic adaptive operation and crossover operation were integrated into the standard CS (DACS-CO). Rechenbergâ€™s 1 / 5 criteria combined with learning factor were used to control the parameter dynamic adaptive adjusting process. The crossover operation of genetic algorithm was utilized to guarantee the population diversity. The new hybrid algorithm has better local search ability and contributes to superior performance. To verify the ability of the DACS-CO algorithm to estimate atmospheric refractivity parameters, the simulation data and real <b>radar</b> <b>clutter</b> data are both implemented. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the DACS-CO algorithm can provide an effective method for near-real-time estimation of the atmospheric refractivity profile from <b>radar</b> <b>clutter...</b>|$|E
