25|$|MUTYH encodes DNA <b>repair</b> <b>enzyme</b> MYH glycosylase. During normal {{cellular}} activities, guanine sometimes becomes {{altered by}} oxygen, which causes it to pair with adenine instead of cytosine. MYH glycosylase fixes these mistakes by base excision repair, such that mutations do not accumulate in the DNA {{and lead to}} tumor formation. When MYH glycosylase does not function correctly, DNA errors may accrue to initiate tumorigenesis with a clinical presentation {{similar to that in}} patients with APC mutations.|$|E
25|$|In 29â€“66% of glioblastomas, DNA repair is {{deficient}} due to epigenetic methylation of the MGMT gene, {{which reduces}} protein expression of MGMT. However, for 28% of glioblastomas, the MGMT protein is deficient, but the MGMT promoter is not methylated. In glioblastomas without methylated MGMT promoters, {{the level of}} microRNA miR-181d is inversely correlated with protein expression of MGMT and the direct target of miR-181d is the MGMT mRNA 3'UTR (the three prime untranslated region of MGMT mRNA). Thus, in 28% of glioblastomas, increased expression of miR-181d and reduced expression of DNA <b>repair</b> <b>enzyme</b> MGMT may be a causal factor.|$|E
500|$|Among mammals, species maximum {{lifespan}} varies significantly (for {{example the}} shrew has a lifespan of two years, whereas the oldest bowhead whale is recorded to be 211 years). [...] Although the underlying basis for these lifespan differences is still uncertain, numerous {{studies indicate that}} the ability to repair DNA damages is an important determinant of mammalian lifespan. [...] In a 1974 study by Hart and Setlow, it was found that DNA excision repair capability increased systematically with species lifespan among seven mammalian species. Species lifespan was observed to be robustly correlated with the capacity to recognize DNA double-strand breaks as well as the level of the DNA repair protein Ku80. [...] In a study of the cells from sixteen mammalian species, genes employed in DNA repair were found to be up-regulated in the longer-lived species. [...] The cellular level of the DNA <b>repair</b> <b>enzyme</b> poly ADP ribose polymerase was found to correlate with species lifespan in a study of 13 mammalian species. [...] Three additional studies of a variety of mammalian species also reported a correlation between species lifespan and DNA repair capability.|$|E

Recent experiments and molecular data suggest that individual <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes</b> do not work independently of each other, but {{interact with each other}} through charges exchanged along the DNA. A damaged site in the DNA hinders this exchange. The hypothesis is that the charge exchange quickly liberates the <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes</b> from error-free stretches of DNA. In this way, the sites of damage are located more quickly; but how much more quickly is not known, nor is it known whether the charge exchange mechanism has other observable consequences. Results Here the size of the speed-up gained from this charge exchange mechanism is calculated and the characteristic length and time scales are identified. In particular, for Escherichia coli, I estimate the speed-up is 50000 / N, where N is the number of <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes</b> participating in the charge exchange mechanism.

500|$|Chromatin {{relaxation}} occurs rapidly at {{the site}} of a DNA damage. [...] In one of the earliest steps, the stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylates SIRT6 on serine 10 in response to double-strand breaks or other DNA damage. [...] This post-translational modification facilitates the mobilization of SIRT6 to DNA damage sites, and is required for efficient recruitment of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to DNA break sites and for efficient repair of DSBs. [...] PARP1 protein starts to appear at DNA damage sites in less than a second, with half maximum accumulation within 1.6 seconds after the damage occurs. [...] Next the chromatin remodeler Alc1 quickly attaches to the product of PARP1 action, a poly-ADP ribose chain, and Alc1 completes arrival at the DNA damage within 10 seconds of the occurrence of the damage. [...] About half of the maximum chromatin relaxation, presumably due to action of Alc1, occurs by 10 seconds. This then allows recruitment of the DNA <b>repair</b> <b>enzyme</b> MRE11, to initiate DNA repair, within 13 seconds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{examined}} the phylogenetic pattern among eukaryotes of homologues of the E. coli 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxoguanine (8 -oxo-G) <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes</b> MutY, MutM, and MutT. Results These DNA <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes</b> are present in all large phylogenetic groups, with MutM homologues being the most universally conserved. All chordates and echinoderms were found to possess all three 8 -oxo-G repair components. Likewise, the red and green algae examined have all three <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes,</b> while all land-living plants have MutY and MutM homologues, but lack MutT. However, for some phyla, e. g. protostomes, a more patchy distribution was found. Nematodes provide a striking example, where Caenorhabditis is the only identified example of an organism group having {{none of the three}} <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes,</b> while the genome of another nematode, Trichinella spiralis, instead encodes all three. The most complex distribution exists in fungi, where many different patterns of retention or loss of the three repair components are found. In addition, we found sequence insertions near or within the catalytic sites of MutY, MutM, and MutT to be present in some subgroups of Ascomycetes. Conclusion The 8 -oxo-G <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes</b> are ancient in origin, and loss of individual 8 -oxo-G repair components at several distinct points in evolution appears to be the most likely explanation for the phylogenetic pattern among eukaryotes. </p...|$|R

40|$|DNA <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes</b> are {{essential}} for maintaining {{the integrity of the}} DNA sequence. Unfortunately, very little is known about how these enzymes recognize damaged regions along the helix. Structural analysis of cellular <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes</b> bound to DNA reveals that these enzymes are able to recognize DNA in a variety of conformations. However, the prevalence of these deformations in the absence of enzymes remains unclear, as small populations of DNA conformations are often difficult to detect by NMR and X-ray crystallography. Here, we used time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to examine the conformational dynamics of linear, nicked, gapped, and bulged DNA in the absence of protein enzymes. This analysis reveals that damaged DNA is polymorphic in nature and able to adopt multiple individual conformations. We show that DNA repair intermediates that contain a one-nucleotide gap and bulge have a significant propensity to adopt conformations in which the orphan base resides outside the DNA helix, while DNA structures damaged by a nick or two-nucleotide gap favor intrahelical conformations. Because changes in DNA conformation appear to guide the recognition of DNA <b>repair</b> <b>enzymes,</b> we suggest that the current approach could be used to study the mechanism of DNA repair.
