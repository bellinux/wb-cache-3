Four game modes are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' <b>Racing,</b> Stock Car <b>Racing</b> and Time Trial. In Destruction Derby, the player earns points by destroying other cars in a large, trackless arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car <b>Racing,</b> the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' <b>Racing</b> is a hybrid of the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and by destroying other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode.|$|E
