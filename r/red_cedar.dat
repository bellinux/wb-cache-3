5|$|MSU has {{a variety}} of campus media outlets. The student-run {{newspaper}} is The State News and free copies are available online or at East Lansing newsstands. The paper prints 28,500 copies from Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and 15,000 copies Monday through Friday during the summer. The paper is not published on weekends, holidays, or semester breaks, but is continually updated online at statenews.com. The campus yearbook is called the <b>Red</b> <b>Cedar</b> Log. <b>Red</b> <b>Cedar</b> Review, Michigan State University's premier literary digest for over forty years, is the longest running undergraduate-run literary journal in the United States. It is published annually by the Michigan State University Press.|$|E
5|$|Marshlands, cypress {{forests and}} {{mixtures}} of shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, blue palmetto, and deciduous forests dominate the state's southeastern quarter, while mixtures of largely post oak, elm, <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> (Juniperus virginiana) and pine forests cover northeastern Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|As {{it existed}} at the time, M-144 started at the {{headquarters}} for the Michigan State Police next to the campus of Michigan State College, now Michigan State University. The highway ran north along Harrison Road next to campus and across the <b>Red</b> <b>Cedar</b> River. North of the river, the trunkline terminated at the junction with Michigan Avenue (then M-39, now the unsigned M-143).|$|E

5|$|Continuing eastward, I-496 passes {{north of}} the {{assembly}} plant complex {{and south of the}} central business district. East of a partial interchange with Walnut Street, the freeway passes the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, which is located on I-496's southern service drive. The south side of the freeway is adjacent to Cooley Gardens near the confluence of the Grand and <b>Red</b> <b>Cedar</b> rivers. I-496 crosses the Grand River downstream from the confluence and meets the eastern terminus of the Capitol Loop. This interchange with Cedar and Larch streets is also a connection to Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96) and Pennsylvania Avenue. St. Joseph Street ends after the connection to Pennsylvania Avenue. The main freeway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation. I-496 runs parallel to {{the north side of the}} rail line while Malcolm X Street follows to the south as far as the Clemens Avenue overpass. The freeway then crosses into East Lansing near the <b>Red</b> <b>Cedar</b> Natural Area.|$|E
5|$|Flora {{along the}} {{northern}} end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> (Juniperus virginiana), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).|$|E
5|$|I-96 crosses into Ingham County and {{continues}} {{along the southern}} edges of the Lansing metro area. It passes through areas with residential subdivisions and commercial developments, coming {{to a pair of}} interchanges including one for the eastern end of BL I-96 (Cedar Street). Near the crossing of the <b>Red</b> <b>Cedar</b> River, I-96 goes through the interchange for I-496/US127. East of that interchange, the freeway begins to exit the metro area as the landscape transitions back to farm fields. I-96 continues eastward, bypassing Williamston and Webberville to the south. Near the latter, the freeway turns more southeasterly and crosses into Livingston County.|$|E
50|$|Forests of large, {{coniferous}} trees (Western <b>red</b> <b>cedars,</b> Douglas-firs, Western hemlocks, firs, pines, spruces, and others) dominate {{most of the}} Cascade Range. Cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers (largely a result of oceanic influence) favor evergreen species, whereas mild temperatures and rich soils promote fast and prolonged growth.|$|R
50|$|Heathland {{is found}} at Wrights Lookout {{and in other}} patches. Previous {{estimates}} of the number of different plant species in the park place the figure at 500.

5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have {{a high rate of}} biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and Southern live oak.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as western <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, bittersweet, and wild grape, which is the pattern for Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 496 (I-496) is an {{auxiliary}} Interstate Highway that passes through downtown Lansing in the US state of Michigan. Also {{a component of}} the State Trunkline Highway System, the freeway connects I-96 to the downtown area. It has been named the R.E. Olds Freeway (sometimes just Olds Freeway) for Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east–west from I-96/I-69 near the downtown area and north–south along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway127 (US127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and <b>Red</b> <b>Cedar</b> rivers.|$|E

5|$|Near Cooley Law School Stadium at the {{intersection}} with Michigan Avenue, BL I-96 meets the Capitol Loop, Lansing's third business loop. The two highways run concurrently south of Michigan Avenue as Cedar Street angles southeasterly. The two directions of BL I-96 merge at an interchange with I-496 that also {{marks the end of}} the Capitol Loop. South of this interchange, Cedar Street continues as a five-lane street through a commercial corridor {{on the south side of}} Lansing. The business loop crosses the <b>Red</b> <b>Cedar</b> River three blocks south of the I-496 interchange. On either side of the business loop, the adjacent neighborhoods are residential in character. South of an intersection with Jolly Road, Cedar Street starts angling southeasterly. BL I-96 ends at an indirect interchange with I-96 near the Edgewood Town Center.|$|E
5|$|On {{the southeastern}} {{side of the}} capital city, US127 meets I-96. From this {{interchange}} northward, the freeway is also designated as part of I-496 (Ransom E. Olds Freeway). The I-496/US127 freeway runs northward through suburban Delhi Township and into the city of Lansing. Right near the <b>Red</b> <b>Cedar</b> River, {{just west of the}} Michigan State University campus, I-496 and US127 separate as US127 continues north and I-496 turns west. This side of the city is mostly residential neighborhoods as US127 runs along the East Lansing border, but there is a commercial area surrounding the Lake Lansing Road interchange before the highway crosses into Clinton County. US127 meets I-69 northeast of Lansing, at the 1998–2002 terminus of the highway. From here north, US127 follows the former US27 north to Grayling.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
5000|$|The presettlement {{vegetation}} {{would have}} been tallgrass prairie, broken by a swath of Big Woods flanking Minneopa Creek with oak savanna at the east end, and bottomland hardwood forest along the Minnesota River floodplain. Today these plant communities are largely intact, {{as much of the}} future park was unsuitable for agriculture, being too rocky, steep, or wet. The prairie is the most deteriorated as much of it was intensively used as livestock pasture. Its 355 acre are dominated by junegrass with a mix of other grasses and forbs and small eastern <b>red</b> <b>cedars.</b> Larger <b>red</b> <b>cedars</b> ring the prairie. Southeast of the prairie are 204 acre of old fields exhibiting ecological succession. Currently they feature bluegrass, bromegrass, Russian thistle, alfalfa, and seedlings of eastern cottonwood and willow. Controlled burning is being used {{to improve the quality of}} the prairie.

50|$|Along the Pacific coast Western <b>red</b> <b>cedars</b> (Thuja plicata) can {{be found}} from Northern California to Southern Alaska. The age range of these trees are between 800-1,000 years old, with the oldest living up to 2,000 years in California. The wood from these trees is used {{extensively}} in the forestry industry, much like the Douglas fir. However, {{there needs to be}} an increase in regulation of the management of these trees, as they are currently being used faster than they can grow.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Aureoboletus mirabilis grow solitarily, scattered, or {{sometimes}} {{in small groups}} {{on the ground or}} on well-decayed conifer logs, especially of western and mountain hemlock, but occasionally also Douglas-fir and western <b>red</b> <b>cedar.</b> The fungus is strongly suspected to form mycorrhizal associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing B.mirabilis mycorrhizae in laboratory culture have failed. Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown cubical rot—a trait suggestive of cellulose-decomposing saprobic fungi—the rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant conifer roots. It has been suggested that B.mirabilis has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other mycorrhizal fungi, and further, that the inability to culture mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown cubical rot are required for fungal growth.|$|E
25|$|In North America, {{species of}} the genus Thuja, such as western <b>red</b> <b>cedar,</b> are commonly— though mistakenly— {{confused}} with genuine cedar, as is J. virginiana, typically known as <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> or eastern <b>red</b> <b>cedar.</b> While some naturalized species of cedar (Cedrus, the true cedars) {{can be found in}} the Americas, no species is native.|$|E
