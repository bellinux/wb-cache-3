5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that {{it is one of the}} very few episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E
25|$|Scenes shot {{afterwards}} included various live-action {{shots of}} Riders for the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and a <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> of Serkis as Gollum finally realises Frodo intends {{to destroy the}} Ring, shot in Jackson's house. For the Extended DVD, in March 2004 Jackson created a few shots of skulls rolling over for the avalanche scene; this was the final piece of footage ever shot for the trilogy, and Jackson noted {{that it must be}} the first time a director had shot scenes for a film after it had already won the Oscar.|$|E
25|$|Edoras exteriors {{were shot}} in October. The Ride of the Rohirrim, where Théoden leads the charge into the Orc army, was filmed in Twizel with 150 extras on horseback. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields has more {{extensive}} use of computer-generated imagery, {{in contrast to the}} more {{extensive use of}} live action in the Battle of Helm's Deep in the second film. Also filmed were the attempts by Faramir to recapture Osgiliath, as were scenes in the city itself. At this point production was very hectic, with Jackson moving around ten units per day, and production finally wrapped on the Minas Tirith sets, as well as second units shooting parts of the siege. Just as the Hobbit actors' first scene was hiding from a Ringwraith under a tree, their last scene was the bluescreened <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> of the inhabitants of Minas Tirith bowing to them.|$|E
25|$|Added <b>reaction</b> <b>shots</b> in the classroom, and {{extensions}} {{to existing}} shots.|$|R
50|$|Director Jacques Tourneur {{claimed that}} {{producer}} Small thought {{the film was}} not long enough so he inserted <b>reaction</b> <b>shots</b> of close-ups of various actors all throughout the film.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reaction</b> <b>shots</b> can be {{especially}} critical in comedy, as the reaction of an actor or actors to a dramatic incident provides a psychological cue to the audience about {{how to respond to}} that incident themselves.|$|R
500|$|Majel Barrett reprises {{her role}} as Christine Chapel, the {{director}} of Starfleet Command's medical services. Many of her scenes—some reportedly very large—were omitted in the final cut, angering the actress. Her final role in the film consists of one line of dialogue and a <b>reaction</b> <b>shot.</b> Mark Lenard and Jane Wyatt play Ambassador Sarek and Amanda Grayson, respectively, Spock's parents, with Wyatt reprising the role she had previously played in the 1967 episode [...] "Journey to Babel". Wyatt commented that although she generally disliked working with actors who were directing, she found Nimoy an exception because he could concentrate on {{being part of the}} cast as well as setting up the crew. Robin Curtis reprises the role of Saavik, a Starfleet lieutenant. Saavik's role is minimal in the film—originally, she was intended to remain behind on Vulcan because she was pregnant after she had mated with the younger Spock in [...] In the final cut of the film, all references to her condition were dropped.|$|E
500|$|After test-sculpting in Plasticine, {{the puppet}} heads were moulded on a {{silicone}} rubber base and made using fibreglass. At heights ranging from 20 to 24inches (approximately one-third life-size) the next-generation puppets were no shorter than their predecessors. For previous series, puppet eyes had been sized {{out of proportion}} to the heads, but as part of the realistic look introduced in Captain Scarlet, the eyes of production personnel were photographed and the images scaled down for attachment to the eye sockets. As had been the case for earlier series, a number of alternative heads displaying a range of expressions were created for main character puppets, including [...] "smilers", [...] "frowners" [...] and [...] "blinkers". Since episodes of Captain Scarlet were filmed in pairs, one on each of the puppet stages available at the Century 21 Studios, duplicates were made of the [...] "expressionless" [...] template of each main character. For the pilot episode, an [...] "agony" [...] head was specially sculpted for the Captain Scarlet puppet for a brief <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> of Scarlet's Mysteron double being shot by Captain Blue.|$|E
500|$|The script posed several {{technical}} {{challenges to}} both the puppet and special effects departments of Century 21 Productions. The [...] "blurring" [...] of the structures making up the Mysteron city was accomplished by mounting a sheet of glass between the camera and the effects set, with Vaseline placed on the glass at the necessary points to create lens flare. Complex scale model shots of Captain Blue's SPV navigating the spiral structure of the Car-Vu were simplified by turning the road surface instead of the vehicle, thus eliminating the requirement to manipulate the wires (or move the camera). Since the spinning blades reduced the practicality of overhead wire control, the scenes of Spectrum Helicopter A42's dogfight with the jetpack-wearing Blue were filmed upside-down (with wires supporting {{the base of the}} helicopter model) and flipped during post-production. A sequence of the World President and Captain Brown standing on a moving walkway while undergoing security checks at the Maximum Security Building was particularly difficult to film, since it was essential that the puppet operators, working from a gantry overhead, keep pace with the speed of the conveyor belt powering the set below. The Captain Scarlet [...] "grimacing" [...] head, used for the <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> immediately after the reconstruction is hit by Blue's bullet, was sculpted especially by the puppet workshop for its one-off appearance in this episode. In his DVD audio commentary for the episode, Gerry Anderson remembered how, on a technical level, [...] "everything had to be perfect" [...] for the filming of the first episode of the new series.|$|E
50|$|Shooting {{began in}} Ticino (Switzerland) in February 2016 {{and ended in}} Rijeka (Croatia) in March. Mazza's {{direction}} purposely mixes different styles, from the most orthodox French oriented long sequence <b>shot</b> and <b>reaction</b> <b>shots</b> to the most sporty quick movement in order to appeal both fiction and sport audiences.|$|R
50|$|After McConnell's death, {{the show}} was hosted by the rough-voiced, gentle giant Andy Devine, who had earlier {{appeared}} as Jingles on The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok with Guy Madison. Studio <b>reaction</b> <b>shots</b> were again intercut, and Devine did his segments without a live audience. This also allowed some limited special effects, such as when Froggy appeared or disappeared.|$|R
500|$|The scenes {{featuring}} boar {{were originally}} {{planned to use}} actual, domesticated animals. Since bringing domesticated boar from continental United States was expensive, and the animals available in Hawaii {{did not look like}} wild boar and rarely moved (the script required them to run in most scenes), the producers decided to use computer-generated boar instead, along with <b>reaction</b> <b>shots</b> from the actors and first-person sequences from the animals' point of view.|$|R
500|$|American Beauty was {{edited by}} Christopher Greenbury and Tariq Anwar; Greenbury {{began in the}} position, but had to leave halfway through {{post-production}} because of a scheduling conflict with Me, Myself and Irene(2000) (in which Chris Cooper also starred). Mendes and an assistant edited the film for 10 days between the appointments. Mendes realized during editing that the film {{was different from the}} one he had envisioned. He believed he had been making a [...] "much more whimsical, kaleidoscopic" [...] film than what came together in the edit suite. Instead, Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines. In total, he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit. The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town. Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against bluescreen, but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical—"like a Coen brothers movie"—and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set. The opening in the final cut reused a scene {{from the middle of the}} film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father. This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester's death, as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane's request was not serious. However, in the portion he used in the opening—and when the full scene plays out later—Mendes used the score and a <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt. The subsequent shot—an aerial view of the neighborhood—was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence.|$|E
2500|$|The iconic {{explosion}} overlay most {{associated with}} the TV show was introduced after the third episode to mask the cut point between the Diana and Wonder Woman clips, meaning they no longer needed to be perfectly aligned. This allowed them to be shot without a locked off camera at more convenient points in the production schedule, when Carter {{was already in the}} appropriate costume. [...] The slow motion aspect of the sequence was dropped, and Wonder Woman was no longer left holding her Diana Prince clothes. [...] A thunderclap sound effect accompanied the explosion effect; both the explosion flash and its sound are apparently non-diegetic (only heard by the audience, not within the narrative world), as demonstrated by Diana changing unnoticed in a dormitory of sleeping women, in adjoining office spaces, etc. [...] Generally the audience never sees Wonder Woman change back to Diana Prince, although there is one occasion when it is almost shown: Wonder Woman reveals her secret identity to her little sister Drusilla by slowly turning on the spot, but the actual moment of transformation is masked by a cut-away <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> of Drusilla (no thunderclap was heard) ...|$|E
50|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} Hard West's gameplay is the <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> which replaces the overwatch mechanic of XCOM. Approaching an enemy up to point-blank range makes him automatically {{fire at the}} approaching player character if he could already see the player character before executing the move. Player characters are not protected from enemies by a <b>reaction</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E
50|$|Curly {{was to be}} {{featured}} prominently in the pie-fight scene, but after Moe found him with his head slumped on his shoulder, it was apparent the comedian was in no shape to perform. Moe quietly alerted director Jules White of Curly's unfortunate situation, leading White to quickly rework the scene to be divided between Moe and Larry. <b>Reaction</b> <b>shots</b> from the supporting cast were spliced in more frequently to hide Curly's absence.|$|R
5000|$|An early MGM color movie short, Starlit Days at the Lido (1935), {{was filmed}} at the Lido Spa in the Ambassador, of a lunchtime tea dance {{featuring}} the Henry Busse band and vocalists, novelty acts with Arthur Lake), Cliff Edwards and Ben Turpin, chorus girls and <b>reaction</b> <b>shots</b> of [...] "guests," [...] including Francis Lederer, Buster Crabbe, John Boles, Clark Gable, Robert Montgomery, Richard Barthelmess, Constance Bennett, Lili Damita and MC Reginald Denny.|$|R
5000|$|Katherine Miller from The A.V. Club gave a B- rate to {{the episode}} {{saying that the}} episode started with such a promise and it ended well enough. [...] "So here, in this fall finale, looking at a show that's far, far {{better than it was}} in the pilot, a word of advice: Secret Circle, stick to your horror, your awkward <b>reaction</b> <b>shots,</b> and your {{ensemble}} scenes. You are so much better there." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{assumption}} {{behind the}} logic of the <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> is that the emotional reaction of the actor being depicted will either advance the story, reveal character traits of the character in the <b>reaction</b> <b>shot,</b> or emphasize character traits of another character that were displayed in the action or dialog present in the preceding shot. A completely unemotional reaction may also be important if it provides information to the audience or is unexpected {{in the context of the}} scene.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> usually {{implies the}} display {{of some sort of}} emotion {{on the face of the}} actor being shown, and is thus most {{commonly}} a close-up shot (although a group of actors may be shown reacting together). A <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> is also generally bereft of dialogue, though this is not an absolute rule. Its main purpose is to show an emotional response to the immediately preceding action or words of another character in the scene, or to an event in the immediately preceding scene which may or may not involve another actor (e.g., an explosion, monster, empty room, etc.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor {{gave the}} film a C- grade saying [...] "the comedy {{routines}} are so-so (though the falling-in-the-aisles <b>reaction</b> <b>shots</b> tell another story) and the comics’ patchwork odyssey often derails into irrelevancies". Writing for The New York Times, Miriam Bale gave the film {{two and a}} half stars out of five, and said that [...] "this well-intentioned 'docu-comedy' (as the filmmakers label it in publicity notes) is not very funny." ...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{environmental}} elements {{have different}} <b>reactions</b> when <b>shot,</b> such as exploding with unexpected results or randomly spewing out items or enemies.|$|R
500|$|Critic Judith Thurman said in The New Yorker that, [...] "Riefenstahl's genius {{has rarely}} been questioned, even by critics who despise the service to which she lent it. Riefenstahl was a consummate stylist obsessed with bodies in motion, {{particularly}} those of dancers and athletes. Riefenstahl relies heavily for her transitions on portentous cutaways to clouds, mist, statuary, foliage, and rooftops. Her <b>reaction</b> <b>shots</b> have a tedious sameness: shining, ecstatic faces—nearly all young and Aryan, except for Hitler's".|$|R
5000|$|In {{the shorter}} 30-second ad, Mr. Owl returns the spent candy stick, and the boy's final line is {{replaced}} with a <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> and a beat of silence. The 30-second commercial dialogue is as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|In some cases, the {{deliberate}} avoidance of showing a <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> {{can be used}} by a filmmaker to dramatic effect; for instance, if the filmmaker wishes to conceal a character's motivations by hiding their reaction to a particular event.|$|E
50|$|In {{motion picture}} film production, {{cinematography}} and video production, a <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> is a shot which cuts {{away from the}} main scene {{in order to show}} the reaction of a character to it, a basic unit of film grammar.|$|E
50|$|Syndicate Sadists was {{released}} in the United States by Sam Sherman's Independent International. It {{was released}} in the United States titles Rambo's Revenge and on home video as Final Payment. It has been released as One Just Man in the United Kingdom. The unrated American DVD {{of the film is}} missing two minutes of footage: a scene where the mother of the kidnapped boy comes home and Paterno's henchmen searching for Rambo in a pub, and two <b>reaction</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Paul Lieberstein and Michael Schur, and was {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. It was cut down from an hour and twelve minutes to forty-two minutes, making it the season's second hour-long episode after [...] "A Benihana Christmas". Kwapis carefully <b>shot</b> Jim's <b>reaction</b> <b>shots,</b> as {{he did not want}} to reveal Jim's choice of Karen or Pam to the audience. The cast were unaware how the season would end, as multiple endings were shot by the crew. Filming wrapped up in April 2007.|$|R
40|$|This {{study will}} {{highlight}} how rhetorical devices and stylistic techniques are employed {{both in the}} novel Pride and Prejudice and in its film adaptations to transform and mitigate the destabilizing power of passion. The use of tropes, such as synecdoche and metonymy, and of the stylistic technique of focalization, finds its effective counterpart in the filmic grammar that includes close-ups, insert shots, subjective shots, eyeline matches and <b>reaction</b> <b>shots.</b> The direct correspondence between the literary devices chosen by Jane Austen and the visual equivalents employed by the cinema will be elaborated...|$|R
5000|$|The Clock reveals its plot {{largely through}} the use of cutaway shots. A shot {{indicating}} the time is followed by a <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> with a character's emotional response, often one of anxiety, fear, or boredom. Petit remarked that the impact of repeated reactions lacking context [...] "comes over as incredibly weird". The sequence interpellates viewers into The Clocks flow, and they often experience a detached, hypnotic effect.|$|E
50|$|Daniels {{also makes}} cameo {{appearances}} as a humanoid in two {{scenes of the}} feature films. His character, Lieutenant Dannl Faytonni, is named {{as a tribute to}} his own name, albeit in modified form. The character appears in the Outlander nightclub scene early in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones as a man in blue uniform who can be seen in a cutaway <b>reaction</b> <b>shot</b> after Obi-Wan disarms the bounty hunter Zam Wesell. Faytonni can also be seen at the Galaxies Opera House in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the term}} recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary dates from 1982. It was explained more fully by John Fiske in 1987: [...] "the camera is then turned onto the interviewer who asks some of the questions again and gives a series of [...] "noddies," [...] that is, <b>reaction</b> <b>shots,</b> nods, smiles, or expressions of sympathetic listening. These are then used to disguise later edits in the interviewee's speech... Without the [...] "noddy", the visuals would show an obvious [...] "jump" [...] that would reveal the edit." ...|$|R
50|$|Drake cannot find Anian, and so {{returns home}} the long way, by going {{completely}} around the globe. After hearing Drake's story, Elizabeth, clearly {{interested in the}} riches which Drake has won, grants him her full protection from Doughty's friends and from the Spanish king, who has demanded his execution. She cynically informs {{him that if he}} had not succeeded, he would be as good as dead for the execution of Doughty. The film ends with Drake's knighthood, a triumph that seems oddly hollow due to the strained <b>reaction</b> <b>shots</b> of some of the surviving characters including Drake's nephew and the preacher, Francis Fletcher.|$|R
50|$|In London he {{established}} {{a relationship with the}} National Jazz Federation, run by Harold Pendleton, who also managed Britain's top jazz star of the time Chris Barber. Despite Giorgio's inclination to shoot the avant-garde Johnny Dankworth, Pendleton prevailed on him to shoot Chris Barber. The resulting piece, comprising four songs, intercut establishing and audience <b>reaction</b> <b>shots</b> from the Royal Festival Hall with separate studio session footage. The studio footage, shot in one day, used cutting-edge technology like large Mitchell cameras with 'elephant' suspended mics that restricted camera movements in the small studio, preventing Giorgio from getting all the angles he had hoped for.|$|R
