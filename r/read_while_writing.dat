2500|$|I Luv Halloween {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. The art style drew criticism, and two critics compared the character designs {{to those of}} the Garbage Pail Kids. Conversely, KJB of IGN wrote that Roman's art style complimented Giffen's writing nicely. PopCultureShock's former senior manga editor Katherine Dacey thought that the colored illustrations in the re-release improved the art style. Another point of criticism was the use of dark comedy. Leroy Douresseaux of Coolstreak Cartoon compared the characters and tone of the series to [...] "a lame version of the TV show “Jackass”". Dacey wrote that the inclusion of fan service and [...] "truly tasteless jokes" [...] prevented I Luv Halloween from becoming an enjoyable <b>read.</b> <b>While</b> <b>writing</b> that the series [...] "isn't the best original manga to hit the shelves", KJB [...] commented on the [...] "wickedly perverse sense of humor at play here" [...] that at times became [...] "a little too broad", and enjoyed that the first volume did not end on a cliffhanger. Another reviewer for IGN, A.E. Sparrow put the series on his list of the ten best horror/thriller manga. The Young Adult Library Services Association, a division of the American Library Association, placed the first two volumes on its 2007 list of [...] "Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers".|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{asynchronous}} processes <b>reading</b> shared data <b>while</b> {{the data are}} being modified by another process is considered. This problem differs from the standard readers/writers problem in that concurrent <b>reading</b> <b>while</b> <b>writing</b> is allowed. The model used here strongly limits the use {{and size of the}} shared variables. If multiple copies of the shared data are allowed, then simple, efficient solutions are found. In general, solutions which are more time efficient because they avoid waiting are seen to require more copies of the shared data. The number of copies used by all algorithms is shown to be the best possible. The main solution demonstrates that any system of processes which uses large distributed variables can be strongly simulated by a system which uses only binary distributed variables...|$|R

5000|$|The {{inspiration}} for the title and lyrics about a seductive enchantress came {{from a number of}} women, although Henley had one particular woman in mind - Zelda Fitzgerald whose biography he was <b>reading</b> <b>while</b> <b>writing</b> the song. [...] According to Henley, he was suffering from flu with a very high fever and become semi-delirious, and every time the fever subsided, he would continue to read a book on the life of Zelda Fitzgerald, and the character in the song would be a mix of Zelda Fitzgerald [...] "along with amorphous images of girls he had met at the Whisky and the Troubadour". Zelda, the muse behind her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald, was known as a wild, bewitching and mesmerizing [...] "Flapper" [...] of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties, and is sometimes thought to be the model for the character of Daisy Buchanan in his novel, The Great Gatsby. In [...] "Witchy Woman", the line [...] "She drove herself to madness with the silver spoon" [...] may be a reference to Zelda's time in a mental institution and the special slotted silver spoon used to dissolve sugar cubes with absinthe, the popular 1920s alcoholic beverage distilled from the wormwood tree and called [...] "the green fairy" [...] for sometimes inducing hallucinations.|$|R

40|$|Two {{subjects}} <b>read</b> {{short stories}} <b>while</b> <b>writing</b> lists of words at dictation. After some weeks of practice, {{they were able}} to write words, discover relations arnong dictated words, and categorize words for meaning, <b>while</b> <b>reading</b> for comprehension at normal speed. The performance of these subjects is not consistent with the notion that there are fixed limits to attentional capacity. The study of divided attention has a long history. Most early psychologists, like their contemporary counterparts, believed that consciousness could only be directed to a single activity at a time. Conscious attention to two different actions performed at the same time was thought to be possible only if they were coordinated into a single, higher-order activity, or attended to in rapid alternation. Otherwise, it was assumed {{that at least one of}} them was being carried out ‘automatically’, without conscious control (James, 1890; Woodworth, 1921). Early investigators attempted to explore the limits of consciousness by combining diverse tasks while introspecting on their performance. Paulhan (1887) recited one poem <b>while</b> <b>writing</b> another, or <b>while</b> executing mathematical calculations. Solomons and Stein (1896) and later Downey and Anderson (1915) practiced <b>reading</b> stories <b>while</b> <b>writing</b> at dictation, and noted the changes that occurred in their conscious awareness of the act of writing. These studies did not always support the view that consciousness is unitary.

40|$|Stefan Darda in {{his novel}} Dom na wyrębach, {{presents}} the enormous potential of the acoustic realm, not only to scare the reader but also to enhance the presented vision of events. He uses various sounds (including those of creaking doors, a tawny owl or music from a recording), but also evokes a fear with silence which all the more enhances the richness of their meanings. Therefore, Darda creates an atmosphere of fear and uneasi-ness basing on sensual experience that proves to be key for the <b>reading</b> auditory. <b>While</b> <b>writing</b> a modern horror novel, he reaches for conventional narrative topos of a secluded place near a forest, ‘a hun¬ted house’, {{that allows him to}} successfully utilise the richness of the audiosphereCreatio Fantastic...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that early sensory {{deprivation}} modifies brain functional structure and connectivity. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the neuro-functional organization of reading in a patient with profound congenital unilateral deafness. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we compared cortical networks supporting the processing of written words in patient RA (completely deaf in the right ear since birth) and in a group of control volunteers. We found that congenital unilateral hearing deprivation modifies neural mechanisms of word <b>reading.</b> Indeed, <b>while</b> <b>written</b> word processing was left-lateralized in controls, we found a strong right lateralization of the fusiform and inferior occipital gyri activation in RA.
