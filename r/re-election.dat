5|$|In October 2015, The Boston Globe first {{reported}} that Wolf was considering {{not running for}} <b>re-election.</b> Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek <b>re-election</b> in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning <b>re-election</b> in 2014, though {{he said he was}} more focused on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek <b>re-election</b> in 2016 in order to focus on a run for governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E
5|$|Minton ran for <b>re-election</b> to his Senate seat in 1940.

In January, rumors that were {{eventually}} confirmed began circulating that second term Republican United States Senator George Voinovich would not run for <b>re-election</b> in 2010. Brunner's name was mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for the seat. On January 23, 2009, Brunner and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher met to discuss the possibility that either of them would run, but did not confirm any decision or leanings to the media.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, the {{old order}} was mostly re-established as {{fourteen}} of the fifteen judges were endorsed for <b>re-election</b> by both parties and returned to office without opposition. The fifteenth, 75-year-old Joseph L. Kun, was President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and had served on the court for thirty years. In February, lawyers from the city bar association voted by a 2-to-1 margin to not endorse his <b>re-election,</b> calling him unqualified to hold office. Despite the bipartisan effort against him among the city's lawyers, Kun filed for <b>re-election</b> in both parties' primaries. Kun won the Republican nomination handily, but lost the Democratic nomination to Earl Chudoff, {{a member of the}} federal House of Representatives from Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district. In November, Chudoff won easily, taking 58% of the vote. Kun, already in poor health, retired from the profession of law and died in 1961. Chudoff remained on the bench until 1974.|$|E

5|$|Chotiner {{initially}} {{registered to}} vote as a Democrat, but soon switched parties, joining the Republicans. He involved himself in Republican politics, working on Herbert Hoover's unsuccessful presidential <b>re-election</b> campaign in 1932. In 1938, the young attorney ran against longtime Republican incumbent Charles W. Lyon for the California State Assembly. Lyon cross-filed and secured his <b>re-election</b> by winning both primaries, defeating Chotiner in the Republican poll, and narrowly beating Robert A. Heinlein (who subsequently turned to writing science fiction) in the Democratic contest.|$|E

40|$|The <b>re-elections</b> to the Swiss Federal Government ('Federal Council') {{have not}} been much studied so far. On {{the basis of the}} 1947 - 1999 record, we propose an econometric model of these <b>re-elections,</b> {{consisting}} of four identities and two equations, the first of the latter explaining the score of the candidates and the second a residual category dominated by blank votes. Simulating the model, we find that the scores are predetermined - to the tune of about 50 % in recent years - by a number of systematic factors on which the candidates have no influence. The simulation residuals, i. e. the difference between the actual and the simulated scores, can however be interpreted as the personal 'sanctions' (negative or positive) inflicted on the candidates by the Federal Chambers {{on the basis of their}} action and personality. The results of some individual <b>re-elections</b> thus appear a good deal less 'brilliant' or, as the case may be, less 'deplorable' than would appear on first sight. We finally show that the curve of the scores and that of the requisite majorities tend to get closer and could cross before too long, meaning that non <b>re-elections</b> could occur in the more or less near future.

5|$|In the 2008 general election, Gibbs faced Republican Don Ytterberg, {{whom he had}} outraised roughly $80,000 to $50,000 by mid-October.
