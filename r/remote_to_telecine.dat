5000|$|The [...] "3:2 pulldown" [...] {{conversion}} process for 24 frame/s film <b>to</b> television (<b>telecine)</b> creates a slight {{error in the}} video signal compared to the original film frames.

The phenomenon is particularly apparent during slow, steady camera movements which appear slightly jerky when telecined. This process is commonly referred <b>to</b> as <b>telecine</b> judder.|$|R

The Brazilian transition will occur for two more years - meanwhile, the back catalog will stay with HBO, but the premium window will be exclusive <b>to</b> <b>Telecine,</b> starting in October 2011. The announcement came amidst controversies: <b>Telecine</b> claims <b>to</b> now have over 70% of premieres (Disney included), an argument refuted by HBO, which, in turn, says it has over 50% of top grossing movies. The main issue, however, is that HBO announced that it spontaneously broke up the agreement with Disney to [...] "open space for new Brazilian productions," [...] also contradicting Disney's Latin America VP Fernando Barbosa's statement {{that it was a}} financial issue, Telecine being [...] "more watched and, thus, more profitable." [...] Globosat's general manager, Alberto Pecegueiro, was also quoted as saying that his company maintains good relations with most programmers, with the exception of HBO, which he considers [...] "thugs."
