40|$|In {{pharmacotherapy}} for bronchitis and asthma, anti-hista-mines and anti-allergic {{drugs can}} be used concomitantly with theophylline (TP) to avoid induction of bronchoconstriction and inflammation in the respiratory tract. Some anti-hista-mines such as azelastine, ketotifen, mequitazine, mizolastine, pemiropast potassium, picumast dihydrochloride, <b>repirinast,</b> temelastine and terfenadine have been reported not to inter-act adversely with TP. 1) However, doqualast accelerated elim-ination of TP by increasing the free fraction in blood, and ke-totifen also decreased the serum level of TP. 2) TP has a nar-row therapeutic range in serum level of 10 â€” 20 mg/ml and can interact with other drugs in its metabolic process. 1, 3) Since many kinds of anti-allergic drugs have been developed and are commercially available, pharmacokinetic evaluation of the possible interaction between anti-allergic drugs and TP is important. Suplatast (ST), () -[2 -[4 -(3 -ethoxy- 2 -hydroxypropoxy) -phenylcarbamoyl]ethyl]dimethylsulfonium p-toluenesulfo-nate, is a novel anti-allergic drug and can inhibit not only production of IgE antibody but also type I allergic reaction. 4) That means ST can block both {{the first and second}} steps in an allergic reaction. In clinical practice, ST has been used for the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhini-tis. Anti-allergic drugs can be administered in association with TP, however, no interaction between ST and TP has been reported. In this study, we investigated the effect of ST on pharmacokinetics of TP in rats. A pharmacokinetic study in vivo was performed, and TP metabolism was also exam-ined in rat-liver microsomes in vitro. Finally, the inhibitory effect of ST and its main metabolite, M 1, on TP metabolism was demonstrated...|$|E
