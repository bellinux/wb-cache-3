With his suspicions growing stronger, he arrives in Ooty to meet Chandru and visits the police station, where he finds Chandru's car. The area's inspector tells Raghunath that an unknown person came in {{the car to the}} hospital and was admitted; the car was brought to the police station for safety.

25|$|The {{investors in}} the Lowell textile {{companies}} decided {{they needed to do}} something about their transportation situation. They looked toward the railroads budding in England, and now in America, for inspiration and took operations on the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad and the construction ongoing on the Allegheny Portage Railroad and Baltimore & Ohio {{and a handful of other}} ventures as omens and inspiration. A railroad could run year round, was expandable with as many tracks as they might need, and could use the new locomotives that were being highly praised in England at the heart of <b>recent</b> <b>news</b> stories. By 1829 the B was testing a locally produced steam locomotive, the Tom Thumb, and opened for passenger operations in May 1830. With well-publicized and ambitious plans to scale one of the gaps of the Allegheny and cross the Ohio River, and New York and Pennsylvania's canal mania sprinkled with railroads, Massachusetts and New England investors were looking at bold plans everywhere.|$|E

25|$|In {{the press}} release issued by the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA, 文建會) on Jan. 23, 2007, it was stated that “according to <b>recent</b> <b>news,</b> some local representatives and {{organizations}} in Taipei City and Taipei County claimed that the 90% Losheng preservation plan proposed by CCA will severely delay the MRT construction. Hereby CCA reiterates that the 90% preservation plan, evaluated by Hsin-Lu cooperation, will lengthen the construction period for about four months, and appends a three billion budget to it. It is not true to say the MRT construction will be delayed {{for two to three}} years.” This press release concludes that it is untrue for the media and Department of Taipei Rapid Transit System (DORTS, Taipei) to say that the 90% preservation plan will delay the construction of MRT for two to three years and result in a two to three hundred billion NTD (approx. 760 million USD) increase in budget.|$|E
25|$|I needed good victims. <b>Recent</b> <b>news</b> {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E

500|$|In an {{appearance}} at Harvard University in 2006, Colbert revealed that his character's fear of bears {{was in part}} inspired by a recurring nightmare he has had, in which a bear is standing {{between him and his}} goal.
