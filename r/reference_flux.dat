The proposed self-learning control scheme (SLC) {{is based on}} the newly reported virtual signal injection aided direct flux vector control. However, other searching based optimal control schemes in the flux-torque (f-t) reference frame are also possible. Initially the <b>reference</b> <b>flux</b> amplitudes for MTPA operations are tracked by virtual signal injection and the data are used by the proposed self-learning control scheme to train the <b>reference</b> <b>flux</b> map online. After training, the proposed control scheme generates the optimal <b>reference</b> <b>flux</b> amplitude with fast dynamic response.

40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} {{induction}} machine speed control is considered. Most previous works considered the machine magnetic characteristic to be linear and the <b>flux</b> <b>reference</b> to be constant. Specifically, the constant <b>flux</b> <b>reference</b> is chosen in the elbow {{zone of the}} magnetic characteristic. Doing so, the machine operation mode is not optimal in presence of small loads. In the present work, a new speed control strategy is developed that accounts for the saturation feature of the magnetic characteristic making possible the generation of optimal <b>flux</b> <b>references.</b> <b>Flux</b> optimality guarantees satisfactory machine performances (efficiency, power factor, maximal torque, [...] .). The obtained <b>flux</b> <b>reference</b> {{turns out to be}} a function of the machine state variables. Then, a speed controller is designed using the backstepping technique. The originality of the presented control design is twofold: (i) the magnetic characteristic nonlinearity makes the machine model highly nonlinear, (ii) the <b>flux</b> <b>reference</b> signal is state-dependent. The performances of the developed control strategy are formally analysed and their supremacy with respect to the standard control solution is illustrated through a simulation study...|$|R

Laboratory {{comparisons}} to quantify errors resulting from chamber design, operation and flux calculation methods are rare. We tested fifteen chambers against four flux levels (FL) ranging from 200 to 2300 g CH 4 m− 2 h− 1. The measurements were conducted on a calibration tank using three quartz sand types with soil porosities of 53 % (dry fine sand, S 1), 47 % (dry coarse sand, S 2), and 33 % (wetted fine sand, S 3). The chambers tested ranged from 0. 06 to 1. 8 m in height, and 0. 02 to 0. 195 m 3 in volume, 7 of them were equipped with a fan, and 1 with a vent-tube.

Ultracool dwarfs (. 2500 K) {{are known}} to display photometric variability in short timescales (hours to days), which has usually been related to rotation-modulated dust cloud patterns, or to unresolved companions. Aims. We perform photometric time-series analysis of a sample of ten early to mid-L dwarfs in the field over three years of Ks-band observations with the OMEGA 2000 infrared camera of the 3. 5 m telescope on Calar Alto Observatory between January 2010 and December 2012. This study represents the first systematic long-term photometric monitoring {{of this kind of}} object to date. Methods. We perform Ks-band differential photometry of our targets (with typical errors of ± 15 - 30 mmag at the 1 σ level) by sub-tracting a <b>reference</b> <b>flux</b> from each photometric measurement. This <b>reference</b> <b>flux</b> is computed using three nearby, probably constant stars in the target’s field-of-view.
