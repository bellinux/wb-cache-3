For example, it may not need to turn <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> to rack it, and operation is less sensitive to pallet orientation.|$|R

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>Pallet</b> Loading Problem (PLP) {{occurs when}} {{identical}} rectangular boxes {{are to be}} stacked and packed on <b>a</b> rectangular <b>pallet.</b> The problem has many practical applications in distribution and logistics in packaging industries. An {{increase in the number}} of boxes that can be shipped on <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> directly reduces the cost. In automated manufacturing palletising operations, the Pallet Loading Problem (PLP) usually deals with generating optimal pallet patterns <b>of</b> boxes on <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> but <b>a</b> purely mathematical solution does not consider the physical aspects and restrictions encountered when using the robot and the gripper to implement these patterns. Therefore, merely getting <b>an</b> optimal <b>pallet</b> pattern does not guarantee an optimal pattern placement strategy. Very few published literature is available to address this problem, there is a need to develop a methodology that considers the palletisers physical characteristics and limitations in robotic palletising systems. This paper presents the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> pattern placement strategy with practical implementations for five-block patterns with the aim of improving the operational efficiency in robotic palletisation...|$|R

The proper assignment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> to <b>an</b> aircraft trip usually yields quality (i.e., fewer aircraft and aircraft trips required) initial solutions. Selecting the best arrival date (and correspondingly the departure date) for an aircraft trip receiving its first pallet assignment is imperative in producing quality initial solutions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{finite element}} {{approaches to the}} strength assessment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> having repeated lattice pattern. The pallet is made of recycled plastics similar to high density polyethylene (HDPE). Due {{to the nature of}} repeat, the direct full 3 D finite element model consumes tremendous computational resource for analysis and hence is far inefficient. A full 3 D model using brick elements is created as a benchmark for comparison. Three other models contain shell elements, beam elements and bricks, representing the plate, stringers and ribs <b>of</b> the <b>pallet.</b> <b>A</b> last model using substructure scheme with super-elements is created to conduct the structural analysis of the pallet. The results of this study discloses that the substructural method employing superelements gives the least percent error and is advantageous over either the benchmark model or the rest models proposed in the present study...|$|R

Location of each transponder is determined from the transponder signal, and probabilities of location of pallets (2) are calculated based on {{the location of the}} transponders, where information is provided about the location of the pallet having highest probability.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>an</b> {{experimental study}} <b>of</b> the thermal inertia <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> loaded with returnable plastic crates containing primary packages of smoked ham. Based on this, food quality variations within the pallet were also investigated. Thermal time constants from 83 sensor locations {{were identified by}} studying the temperature changes when the pallet was exposed to instant temperature drops (16 C - 2 C) and temperature elevations (2 C - 16 C). The thermal time constants were used in microbiological prediction models to calculate the maximum difference in shelf life between packages at the two most extreme spots in the pallet unit load, when temperature elevated from 4 C to a higher temperature (ranging from 4. 5 C to 12 C), during different periods of time (ranging from 0. 5 h to 200 h). The results showed a maximum difference in shelf life of approximately 1. 8 days. The identified thermal time constants were also {{used to calculate the}} maximum difference in shelf life between packages at the two most extreme spots <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> unit load, in a real chilled food supply chain lasting for about 2. 5 days. This resulted in <b>a</b> maximum difference <b>of</b> 0. 1 days. The results imply that the location <b>of</b> <b>a</b> product in <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> has <b>a</b> relatively low influence on the product shelf life. This means that a temperature sensor used for calculating the predicted shelf life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> product, can be placed relatively far from the product itself (e. g. on the secondary package or even on the pallet) without jeopardizing the reliability of the resulting shelflife prediction. However, the results also emphasize the importance of continuous temperature monitoring along the entire chilled food supply chains...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pallet</b> pooling is <b>a</b> {{basis for}} the {{operation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city joint distribution system. <b>Pallet</b> allocation is <b>a</b> key problem for the success <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> pool. This article considers a multi-station, multi-period, and multi-type pallet allocation problem over <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> pool in <b>a</b> city joint distribution system. First of all, we develop a deterministic model to optimally allocate pallets when managers have perfect knowledge {{of the information that}} will be available. By case studies, we show that this model can help managers to make scientific decisions. The influence of transportation capacity on decisions is shown by numerical simulation. And we propose managers should use both demand forecasting and leasing and renting tactics to minimization allocation cost. Then, we propose a multi-scenario model to optimally allocate pallets when some uncertain parameters cannot be estimated through historical data. The application of this multi-scenario model is also illustrated...|$|R

50|$|Unit load {{formation}} {{equipment is}} used to restrict materials so that they maintain their integrity when handled a single load during transport and for storage. If materials are self-restraining (e.g., a single part or interlocking parts), then they can be formed into a unit load with no equipment. Examples of unit load formation equipment include pallets, skids, slipsheets, tote pans, bins/baskets, cartons, bags, and crates. <b>A</b> <b>pallet</b> is <b>a</b> platform made <b>of</b> wood (the most common), paper, plastic, rubber, or metal with enough clearance beneath its top surface (or face) to enable the insertion of forks for subsequent lifting purposes. A slipsheet is <b>a</b> thick piece <b>of</b> paper, corrugated fiber, or plastic upon which a load is placed and has tabs that can be grabbed by special push/pull lift truck attachments. They are used in place <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> to reduce weight and volume, but loading/unloading is slower.|$|R
