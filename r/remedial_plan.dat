He has {{submitted to the}} Court twenty-six periodic status reports, sixty-three numbered topic-specific reports, many special reports and recommendations to the parties, and numerous other analyses.” (p. 11). The court concluded that the remedial process had resulted in substantial positive change at Southbury Training School: “The contempt finding {{has resulted in the}} reform of Southbury Training School mandated in the <b>Remedial</b> <b>Plan</b> and its associated plans and orders. The remedial process has done much to advance the interests of the residents of Southbury Training School.
