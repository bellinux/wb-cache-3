5|$|Platform A2 {{is built}} {{along the edge}} of the <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> behind Pyramid A1. It faces west towards the pyramid and has two access stairways. Three {{successive}} versions of the platform were built, each overlying the previous. The earliest version sat upon the early <b>retaining</b> <b>wall,</b> as did the second version. The final version was much larger and was built after the new <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> had extended the available area for Group A.|$|E
5|$|Group E {{is located}} {{to the west}} of Group C. Group E is largely {{surrounded}} by steep ravines; the inhabitants of the city cut the cliffs to make them steeper and more defensible, and reinforced them with a <b>retaining</b> <b>wall.</b> Archaeological investigations failed to find any access stairway through the <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> to Group E.|$|E

40|$|The 2005 Fukuoka-ken Seiho-oki {{earthquake}} caused heavy {{damage to}} residential areas at the Genkai-jima Island. A field survey {{was carried out}} to investigate the damage of <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> in the residential areas. From the survey of 218 <b>retaining</b> <b>walls,</b> it appeared that 83 % of the <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> were damaged and 61 % of the whole lost their functions (collapsed or distorted/cracked). Especially in masonry <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> using natural rocks and boulders, the damage was serious. The damage features of dry masonry <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> (collapsed: 62 %) and wet masonry <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> (collapsed: 25 %) were different, and {{the difference in the}} earthquake-resistant capacity between the two <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> became obvious. Moreover, it appeared that most of the residential houses are built on transitions of cut slopes and fill embankments. It seems that this condition is one of a great factor which causes the heavy damage. Only 17 % of the <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> escaped from any damage. Furthermore, to evaluate the collapse mechanism of masonry <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> during earthquake, a theoretical model based on the earth pressure theory was proposed. Through the theoretical considerations, it became possible to quantitatively evaluate the stability of the masonry <b>retaining</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary. The <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> {{behavior}} {{is an interesting}} problem in the soils mechanics. Many of them are built without a clear knowledge of its mechanic behavior, because the most common theories about <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> only are accurate with some types of backfill. This paper presents a simple tool to simulate the <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> behavior by the Finite Element Method and numerical methods for non-linear structural problems. The Mohr-Coulomb model is used for soil mechanic behavior, and the interaction backfill soil-wall is simulated by orthotropic materials...|$|R
40|$|<b>Retaining</b> <b>walls</b> {{are large}} {{category}} of engineering structures of multiple uses, having an essential safety ensuring role. The structural systems are varied because the situations and requirements derived from both site conditions and other criteria are varied. The paper enlarges upon <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> systems that use an outstanding amount of precast units and multiple cylindrical vault type structural systems supported by abutments [1], [2]. The paper proposes extending the structural system to <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> and develops certain specific issues. Some considerations regarding structural design are made...|$|R
5|$|All {{that is left}} of Missouri Row is a four-sided {{concrete}} fireplace {{surrounded by}} pieces of foundation, a few sets of stairs, metal plumbing, and a <b>retaining</b> <b>wall.</b> East of that, surrounding {{what is now the}} Monte Ne boat launch, are remnants of limestone structures. Some of these are foundations from the broad wooden staircase built in front of Hotel Monte Ne; some are structural components for the twin stone bridges that crossed the lagoon and some are simply low retaining walls. The amphitheater and the <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> built for the Pyramid are underwater. Occasionally, when water levels drop in summer, they can be seen.|$|E
5|$|Armies {{of workers}} would gather a long, durable grass known as shicra in the {{highlands}} above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each successive <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> of the step pyramids with the stone-filled bags.|$|E
5|$|Platform A8 is to {{the east}} of Pyramid A1, on {{the eastern side of the}} Group A plaza. It faces {{northwest}} towards the pyramid and had two access stairways. Behind the platform was a finely paved terrace extending along the edge of the <b>retaining</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{the waters}} of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100feet (335m). This {{generated}} a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted {{to the edge of}} the lake to explore the remains. The upper part of the amphitheater and the <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again swallowed by the lake.|$|E

5|$|A major 18-month {{redevelopment}} of {{the square}} led by W.S. Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides {{of the square}}, demolishing the central section of the northern <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace {{in front of the}} National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a café. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.|$|E
5|$|Group B is {{near the}} centre of the site, roughly {{equidistant}} between Group A (to the northeast) and Group C (to the southwest). The main plaza of Group B was at the northern end of the group and was enclosed by the ballcourt on the south side, a double pyramid on the east side and three platforms. A stairway with 28 steps descends the Group B <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> behind the northeast corner of the double pyramid, providing an access route towards Group D. On {{the north side of the}} group another stairway, with 18 steps divided into two flights, descends towards Group A.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to {{a highway}} {{expansion}} project, this paper makes field obversations on earth pressrue of double-sided reinforcement <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> and studies distribution of it. Test results show earth {{pressure on the}} back of double-sided reinforcement <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> grows with increase of filling height during construction and the distribution is nonlinear along with height of the wall, the maximum is at the base. Measured values of vertical earth pressure are lower than theoretical ones. And this structure of double-sided reinforcement <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> has low requirement on bearing pressure of foundations. The results {{can be used as a}} reference for further application in future...|$|R

5|$|Group F is to {{the west}} of Group E. Mound F is the main {{structure}} within Group F. It slopes gradually away to the west and was not easily defensible on that side, however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears to have been an observation platform covering the western pass to the city. A <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> supported the mound above the pass and a round earth platform upon the mound may have supported a perishable watchtower.|$|E
5|$|In the late-1930s it {{was decided}} to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, {{designed}} by Sir Edwin Lutyens, were memorials to Lord Jellicoe and Lord Beatty, although busts of the admirals, initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> when the project was completed after the Second World War. The fountains cost almost £50,000. The old ones were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in Ottawa's Confederation Park and Regina's Wascana Centre.|$|E
5|$|On June 18, 1998, {{a severe}} storm damaged the estate. Heavy rains caused the {{drainage}} system to fail and {{a cascade of}} water surged over the <b>retaining</b> <b>wall.</b> This caused a mudslide, damaging the estate's foundation. Furthermore, the large oak tree {{at the center of}} the courtyard fell down on top of the house. The next year, another storm collapsed a tunnel underneath the studio wing. A 1999 grant from Save America's Treasures helped defray costs to re-roof Taliesin III, to stabilize its foundation, and to connect it to a local sewage treatment plant.|$|E

5|$|Stela 2 is a {{monument}} {{in the early}} Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which would place it in the 1st century BC.

5|$|The {{match is}} largely remembered for the {{disaster}} that occurred before the kick-off. Liverpool fans breached a fence separating {{the two groups}} of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds. Despite calls for an abandonment, the match went ahead because it was felt that further trouble would otherwise occur. The disaster prompted UEFA to ban English clubs from European football for five years.|$|E
5|$|Clifford's Tower {{played no}} part in the formal design of the prison, {{although}} the talus, or sloping edge of the motte, was cut away and replaced by a <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> to allow more space for the new prison building. The backyard of the Female Prison, concealed from public view by the new wall, was used for hangings from 1868 onwards. The Prison Act, 1877, reformed the English prison system, and York Castle gaol was passed into the control of central government the following year. It {{was used as the}} county prison until 1900, when the remaining prisoners were transferred to Wakefield Prison, and from then onwards the facility was used as a military prison instead.|$|E
