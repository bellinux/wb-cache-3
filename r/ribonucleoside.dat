25|$|The enzyme {{ribonucleotide}} reductase (RNR) catalyzes the de novo {{synthesis of}} dNDPs. Catalysis of <b>ribonucleoside</b> 5’-diphosphates (NDPs) involves a reduction at the 2’-carbon of ribose 5-phosphate to form the 2’-deoxy derivative-reduced 2’-deoxyribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (dNDPs). This reduction is initiated with the generation of a free radical. Following a single reduction, RNR requires electrons donated from the dithiol groups of the protein thioredoxin. Regeneration of thioredoxin occurs when {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) provides two hydrogen atoms that are used to reduce the disulfide groups of thioredoxin.|$|E
25|$|Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), {{also known}} as <b>ribonucleoside</b> {{diphosphate}} reductase (rNDP), is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides. Deoxyribonucleotides in turn {{are used in the}} synthesis of DNA. The reaction catalyzed by RNR is strictly conserved in all living organisms. Furthermore, RNR plays a critical role in regulating the total rate of DNA synthesis so that DNA to cell mass is maintained at a constant ratio during cell division and DNA repair. A somewhat unusual feature of the RNR enzyme is that it catalyzes a reaction that proceeds via a free radical mechanism of action. The substrates for RNR are ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP. dTDP (deoxythymidine diphosphate) is synthesized by another enzyme (thymidylate kinase) from dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate).|$|E
25|$|The NS5B protein (65 kDa) is the viral RNA {{dependent}} RNA polymerase. NS5B has the key {{function of}} replicating the HCV’s viral RNA {{by using the}} viral positive RNA strand as its template and catalyzes the polymerization of <b>ribonucleoside</b> triphosphates (rNTP) during RNA replication. Several crystal structures of NS5B polymerase in several crystalline forms have been determined {{based on the same}} consensus sequence BK (HCV-BK, genotype 1). The structure can be represented by a right hand shape with fingers, palm, and thumb. The encircled active site, unique to NS5B, is contained within the palm structure of the protein. Recent studies on NS5B protein genotype 1b strain J4’s (HC-J4) structure indicate a presence of an active site where possible control of nucleotide binding occurs and initiation of de-novo RNA synthesis. De-novo adds necessary primers for initiation of RNA replication. Current research attempts to bind structures to this active site to alter its functionality in order to prevent further viral RNA replication.|$|E

To {{determine the}} metabolism of ribonucleic acid (RNA) in uremia, serum and urine levels of <b>ribonucleosides</b> in uremic patients {{were analyzed using}} reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The serum levels of xanthosine and all modified <b>ribonucleosides</b> were increased in undialyzed patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), and patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The serum level of pseudouridine was markedly increased in all the uremic patients especially CAPD patients (32 times higher than normal). By contrast, the serum level of adenosine did not show any {{significant change in the}} uremic patients. Interestingly, the serum and urine levels of inosine were significantly decreased in all the uremic patients, suggesting that the production of inosine is decreased in uremic patients. The serum level of uridine was significantly elevated only in the HD patients. The serum levels of all <b>ribonucleosides</b> except inosine and uridine decreased significantly after HD. The urinary excretion of inosine, 1 -methyladenosine, 1 -methylguanosine, N 2,N 2 -dimethylguanosine and N 4 -acetylcytidine was significantly decreased in the CRF patients, leading to the accumulation of these modified <b>ribonucleosides</b> in the uremic serum. CAPD patients showed markedly increased serum levels of modified <b>ribonucleosides</b> such as pseudouridine, 1 -methylinosine, and N 2,N 2 -dimethylguanosine and N 4 -acetylcytidine as compared with the HD patients. These results demonstrate that there was an altered metabolism of RNA in uremic patients with marked accumulation of modified <b>ribonucleosides...</b>|$|R

A more extensive information {{on the use of}} various coupling agents in oligonucleotide synthesis {{can be found in a}} recent review. [...] The mixing is usually very brief and occurs in fluid lines of oligonucleotide synthesizers (see below) while the components are being delivered to the reactors containing solid support. The activated phosphoramidite in 1.5– 20-fold excess over the support-bound material is then brought in contact with the starting solid support (first coupling) or a support-bound oligonucleotide precursor (following couplings) whose 5'-hydroxy group reacts with the activated phosphoramidite moiety of the incoming nucleoside phosphoramidite to form a phosphite triester linkage. The coupling of 2'-deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites is very rapid and requires, on small scale, about 20s for its completion. In contrast, sterically hindered 2'-O-protected <b>ribonucleoside</b> phosphoramidites require 5-15 min to be coupled in high yields. The reaction is also highly sensitive to the presence of water, particularly when dilute solutions of phosphoramidites are used, and is commonly carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile. Generally, the larger the scale of the synthesis, the lower the excess and the higher the concentration of the phosphoramidites is used. In contrast, the concentration of the activator is primarily determined by its solubility in acetonitrile and is irrespective of the scale of the synthesis. Upon the completion of the coupling, any unbound reagents and by-products are removed by washing.|$|E

Modulating effects of several <b>ribonucleosides</b> were found in the range of 10 − 7 – 10 − 3 mol/l. The following <b>ribonucleosides</b> induced significant apoptosis of HL- 60 cells: adenosine, N 6 -dimethyladenosine, N 6 -(2 -isopentenyl) -adenosine, N 2 -dimethylguanosine.

40|$|Post-transcriptional {{modification}} of RNA {{is an important}} determinant of RNA quality control, translational efficiency, RNA-protein interactions and stress response. This {{is illustrated by the}} observation of toxicant-specific changes in the spectrum of tRNA modifications in a stress-response mechanism involving selective translation of codon-biased mRNA for crucial proteins. To facilitate systems-level studies of RNA modifications, we developed a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technique for the quantitative analysis of modified <b>ribonucleosides</b> in tRNA. The protocol includes tRNA purification by HPLC, enzymatic hydrolysis, reversed-phase HPLC resolution of the <b>ribonucleosides,</b> and identification and quantification of individual <b>ribonucleosides</b> by LC-MS via dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (DMRM). In this approach, the relative proportions of modified <b>ribonucleosides</b> are quantified in several micrograms of tRNA in a 15 -min LC-MS run. This protocol can be modified to analyze other types of RNA by modifying the steps for RNA purification as appropriate. By comparison, traditional methods for detecting modified <b>ribonucleosides</b> are labor- and time-intensive, they require larger RNA quantities, they are modification-specific or require radioactive labeling.

40|$|Carbon nanomaterials, {{including}} carbon nanotubes and graphene, {{with various}} unique {{physical and chemical}} properties are emerging as extraordinary materials for biomedical applications. The aim of this thesis was to functionalise single walled carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxide with range of biomolecules including, peptides, peptoids, and <b>ribonucleosides.</b> The first study investigated the noncovalent interaction between single walled carbon nanotubes and fluoro tagged nano- 1 peptide with 19 F NMR. In the second study single walled carbon nanotubes were noncovalently functionalised with a series of antibacterial, chiral, amphiphilic peptoids. The peptoids varied in the number of aromatic residues on the hydrophobic surface of the helix. It was found that peptoid’s ability to individually disperse single walled carbon nanotubes increased with increasing the number of aromatic residues. The third study presented the first experimental noncovalent interaction of <b>ribonucleosides,</b> nucleobases, and ribose with purified and oxidised single walled carbon nanotubes. It was found that cyclic and aromatic <b>ribonucleosides</b> and nucleobases are too small to disperse the hydrophobic nanotube surface by π-π stacking. Furthermore, results showed that the <b>ribonucleosides</b> dispersion ability towards nanotubes depends on the number of oxygen-containing functional groups on the nanotube surface. In the final research {{it was found that the}} flat rigid surface of reduced graphene oxide has a critical role in its noncovalent interaction with peptides and peptoids. Results showed that biomolecules with higher backbone flexibility can give a higher dispersion affinity towards reduced graphene oxide. Also, it was found that <b>ribonucleosides</b> and their nucleases, and ribose moieties have very limited dispersion affinity towards reduced graphene oxide.
