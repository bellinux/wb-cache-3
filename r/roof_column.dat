The trophy bites the bandit on the rear end, while the bandit screams in pain. Popeye continues beating bandits. Bluto works his way to Olive's dressing room.

50|$|To {{allow for}} fast on-site assembly, {{compression}} truss and <b>roof</b> <b>column</b> connections were bolted; this enabled easy disassembling {{of the roof}} structure after the closing ceremonies. The cable-supported roof structure covers approximately two-thirds of the stadium's seating. Reaching 70 m above the field of play, the stadium roof held 14 lighting towers, or paddles, that collectively contained a total of 532 individual 2 kW floodlight lamps. The lights were first officially switched on in December 2010 by Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson. During the games, the towers were fitted with additional ceremony lighting, and 4 of the 14 towers held large temporary video screens.|$|E

Construction {{at the base of the}} mountain offered some structural support. The ceiling material was a composite application of wood and stone decreasing its overall weight. Extensive use of stone in Persepolis, not only guaranteed its structural integrity for the duration of its use but also meant that its remains lasted longer than the mud-bricks of Susa palaces.|$|R

2500|$|Robert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein {{dedicated}} his 1958 novel Methuselah's Children [...] "To Edward E. Smith, PhD".) Heinlein {{reported that}} E. E. Smith perhaps took his [...] "unrealistic" [...] heroes from life, citing {{as an example}} the extreme competence of the hero of Spacehounds of IPC. He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein's essay, he reports {{that he began to}} suspect Smith might be a sort of [...] "superman" [...] when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it on a back road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the <b>roof</b> <b>columns</b> to listen for chassis squeaks by bone conduction—a process apparently improvised on the spot.|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, virtual 3 D reconstructions of archaeological sites have gained large {{attention}} from various fields of science. Procedural modelling approaches {{have emerged as}} appropriate to model and visualize reconstructed ancient structures. The process of reconstructing historical building structures involves ambiguities and uncertainties. On an archaeological site, excavated and surveyed findings such as ruins, located in their original positions, provide reliable foundations for a 3 D reconstruction. On the contrary, findings, such as debris of walls, <b>roofs,</b> <b>columns,</b> etc. are not less important, but implicate different levels of certainties for a 3 D model, depending on the archaeological knowledge and interpretation. On one hand, this work provides a virtual 3 D reconstructing of an ancient Roman temple named “Sanctuary of Diana” located in Nemi, Italy, in different levels of detail using a procedural modelling approach. On the other hand, we present a fuzzy logic approach to quantify and visualize {{the uncertainty of the}} temple reconstruction...|$|R

Steel girders and beams were run through the old walls, which were two feet thick in some places. Finally a terra cotta front was installed. The single story structure then measured twenty feet in height. The restaurant was kept open while the remodeling progressed.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} thermal bridging due to columns and beams on energy consumption and peak load requirements of typical private residential villas in Kuwait.

The local climate pattern coupled with uninsulated skeleton structure of reinforced concrete that forms 27 % of the external total wall area can {{have a significant effect}} on the thermal resistance of the buildings envelope. Multi-dimensional heat transfer method was implemented to assess the magnitude of this effect and then to incorporate this in a whole building energy simulation program to assess the impact on the overall thermal performance of the buildings considered. It was found that the thermal resistance of constructions can be reduced by 48 % due to uninsulated columns and beams. In addition, the average effect on the overall annual energy consumption and peak load demand for Kuwaiti type villas was found to be 1. 8 % and 2. 3 % respectively...|$|R
