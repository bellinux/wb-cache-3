5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force <b>resisting</b> forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force <b>resisting</b> forward motion.|$|E

40|$|Many {{problems}} {{exist in}} current photoresist designs that will limit {{their ability to}} obtain the performance required for future generations of integrated circuit devices. In order to overcome these challenges, novel <b>resist</b> designs are required, along with advancement in the fundamental understanding {{of the source of}} these problems. A mesoscale kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of <b>resists</b> was developed to probe the effects of changes in <b>resist</b> formulation and processing. A detailed SEM simulator was developed in order to better understand the effect of metrology on the characterization of the final <b>resist</b> relief image. Several important structure-property relations were developed for the prediction of glass transition temperature in molecular <b>resists</b> and the prediction of the solubility of molecular <b>resists</b> in developer. Five new families of molecular <b>resists</b> were developed that provide solutions to some of the limitations in current <b>resist</b> designs. Single component molecular <b>resists</b> have all of the functional groups required to act as a chemically amplified <b>resist</b> contained in a single molecule. This eliminates inhomogeneities in the <b>resist</b> and provides improved line edge roughness. Non-chemically amplified molecular <b>resists</b> were developed that have very good sensitivity due to the unique dissolution properties of molecular <b>resists.</b> Negative tone molecular <b>resists</b> were developed that have an excellent combination of resolution, sensitivity, and line edge roughness with better resolution than has been previously seen in negative tone <b>resists.</b> Control methods were also developed to improve the resolution of these types of negative tone <b>resists</b> even further.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Patterning {{of metal}} oxides {{typically}} involves a multi step process, involving depositing a <b>resist,</b> patterning that <b>resist</b> with {{some form of}} lithography, etching the oxide through the <b>resist,</b> and finally removing. This process can be simplified if the <b>resist</b> is removed and replaced with a metal oxide that can be directly patterned. Solution deposition of metal oxides allows the possibility of depositing materials that are responsive to traditional lithographic patterning methods. A directly patterned <b>resist</b> can be integrated into devices with less difficulty. It is also possible, with a directly patterned metal oxide, to consider this material also as a <b>resist</b> for the patterning of another material. This metal oxide can then be considered an inorganic <b>resist.</b> Inorganic <b>resists</b> have proven to offer a higher resolution and etch resistance than a comparable polymer <b>resist.</b> The work presented here represents efforts to develop directly patterned metal oxides that exhibits these desired <b>resist</b> properties, but which also competes with polymer <b>resist</b> in terms of sensitivity, the one area inorganic <b>resists</b> have always performed unsuitably.
