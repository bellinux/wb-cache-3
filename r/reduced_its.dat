5|$|David A. Wheeler's paper How to Prevent {{the next}} Heartbleed {{analyzes}} why Heartbleed wasn't discovered earlier, and suggests several techniques {{which could have}} led to a faster identification, as well as techniques which could have <b>reduced</b> <b>its</b> impact. According to Wheeler, the most efficient technique which could have prevented Heartbleed is an atypical test suite thoroughly performing what he calls negative testing, i.e. testing that invalid inputs cause failures rather than successes. Wheeler highlights that a single general-purpose test suite could serve as a base for all TLS implementations.|$|E
5|$|Despite the defeat, the {{soldiers}} were received as heroes in Santiago. Thanks to Las Heras, a potential disaster for the patriot armies turned into a minor setback. The army was reorganized again, but the deaths, injuries and desertions caused by the defeat at Cancha Rayada <b>reduced</b> <b>its</b> size to 5,000 soldiers, which was closer to the royalist forces. They took position next to the Maipo River, near Santiago.|$|E

From 2000 to 2003, he reduced IT staff by 20 percent and reduced purchasing from technology vendors by 30 percent. He negotiated aggressively with vendors to reduce prices and lobbied Verizon to eliminate its policy against purchasing IT equipment being auctioned on eBay by failed dot-com businesses. Many contract programming positions were out-sourced to lower-cost labor in India. Additionally, new software was installed that improved Verizon's utilization of IT hardware.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Mendips is open {{calcareous}} grassland, {{supporting a}} wide variety of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, and some have been used intensively for arable agriculture, particularly since World WarI. As the demand for arable land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has <b>reduced</b> <b>its</b> biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) maintains the grassland habitat.|$|E

The ENACC sets the long-term climate change agenda for the country, together with medium to long-term goals for adaptation and mitigation.

5|$|The jaguar is a near-threatened {{species and}} its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and {{fragmentation}} of habitat.

Following the announcement of the competition, CEO of NSB, Einar Enger, said that he did not see competition as a threat, but instead that NSB would introduce means to rationalize costs.
