25|$|Most goalkeepers also wear {{gloves to}} improve their grip on the ball, and to protect {{themselves}} from injury. Some gloves now include <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> spines down each finger to help prevent injuries such as jammed and sprained fingers. Though gloves are not mandatory attire, it is uncommon for goalkeepers to opt against them due to the advantages they offer. At UEFA Euro 2004, Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo famously took off his gloves for the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against England. He then went on to score a penalty in sudden death before saving Darius Vassell's penalty to win it for the Portuguese.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1950s {{there have}} been several {{attempts}} to develop theories for arching action in both one and two-way slabs. One of the principal approaches to membrane action was that due to Park which {{has been used as a}} basis for many studies into arching action in slabs. [...] Park’s approach was based on <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> slab strip theory, and required the assumption of a critical deflection of one half of the slab depth at failure. [...] Park’s approach was later extended by Park and Gamble in their method for predicting the plastic load-deformation response of laterally restrained slabs.|$|E
2500|$|Diving masks {{may have}} a single, durable, {{tempered}} glass faceplate, or two lenses {{in front of the}} eyes. These may be supported by a relatively <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> or metal frame, or they may be permanently bonded to the rim of the skirt, in a construction known as [...] "frameless". In the case of freediving masks, which need to have a low internal volume to minimize the amount of breath needed to equalize the change of pressure that occurs with depth, the lenses may be made of polycarbonate plastic. There is usually a [...] "skirt" [...] of synthetic rubber or silicone elastomer to support the frame and lenses and create a watertight seal with the diver's face.|$|E

2500|$|Sectional {{track was}} an {{improvement}} in setting up track on a living room floor because the rail was attached to a <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> tie base, and could withstand rough handling from children and pets without suffering much damage.

Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and fishing line in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|R
50|$|When the PET bottles are {{returned}} to an authorized redemption center, {{or to the}} original seller in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly or fully refunded to the redeemer. In both cases the collected post-consumer PET is taken to recycling centres known as materials recovery facilities (MRF) where it is sorted and separated from other materials such as metal, objects made out of other <b>rigid</b> <b>plastics</b> such as PVC, HDPE, polypropylene, flexible plastics such as those used for bags (generally low density polyethylene), drink cartons, glass, and anything else which is not made out of PET.|$|R
5000|$|Polyolefin {{properties}} {{range from}} liquidlike to rigid solids, and are primarily determined by their molecular weight {{and degree of}} crystallinity. Polyolefin degrees of crystallinity range from 0% (liquidlike) to 60% or higher (<b>rigid</b> <b>plastics).</b> Crystallinity is primarily governed by the lengths of polymers crystallizable sequences established during polymerization. Examples include adding {{a small percentage of}} comonomer like 1-hexene or 1-octene during the polymerization of ethylene, or occasional irregular insertions ("stereo" [...] or [...] "regio" [...] defects) during the polymerization of isotactic propylene. The polymers ability to crystallize to high degrees decreases with increasing content of defects.|$|R
