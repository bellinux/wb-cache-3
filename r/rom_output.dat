40|$|Abstract—A 2 -GHz direct digital {{frequency}} synthesizer (DDFS) chip-set is presented which operates {{at a very}} low supply voltage of 2 V. The chip-set consists of a CMOS DDFS-large scale integrator (LSI) which synthesizes a sine wave at 55 Msps with an internal 10 -b digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and Si-bipolar image-reject up-converters. To achieve both high purity and low power dissipation, we developed a distortion-free up-conversion architecture and an efficient <b>ROM</b> <b>output</b> bit-width reduction technique. Operation of 2 -V for the entire chip-set becomes possible because {{of the use of}} both multithreshold-voltage CMOS in the D/A converters and current-folded double-balanced mixers in the microwave up-converters. The synthesizer achieves a wide spurious-free dynamic range of 50 dB and a low power dissipation of less than 160 mW at 2 GHz.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the modeling work by Makai Ocean Engineering, Inc. {{to simulate the}} biochemical effects of of the nutrient-enhanced seawater plumes that are discharged by one or several 100 megawatt OTEC plants. The modeling is needed to properly design OTEC plants that can operate sustainably with acceptably low biological impact. In order to quantify the effect of discharge configuration and phytoplankton response, Makai Ocean Engineering implemented a biological and physical model for the waters surrounding O`ahu, Hawai`i, using the EPA-approved Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). Each EFDC grid cell was approximately 1 square kilometer by 20 meters deep, and used a time step of three hours. The biological model {{was set up to}} simulate the biochemical response for three classes of organisms: Picoplankton (20 um) e. g., diatoms. The dynamic biological phytoplankton model was calibrated using chemical and biological data collected for the Hawaii Ocean Time Series (HOTS) project. Peer review of the biological modeling was performed. The physical oceanography model uses boundary conditions from a surrounding Hawai'i Regional Ocean Model, (ROM) operated by the University of Hawai`i and the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration. The ROM provided tides, basin scale circulation, mesoscale variability, and atmospheric forcing into the edges of the EFDC computational domain. This model is the most accurate and sophisticated Hawai'ian Regional Ocean Model presently available, assimilating real-time oceanographic observations, as well as model calibration based upon temperature, current and salinity data collected during 2010 near the simulated OTEC site. The ROM program manager peer-reviewed Makai's implementation of the <b>ROM</b> <b>output</b> into our EFDC model. The supporting oceanographic data was collected for a Naval Facilities Engineering Command / Makai project. Results: The model was run for a 100 MW OTEC Plant consisting of four separate ducts, discharging a total combined flow rate of 420 m 3 /s of warm water and 320 m 3 /s of cold water in a mixed discharge at 70 meters deep. Each duct was assumed to have a discharge port diameter of 10. 5 m producing a downward discharge velocity of about 2. 18 m/s. The natural system, as measured in the HOTS program, has an average concentration of 10 - 15 mgC/m 3. To calibrate the biological model, we first ran the model with no OTEC plant and varied biological parameters until the simulated data was a good match to the HOTS observations. This modeling showed that phytoplankton concentration were patchy and highly dynamic. The patchiness was a good match with the data variability observed within the HOTS data sets. We then ran the model with simulated OTEC intake and discharge flows and associated nutrients. Directly under the OTEC plant, the near-field plume has an average terminal depth of 172 meters, with a volumetric dilution of 13 : 1. The average terminal plume temperature was 19. 8 oC. Nitrate concentrations are 1 to 2 umol/kg above ambient. The advecting plume then further dilutes to less than 1 umol/kg above ambient within a few kilometers downstream, while remaining at depth. Because this terminal near-field plume is well below the 1 % light limited depths (~ 120 m), no immediate biological utilization of the nutrients occurs. As the nitrate is advected and dispersed downstream, a fraction of the deep ocean nutrients (< 0. 5 umol/kg perturbation) mix upward where they are utilized by the ambient phytoplankton population. This occurs approximately twenty-five kilometers downstream from the plant at 110 - 70 meters depth. For pico-phytoplankton, modeling results indicate that this nutrient perturbation causes a phytoplankton perturbation of approximately 1 mgC/m 3 (~ 10 % of average ambient concentrations) that covers an area 10 x 5 km in size at the 70 to 90 m depth. Thus, the perturbations are well within the natural variability of the system, generally corresponding to a 10 to 15 % increase above the average pico-phytoplankton biomass. This perturbation exhibits a meandering horizontal plume trajectory and spatial extent, but remains similar in magnitude (generally 1 - 2 mgC/m 3). The diatom perturbations become more noticeable after three weeks of the simulation period, when the nearshore diatom population trends towards a greater concentration of 1 to 3 mgC/m 3. Relative to the background concentrations, this increased response is a fraction of the ambient, with perturbations remaining within fluctuations of the existing system. The perturbations were quantified by post-processing each time-step of model simulations without OTEC plants, with identical simulations that included OTEC plumes. Without this post processing, the 10 - 25 % perturbations were obscured by the larger dynamic variations naturally caused by ocean circulation...|$|E

Like the DA algorithm, ROM can be implemented in polynomial time. Unlike the DA algorithm, it is possible for <b>ROM</b> to <b>output</b> a stable matching that is different from the man-optimal and woman-optimal stable matchings. We say that a stable matching µ is ROM-reachable if <b>ROM</b> can <b>output</b> µ. In this paper, we investigate computational questions related to ROM-reachability. First, we show that there is an efficient algorithm for determining if ROM can reach a non-trivial stable matching- i. e., one different from the man-optimal and woman-optimal stable matchings. However, if we wish to determine if ROM can reach a particular stable matching then the problem becomes NP-complete. We then study two restricted versions of this problem. In the first version, we consider stable matchings that can be reached by ROM in a “direct ” manner. We show that they are computationally easy to recognize. In the second version, we restrict the class of stable matchings to what we call extreme stable matchings and prove that computational complexity of determining if they are ROM-reachable depends on the number of unstable partners of the agents. ...|$|R

Determining {{accurate}} {{statistical information}} about outputs from ensembles of realizations is not generally possible whenever the input-output map involves the (computational) solution of systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). This {{is due to}} the high cost of effecting each realization. Recently, in applications such as control and optimization that also require multiple solutions of PDEs, there has been much interest in reducedorder models (ROMs) that greatly reduce the cost of determining approximate solutions. We explore the use of <b>ROMs</b> for determining <b>outputs</b> that depend on solutions of stochastic PDEs. One is then able to cheaply determine much larger ensembles, but this increase in sample size is countered by the lower fidelity of the ROM used to approximate the state. In the contexts of proper orthogonal decomposition-based ROMs, we explore these counteracting effects on the accuracy of statistical information about outputs determined from ensembles of solutions...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{increased}} attention towards reduction {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) emissions and other heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere. This has affected the operation of process industries, particularly solid fuel power plants which are responsible for {{almost a third of}} the total CO 2 emissions. Among the choices for power generation from solid fuels, gasification-based power plants have been accepted {{as one of the most}} efficient means of generating electricity from solid fuels, when a CO 2 capture unit is considered in the plant’s layout. However, improvements in the cost and availability of gasifiers are still required to make this technology competitive with combustors. In recent years, a new class of compact gasifiers, also known as short-residence time gasifiers, has been proposed to reduce the cost of power generation. To speed up the development of this technology, insights regarding the operability, efficiency and feasibility of these gasifiers are required through a mathematical modelling analysis. This research aims to develop a computationally efficient dynamic reduced order model (ROM) that considers the essential features of a short-residence time gasifier. The ROM was initially validated for steady-state simulation of the pilot-scale gasifier by using data obtained from computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations and experimental tests. Although the framework of the ROM was fixed and developed based on CFD simulation generated at a base-case condition, the results showed reasonable agreement between the two models under different operating conditions and kinetic parameters. In addition, the ROM predicted the experimental observations for conversion in the range of 48 - 90 %. The proposed ROM has shown to be computationally attractive as it reduces the computation time by two orders of magnitude when compared to CFD simulations. The attractive computational costs of the ROM has allowed the evaluation of the gasifier’s performance through sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, parameter estimation, dynamic simulation and process scale-up. The results of a sensitivity analysis indicated that the recirculation ratio and oxygen flowrate have a greater effect on the process compared to model geometry and kinetic parameters. An uncertainty quantification was performed to investigate the variability in the <b>ROM’s</b> key <b>outputs</b> in the presence of uncertainty in parameters that affect the feedstock’s properties and the mixing/laminar flows within different zones of the reactor network. The study revealed significant variability in the conversion, peak temperature and steam percentage in the syngas; while the dry syngas composition does not seem to be significantly affected by the uncertainty of the considered parameters. Since the recirculation ratio is the most influential parameter in the ROM, and its true value is typically uncertain, a new semi-empirical correlation was proposed to estimate this parameter. The proposed correlation improved the well-known method of Thring and Newby for jet-flow recirculation by adding a term that takes into account the changes in the feed streams on the recirculation. This feature enhances the prediction capabilities of the reactor network, especially in dynamic simulations where the inlet flowrates may change over time, e. g., for load-following power plants. The dynamic simulation of the gasifier was then performed by implementing this correlation. Accordingly, the operability of the pilot-scale gasifier based on the responses the dry syngas composition, temperature distribution, cold gas efficiency, slag thickness and flowrate were studied under sinusoidal changes in the feed, load-following and co-firing scenarios. Furthermore, the ROM was scaled-up to perform the steady-state simulation of a 3, 000 TPD commercial-scale short-residence time gasifier which uses a multi-element injector feed system with 36 nozzles. The performance of the gasifier was then examined under changes in the operating pressure, number of injectors and fuel distribution among injection tubes. The results provided valuable insights regarding the suitability of design parameters and the operational conditions which may damage the gasifier’s refractory and injectors. Based on the simulations performed through this research, a systematically developed ROM that captures the streamlines of the multiphase flow, can predict the behaviour of a gasifier for a wide range of operating conditions with reasonable accuracy. Moreover, a ROM can provide valuable insights on the following objects: 1) the suitability of the design parameters and model assumptions; 2) identifying the critical operating conditions or demand scenarios that may impose a safety hazard or operational constraints; and 3) the flexibility of the system under the changes in fuel, load and failure of mechanical equipment...|$|R
40|$|P. Wolff, S. Rockwood, R. Jepsen, W. M. Silvers Whitworth University, Spokane WA Evidence {{to support}} the {{positive}} effects of static stretching (SS) on range of motion (ROM) is long withstanding. However, researchers have consistently found negative effects on performance after SS sessions. Recently, there has been increased interest in self-myofascial release (SMR) via foam rolling (FR). It appears that FR has the potential to improve ROM without eliciting a detrimental effect on force output and athletic performance. However, few studies have directly compared the effects of SS and FR on ROM and athletic performance. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the effects of acute sessions of SS and FR on ankle dorsiflexion ROM and vertical jump (VJ) force output. METHODS: Fifteen healthy, recreationally active, college-aged males and females (nm = 3; nf = 12; age: 19 - 22 y; ht: 169. 7 ± 10. 7 cm; wt: 70. 8 ± 15. 9 kg) completed separate sessions of FR or SS, followed immediately by <b>ROM</b> and force <b>output</b> tests. Each gastrocnemius muscle-tendon group was stretched statically or rolled for three bouts of 30 s, with 30 s rest between sets. Goniometry was used to assess active, static ankle dorsiflexion ROM at baseline (CON) and post-SS/FR. A VJ test on a force plate was used to assess baseline and post-SS/FR force output. A repeated measures ANOVA (significance level p ≤ 0. 05) was utilized to determine the existence of significant differences between experimental conditions for each dependent variable. RESULTS: No statistical difference was found in VJ performance between conditions (CON: 1530. 4 ± 450. 7 N, SS: 1537. 5 ± 489. 4 N, FR: 1524. 5 ± 467. 8 N; p = 0. 830). For the right leg ROM measurements, there was no statistical difference between conditions (CON: 59. 5 ± 7. 8 o, SS: 60. 7 ± 8. 7 o, FR: 59. 9 ± 9. 4 o; p = 0. 748). However, for left leg ROM measurements there was a statistical difference between CON, SS and FR (CON: 57. 6 ± 9. 3 o SS: 62. 2 ± 8. 3 o, FR: 62. 6 ± 8. 0 o; p = 0. 013). CONCLUSIONS: Under the present research conditions, an acute session of SS or FR elicited no significant changes in VJ force output compared to CON. For the left ankle, FR and SS increased ROM compared to CON; however, this result was not observed bilaterally as in previous research. One possible explanation for the ROM differences between ankles was that left leg dominance of participants may have increased tightness of the muscle-tendon unit. Such tightness may have increased the susceptibility for change in left ankle ROM in response to FR and SS sessions. Future research should utilize larger samples, varied intervention times, and multiple sessions for further investigation of SS versus FR effects on joint ROM and athletic performance...|$|R
