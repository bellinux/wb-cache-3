40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds on the antioxidative defense system and oxidative stress in rats fed a high fat · high cholesterol diet. Rats were divided into four experimental groups which were composed of high fat · high cholesterol diet group (HF), high fat · high cholesterol diet with 0. 1 % ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented group (HEA), high fat · high cholesterol diet with 0. 2 % ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented group (HEB) and high fat·high cholesterol diet with 0. 5 % ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented group (HEC). Supplementation of ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds groups (HEA, HEB and HEC) resulted in significantly increased activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and catalase. Hepatic superoxide radical contents in microsome and mitochondria were significantly reduced in the groups supplemented with <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds ethanol extracts. Hepatic hydrogen peroxide content in the mitochondria was reduced in ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented groups.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds powder on lipid metabolism in rats fed high fatㆍhigh cholesterol diet.

Each diet was fed to three replicate batteries of hens with each battery consisting of a row of five cages of hens with two hens per cage (n = 3). In Exp. 2, 180, thirty-wk old, Hyline Brown laying hens, housed similarly to those in Exp. 1, were fed an unsupplemented basal diet as well as treatments in which the basal diet was supplemented with 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed in a laboratory blender to an average particle size of 300 μm, 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed as a super fine powder with a vibrational mill (44 μm) and finally 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed as a super fine powder with a vibrational mill but mixed with 5 % Na 2 CO 3 either before or after grinding. A diet supplemented with 0. 3 ppm carophyll red pigment was also included (n = 3). In both experiments, hens were fed the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder or pigment for 14 days. After feeding of the powder or pigment was terminated, all hens were fed the basal diet for eight more days to determine if the dietary treatments had any residual effects. In Exp. 1, there were no differences in egg-laying performance, feed consumption or feed conversion ratio due to inclusion of <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> pigment in the diet. Average egg weight was higher (p 0. 05). However, compared with the control group, supplementation with all of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder treatments increased egg weight (p< 0. 05). All the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder treatments also increased (p< 0. 05) the yolk color score compared with the control.
