50|$|In 2004, the {{institute}} achieved the milestone {{to be reckoned}} as the Post-graduate institute with introduction of MD/MS courses in five specialised disciplines like Anatomy, Physiology, Community Medicine, Pathology and Anesthesiology, which were recognized by the Medical Council of India in 2007. Since then more postgraduate courses were added {{in the fields of}} Forensic Medicine & Toxicology, General Medicine, Surgery, Gynae & Obstetrics, Orthopaedics, Paediatrics, Ophthalmology and ENT Diseases. Postgraduate seats in the fields of <b>Radiodiagnosis</b> (already sanctioned), Psychiatry, Microbiology, Biochemistry (in process) will be added in near future.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, the {{department}} of Medicine attained the requisite number of teachers and services {{to the extent that}} it was upgraded to train postgraduates in medicine, leading to the M.D degree. Specialties in Gastroenterology, Cardiology and Medical Oncology were started 1966 - 1987. Further specialties such as Neurology, Nephrology and Haematology were added until 1993. Presently the institute offers MD & MS degrees in Pediatrics, Dermatology, Pharmacology, Pathology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Community Medicine, Physiology, Anatomy, Medicine, <b>Radiodiagnosis,</b> Radiotherapy, General Surgery, Orthopedics, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Otorhinolaryngology, ophthalmology etc. The institute offers several post graduate diplomas also.|$|E
5000|$|Abreu's first {{landmark}} {{contribution to}} the radiography of soft tissues (until then not much utilized as a diagnostic radiographical method, due to the low definition of images) was to develop an x-ray densitometry method, by comparing the degree of white density of biological tissues to water's and to other highly dense references, such as bones, and to point out its value for <b>radiodiagnosis.</b> In 1921 he first published his pioneering work on the radiological interpretation of pulmonary injuries in pleuropulmonary tuberculosis, titled [...] "Le Radiodiagnostic dans la Tuberculose Pleuro-Pulmonaire". This and his method of pulmonary densitometry gave him an invitation to join the prestigious Académie de Médicine de Paris.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of the hospital started in 1927 and in that same year, the hospital {{was able to take}} care of 30 people. An operating room, a pharmacy and a washhouse were added in 1928. In 1932, a room for <b>radiodiagnosis</b> was added. During World War II, in 1941, the hospital was extended with another hall that could fit 30 patients, as well as a delivery room. A maternity department was added in 1952 and in 1957, an internal medicine department was added. Finally, the hospital was extended with a pediatrics department. After these works, however, renovations and more specialised medical departments were needed in the hospital.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the College was an {{awarding}} body for academic awards {{but no longer}} fulfils this function. The degree-equivalent radiography qualification awarded by the CoR was the Diploma of the College of Radiographers (DCR) and this was awarded following a three-year training course and successful completion of a national examination, either in <b>Radiodiagnosis</b> (the DCR(R)) or in Therapy Radiography (the DCR(T)). Following study equivalent to Masters level, students with a DCR could proceed by examination to the Higher Diploma of the College of Radiographers (HDCR). Holders of the HDCR undergoing specialist training in management were awarded the Management Diploma of the College of Radiographers (MDCR) and those undergoing specialist training {{in the teaching of}} radiography were awarded the Teaching Diploma of the College of Radiographers (TDCR). The first Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Radiography was validated in 1989 and with the widespread introduction of BSc courses in radiography during 1993, the DCR was phased out. The HRCR, TDCR and MDCR have been replaced by postgraduate level courses.|$|E

40|$|Precise {{determination}} of malignant process generalization and {{the assessment of}} the response on therapy in patients with malignant lymphomas are of primary importance. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with 18 F-FDG due to its unique possibility to detect living tumour cells regardless of the malignancy size is widely used to determine the disease stage, to plan treatment policy, to assess the treatment effectiveness, to reveal relapses, to follow up and make prognoses in patients with Hodgkin’s non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Detection of marrow failures and visceral involvement in patients with malignant lymphomas is also an advantage of PET compared to other <b>radiodiagnosis</b> techniques. The method has a dominant role in early assessment of the response on chemotherapy that enables to predict a long-term result of the treatment and if necessary, to change the management. In contrast to structural methods of <b>radiodiagnosis,</b> PET with 18 F-FDG can differentiate fibrous tissue, its metabolism level being very low, from tumour tissue with high metabolic level, with high accuracy.

40|$|Abstract- The aim of {{this study}} was to review the {{appearance}} of normal patterns of left coronary artery, its anatomic variants and anomalies and to assess their incidence in subjects of North India who underwent 64 -slice Computed Tomographic Coronary Angiography (CT-CA) for suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD). This study was carried out in the Departments of Anatomy and <b>Radiodiagnosis,</b> KGMU, U. P, Lucknow, India. Fifty CT Coronary Angiograms of routine subjects of either sex and of different age groups coming to the department of <b>Radiodiagnosis</b> were evaluated prospectively to see the normal and variant anatomy of Left Coronary Artery (LCA) regarding its origin, length of main trunk and branching pattern. In all the cases LCA arose either below the Sinotubular (ST) junction from Left Posterior Aortic Sinus (LPAS) or from ST junction except one which demonstrated a high take off from tubular part of ascending aorta. The LCA had a mean length of 7. 11 ± 3. 04 mm. The two main branches of LCA are Left Circumflex (LCX) artery and Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery. This study revealed that the main trunk of LCA bifurcated into LCX artery and LAD artery in 38 (76 %) subjects. The artery was seen to be trifurcating in 12 (24 %) cases with the Ramus Intermedius (RI) being the third artery. Left coronary artery is one of the feeding arteries of the heart, so a detailed knowledge of its anatomy is very important. High takeoff of LCA may cause difficulty in cannulation during coronary arteriography. Its trifurcation can cause technical problem...|$|E
40|$|A twenty-year-old second gravida {{presented}} {{to the department of}} <b>radiodiagnosis</b> for routine obstetric ultrasound examination. Ultrasonography revealed a live fetus of 17 weeks with absent falx, fused thalami, monoventricle, proboscis, and cyclopia. Fetal MRI was performed and the findings were confirmed. Even though ultrasonography is diagnostic in the detection of fetal anomalies, MRI plays a vital role due to its multiplanar capability and excellent soft tissue resolution. The importance of presenting this classical case of alobar holoprosencephaly is to sensitize the clinicians and radiologists to the imaging manifestations of holoprosencephaly and to stress the importance of early diagnosis. If diagnosed in utero at an early stage of pregnancy, termination can be performed and maternal psychological trauma of bearing a deformed fetus can be avoided...|$|E
