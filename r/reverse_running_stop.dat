50|$|Backward running, {{also known}} as {{backwards}} <b>running,</b> <b>running</b> backwards, <b>reverse</b> <b>running,</b> retro running, or retro locomotion is the act of <b>running</b> in <b>reverse,</b> so that one travels in the direction one's back is facing rather than one's front. It is classed as a retro movement, the reverse of any normal movement.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were also}} known as Wynberg Tenders. They were also designed with <b>reverse</b> <b>running</b> in mind, with a weatherboard mounted on the six-wheeled tender’s front to protect the crew from the elements when running tender first.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} specifically {{for use on}} the Natal South Coast and the Richmond branch, where <b>reverse</b> <b>running</b> was required due {{to the absence of}} turning facilities such as turntables or triangles. In SAR service, the Class E was mainly used for shunting work.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Reverse</b> <b>running</b> {{centrifugal}} pumps are an effective source {{of reducing the}} equipment cost in small hydropower plants. The manufacturers do not provide any information on the performance and flow characteristics when pumps are oper-ated in turbine mode. Lack of Pump as Turbine (PAT) performance data is a significant barrier to the wider use of PAT. Ap-plication of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a recent attempt for predicting the performance of PAT. CFD analysis is an effective design tool for predicting the performance of <b>reverse</b> <b>running</b> operation of {{centrifugal pumps}}. But some deviations still exist in experimental and CFD results of reverse operation of pumps. Future works {{in the field of}} computational analysis can further improve the prediction of pumps in reverse operation...|$|R

Redflex also has technology {{used to help}} prevent right angle crashes by red light runners.|$|R
50|$|By {{means of}} the {{application}} of a pressure exchange system, which is already used in other domains, a considerably higher efficiency of energy recovery of reverse osmosis systems may be achieved than with the use of <b>reverse</b> <b>running</b> pumps or turbines.The pressure exchange system is suited, above all, for bigger plants i.e. approx. ≥ 2000 m3/d permeate production.|$|R
5000|$|Infractions {{were created}} in 1968, {{originally}} only including parking violations, but was gradually broadened to include <b>running</b> <b>stop</b> lights and eventually most common traffic offenses.

They were given the same boiler as the Class 50s which were developed in parallel and, like them, the newly developed 2'2' T 26 tender with its front wall that protected train crews during <b>reverse</b> <b>running.</b>|$|R

50|$|Athletes first learn basic {{movement}} patterns such as <b>running,</b> <b>stopping,</b> jumping and throwing. Coaches help athletes refine these movements into sport specific skills. A skill {{such as high}} jumping can then be refined into a competitive technique like the Western roll or the Fosbury Flop. An individual’s expression of a technique is often called a style; while various competitive swimming strokes are also called styles. Team sports often develop and practice plays or strategies where players carry out specific tasks to coordinate a team effort of attack or defense.|$|R
