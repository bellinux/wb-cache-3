5|$|Using RAF aerial photographs, Crawford {{determined}} {{the length of}} the Avenue at Stonehenge before embarking on an excavation of the site with A. D. Passmore in late 1923. This project attracted press attention, resulting in Crawford being contacted by the marmalade magnate and archaeologist Alexander Keiller. Keiller invited Crawford to join him in an aerial survey, financed by Keiller himself, in which they flew over Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, Somerset, and Wiltshire in 1924, taking photographs of archaeological traces in the landscape. Many of these images were published in Crawford and Keiller's Wessex from the Air in 1928. In 1927 Crawford and Keiller helped raise the finances to buy the land around Stonehenge and present it to The National Trust to prevent it from being damaged by further agricultural or urban development. Previously, in 1923, Crawford had assisted Keiller in campaigning to prevent a <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> being erected on the archaeologically significant Windmill Hill in Wiltshire, with Keiller later purchasing the hill and the surrounding Avebury area. Despite this working relationship, the two never became friends, perhaps a result of their highly divergent opinions and interests outside of archaeology.|$|E

Apart from the masts and their supporting cables, {{the roof of}} the building is flat with no crown.|$|R
25|$|Other {{structural}} changes included flush riveting for the fuselage, introduced in mid-1943. A streamlined round rear-view mirror, with a bullet-shaped fairing replaced the rectangular version. On new production Mk IXs the small, teardrop shaped identification light behind the <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> was removed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>mast</b> {{radiators}} may be {{insulated from}} the ground by a gap at the base. When lightning hits the mast, it jumps this gap. A small inductivity in the feed line between the mast and the tuning unit (usually one winding) limits the voltage increase, protecting the transmitter from dangerously high voltages.|$|E
25|$|Edwin Howard Armstrong, {{a network}} radio pioneer who invented FM radio, used West Peak as the {{location}} {{of one of the}} first FM radio broadcasts, in 1939. His original 70-foot (21 m) <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> still stands on the peak. Currently, West Peak is home to seven FM broadcast stations, WPKT, WWYZ, WKSS, WDRC-FM, WZMX, WHCN and WMRQ-FM.|$|E

25|$|A hut near Cregneash: The {{eventual}} home of Dan {{during his}} exile. This {{is identified as}} being near the Chasms, overlooking the sea near the cliffs, and backing onto a hill, {{from the top of}} which Cregneash can be seen. This hill is almost certainly to be identified with that where a <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> stands today.|$|E
25|$|Overhead {{transmission}} lines form a catenary for which vibration is predominately in the vertical plane. When {{more than one}} plane of vibration is anticipated, Stockbridge dampers may be mounted {{at right angles to}} each other. This is common when the cable runs in a vertical or off-horizontal plane, for example in cable-stayed bridges or <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> guy-wires.|$|E
25|$|The {{control tower}} {{was located in}} a cabin which was placed on a hill shelf {{overlooking}} the quay at Hjellestad. A <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> was erected at Sandkleivane and a windsock installed don Kuholmen. Non-directional beacons were installed at Espeland and Bjelkarøy. Ship traffic near Hjellestad had to be alerted in case of incoming flights; this was announced through the hoisting of a black and yellow ball on the flag pole at the control tower.|$|E

25|$|A planned opening date of 1 April 1966 {{had to be}} {{abandoned}} when the station's vessel, Oceaan 7, shed its <b>radio</b> <b>mast.</b> However, the station finally opened in June, broadcasting on 1115 kilohertz, 269 metres, in the medium wave. This wavelength was used by some existing radio stations in southern and eastern Europe but these were too far away for Radio 270 to cause them any trouble. However, the frequency was close to Radio London on 1133kHz, resulting in the potential for mutual interference on radios with less precise tuning.|$|E
25|$|The {{only time}} post members had been mobilised and volunteers spent nearly ten days {{underground}} {{was during the}} Cuban Missile Crisis as the government prepared the country for potential outbreak of war. The Lisvane nuclear bunker was abandoned by the ROC in 1991 when the Corps itself was disbanded {{with the end of}} the Cold War and as a result of recommendations in the governments Options for Change review of UK defence. The Lisvane nuclear bunker still exists but it was purchased by a mobile phone communications company who built a <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> inside the fenced compound and sited some of their equipment in the underground facility.|$|E
25|$|The Geophysical Institute of Tromsø {{established}} a geophysical station at Kvadehuken in 1920, {{consisting of a}} small hut and a <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> allowing communication via Ny-Ålesund. It carried out meteorological surveys and geomagnetic field measurements and was manned by four men. Two of these died in February 1922 while attempting to rescue a trapper. The station was closed in 1924 {{due to lack of}} funding. The Church of Norway never {{established a}} presence in Ny-Ålesund, although the minister at Svalbard Church in Longyearbyen visited Ny-Ålesund irregularly. Most of the children in town were below school age. However, during the 1920–21 winter there were 23 children in town and an improvised school was taken into use for the year.|$|E

The studios on the top floor broadcast WSB-AM from 1925 until 1956. The large <b>radio</b> <b>masts</b> supported the transmitting antenna of WSB-AM from 1925 to 1929, when output power was increased to 5,000 watts, and a suburban transmitter site was built in East Lake.|$|R

25|$|This section through Inglewood Forest {{essentially}} {{follows a}} parallel {{path to the}} M6, and passes through Plumpton where it meets the B6413; an old Roman fort called Voreda at Castlesteads; High Hesket which it bypasses; Low Hesket; enters the district of Carlisle near Cotehill; and meets the M6 (and the B6263) eventually at junction 42: {{the start of the}} Carlisle bypass. Entering Carlisle, it crosses the River Petteril (near a large <b>radio</b> <b>mast)</b> then the Tyne Valley railway line. The A6 travels through south-eastern Carlisle as London Road, before finishing at Botchergate in the centre of Carlisle where it transforms seamlessly into the A7 which runs out of Carlisle and across the Anglo-Scottish border terminating eventually at Scotland's capital city of Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|A major IRA {{attack in}} County Tyrone {{took place on}} 20 August 1988, barely a year after Loughall, which ended {{in the deaths of}} eight {{soldiers}} when a British Army bus was bombed at Curr Road, near Ballygawley. The soldiers were being transported from RAF Aldergrove to a military base near Omagh after returning from leave in England. This attack forced the British military to ferry their troops to and from East Tyrone by helicopter. On 30 August 1988, an SAS ambush killed IRA members Gerard Harte, Martin Harte and Brian Mullin as they tried to kill an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment member near Carrickmore. British intelligence identified them as the perpetrators of the attack on the military bus at Curr Road. On 16 September 1989, a British sergeant of the Royal Corps of Signals (Kevin Froggett) was shot and killed by an IRA sniper while he was repairing a <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> at Coalisland Army/RUC base.|$|E
25|$|Knickebein was {{in general}} use but the X-Gerät (X apparatus) was {{reserved}} for specially-trained pathfinder crews. X-Gerät receivers were mounted in He 111s, with a <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> on the fuselage. The system worked on 66–77MHz, a higher frequency than Knickebein. Ground transmitters sent pulses {{at a rate of}} 180 per minute. X-Gerät received and analysed the pulses, giving the pilot visual and aural directions. Three cross-beams intersected the beam along which the He 111 was flying. The first cross-beam alerted the bomb-aimer, who activated a bombing clock when the second cross-beam was reached. When the third cross-beam was reached the bomb aimer activated a third trigger, which stopped the first hand of the clock, with the second hand continuing. When the second hand re-aligned with the first, the bombs were released. The clock mechanism was co-ordinated with the distances of the intersecting beams from the target so the target was directly below when the bombs were released.|$|E

25|$|Essentially {{similar to}} the P-47B, the initial P-47C {{featured}} strengthened all-metal control surfaces, an upgraded GE turbosupercharger regulator, and a short vertical <b>radio</b> <b>mast.</b> After the initial manufacture of a block of 57 P-47Cs, production moved to the P-47C-1, which had an 8in (20cm) fuselage extension forward of the cockpit at the firewall to correct center of gravity problems, ease engine maintenance and allow installation of a new engine mount. There {{were a number of}} other changes, such as revised exhausts for the oil coolers, and fixes to brakes, undercarriage and electrical systems, as well as a redesigned rudder and elevator balance. The 55 P-47C-1s were followed by 128 P-47C-2s which introduced a centerline hardpoint with under-fuselage shackles for either a 500lb (227kg) bomb or a 200U.S. gal (758l, 167Imp gal) fuel tank that conformed to the underside of the fuselage. The main production P-47C sub-variant was the P-47C-5 which introduced a new whip antenna. With the use of pressurized drop tanks, the P-47C was able to extend its range on missions beginning 30 July 1943.|$|E
25|$|The Wehrmacht {{therefore}} {{decided the}} following day that it would use the iced up lake of Jonsvatnet as a temporary air station, located between Valset and Malmannøya. The ice was still thick on the lake, about one meter (three feet), giving sufficient support for the Luftwaffe to land heavy bombers at Jonsvatnet. On 11 April 18 Junkers Ju 52 aircraft from landed. A defensive installation was established and later Junkers Ju 88A-1 and Heinkel He 111H aircraft from Kampfgeschwader 26 and Kampfgeschwader 30 landed. These were also operating out of Sola Air Station. Jonsvatnet was among other tasks set to refuel aircraft which were used for bombing targets further north. British and French troops landed in the Namsos area on 14 April, causing an increase in German air activity. On 15 April some of the Ju 88s participated on the bombing of a <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> in the Namsos Campaign. The following day the Royal Air Force's No. 77 Squadron conducted reconnaissance of Jonsvatnet with their Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys. That day the airport was also used to refuel He 111s returning from the Battle of Narvik. Jonsvatnet is further reinforced with five Junkers Ju 87s from Stukageschwader 1.|$|E
500|$|Two Type 94 high-angle fire-control {{director}}s, one on {{each side}} of the ship, were fitted to control the Type 89 guns. Each director mounted a [...] rangefinder. Six Type 95 directors controlled the 25mm guns and the rocket launchers. Early warning was provided by two Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radars. One of these was mounted on the top of the island while the other retracted into the port side of the flight deck, between the two elevators. In addition, Amagi had two smaller Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 air search radars, one mounted on the tripod mast on the island and the other on the aft starboard retractable <b>radio</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E
