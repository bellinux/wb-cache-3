5|$|In {{the space}} of only a generation, public {{education}} had left behind a highly regimented and politicized system dedicated to training children in the basic skills of literacy and the special discipline required of urban citizens, and had <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> largely apolitical, more highly organized and efficient structure specifically designed to teach students the many specialized skills demanded in a modern, industrial society.

5|$|The Old Court – New Court {{controversy}} was a 19th-century political {{controversy in}} the U.S. state of Kentucky in which the Kentucky General Assembly abolished the Kentucky Court of Appeals and <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new court. The justices of the old court refused to recognize the action as valid, and for a time, two separate courts operated as the court of last resort for the state.|$|E
5|$|Domitian firmly {{believed}} in the traditional Roman religion, and personally {{saw to it that}} ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter, perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small chapel dedicated to Jupiter Conservator was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more expansive building, dedicated to Jupiter Custos.|$|E

In 1962, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs poured an {{elevated}} cement pad around the 1931 brass marker; this pad included the state border lines and names in tile. The monument was completely rebuilt in 1992, and the 1931 brass marker {{was replaced with}} a disc shaped aluminum-bronze plate set in granite. The monument was again rebuilt in 2010, although the disc shaped plate from 1992 remained in place.|$|E
5|$|The Finsta Chapel or St Eric's Chapel on the north-west {{corner of}} the chancel houses the relics of Eric the Holy, {{the patron saint of}} Sweden, who was killed in 1160 on the site where Uppsala Cathedral was later built. His shrine was moved from the first cathedral in Gamla Uppsala as soon as work began on the new building. In 1580, King John III melted his shrine down but <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new {{gold-plated}} one which still contains Eric's relics and crown. The name Finsta originates from the Uppland estate where Judge Birger Persson and his wife were born. They were entombed in the chapel in 1328. A relic of their daughter Saint Bridget housed in a small gold-plated shrine was donated by the Saint Bridget Order in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The most {{politically}} charged issue in Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, was the Old Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire financial straits. Legislators sought to relieve {{some of the}} financial burden by passing a law of replevin which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court and <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as valid, and a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split along party lines, with Democrats generally favoring the New Court and Whigs favoring the Old Court.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Vénus de Quinipily are uncertain, but it is {{believed}} to have been sculpted around 49 BC. It was originally erected at the site of a former Roman camp in Castennec in Bieuzy-les-Eaux, a commune in the Morbihan department in Brittany in northwestern France. Various {{origins of the}} statue have been proposed, including Greek, Roman or Egyptian; a Celtic deity, the Roman Mother goddess Cybele, or an Egyptian Isis statue. It has also been proposed that the statue did not survive its restoration in 1696 by Pierre de Lannion, the Lord of Blavet Quinipily, and that he secretly <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new one. According to the French archaeologist Monsieur de Penhouët, the statue was built by Moorish soldiers in the Roman army.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s {{a series}} of new palaces were {{constructed}} elsewhere for the king's use; these included the more modern Dusit Palace, constructed in 1903, and Phaya Thai Palace in 1909. These other Bangkok residences began to replace the Grand Palace as the primary place of residence of the monarch and his court. By 1925 this gradual {{move out of the}} palace was complete. The growth and centralization of the Siamese state also meant that the various government ministries have grown in size and were finally moved out of the Grand Palace to their own premises. Despite this the Grand Palace remained the official and ceremonial place of residence as well as the stage set for elaborate ancient ceremonies of the monarchy. The end of the absolute monarchy came in 1932, when a revolution overthrew the ancient system of government and <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E

5|$|The {{problems}} with seating the second RSU set the spacewalkers {{back in the}} timeline by approximately two hours, but after Altman asked Massimino and Good how they felt, they replied they were doing well and felt fine to continue. Flight controllers on the ground evaluated the consumables for the two spacesuits, and decided that if Massimino recharged his suit's oxygen in the airlock, the pair could safely continue with the battery installation. After moving to the battery unit site, Good and Massimino removed {{one of the original}} battery modules from Bay 2 of the telescope, and <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new unit. The batteries provide power to the telescope when it passes into the Earth's shadow and its solar arrays are not exposed to the sun. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:45 UTC, for a time of seven hours, fifty-six minutes. It was the twentieth spacewalk to service Hubble, bringing the total time in EVA servicing the telescope to one hundred forty-four hours and twenty-six minutes.|$|E
5|$|Ubico {{had made}} {{statements}} supporting {{the labor movement}} when campaigning for the presidency, but after his election his policy quickly became authoritarian. He abolished the system of debt peonage, and <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure like roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property, an action described by historians as legalizing murder. He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it {{into one of the}} most efficient and ruthless in Latin America. The police were given greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. The result of these laws was to create tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly contemptuous of the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys.|$|E
5|$|Waters' primary {{instrument}} in Pink Floyd was the electric bass guitar. He briefly played a Höfner bass but <b>replaced</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Rickenbacker RM-1999/4001S, until 1970 {{when it was}} stolen {{along with the rest}} of the band's equipment in New Orleans. He began using Fender Precision Basses in 1968, originally alongside the Rickenbacker 4001, and then exclusively after the Rickenbacker was lost in 1970. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972 when it became his main stage guitar and as of 2 October 2010, the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model. Waters endorses RotoSound Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings. Throughout his career he has used Selmer, WEM, Hiwatt and Ashdown amplifiers but has used Ampeg for the last few tours, also employing delay, tremolo, chorus, stereo panning and phaser effects in his bass playing.|$|E
