5|$|The {{defendants}} {{appealed to}} the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On December 23, 1973, Judge Levin H. Campbell, for the unanimous panel, affirmed. Because the trust <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> found, the First Circuit did not reach the third issue.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazis {{seized power}} {{the family moved}} first to Möhlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to Lake Tegern, where they bought a house. Himmler also later {{obtained}} a large house in the Berlin suburb of Dahlem, free of charge, as an official residence. The couple saw little of each other as Himmler became totally absorbed by work. The <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> strained. The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the Heydrich home. Margarete saw it as her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for afternoon coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons.|$|E
5|$|Around 1898 Holden began {{living with}} Margaret Steadman (née Macdonald, 1865–1954), {{a nurse and}} midwife. They were {{introduced}} by Holden's older sister, Alice, and became friends through their common interest in Whitman. Steadman had separated from her husband James Steadman, a university tutor, because of his alcoholism and abuse. Steadman {{and her husband were}} never divorced and, though she and Holden lived as a married couple and Holden referred to her as his wife, the <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> never formalised, even after James Steadman's death in 1930.|$|E
40|$|Establishing {{supplier}} <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> {{becoming more}} important than ever, but maintaining effective <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> increasingly difficult due to the pressures on business-to-business relations. In Japan, business-to-business <b>relationships</b> have <b>been</b> quite stable and close in the hotel sector. Following the imperatives of global competition, however, {{the changing nature of}} hotel-supplier <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> observed. This paper examines how hotel-supplier relations are established traditionally and how they are changing in the context of Japanese culture...|$|R
50|$|Good's own price: The basic demand <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> between {{potential}} {{prices of}} a good and the quantities that would be purchased at those prices. Generally the <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> negative meaning that an increase in price will induce {{a decrease in the}} quantity demanded. This negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> embodied in the downward slope of the consumer demand curve. The assumption of a negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> reasonable and intuitive. If the price of a new novel is high, a person might decide to borrow the book from the public library rather than buy it.|$|R
50|$|Kindred <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> often {{similar to}} mirror <b>relationships</b> where ideas <b>are</b> communicated through drawn out dialog.

5|$|Carson {{first met}} Dorothy Freeman in the Summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine. Freeman {{had written to}} Carson {{welcoming}} her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It {{was the beginning of}} an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book Always, Rachel, published in 1995 by Beacon Press.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor and her {{daughter}} Anna became estranged after she took over some of her mother's social duties at the White House. The <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> further strained because Eleanor desperately wanted {{to go with her}} husband to Yalta in February 1945 (two months before FDR's death), but he took Anna instead. A few years later, the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. Anna took care of her mother when she was terminally ill in 1962.|$|E

30|$|A {{negative}} <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> expected {{between the}} economies of non-debt taxes and the debt ratio. This <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> verified by several empirical studies such as those developed by: Titman and Wessels (1988), Ozkan (2001), Chen (2004) and N. Delcoure (2006). Several investments have led to savings of taxes and savings generated by debtedness. A negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> expected between this variable and the levels of indebtedness.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{on arrival}} in Port Jackson Baker {{also took a}} common-law wife from among the convicts – 25-year-old Susannah Huffnell, who had been sentenced to seven years {{transportation}} for petty larceny. Their only child, Elizabeth, was born on 1 January 1789. The <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> not a happy one and Baker refused to accompany {{his wife and child}} when they were transferred to the remote colonial outpost of Norfolk Island in March 1790. Susannah and Elizabeth had no further contact with Baker, even after they returned to Sydney in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{while playing}} Lord Byron in the Spanish {{production}} Remando Al Viento (1988), Grant met actress Elizabeth Hurley, who {{was cast in}} a supporting role as Byron's former lover Claire Clairmont.

5|$|In 2013, Finnessey {{became a}} {{contestant}} on Ready for Love where she competed {{for the attention}} of Ernesto Arguello. She won Arguello's heart on the show, but the <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> short-lived in real life. Later that year, she posed nude for a PETA anti-fur campaign opposing the distribution of fur coats as prizes during beauty pageants. On September 24, 2014, Finnessey announced on Twitter that she became engaged to businessman Ben Higgins. They were married on July 11, 2015, according to another autobiographical tweet. Finnessey announced the June 10, 2016 home birth of her son Finn Arthur Higgins via Instagram.|$|E
30|$|The {{possible}} {{types of}} software concern <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> {{represented by the}} “Contribution,” “Dependency,” and “Composition” concepts (sub-concepts of “Relationship”). The classes that represent these concepts were stereotyped with «Relator». In OntoUML, “Relators” are mediator elements, i.e., elements that mediate the relationship among other ones, making it real. In Fig.  1, {{it is possible to}} notice a relationship, called “isRelatedTo,” stereotyped with «Material». “Material” <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> applied to relations that depend on a mediator element to exist. For example, the “married to” <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> only valid while a “marriage” (relator) exists. In the same way, the “isRelatedTo” <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> only valid while a “Relationship” (relator) between two concerns exists.|$|R
50|$|The <b>relationship</b> can <b>be</b> {{analyzed}} through techniques {{developed for}} the analysis of interpersonal ties. The form of the <b>relationship</b> may <b>be</b> explicit (or implicit) and internal (or external) to an institution in both perception and reality. The disposition of the <b>relationship</b> can <b>be</b> qualified as positive, neutral or negative. The strength of the <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> quantifiable through a relative percentage from 0% (weak) to 100% (strong) and a degree of separation (for example, 1 degree of separation means the trust <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> direct, see Six degrees of separation).|$|R

The 2009–2010 budget appears to indicate however that this consolidation has not taken place.|$|E
5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that {{the feeling of being}} an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E

Despite this opposition, the two married in Berlin on August 28, 1928; seven years elapsed before Margarete Speer was invited to stay at her in-laws' home.|$|E
50|$|According to {{cognitive}} dissonance theory, {{there are three}} types of cognitive relationships: consonant relationships, dissonant relationships, and irrelevant <b>relationships.</b> Consonant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements, such as your beliefs and actions, are in equilibrium with each other or coincide. Dissonant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements are not in equilibrium and cause dissonance. Irrelevant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements do not possess a meaningful relationship with one another, they are unrelated and do not cause dissonance.|$|R
