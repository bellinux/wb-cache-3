40|$|Background: The {{cholesterol-lowering}} {{abilities of}} rice bran’s fiber and oil {{apart from its}} fatty acid composition remain unclear. Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to assess the effects of defatted rice bran and <b>rice</b> bran <b>oil</b> in an average American diet on blood lipids in moderately hypercholesterolemic persons. Design: Study 1 used a parallel-arm design. Twenty-six healthy volunteers consumed a diet with 13 – 22 g dietary fiber/d for 3 wk, and then 13 of the volunteers were switched to a diet with defatted rice bran to double the fiber intake for 5 wk. Study 2 was a randomized, crossover, 10 -wk feeding study performed in 14 volunteers who consumed a diet with <b>rice</b> bran <b>oil</b> (1 / 3 of the total dietary fat) substituted for an oil blend that had a fatty acid composition similar to that of the <b>rice</b> bran <b>oil.</b> Serum lipids and factor VII were measured in both studies. Results: Defatted rice bran did not lower lipid concentrations. In study 2, total cholesterol was significantly lower with consumption of the diet containing <b>rice</b> bran <b>oil</b> than with consumption of the control diet. Moreover, with consumption of the <b>rice</b> bran <b>oil</b> diet, LDL cholesterol decreased by 7 % (P 0. 0004), whereas HDL cholesterol was unchanged. Conclusions: <b>Rice</b> bran <b>oil,</b> not fiber, lowers cholesterol in healthy, moderately hypercholesterolemic adults. There were no substantial differences in the fatty acid composition of the diets; therefore, the reduction of cholesterol was due to other components present in the <b>rice</b> bran <b>oil,</b> such as unsaponifiable compounds.
