5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, players are given an introductory level and boss to overcome. Afterward, they are given access to eight different stages, each representing one of the above-mentioned <b>Robot</b> Masters. At the end of each stage, players must battle a <b>Robot</b> Master. When a <b>Robot</b> Master is destroyed, it will give Mega Man its respective weapon, which can be used against other <b>Robot</b> Masters or enemies but has limited ammunition. If Mega Man defeats the <b>Robot</b> Master using his primary weapon, the <b>Robot</b> Master will be captured and reprogrammed. This allows players to play through stages as one of the <b>Robot</b> Masters.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile <b>robot</b> is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} <b>robot.</b> During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of <b>robot</b> checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E
5|$|In {{an outdoor}} environment, the <b>robot</b> {{is able to}} go to the {{inspection}} site by localizing through Global Positioning System (GPS) data. The GPS device developed by M3 Systems allows geofencing. At the airport, the <b>robot</b> operates in dedicated navigation corridors respecting speed limits. Alerts are sent to the operator if the <b>robot</b> enters a prohibited area or exceeds a given speed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{introduce}} <b>robots</b> into education field appropriately, {{it is necessary}} to consider the children‘s perceptions of the <b>robots.</b> In this study, the researchers developed the questionnaire for exploring the children’s general impressions of the <b>robots,</b> the roles of the <b>robots</b> in the classroom and the ap-pearances of the <b>robots.</b> A hundred and sixty seven fifth-grade children took this questionnaire. The results show that most students have good impressions of the <b>robots</b> and positive attitude to see the <b>robots</b> in their classroom. Their responses also reveal that they might have over expectations of the <b>robots.</b> Besides, the results show that most of children like cartoon character-like <b>robots</b> and ani-mal-like <b>robots,</b> because the <b>robots</b> are very cute...|$|R
5|$|Razer is {{a combat}} <b>robot</b> that competes on the British {{television}} series <b>Robot</b> Wars. It was constructed by Simon Scott and Ian Lewis from Bournemouth; the team later {{expanded to include}} webmaster Vincent Blood. Razer was designed and constructed in 1998 {{to participate in the}} second series of <b>Robot</b> Wars, but subsequent modifications and improvements enabled it to remain competitive until its retirement after the second series of <b>Robot</b> Wars Extreme. Despite gaining a reputation for being unreliable, it was champion of the fifth series of <b>Robot</b> Wars, runner-up in the sixth, and won the first two <b>Robot</b> Wars World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Razer {{returned}} to {{action for the}} 2016 revival of <b>Robot</b> Wars, but was knocked {{out in the first}} round after toppling into the pit when pushing opposing <b>robot</b> Kill-E Crank-E in, immobilising both.|$|E
5|$|Team Razer was {{acknowledged}} {{for having}} devised and popularised the crushing and piercing arm weapon. Razer's success spawned {{a number of}} imitations: SuicidalTendencies, Ming3 and Tiberius are amongst the other heavyweight robots to have adopted such a weapon, whilst the featherweight <b>robot</b> Venom is a scaled-down replica of Razer. In 2001, Razer appeared in cartoon form on the front cover of the seventeenth issue of <b>Robot</b> Wars Magazine. It was {{also included in the}} <b>Robot</b> Wars video games. The version of Razer which competed in the fourth series of <b>Robot</b> Wars was used as the model for a pull-back toy powered by friction motors. This was sold alongside a model stunt ramp and barrels. A small metal toy based on Razer was available as part of the <b>Robot</b> Wars minibots range and, alongside Chaos 2 and Hypno-Disc, Razer was one of three competitor robots chosen to appear on a personalised DVD as part of the <b>Robot</b> Wars Ultimate Warrior Collection series.|$|E

40|$|The role of <b>robots</b> is {{to replace}} or assist humans in {{performing}} the {{tasks that are}} unsafe, repetitive and energy demanding. Almost every day the number of tasks performed by <b>robots</b> instead of humans, or in cooperation with humans increases. For this reason, increases {{the responsibility of the}} constructors of <b>robots,</b> as well as the whole community involved in the implementation of <b>robots</b> that are safe. To develop reliable and safe <b>robots,</b> one needs to include ergonomic knowledge, standards, and recommendations. We describe the significant problems related to the application of autonomous industrial <b>robots,</b> collaborative industrial <b>robots,</b> personal care <b>robots</b> and medical <b>robots.</b> The importance of the use of standards related to the safety of the types of <b>robots</b> mentioned above is pointed out.

5|$|The {{autonomous}} navigation of the Air-Cobot <b>robot</b> is in two phases. The first, navigation in {{the airport}} or the factory, allows the <b>robot</b> to move close to the aircraft. The second navigation, around the aircraft, allows the <b>robot</b> to position itself at control points referenced in the aircraft virtual model. In addition, the <b>robot</b> must insert itself in a dynamic environment where humans and vehicles are moving. To address this problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many navigation algorithms are constantly running on the <b>robot</b> with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on optimizing the computing time.|$|E

30|$|The social {{need for}} robotic {{technology}} is rapidly increasing {{to cope with}} the aging society in Japan. In particular, service <b>robots,</b> including life support <b>robots,</b> must coexist and collaborate with humans in a common space. New challenges arise from the coexistence of <b>robots</b> with humans that have never been considered for industrial <b>robots</b> because safety barriers usually separate them from humans. However, situations in which service <b>robots</b> work with humans could pose risks for humans and result in serious accidents. For example, collisions between humans and <b>robots,</b> <b>robots</b> falling, and mechanical and electrical malfunction of <b>robots</b> could occur. These problems must be addressed during innovation and social implementation to ensure that <b>robots</b> are safe and reliable [1].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} problem of having mobile <b>robots</b> in a multi-robot system {{maintain}} {{an estimate of the}} relative position and relative orientation of near-by <b>robots</b> in the environment. This problem is studied in the context of large swarms of simple <b>robots</b> which are capable of measuring only the distance to near-by <b>robots.</b> We describe and compare two approaches to distributed localization with different trade-offs between their computational complexity and their co-ordination requirements. The first algorithm does not require the <b>robots</b> to coordinate their motion. It relies on a non-linear least squares based strategy to allow <b>robots</b> to compute the relative pose of near-by <b>robots.</b> The second algorithm borrows tools from distributed computing theory to coordinate which <b>robots</b> must remain stationary and which <b>robots</b> are allowed to move. This coordination allows the <b>robots</b> to use standard trilateration techniques to compute the relative pose of near-by <b>robots.</b> Both algorithms are analyzed theoretically and validated through simu-lations. ...|$|R
