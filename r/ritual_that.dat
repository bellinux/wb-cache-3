5|$|Malcolm tells Adrienne about a <b>ritual</b> <b>that</b> can {{eradicate}} the demon. Harriet, fearing for her safety, decides {{to leave with}} Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic. The next day, Adrienne is attacked by Don, who is now completely insane and dressed like Carno. Adrienne scars Don's face with acid from his darkroom and then flees, discovering the corpses of Mike, Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion. Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the throne, but she distracts him long enough to free herself and trigger the swinging axe, which impales and kills Don. His death unleashes the demon, a huge and murderous monster that pursues Adrienne through the mansion. She escapes long enough to perform a <b>ritual</b> <b>that</b> traps the demon once again. The game ends with Adrienne {{walking out of the}} mansion with a vacant stare, almost catatonic.|$|E

The following paragraph is based on that description, it is not to be regarded as a static <b>ritual</b> <b>that</b> always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over a period of several centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E

5|$|Drakengard 2 {{takes place}} in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of Drakengard: {{originally}} said to take place after the game's first ending, it was later retconned so it took place in an isolated timeline following events similar to Drakengard. In the original game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, {{were engaged in a}} religious war over the Seals, magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a dragon who had made a pact (a magical <b>ritual</b> <b>that</b> linked their souls), and fought to try to keep both the Seals and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world. Eighteen years later, the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land.|$|E

5|$|Finding {{an account}} of a World War II-era Japanese {{military}} and Nazi scientific expedition to the island that sought a way to harness the storms as a weapon, Lara decides to explore a coastal tomb, where she finds {{the remains of a}} samurai general who committed seppuku. It is revealed in a message he left that he led the Queen's Stormguard, the Oni that defend the monastery, and that the Queen's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen's power. Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen, but rather a <b>ritual</b> <b>that</b> transfers the original Sun Queen's soul into a new body; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl's body each time she grew old. The last priestess' suicide had interrupted the ritual, and left the Queen's soul trapped in her old decaying body, and Himiko's spirit has wanted to escape that corpse ever since. Her rage is what's causing the storms on the island. As a descendant of Yamatai, Sam is a viable candidate, and Mathias plans to offer Sam as a new host in exchange for his freedom. Once the Sun Queen awakens in Sam's body, the storms will subside.|$|E
