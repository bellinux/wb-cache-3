40|$|Adsorption of benzene and {{cyclohexane}} {{on various}} Y-zeolites was investigated to develop sorbents for the purification of aliphatics by <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatics.</b> Ag-Y showed superior benzene/cyclohexane selectivities to Na-Y, Pd-Y, and H-USY. Separation factors greater than 10 5 were obtained with Ag-Y at low concentrations of benzene. High selectivities were {{achieved by the}} strong interaction between benzene and Ag-Y, while the interaction with cyclohexane was not influenced by the cations. Molecular orbital calculation revealed that benzene formed a classic Π-complexation bond with Ag-Y: donation of electron charges from the p-orbitals of benzene to the vacant s-orbital of the silver (Σ donation) and, simultaneously, back donation of electron charges from d-orbitals of silver to Π*-orbital of benzene (d–Π* back donation). Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were also performed for adsorption isotherms. Potential parameters of benzene on Ag-Y, including Π-complexation, were developed first.

30|$|New {{approaches}} for β-cyclodextrin-containing silicas synthesis were demonstrated. Materials with hexagonally ordered mesoporous structure were prepared by postsynthesis grafting and by co-condensation methods. β-Cyclodextrin activated by a N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole was employed for postsynthesis treatment of 3 -aminopropyl-modified MCM- 41 support {{as well as}} for sol-gel synthesis with β-cyclodextrin-containing organosilane and tetraethyl orthosilicate participation in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. The successful incorporation of cyclic oligosaccharide moieties in silica surface layer was verified by means of FT-IR spectroscopy and chemical analysis. Obtained β-cyclodextrin-containing materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and low-temperature adsorption-desorption of nitrogen. In spite of commensurable loading of β-cyclodextrin groups attained by both proposed approaches (up to 0.028  μmol[*]·[*]m– 2), it was found that co-condensation procedure provides uniform distribution of β-cyclodextrin functionalities in silica framework, whereas postsynthesis grafting results in modification of external surface of silica surface. Adsorption of benzene from aqueous solutions onto the surface of β-cyclodextrin-containing materials prepared by co-condensation method was studied as the function of time and equilibrium concentration. Langmuir and Freundlich models were used to evaluate adsorption processes and parameters. Adsorption experiments showed that β-cyclodextrin-containing silicas could be promising for the trace amount <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatics</b> from water.|$|E

40|$|Rivers carry {{large amounts}} of {{dissolved}} organic matter (DOM) to the oceans thereby connecting terrestrial and marine element cycles. Photo-degradation in conjunction with microbial turnover is considered a major pathway by which terrigenous DOM is decomposed. To reveal globally relevant patterns behind this process, we performed photo-degradation experiments and year-long bio-assays on DOM from ten of the largest world rivers that collectively {{account for more than}} one-third of the fresh water discharge to the global ocean. We furthermore tested the hypothesis that the terrigenous component in deep ocean DOM may be far higher than biomarker studies suggest, because of the selective photochemical destruction of characteristic biomolecules from vascular plants. DOM was molecularly characterized by a combination of non-targeted ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and quantitative molecular tracer analyses. We show that the reactivity of DOM is globally related to broad catchment properties. Basins that are dominated by forest and grassland export more photo-degradable DOM than other rivers. Chromophoric compounds are mainly vascular plant-derived polyphenols, and partially carry a pyrogenic signature from vegetation fires. These forest and grassland dominated rivers lost up to 50 % of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during irradiation, and up to 85 % of DOC was lost in total if subsequently bio-incubated for one year. Basins covered by cropland, on the other hand, export DOM with a higher proportion of photo-resistant and bio-available DOM which is enriched in nitrogen. In these rivers, 30 % or less of DOC was photodegraded. Consistent with previous studies, we found that riverine DOM resembled marine DOM in its broad molecular composition after extensive degradation, mainly due to almost complete <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatics.</b> More detailed molecular fingerprinting analysis (based on the relative abundance of > 4000 DOM molecular formulae), however, revealed clear differences between degraded riverine and deep-sea DOM (molecular Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of ~ 50 %). None of our experimental treatments enhanced the molecular similarity between the rivers and the deep ocean. We conclude that terrigenous DOM retains a specific molecular signature during photo-degradation on much longer time scales than previously assumed and that substantial, thus far unknown, molecular transformations occur prior to downward convection into the deep oceanic basins...|$|E

The influence of the pH and H(2) O(2) concentration on the treatment process was evaluated by a full factorial design 2 (2) with three replicates of the central experiment.

40|$|Downstream {{mineralization}} and sedimentation {{of terrestrial}} {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) render lakes important for landscape carbon cycling in the boreal region. The chemical composition of terrestrial DOC, the downstream delivery of terrestrial DOC and its processing within aquatic ecosystem may all be influenced by climate change, including increased occurrence of wildfire. Here, we assessed composition and lability (during both dark- and UV incubations) of DOC from peatland groundwater and mineral soil groundwater, and from shallow lakes within a peatland-rich region on the Boreal Plains of western Canada that was recently affected by wildfire. Wildfire was found to increase aromaticity of DOC in peat pore water above the water table, but {{had no effect on}} the concentrations or composition of peatland groundwater DOC or mineral soil DOC. Using a mixing model we estimated that on average 98 and 78 % of terrestrial DOC inputs to the lakes in fine- and coarse-textured settings, respectively, originated from peatland groundwater sources. Accordingly, lake DOC composition reflected primarily a mixing of peatland and mineral soil groundwater sources, with no detectable influence of the recent wildfire. Lake and peatland DOC had low biodegradability, lower than that of mineral soil DOC. However, both mineralization and sedimentation of peatland DOC increased substantially during UV incubations through selective <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> humic and fulvic acids. Similar shifts in DOC composition as observed during the UV incubations were also observed across lakes with longer water residence times. The mixing model estimated that on average 54 % (95 % confidence interval: 36 – 64 %) of terrestrial DOC had been removed in lakes as a result of mineralization and sedimentation. Meanwhile, the reduction in absorbance at 254 nm was 71 % (58 – 76 %), which suggests selective <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> DOC. Hence, incubation results, patterns of DOC composition among lakes and mixing model results were consistent with significant within-lake <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> terrestrial DOC through UV-mediated processes. Selective <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> highly <b>aromatic</b> DOC through UV-mediated processes implies that organic sources that are considered stabile in terrestrial ecosystems can be readily mineralized once entering aquatic ecosystems. Together, our results suggest that regional characteristics (climate, surface geology and lake morphometry) can prevent wildfire from causing pulse perturbations to the linkages between terrestrial and aquatic C cycling and also regulate the processes that dominate within-lake <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> terrestrial DOC...|$|R

40|$|In {{this project}} the {{knowledge}} base for a new process for the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> substances from aqueous solutions with the macrocyclic ligand 'Cucurbituril' has been developed. 1. In the first step the aromatic hydrocarbons are separated from aqueous solutions with the macrocylic ligand cucurbituril. 2. Afterwards the charged ligand is regenerated by destroying the included hydrocarbons with ozone. The regenerated ligand can be reused to separate aromatic compounds from aqueous solutions. Cucurbituril is able to remove BTX-aromatics, chloro- and nitroaromatics, anilines and polynuclear aromatic compounds from aqueous solutions. In these inclusion complexes with 1 : 1 stoichiometry the aromatic molecule is located inside the hydrophobic cavity of cucurbituril. Salts or humic acids decrease {{the efficiency of the}} separation <b>of</b> <b>aromatics</b> from ground- and leak water. By using an excess ratio of cucurbituril to the pollutants the influence of accompanying substances can be ignored. Cucurbituril is fixed on a substrate (SiO_ 2). This enables a good flow through a filled pillar. Silica gel can easily be modified by cucurbituril. It is also inert against oxidation by ozone and very reasonable. Ozone destroys the substances included in the cavity of cucurbituril without oxidising the macrocyclic ligand itself. Even after several charging/regenerating cycles no decrease in the separation capacity <b>of</b> cucurbituril for <b>aromatics</b> is observed. (orig.)

40|$|Vanadia-titania {{catalysts}} {{are highly}} regarded {{for the control}} of industrial and domestic gas effluents. They are particularly used for the abatement of volatile organic compounds and for the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic,</b> polyaromatic and polychlorinated air pollutants like furans and dioxins. Here, mixed oxide catalysts are formed by non-hydrolytic condensation of chloride precursors with diisopropyl ether in non-aqueous medium. Calcination was applied to provoke the migration of the vanadium oxide toward {{the surface of the}} anatase particles, leading to well-spread vanadia species. The materials are made of mesoporous spherical particles of a few microns, themselves constituted by the aggregation of 10 - 25 nm sized particles. Their chemical composition is precisely controlled. The samples are characterized by ICP-AES, N- 2 -physisorption, XRD, XPS, SEM and TOF-SIMS. Their performances as total oxidation catalyst are evaluated in the deep oxidation of benzene, chosen as a model atmospheric pollutant. The activity of the materials compares well with that of catalysts prepared by classical wet impregnation. Along with the V surface concentration, the environment in which V surface species are located is identified as a key parameter. The superior activity of polymeric species as compared to isolated ones is shown. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|NREL {{researchers}} use {{high-performance computing}} to demonstrate fundamental roles <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> residues in cellulase enzyme tunnels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) computer simulations {{of a key}} industrial enzyme, the Trichoderma reesei Family 6 cellulase (Cel 6 A), predict that aromatic residues near the enzyme's active site and at the entrance and exit tunnel perform different functions in substrate binding and catalysis, depending on their location in the enzyme. These results suggest that nature employs aromatic-carbohydrate interactions {{with a wide variety}} of binding affinities for diverse functions. Outcomes also suggest that protein engineering strategies in which mutations are made around the binding sites may require tailoring specific to the enzyme family. Cellulase enzymes ubiquitously exhibit tunnels or clefts lined with aromatic residues for processing carbohydrate polymers to monomers, but the molecular-level role <b>of</b> these <b>aromatic</b> residues remains unknown. In silico mutation <b>of</b> the <b>aromatic</b> residues near the catalytic site of Cel 6 A has little impact on the binding affinity, but simulation suggests that these residues play a major role in the glucopyranose ring distortion necessary for cleaving glycosidic bonds to produce fermentable sugars. <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> residues at the entrance and exit of the cellulase tunnel, however, dramatically impacts the binding affinity. This suggests that these residues play a role in acquiring cellulose chains from the cellulose crystal and stabilizing the reaction product, respectively. These results illustrate that the role of aromatic-carbohydrate interactions varies dramatically depending on the position in the enzyme tunnel. As aromatic-carbohydrate interactions are present in all carbohydrate-active enzymes, the results have implications for understanding protein structure-function relationships in carbohydrate metabolism and recognition, carbon turnover in nature, and protein engineering strategies for biofuels production...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Because they exhibit {{important}} biological functions, from unfolding proteins to activating enzymes to controlling cell fates, aggregates {{of small}} molecules {{are able to}} serve as functional molecular entities in cellular environments. However, the inability to precisely control their production has hampered the understanding and exploration of their biological functions. Here we show that the well-established ligand−receptor interaction between vancomycin and D-Ala-D-Ala catalyzes the aggregation of a D-Ala-D-Ala-containing small peptide derivative in water. The resulting aggregates largely adhere to the cell surface to induce cell necroptosis. Mutation of D-Ala-D-Ala to L-Ala-L-Ala or <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aromatic</b> group in the derivative results in innocuous compounds, confirming that the aromatic−aromatic and ligand...|$|R
5000|$|Horseradish {{peroxidase}} {{is ideal}} {{in many respects}} for these applications because it is smaller, more stable, and less expensive than other popular alternatives such as alkaline phosphatase. It also has a high turnover rate that allows generation of strong signals {{in a relatively short}} time span. [...] It should be noted that high concentrations of phosphate severely decrease stability of horseradish peroxidase. In addition to biomedical applications, horseradish peroxidase is one of the enzymes with important environmental applications. This enzyme is suitable for the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> hydroxylated <b>aromatic</b> compounds (HACs) that are considered to be primary pollutants {{in a wide variety of}} industrial wastewater.|$|R
40|$|Fine-structured {{photocatalytic}} TiO 2 coatings were deposited by atmospheric {{plasma spraying}} (APS) on {{austenitic stainless steel}} coupons. One commercial spray-dried nanostructured TiO 2 powder and five spray-dried powders obtained from suspensions containing mixtures of submicrometric and nanometric TiO 2 particles were used as feedstock materials. Coating microstructure and phase composition were characterised using FEG-SEM and XRD techniques. The photocatalytic activity of the coatings was determined by measuring the degradation of methylene blue dye in aqueous solution. The experimental data were observed to follow a pseudo-first-order kinetic. The kinetic constants displayed a clear relationship with coating anatase content. The photocatalytic decontamination capability {{of one of these}} APS coatings was subsequently investigated by treating an industrial tannery wastewater. The photocatalytic experiments with these TiO 2 coated coupons were carried out in a self-designed reactor. Partial degradation of the pollutants was observed, owing to a decrease in Total Organic Carbon (TOC), in addition to a significant decolouration effect, mainly relating to the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> organic compounds typically present in tannery wastewater. The results demonstrate the potential use of plasma-sprayed photocatalytic TiO 2 coatings in tannery wastewater treatment.

40|$|Ship and {{aircraft}} measurements of aerosol organic matter (OM) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) {{were made in}} fresh and aged pollution plumes from major urban areas in the northeastern United States {{in the framework of}} the 2004 International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation (ICARTT) study. A large part of the variability in the data was quantitatively described by a simple parameterization from a previous study that uses measured mixing ratios of CO and either the transport age or the photochemical age of the sampled air masses. The results suggest that OM was mostly due to secondary formation from anthropogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors in urban plumes. Approximately 37 % of the secondary formation can be accounted for by the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> precursors using newly published particulate mass yields for low-NOx conditions, which are significantly higher than previous results. Of the secondary formation, 63 % remains unexplained and is possibly due to semivolatile precursors that are not measurable by standard gas chromatographic methods. The observed secondary OM in urban plumes may account for 35 % of the total source of OM in the United States and 8. 5 % of the global OM source. OM {{is an important factor in}} climate and air quality issues, but its sources and formation mechanisms remain poorly quantified...|$|R
40|$|The <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> pyrene and benzo(a) pyrene from {{contaminated}} water by sequential and simultaneous ozonation-bioremediation techniques was investigated. During the sequential treatment, ozonation using 0. 5 or 2. 5 mg/L ozone {{was used as}} a pretreatment process, whereas, during the simultaneous treatment process, ozonation of hydrocarbon-{{contaminated water}} at a predetermined duration using 0. 5 mg/L ozone was made in the presence of microbial biomass. Ozonation was not beneficial for the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> pyrene. However, despite a decreased specific biodegradation rate, ozonation improved the overall elimination of benzo(a) pyrene during both treatment processes. The overall <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> benzo(a) pyrene increased from 23 to 91 % after exposure of the water to 0. 5 mg/L ozone for 30 minutes during the simultaneous treatment process and further to 100 % following exposure to 2. 5 mg/L ozone for 60 minutes during the sequential treatment mode, demonstrating the benefits of combined ozonation-biological treatment for the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons.

40|$|Downstream {{mineralization}} and sedimentation {{of terrestrial}} {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) render lakes important for landscape carbon cycling in the boreal region, with regulating processes potentially sensitive to perturbations associated with climate change including increased occurrence of wildfire. In this study we assessed chemical composition and reactivity (during both dark and UV incubations) of DOC from lakes and terrestrial sources within a peatland-rich western boreal plains region partially affected by a recent wildfire. While wildfire was found to increase aromaticity of DOC in peat pore-water above the water table, it {{had no effect on}} concentrations or composition of DOC from peatland wells and neither affected mineral well or lake DOC characteristics. Lake DOC composition reflected a mixing of peatland and mineral groundwater, with a greater influence of mineral sources to lakes in coarse- than fine-textured settings. Peatland DOC was less biodegradable than mineral DOC, but both mineralization and sedimentation of peatland DOC increased substantially during UV incubations through selective <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> humic and fulvic acids. DOC composition in lakes with longer residence times had characteristics consistent with increased UV-mediated processing. We estimate that about half of terrestrial DOC inputs had been lost within lakes, mostly due to UV-mediated processes. The importance of within-lake losses <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> DOC from peatland sources through UV-mediated processes indicate that terrestrial-aquatic C linkages in the study region are largely disconnected from recent terrestrial primary productivity. Together, our results suggest that characteristics of the study region (climate, surface geology and lake morphometry) render linkages between terrestrial and aquatic C cycling insensitive to the effects of wildfire by determining dominant terrestrial sources and within-lake processes <b>of</b> DOC <b>removal...</b>|$|R
