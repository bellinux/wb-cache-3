40|$|The normal {{conducting}} electron-positron Linear Collider projects {{imply that}} accelerating structures and other RF components will undergo an action of extremely high RF fields. Except for the RF breakdown threat, {{there is an}} effect of the copper surface damage due to cyclic heating of the skin-layer under the action of currents, induced by microwave irradiation. In this paper {{we would like to}} introduce a new “grain” model of the processes responsible for the fatigue of the copper surface [1]. This model is based on the quasi-elastic interaction between neighbouring grains in the copper due to the thermal expansion of the skin layer. This mechanism of fatigue is compared with another, where stresses are generated by the temperature gradient towards the bulk of the material. With the proposed formalism one can estimate the total number of the RF pulses required to fracture the surface depending on the temperature <b>rise,</b> <b>pulse</b> length and steady state temperature. The parameters necessary to finalize the proposed approach were found through the comparison of experimental data obtained at 11. 424 GHz...|$|E
30|$|Next, we {{will explain}} the various decays and {{mechanisms}} {{of the observed}} time-resolved measurements based on the model shown in Fig. 2. The fast exponential decay (τ 1 ~ 1 – 0.6 ps) seen for the 2.25 eV and smaller probing photon energies corresponds to the carrier transferring time from the excitation region (pump 4.13 eV, see case (a) in Fig. 2) to the surrounding surface-related states. This is further supported by the sharp <b>rise</b> (<b>pulse</b> width limited) to a maximum PA signal seen for probing photon energies smaller than 2.25 eV, suggesting that once the carriers are generated they provide PA signal. On the other hand, the delay (~ 1 ps) in reaching the maximum PA signal observed for the probing photon energy of 2.75 eV suggests that the PA in this case occurs at the surface-related states after the carriers have moved from their initial excitation region. It is interesting {{to point out that}} the decay component for the 2.75 eV probing is relatively long. The fitting initial time constant is of the order of 5 ps. This clearly suggests that the observable PA probing is carried out not from the initial excited states but most likely from the nearby surface-related states as shown in the schematic of Fig. 2. We believe that measured ~ 5 ps decay is associated with the time that the photoexcited carriers require to reach the lowest indirect state. This is further supported by the degenerate time-resolved absorption measurements at 3.09 eV (see Fig. 1 a, which corresponds to Fig. 2 b), where the excitation is below the direct energy states, and similar time constant (~ 5.5 ps) is evident which most likely comes from PA from the surface-related states. Finally, the long decay component ~ 1 ns which is observed for the 2.75 eV probing energy is attributed to radiative recombination of the carriers after reaching the lowest indirect energy state of the Si-NCs, as indicated in Fig. 2.|$|E
