5|$|Ruffed lemurs, on average, spend 28% {{of the day}} feeding, 53% <b>resting,</b> and 19% traveling, {{although}} {{differences in}} <b>resting</b> and feeding durations have been observed between males and females, with females <b>resting</b> less and feeding more. They are diurnal; although peak activity occurs during the early morning and late afternoon or evening, <b>resting</b> usually occurs around midday. When <b>resting,</b> ruffed lemurs often sit hunched or upright. They are also frequently seen lying prone over a branch or sunbathing in a supine position with the limbs outstretched. When feeding, they will often hang upside-down by their hind feet, a type of suspensory behavior, which allows them to reach fruits and flowers.|$|E

40|$|The {{repressor}} element 1 -silencing {{transcription factor}} (<b>REST)</b> {{functions as a}} master regulator to maintain neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs). <b>REST</b> undergoes proteasomal degradation through β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination during neuronal differentiation. However, reciprocal mechanisms that stabilize <b>REST</b> in NPCs are undefined. Here we show that deubiquitinase HAUSP counterbalances <b>REST</b> ubiquitination and prevents NPC differentiation. HAUSP expression declines concordantly with <b>REST</b> upon neuronal differentiation and reciprocally with β-TrCP levels. HAUSP knockdown in NPCs decreases <b>REST</b> and induces differentiation. In contrast, HAUSP overexpression up-regulates <b>REST</b> by overriding β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination. A consensus site (310 -PYSS- 313) of human <b>REST</b> is required for HAUSP-mediated <b>REST</b> deubiquitination. Furthermore, <b>REST</b> overexpression in NPCs rescues the differentiation phenotype induced by HAUSP knockdown. These data demonstrate that HAUSP stabilizes <b>REST</b> through deubiquitination and antagonizes β-TrCP in regulating <b>REST</b> at post-translational level. Thus, the HAUSP-mediated deubiquitination represents a critical regulatory mechanism involved in the maintenance of NPCs.

Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail.

50|$|A regular weekly <b>rest</b> {{period is}} a period of at least 45 {{consecutive}} hours. An actual working week starts {{at the end of a}} weekly <b>rest</b> period, and finishes when another weekly <b>rest</b> period is commenced, which may mean that weekly <b>rest</b> is taken in the middle of a fixed (Monday-Sunday) week. This is perfectly acceptable - the working week is not required to be aligned with the ‘fixed’ week defined in the rules, provided all the relevant limits are complied with. Alternatively, a driver can take a reduced weekly <b>rest</b> period of a minimum of 24 consecutive hours. If a reduction is taken, it must be compensated for by an equivalent period of <b>rest</b> taken in one block before the end of the third week following the week in question. The compensating <b>rest</b> must be attached to a period of <b>rest</b> of at least 9 hours - in effect either a weekly or a daily <b>rest</b> period.For example, where a driver reduces a weekly <b>rest</b> period to 33 hours in week 1, he must compensate for this by attaching a 12-hour period of <b>rest</b> to another <b>rest</b> period of at least 9 hours before the end of week 4. This compensation cannot be taken in several smaller periods. A weekly <b>rest</b> period that falls in two weeks may be counted in either week but not in both.However, a <b>rest</b> period of at least 69 hours in total may be counted as two back-to-back weekly <b>rests</b> (e.g. a 45-hour weekly <b>rest</b> followed by 24 hours), provided that the driver does not exceed 144 hours’ work either before or after the <b>rest</b> period in question. Where reduced weekly <b>rest</b> periods are taken away from base, these may be taken in a vehicle, provided that it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary.|$|R

The weekly driving time may not exceed 56 hours. In addition to this, a driver cannot exceed 90 hours driving in a fortnight. Within each period of 24 hours {{after the end of}} the previous daily <b>rest</b> period or weekly <b>rest</b> period a driver must take a new daily <b>rest</b> period. An 11-hour (or more) daily <b>rest</b> is called a regular daily <b>rest</b> period. Alternatively, a driver can split a regular daily <b>rest</b> period into two periods. The first period must be at least 3 hours of uninterrupted <b>rest</b> and can be taken at any time during the day. The second must be at least 9 hours of uninterrupted <b>rest,</b> giving a total minimum <b>rest</b> of 12 hours. A driver may reduce his daily <b>rest</b> period to no less than 9 continuous hours, but this can be done no more than three times between any two weekly <b>rest</b> periods; no compensation for the reduction is required. A daily <b>rest</b> that is less than 11 hours but at least 9 hours long is called a reduced daily <b>rest</b> period. When a daily <b>rest</b> is taken, this may be taken in a vehicle, as long as it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary.|$|R

5|$|As of October 2010, {{there are}} four <b>rest</b> areas {{operating}} along the A6 motorway, as a new <b>rest</b> area opened on October 9, 2010 next to the western portal of Tuhobić Tunnel on the VrataOštrovica section of the route. Applicable legislation provides for four types of <b>rest</b> areas designated as types A through D: A-type <b>rest</b> areas comprise {{a full range of}} amenities including a filling station, a restaurant and a hotel or a motel; B-type <b>rest</b> areas have no lodging; C-type <b>rest</b> areas are very common and include a filling station and a café, but no restaurants or accommodations; and D-type <b>rest</b> areas offer parking spaces only, with possibly some picnic tables, benches, and restrooms. Even though the <b>rest</b> areas found along the A6 motorway generally follow this ranking system, there are considerable variations, as some of them offer extra services. The most notable example is Lepenica <b>rest</b> areaeven though it has no restaurant and therefore falls below B-type <b>rest</b> area standard, there is, for instance, an RV park available. The filling stations typically have small convenience stores and some of them offer LPG fuel. As of October 2010, all of the <b>rest</b> areas found along the A6 motorway comply with C-type <b>rest</b> area standards or above.|$|R
