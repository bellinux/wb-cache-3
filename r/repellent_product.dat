From the results of the repellency tests of the various active combinations, three actives were identified that showed promising signs of synergism. These actives were then studied in further detail to determine their optimum combination. In addition, it was shown that when using a natural flavourant as promoter and incorporating a slow-release agent into formulations for aerosols and lotions, a product is obtained that gives comparable levels of efficiency to current commercial products, but at much reduced levels of active loading.

The repellent potential of 19 essential oils from the island of Corsica, France, was evaluated in a bio-assay with the mosquito Aedes aegypti, in order to assess the 'space repellent' properties of these oils. Lavendula stoechas, Helichrysum italicum (leaves) and Laurus nobilis oils showed a capability of reducing the attractivity of a human finger for yellow fever mosquitoes in a Y-tube olfactometer. In addn. to the behavioral studies on mosquitoes, two tests on the olfactory perception of these 19 oils were performed, involving 25 female and 25 male human volunteers.

40|$|Many {{bioactive}} {{products from}} benthic invertebrates mediating ecological interactions {{have proved to}} reduce predation, but their mechanisms of action, and their molecular identities, are usually unknown. It was suggested, yet scarcely investigated, that nutritional quality interferes with defensive metabolites. This means that antifeedants would be less effective when combined with energetically rich prey, and that higher amounts of defensive compounds would be needed for predator avoidance. We evaluated the effects of five types of repellents obtained from Antarctic invertebrates, in combination with diets of different energetic values. The compounds came from soft corals, ascidians and hexactinellid sponges; they included wax esters, alkaloids, a meroterpenoid, a steroid, and the recently described organic acid, glassponsine. Feeding repellency was tested through preference assays by preparing diets (alginate pearls) combining different energetic content and inorganic material. Experimental diets contained various concentrations of each <b>repellent</b> <b>product,</b> and were offered along with control compound-free pearls, to the Antarctic omnivore amphipod Cheirimedon femoratus. Meridianin alkaloids were the most active repellents, and wax esters were the least active when combined with foods of distinct energetic content. Our data show that levels of repellency vary for each compound, and that they perform differently when mixed with distinct assay foods. The natural products that interacted the most with energetic content were those occurring in nature at higher concentrations. The bioactivity of the remaining metabolites tested was found to depend on a threshold concentration, enough to elicit feeding repellence, independently from nutritional quality...|$|E

40|$|People {{who work}} or play {{outdoors}} are often attacked by numerous species of insects, ticks and mites. Mosquitoes, ticks, chiggers, fleas, biting flies and gnats {{are just some}} of the creatures that irritate and annoy people and disrupt their normal activities. These creatures are not just nuisances. Some may inflict painful bites, cause rashes or lesions, or, in some cases, transmit important diseases. One way in which you might protect yourself is by staying inside during times of peak insect activity. For example, most mosquitoes are often more active during the early morning or late evening. Some horse flies are more active during the bright, sunny hours of the day. Wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts will protect you from insects by reducing the exposed areas of the body. Louisiana’s hot, humid summers can make outdoor conditions unbearable, however, if you dress too warmly. If you choose or are required to be outside when insects are active, use a repellent. Repellents are chemical substances that protect people from insect attack by making the body unattractive or offensive to insects. A repellent does not have to kill insects to be effective, although it may. Repellents are usually synthesized chemicals, although some are natural, botanical products. Commercial repellents come in a variety of forms such as sprays, liquids, creams, lotions, sticks, wrist-bands and pre-moistened towelettes. Some repellents are applied to exposed skin areas, and others only to clothing.

New strategies such as spatial repellents need to be evaluated as supplemental tools to existing control measures such as insecticide treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. Linalool is a naturally occurring terpene alcohol commonly found in flowers and spices with reportedly repellent properties. Four experimental huts fitted with exit traps and enclosed inside a large screened semi-field system were used for the evaluation. The tested spatial <b>repellent</b> <b>product</b> consisted of an agar gel emanator containing 73 % linalool. Two rounds of experiments using a Latin square design were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the linalool emanators compared to no treatment (negative control) and a transfluthrin coil (positive) against lab-reared disease free Anopheles gambiae s. s [...] The emanators were hung inside experimental huts where two volunteers were sleeping unprotected. The outcome measures were repellency, % feeding inhibition, %mortality and post 24 h % mortality. Unlike the mosquito coil, the linalool emanators did not show any feeding inhibition, repellency or induced mortality compared to the negative control. On the other hand mosquitoes kept for 24 h post exposure were 3 times more likely to die after being exposed to two 73 % linalool emanators than the negative control. Our results indicate that linalool agar gel emanators are not adequate as a spatial repellent against Anopheles gambiae s. s [...] However adding linalool to known repellent formulations could be advantageous, not only because of its pleasant scent but also because of the delayed mortality effect it has on mosquitoes...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis unravels various {{strategies of}} the Drosophila melanogaster olfactory circuit to decode the olfactory world into an accurate perception of odors underlying innate odor-guided behavior. The olfactory system is an extremely flat but elegantly organized circuitry, which is optimized to extract relevant variables at any of its processing levels. The peripheral machinery composed of various OSN types mainly serves as a pure detection area encoding odors in a combinatorial manner. Already at the first synapse between OSNs and PNs specific features of an odor stimulus as valence and intensity are extracted by the PNs that relay this information to higher processing centers. Hereby excitatory PNs, which represent {{the majority of the}} AL output, possess the capacity to extract odor identity as well as positive and negative valence. Inhibitory PNs constitute a parallel processing stream to ePNs towards the higher brain and perform a decoding of features from the AL into a particular percept underlying a traceable behavior. Moreover, I found evidence for a spatial partitioning of the LH according to distinct odor features. Since both PN types are reunited within the LH, valence and intensity-specific activity might be computed to configure a valence-specific behavioral output. Besides general rules of olfactory coding, this thesis elucidates two exceptional cases with evolutionarily highly conserved underlying principles. First, the olfactory mimicry of yeasty fermentation products performed by the plume of the deceptive Arum palaestiunum flower and second, a labeled line circuit of fundamental significance for the animal’s survival could be discovered: the geosmin pathway is exclusively tuned to the <b>repellent</b> <b>product</b> of toxic microorganisms. In conclusion, findings within my thesis reveal general rules for decoding odor features as innate valence and odor intensity as well as specialized hard-wired mechanisms initiating innate behavior...|$|E

30|$|Mosquito bites {{can give}} an {{unpleasant}} feeling and may transmit the vector disease such as dengue or malaria to humankind. Mosquitoes {{are attracted to}} human blood containing protein to develop their eggs, biting human to another human, thereby transmitting the vector disease to human. The genus Aedes mosquitoes are responsible to transmit the vector of dengue all over the worlds with billion people suffer from the disease and also death cases reported (Division of Vector-Borne Disease 2012). There {{are only a few}} vaccines to treat the virus caused by mosquito bites, however, in the case of dengue, researchers are yet to find the vaccines for it (Farag et al. 2011) the best way is for people to avoid mosquito bites. Repellents are practical products and economical means to prevent the transmissions of the mosquito vector disease (Yang and Ma 2005). Hence, personal protective measure must be taken to protect human from mosquito bites. Applying mosquito repellents either on their skin, house, even on their clothing or upholsteries may help in protecting human against mosquito bites. Repellents that applied to skin or clothing produce a vapor layer that has an offensive smell or taste and makes a person unattractive for feeding and therefore repels the mosquito (Brown and Hebert 1997; Fradin and Day 2002) several studies showed that most repellents was developed in the form of lotions, cream, essential oils, spray, or solution where in most cases require direct application to the human skin (Amer and Mehlhorn 2006; Ariffin et al. 2012; Fei and Xin 2007; Fradin and Day 2002; Snodgrass 1992; Yates et al. 2005). Treating the garment fabrics with repellent agent is another way to avoid mosquito bites as the big proportion of the human skin is covered by the treated garment thus, avoiding it to be exposed to the blood sucking mosquitoes. Imparting the mosquito repellents onto the textile and cloth impregnating laundry emulsions application is one of the innovatory and practical approach in daily routine to driving away the blood sucking arthropods from people (Brown and Hebert 1997; Maheshwari and Ramya 2014). The present inventions of mosquito repellents to be imparted into the fabric can be produced using various techniques such as addition during rinse cycle, direct coating, finishing like cloth impregnating laudry emulsions and others (Anitha et al. 2011; Anuar and Yusof 2016; Farag et al. 2011; Fei and Xin 2007; Snodgrass 1992; Sumithra and Vasugi Raja 2012; Troutman 2009; Van Winkle 2002). The textiles with mosquito repelling features exhibit a character that can drive the mosquito away from the treated textile, or by knocking down the mosquitoes when it is in contact with the treated textiles. The applications of the mosquito repellent feature must not damage the original characteristic of the textile materials itself. The value added of repellent properties also for textile material is a novel approaches as it by means can help to reduce the statistics of vector disease cases without giving a side effect to the wearer. According to a study by (Stajkovic and Milutinovic 2013), the recommendation regarding usage of <b>repellent</b> <b>product</b> for textile materials is “the product should be applied in a thin layer on the skin surface, clothing or both, it should not be applied under clothing”.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRising damp {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{recurrent}} and well-known hazards to existing buildings and monuments. Several types of intervention exist to tackle the problem. Among these, the creation of a damp-proof course against capillary rise by means of injection of chemical products {{is one of the}} most diffused methods, thanks to the relatively easy and cheap application. Despite positive results when applied under controlled conditions in laboratory, these interventions do not always deliver the desired result in practice. Several studies have shown varying degrees of success. Various factors, like the lack of homogeneity of the substrate and a high moisture and salt content may affect the effectiveness of treatments. Moreover, the type of substrate and the combination of materials with different pore size distribution influence the spreading and the effectiveness of chemical products. Since rising damp is a problem that is mainly manifested in masonry, that is usually composed of at least two materials, the last factor may be of great importance. The current paper reports the results of a research on the transport of chemical injection products in relatively small mortar/brick combinations. Since no easy to perform test method for small combined specimens, giving results within a short time, was available, a special test method was developed. The effect of the interface between brick and mortar on the transport of the products was studied by the application of several injection products and creams. The tested products include pore filling and water <b>repellent</b> <b>products</b> and products in water as well as in organic solvent. The obtained results show clear differences in spreading and effectiveness in the different substrates and between products in organic solvent and water based ones, as well as between creams and liquid products.

Taxis boxes distinguished between repellency and attraction inhibition of mosquitoes by measuring response of mosquitoes towards {{or away from}} Transfluthrin coils and humans. Protective effective distance of coils and long-term effects on blood feeding were measured in the semi-field tunnel and in a Peet Grady chamber. Laboratory reared pyrethroid susceptible Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto mosquitoes were used. In the taxis boxes, {{a higher proportion of}} mosquitoes (67 %- 82 %) were activated and flew towards the human in the presence of Transfluthrin coils. Coils did not hinder attraction of mosquitoes to the human. In the semi-field Tunnel, coils placed 0. 3 m from the human reduced feeding by 86 % (95 % CI [0. 66; 0. 95]) when used as a "bubble" compared to 65 % (95 % CI [0. 51; 0. 76]) when used as a "point source". Mosquitoes exposed to coils inside a Peet Grady chamber were delayed from feeding normally for 12 hours but there was no effect on free flying and caged mosquitoes exposed in the semi-field tunnel.

The laboratory results indicate that the average protection times obtained with formulations with karite nut butter as excipient (54. 8 ± 37. 0 mn and 74. 6 ± 26. 4 mn respectively on An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti) are higher than those recorded with vaseline as excipient (respectively 42. 7 ± 30. 0 mn and 60. 8 ± 33. 9 mn). On the other hand, under field conditions, the biting rate percentage reduction obtained with the products with karite nut butter and vaseline excipient were similar (respectively 29. 8 % and 35. 9 % for all mosquitoes collected and 45. 7 % and 47. 4 % against An. gambiae). Nevertheless, the use of karite nut butter on <b>repellent</b> <b>products</b> should be encouraged because its sale price is very lower (10 time less) than the vaseline's...|$|R
