Gulf of Mexico penaeid shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus, F. duorarum, and Litopenaeus setiferus) fishery. In June 2008, the program expanded to include the South Atlantic penaeid and <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Sicyonia spp., fisheries. Data collected from 10, 206 tows during 5, 197 sea days of observations were analyzed by geographical area and target species. The majority of tows (~ 70 %) sampled were off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Based on total hours towed, the highest concentrated effort occurred off South Texas and southwestern Florida. Gear information, such as net characteristics, bycatch reduction devices, and turtle excluder devices were fairly consistent among areas and target species. By species categories, finfish comprised the majority (≥ 57 %) of the catch composition in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic penaeid shrimp fisheries, while in the South Atlantic <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery the largest component (41 %) was <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Bycatch to shrimp ratios were lower than reported in previous studies for the Gulf of Mexico penaeid shrimp fishery.

We examined the grazing effect of the <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp</b> Rhynchocinetes typus on fouling species, which colonize scallop pearl nets. We placed different densities of shrimp (0, 2, 5 and 10 individuals) in pearl nets with juvenile scallops (mean shell height 4. 9  cm) at Tongoy Bay in northern-central Chile. We sampled the nets after 4  months (January-May 2007) and recovered 35 - 50 % of the shrimp from the different treatments. The nets with 10 initial shrimp had a lower cover of the bryozoan B. neritina and lower densities of the ascidians C. intestinalis and Pyura chilensis, {{which resulted in a}} 50 % decrease in biomass of fouling on nets. Low scallop mortality and slightly higher (yet not significant) growth in treatments with high shrimp densities suggest a positive interaction between the shrimp and scallops.

40|$|The ivory tree coral, Oculina varicosa, {{is known}} to form reefs only in deep water (80 - 100 meters) off the central Atlantic coast of Florida. These unique reefs support high levels of biodiversity, and provide {{important}} spawning habitat for commercially important fish species such as snappers and groupers. The fragile, slow-growing Oculina reefs are easily destroyed by bottom trawls, {{and other types of}} bottom fishing gear. In 1984 the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council established the Oculina Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC), banning all bottom trawling in a portion of the reef system. The protected area was expanded in 1994 to include most of the Oculina reefs. However, recent surveys showed that about 90 % of the reefs have been destroyed, mainly by bottom trawling for <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp.</b> This project is an analysis of why the Oculina reefs are almost gone despite many years of protection, and what could be done to improve enforcement and protection of the Oculina HAPC. Information was collected from literature research, and conversations with several stakeholders and experts on issues relevant to the Oculina HAPC. Four main policy problems emerged: a historical lack of enforcement in the <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery, continuing lack of enforcement in the snapper grouper fishery, insufficient penalties for violations of the HAPC regulations, and a lack of funding for research, enforcement, education, and outreach. The pros and cons of six potential solutions to address these problems are discussed: (1) require VMS in the snapper grouper fishery; (2) establish acoustic monitoring systems in the OECA; (3) increase penalties for violations of the Oculina HAPC; (4) increase funding for research, enforcement, education, and outreach; (5) expand the Oculina HAPC; and (6) establish part or all of the Oculina HAPC as a National Marine Sanctuary. It is important to establish effective protections for the Oculina HAPC, not only to conserve the remaining Oculina reef ecosystems, but to learn how to prevent such widespread destruction of other deep-sea coral ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Oculina Bank HAPC. Within the HAPCs, {{prohibited}} gear includes bottom longline, trawl, dredge, pot or trap {{as well as}} the use of an anchor, {{anchor and}} chain, or grapple and chain. Actions 1, 3, and 4 would extend these gear prohibitions to expansions of the Oculina Bank HAPC, Stetson-Miami Terrace Coral HAPC (CHAPC), and the Cape Lookout CHAPC. Therefore, as the size of these HAPCs is increased, the biological benefits would increase for coral, including coral, species that use the bottom substrate as habitat, and shrimp. Increasing the size of the HAPC may provide a refuge for other important species in the area, such as snapper grouper species by prohibiting bottom longline activity as well as anchoring.

40|$|Evidence {{of female}} {{preference}} for dominant males during mating is {{reported for the}} <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp</b> Rhynchocinetes typus. Two sexually mature males of di¡erent ontogenetic stage were tethered at opposite sides of a large tank. Tethering restricted males from actively pursuing the receptive female but allowed females to choose between males. Surprisingly most (10 out of 11) females ¢rst approached the subordinate typus male, but after these initial contacts all females chose the dominant robustus male. Following antennal and corporal contacts of variable duration seven (out of 11) females initiated the mating process with the robustus male, while four females did not initiate mating during the 90 min observation period. The fact that all mating females selected the robustus shows strong female preferences for these males. It is suggested that female preference for large and dominant males is common among crustaceans with sexual size-dimorphism. Sexual size-dimorphism is pronounced in many crustacean species in which males exhibit highly developed ¢ghting structures (chelae, pereopods). Males of these species may overtake females and hold them in a ¢rm mating grip making it di⁄cult to detect whether females have preferences. Despite these di⁄culties several studies indicate that females are capable of exerting preferences for certain males by exhibiting resistance t...|$|R
40|$|SummarySignals {{transmit}} {{information to}} receivers about sender attributes, increase the fitness of both parties, and are selected for in cooperative interactions between species to reduce conflict [1, 2]. Marine cleaning interactions {{are known for}} stereotyped behaviors [3 – 6] that likely serve as signals. For example, “dancing” and “tactile dancing” in cleaner fish may serve to advertise cleaning services to client fish [7] and manipulate client behavior [8], respectively. Cleaner shrimp clean fish [9], yet are cryptic in comparison to cleaner fish. Signals, therefore, are likely essential for cleaner shrimp to attract clients. Here, we show that the yellow-beaked cleaner shrimp [10] Urocaridella sp. c [11] uses a stereotypical side-to-side movement, or “rocking dance,” while approaching potential client fish in the water column. This dance {{was followed by a}} cleaning interaction with the client 100 % of the time. Hungry cleaner shrimp, which are more willing to clean than satiated ones [12], spent more time rocking and in closer proximity to clients Cephalopholis cyanostigma than satiated ones, and when given a choice, clients preferred hungry, <b>rocking</b> <b>shrimp.</b> The <b>rocking</b> dance therefore influenced client behavior and, thus, appears to function as a signal to advertise the presence of cleaner shrimp to potential clients...|$|R

40|$|During first gamete interaction, {{oligosaccharides}} on the glycoproteins {{present in}} oocyte envelopes of the <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Rhynchocinetes typus, {{play an important}} role in spermatozoon recognition prior to the onset of penetration. These oligosaccharides have terminal monosaccharides that may be recognized by means of specific lectins. A variety of marine species have monosaccharides on their oocyte envelopes, allowing them to interact with the spermatozoa. The number and location of the monosaccharides varies during oocyte maturation. However, this phenomenon has not been studied in shrimp. The present study evaluates the presence and location of monosaccharides on oocyte envelopes during maturation using seven specific lectins conjugated to FITC (GNL, LCA, Con-A BS- 1, LTA, GLS-II,DBA); these recognize mannose (&# 945; 1 - 3) mannose, &# 945;-mannose, &# 945;-glucose, glucose, galactose, fucose, N-acetyl-glucosamine, and N-acetyl-galactosamine, respectively. Participation of these carbohydrates in the fertilization process was determined through the insemination of fresh oocytes with spermatozoa previously incubated with the different monosaccharides that block the active sites of the spermatozoa, inhibiting fertilization. The results showed the presence of N-acetyl-glucosamine and mannose on the oocyte envelopes, indicating that these sugars could be the receptors during the first gamete interaction. The results also suggested that glucose could be a complementary receptor to N-acetyl-glucosamine and mannose since, despite the low concentration of glucose on the envelope, this sugar generated a high degree of fertilization inhibition...|$|R
40|$|This review compiles all the {{research}} done on gametes and fertilization in the <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp,</b> R. typus, and describes {{the sequence of events}} from the fi rst gamete interaction to zygote formation and the fi rst cleavage of the embryo, with light, fl uorescence confocal and electron microscopes. Early studies showed that sperm from the vas deferens have a tack-shape with a “needle-like process ” or rigid spike (RS) that extends from a semi-spherical body that contains the arms with chromatin and spines. Upon contact with seawater and by action of Na +, the arms and spines extend, producing an inverted umbrella form of the spermatozoa. The fi rst sperm-oocyte interaction occurs between protein receptors type lectins of the sperm RS and oocyte chorion sperm ligands. These ligands contain residues of α-Glu, Man (α 1 - 3) Man, α and β-GlcNAc and α-GalNA terminal residues. It was found that α-Man and GlcNAc residues are the ligands that are directly related to the adhesion process and further penetration of sperm. After this fi rst interaction, the RS enters the oocyte envelope by the action of a trypsin-like enzyme, rhynchocinecine, present in the acicular process. Later, arms and spines penetrate the oocyte cytoplasm, where the chromatin of the arms begin to migrate to the central area of the sperm, condensing in a cup-shaped structure near the connecting piece, which forms the male pronucleus...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{structures}} {{may play}} an important role in the marine invasion process by providing novel artificial habitats, often out of the reach of common benthic predators. A survey of piers in northern-central Chile revealed a change in the epibenthic assemblage on pilings at different distances from a rocky shore with abundant grazers and predators. Pilings on soft sediment, away from the rocky shore, were heavily colonized by the invasive bryozoan Bugula neritina. We therefore hypothesized that benthic predators may forage on pilings located on rocky bottom whereas pilings on soft sediment benefit from the absence of generalist benthic predators which do not occur on soft sediment. We examined piling communities using cages directly attached to pilings, where we included or excluded the sea urchin Tetrapygus niger and the <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp</b> Rhyncocinetes typus. Resultant communities differed substantially; a high percentage of bare space occurred in the presence of sea urchins, while turf algae dominated in the presence of shrimp. Both sea urchins and shrimp suppressed the colonization of the invasive B. neritina and, when acting together, totally prevented its recruitment. In contrast, invasive bryozoans colonized 95 % of the available substratum in cages where predators were excluded. Our results show the important role of benthic generalist predators in limiting the establishment and spread of non-native species on anthropogenic structures. Further, this study highlights the unprecedented role of shrimp grazing in structuring hard-bottom communities. © Inter-Research 2011. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Mature organisms {{often have}} to trade {{reproductive}} opportunities against the need to survive, especially in species with exaggerated, sexually selected traits. Life history theory predicts that old males with low residual reproductive value (RRV) would accept greater risk for current reproduction than their younger counterparts. Accordingly, we tested the prediction that, under predation risk, old males of the <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp</b> Rhynchocinetes typus pair with females faster and for a longer time than young males do. We exposed young and old dominant males (in the final ontogenetic stage, called “robustus”) to a female in the absence and presence of a predator. As predicted, older robustus males modified their mating behavior when exposed to a predator. However, {{in contrast to the}} prediction, they delayed female seizure under predation risk, possibly to carefully assess the actual threat before initiating female guarding. Once they had established the mate-guarding position, old robustus males did not interrupt it until the end of female spawning and, in the presence of predators, even guarded the female significantly longer than in predator-free treatments. In contrast, younger robustus males did not delay female seizure but abandoned the female repeatedly when a predator was present, suggesting that they perceived and responded to the predation risk. Our results suggest that older robustus males have the experience to assess threats before engaging in risky behaviors that bolster their reproductive success. Although consistent with the theory that low RRV individuals should accept greater reproductive risk, we suggest that old individuals do not recklessly engage in risky behaviors but rather cautiously evaluate the threats before investing in a potentially terminal reproductive event...|$|R

Underwater surveys {{were carried out}} at six shallow-water reef barrens in temperate waters of northern-central Chile from October to December 2010 to describe the effects of predation, habitat complexity (low, medium and high) and refuge availability on the abundance and population structure of the <b>rock</b> <b>shrimp</b> Rhynchocinetes typus (Rhynchocinetidae), an important mesoconsumer on subtidal hard substrata. Three sites were within managed (restricted access) areas for fishermen, and three were unmanaged (open-access). Field observations and tethering experiments were conducted {{to examine the relationship}} between fish and shrimp abundances, and the relative predation rates on shrimps. Direct effects of predation on R. typus body-size distribution were examined from shrimps collected in the field and fish stomachs. The presence and the abundance of R. typus increased with habitat reef complexity and refuge availability. Shrimp abundance was negatively related to fish abundance in managed areas, but not in open-access areas, where shrimp densities were the highest. Also, predation rates and body-size distribution of shrimps were unrelated, although fish consumed more large shrimps than should be expected from their distribution in the field. R. typus occurred most often in shelters with wide openings, offering limited protection against predators, but providing potential aggregation sites for shrimps. Overall, direct effects of predation on shrimp densities and population structure were weak, but indirect effects on shrimp distribution within reefs appear to have been mediated through behavioural responses. Our study highlights the need to assess both numerical and behavioural responses of prey to determine the effects of predator loss on mesoconsumer populations. © 2012 The Author(s). postprin...|$|R
