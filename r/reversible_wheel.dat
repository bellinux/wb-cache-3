5000|$|Steam engines can be {{designed}} {{for more than one}} gauge, by having, for example, <b>reversible</b> <b>wheel</b> hubs that suit two alternative gauges. This was done in the 1930s and beyond in Victoria for possible gauge conversion, though no engines were ever converted in this manner other than one heritage engine (R766). Some [...] Garratt locomotives of East Africa were designed for easy conversion to [...] gauge, though again none ever was.|$|E
50|$|Until the {{invention}} of the steam engine, water power was the main source of energy utilised by the various mechanical engines employed in the mining industry, such as water <b>wheels,</b> <b>reversible</b> water <b>wheels,</b> water-column engines or water turbines.|$|R
50|$|A special type of overshot/backshot <b>wheel</b> is the <b>reversible</b> water <b>wheel.</b> This has {{two sets}} of blades or buckets running in {{opposite}} directions, {{so that it can}} turn in either direction depending on which side the water is directed. <b>Reversible</b> <b>wheels</b> were used in the mining industry in order to power various means of ore conveyance. By changing the direction of the wheel, barrels or baskets of ore could be lifted up or lowered down a shaft or inclined plane. There was usually a cable drum or a chain basket (German: Kettenkorb) on the axle of the wheel. It is essential that the wheel have braking equipment to be able to stop the wheel (known as a braking wheel). The oldest known drawing of a <b>reversible</b> water <b>wheel</b> was by Georgius Agricola and dates to 1556.|$|R

5000|$|The name of {{the walk}} {{is derived from the}} {{artificial}} water channel or Kunstgraben that was laid here between 1844 and 1847 to supply water for the mining industry, Graben being German for [...] "ditch". The channel was used to make water available for overshot <b>wheels</b> (Kunsträder) and <b>reversible</b> <b>wheels</b> (Kehrräder) at the 4th Shaft (IV. Lichtloch) and the two Schwamkrug turbines at the 5th Shaft (V. Lichtloch), which were used to transport the rock extracted from the Rothschönberger Stolln mine and for water management.|$|R
50|$|Valpadana offers three {{categories}} of tractors: one-way 4 <b>wheel</b> equal size, <b>reversible</b> 4 <b>wheel</b> equal size, and specialized. The one-way 4 wheel equal size tractor has three basic models the 4600, 6400, and 6600, these basic models each offer different versions. There are seven specialized versions of the one-way 4 wheel equal size tractor. The <b>reversible</b> 4 <b>wheel</b> equal size tractor has two basic models, the 6600 and the 9600, there are three specialized versions of this tractor line. The specialized tractor line offers one basic model, the 3600, which has six specialized versions.|$|R

He created what The Bicycle described as a quick-release and <b>reversible</b> rear <b>wheel</b> device, an ingenious feat {{for which he was}} awarded the Cyclists' Touring Club's first silver plaque as the inventor or producer of the greatest improvement in cycle design, construction or equipment during the year 1925.|$|R
50|$|East of {{the present}} inn {{building}} the Mining and History Society of the Mining Town of Lautenthal (Bergwerks- und Geschichtsverein Bergstadt Lautenthal von 1976 e.V.) built a working model of mining equipment between 1992 and 1998 {{in order to show}} the original function of the area. The water wheel at a scale of 1:2 with a six-metre diameter is not far from the spot where the <b>reversible</b> water <b>wheel</b> of the Maaßen Hoisting Shaft used to turn.|$|R
50|$|A 1918 {{postcard}} {{shows the}} original headframe building. The headframe was a simple, two-storey, wooden {{building with a}} shallow gable roof. From the roof projected a low, steel hoisting frame with a timber-framed cover above the sheaves, which redirected the hoisting cable from the <b>reversible</b> water <b>wheel</b> into the sloping shaft. In {{the face of the}} gable wall were openings for feeding the flatrods of the water wheel which ran down the slope. The mine railway emerged from the gateway {{at the side of the}} building.|$|R
40|$|A new <b>reversible</b> <b>wheeled</b> {{articulated}} tractor, {{designed to}} work in terraced vineyards trained with “pergola” system, common in mountain areas, is here described in its latest version and analysed through numerical simulations. This tractor has small dimensions, necessary to operate in that environment, and its central articulation has two rotational degrees-offreedom. The described features are surely strong design points but could be critical for vehicle’s stability, as affecting the supporting base’s dimensions and shape. Therefore, the tractor was equipped with a new automatic safety system: a self-locking articulation activated by contact sensors on the wheels. This device makes the vehicle partially-rigid in case of lateral unbalancing, so that rollover can happen only by overcoming the whole vehicle mass. A mathematical description of vehicle-ground interactions was implemented to deeply inquiry the tractor behaviour in different configurations (straight, angled) at increasing values of ground slope; roll and pitch stability indexes were then computed and used for comparisons with conventional tractors. Thanks to the low centre-of-gravity, the resulting rollover angle with the vehicle in straight configuration is promising (43. 8 °→ 96 %) : it {{is greater than the}} maximum lateral (20 °→ 36 %) and frontal (38 °→ 78 %) slope angle ever recorded on terraced vineyards. The same rollover angle is lower when the tractor turns...|$|R
50|$|To {{begin with}} the ore was chiselled free and carted {{to the surface of}} the open pits or shallow mines in baskets. Once shaft depths {{increased}} to between about 10-60 metres hand winches (Handhäspel) were used, operated by one or two workers (Knechten). The crude ore was placed in wooden buckets for transportation. For the rather short, horizontal gangways leading to the shaft the ore was carried in Trogs for several centuries (long before the introduction of blasting). In the 17th century the shafts reached depths of between 100 and 200 m. Ore could no longer be removed by hand and horsepower was increasingly used. The horses worked in a cone-shaped building, the Göpel or Gaipel, which housed a horse whim, a winch that was driven by the horses walking in a circle. The hauling cable (made of natural fibre) or cast-iron chain was wound up and down over a vertical axle. The cable was routed down the shaft and hauled barrels of ore up and down. Due to the shaft's incline, barrels were covered with iron runners on one side, resting partly on the side of the shaft. Above ground at the pithead the ore was emptied out and transported away by horse and cart for processing. From the 18th century shaft depths of several hundred metres were being achieved and horse whims were reaching the limits of their capability. Where the mines were lucrative and their energy consumption high as a result of shaft depth or the ingress of water, water power had been used since the 16th century. Water wheels (Kunsträder) drove piston pumps in order to keep the mine dewatered (zu Sumpfe). <b>Reversible</b> water <b>wheels</b> (Kehrräder) powered the transportation of ore or winnings. Depending on the terrain conditions the <b>reversible</b> <b>wheels</b> were located either in underground wheel houses (Radstuben) near the shaft (the cable drum being set on the same axle as the water wheel) or above ground in the valley. When using the latter method the wheel's rotation was converted into reciprocating motion using a crank mechanism (Krummen Zapfen) and transmitted over twin flat rods, several hundred metres long, to the shaft. Here, reciprocating motion was re-converted into rotary motion.|$|R
50|$|From 1720 the Maaßen Hoisting Shaft (Maaßener Treibschacht) and Maaßen Water Shaft (Maaßener Kunstschacht) of the Lautenthals Glück Pit {{were used}} to hoist ore and surplus water to the surface. At that time, both shafts were {{so-called}} winzes and did not open at the surface. From 1718, the hoisting shaft had a winding engine. From 1842 to 1844 the hoisting shaft was driven to the surface. In the subsequent period, the headframe and other above-ground facilities were added. The <b>reversible</b> water <b>wheel</b> lay 29 metres down the shaft and around 70 metres to the north. It was powered by water from the Oberer Richtschachter Graben. The old water wheel of the blind hosting shaft was another 40 metres deeper in an underground wheel room. In the Maaßen Water Shaft there was a double man engine for enabling miners to journey {{to and from the}} Lautenthals Glück Pit. These and the pumping need for water management were driven by four underground water wheels, which received their water through the Maaßen Watercourse (Maaßener Wasserlauf) which is still visible today.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} chipper design {{employs a}} steel disk with knives mounted upon {{it as the}} chipping mechanism. This technology dates back to an invention by German Heinrich Wigger, for which he obtained a patent in 1922. [...] In this design, (usually) <b>reversible</b> hydraulically powered <b>wheels</b> draw the material from the hopper towards the disk, which is mounted perpendicularly to the incoming material. As the disk spins, the knives cut the material into chips. These are thrown out the chute by flanges on the drum. This design is not as energy-efficient as the drum-style design, but produces chips of more uniform shape and size. Most chippers currently used by commercial tree care companies are disk-type.|$|R
