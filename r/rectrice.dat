50|$|At the bilingual University of Ottawa, {{the term}} {{president}} has been used since 2008, but before that time rector {{was used for the}} English name; however, recteur (or <b>rectrice)</b> continues to be used as the French term for the head of the university.|$|E
50|$|Quebec's universities, both francophone (e.g., Université de Montréal) and anglophone (e.g., Concordia University), use {{the term}} (recteur or <b>rectrice</b> in French) to {{designate}} {{the head of the}} institution. In addition, the historically French-Catholic, and now bilingual, Saint Paul University in Ottawa, Ontario uses the term to denote its head. St. Paul's College, the Roman Catholic College of the University of Manitoba, uses the term 'rector' to designate the head of the College. St. Boniface College, the French College of the University of Manitoba, uses 'recteur' or 'rectrice' to designate the head of the College.|$|E
5000|$|The whitetips are a {{small group}} of {{hummingbirds}} in the genus Urosticte, which are restricted to humid forests growing on Andean slopes in north-western South America. Their common name, whitetips, refers to the conspicuous white tips on the central <b>rectrices</b> of the males. As the central <b>rectrices</b> are shorter than the outer, it appears as a large white spot on the central uppertail. Females, which have green-spotted white underparts, lack the white tips to the central <b>rectrices,</b> but instead have broad tips to the outer <b>rectrices</b> (white [...] "tail-corners").|$|R
40|$|Greater Frigatebirds {{with eggs}} and nestlings have a {{complete}} set of primaries and rarely show active moult in <b>rectrices.</b> In the wing serial descendant moult can be recognized; moult may be interrupted at any primary. The tail moult shows no detectable pattern. Non-breeding adults and subadults were nearly all found moulting primaries and/or <b>rectrices.</b> The length of the different feather generations in the primaries is shorter in adults than in subadults. At most two primaries in one wing were found growing at the same time, whereas as many as four <b>rectrices</b> did. Some moult inner <b>rectrices</b> first, but others moult asymmetrically...|$|R
50|$|The next-to-outermost <b>rectrices</b> of {{the male}} are 15 - 18 cm long, far longer than its bearer's body. Trailing behind the flying hummingbird like thin black streamers, these {{feathers}} make a humming sound. Females lack the elongated <b>rectrices,</b> and are largely white below.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} species {{with which the}} {{mountain}} trogon might be confused; they differ primarily in the color and patterning on their tails. The male elegant trogon's tail is copper-colored (rather than green) above and finely vermiculated black and white (rather than all black) below, while the female has a white patch behind and below her eye. The male collared trogon is golden-green {{on the back and}} uppertail, and its undertail is black with narrow white barring. The female collared trogon's tail is grayish below with a narrow dark bar at the tip of each <b>rectrice.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{preservation}} of feathers {{is a rare}} phenomenon in the fossil record. In this study, we report 11 isolated feathers from the Early Cretaceous of the Konservat-Lagerstätte of Las Hoyas, Spain. Most of them are preserved as a carbonised thin layer, {{but there are also}} imprints. The specimens are relatively small, and unambiguously correspond to body contour feathers, although {{it is very difficult to}} match them to a particular taxon (among avian or non-avian theropods). Among the fossils, there is an almost complete remige, a well-preserved fragment of a possible ornamental <b>rectrice</b> feather, and possibly a semiplume. Furthermore, some specimens appear to have different colour patterns, such as stripes or patches...|$|E
5000|$|It {{has four}} long <b>rectrices</b> (flight {{feathers}} on the tail), which may represent {{an important step}} in feather evolution. For comparison, most modern birds have twelve rectrices; grouse often have more than twelve, while grebes have none. In Paraprotopteryx they may have served as a secondary sex characteristic. However, although the presence of two ribbon-like <b>rectrices</b> is certain (as in the related enantiornithine bird Protopteryx) there is a suspicion that the second pair of <b>rectrices</b> might be the result of artifice.|$|R
500|$|<b>Rectrices</b> (from the Latin for [...] "helmsman"), {{which help}} the bird to brake and steer in flight, {{lie in a}} single {{horizontal}} row on the rear margin of the anatomic tail. [...] Only the central pair are attached (via ligaments) to the tail bones; the remaining <b>rectrices</b> are embedded into the rectricial bulbs, complex structures of fat and muscle that surround those bones. [...] <b>Rectrices</b> are always paired, with {{a vast majority of}} species having six pairs. They are absent in grebes and some ratites, and greatly reduced in size in penguins. Many grouse species have more than 12 <b>rectrices.</b> Some species (including ruffed grouse, hazel grouse and common snipe) have a number that varies among individuals. Domestic pigeons have a highly variable number, due to centuries of selective breeding.|$|R
50|$|The flanks and upperparts are green, often tinged golden on {{the lower}} back and rump, while the underparts are white. The central <b>rectrices</b> are golden, while the outer <b>rectrices</b> are dark blue with narrow whitish tips.

40|$|Historic {{mines in}} New Almaden, CA {{such as the}} New Almaden Quicksilver Mine (NAQM), {{are a source of}} mercury {{contamination}} throughout South San Francisco Bay, California. Mines in this area drain into the Coyote Creek (CC) and Guadalupe River (GR). Water quality and sediment assessments for mercury show increasing levels with increasing proximity to the New Almaden. Tellingly, birds captured at upper GR and CC had some of the highest reported concentrations of mercury in the feathers and blood within the United States. Thus, organisms living within the riparian habitats along the CC, GR, and their tributaries may be affected by local environmental mercury. This study investigates of the feather mercury from Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) caught at varying distances from NAQM and the relationship between feather mercury and of body condition and individual quality. Birds in upper GR and CC and at Llagas Creek had higher mass, primary wear, and <b>rectrice</b> wear compared to birds in lower CC and GR. Bib size and fluctuating asymmetry of barbule density in rectrices was greater in birds located in CC and GR. Hue of bib feathers was significantly greater in birds caught at lower GR and CC and upper CC. Total mercury concentrations in rectrices were highest in birds caught in upper GR. All comparisons were significant with a p-value of {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05...|$|E

40|$|Moult of {{feathers}} entails considerable physiological and energetic costs to an avian organism. Even under favourable feeding conditions, endogenous body stores and energy reserves of moulting birds are usually severely depleted. Thus, most {{species of birds}} separate moult from other energy-demanding activities, such as migration or reproduction. Common snipe Gallinago gallinago is an exception, as during the first autumn migration many young snipe initiate the post-juvenile moult, which includes replacement of body feathers, lesser and median wing coverts, tertials, and rectrices. Here, we evaluated moult-related changes in blood plasma biochemistry of the common snipe {{during a period of}} serious trade-off in energy allocation between moult and migration. For this purpose, concentrations of basic metabolites in plasma were evaluated in more than 500 young snipe migrating through Central Europe. We found significant changes in the plasma concentrations of total protein, triglyceride and glucose over the course of moult, while the concentrations of uric acid and albumin did not change. Total protein concentration increased significantly in the initial stage of moult, probably as a result of increased production of keratin, but it decreased to the pre-moult level at the advanced stage of moult. Plasma triglyceride concentration decreased during the period of tertial and <b>rectrice</b> moult, which reflected depletion of endogenous fat reserves. By contrast, glucose concentration increased steadily during the course of moult, which could be caused by increased catabolism of triglycerides (via gluconeogenesis) or, alternatively, due to increased glucocorticoids as a stress response. Our results suggest that physiological changes associated with moult may be considered important determinants of the low pace of migration typical of the common snipe...|$|E

50|$|Arboreal woodpeckers, which {{depend on}} their tails—particularly the strong central pair of rectrices—for support while they feed, have a unique tail moult.
