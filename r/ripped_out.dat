5|$|At {{some point}} after the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army chartered Kentuckian for transporting animals to Europe {{in support of the}} American Expeditionary Force. Although there is no information about the specific conversion of Kentuckian, for other ships this typically meant that any passenger accommodations had to be <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.|$|E
5|$|A £1million refubishment {{got under}} way in 1985 with the {{introduction}} of artificial turf, as well as the conversion of the ground to all-seater, which began a year later in 1986. The Oak Road End was filled with seats, while the Bobbers Stand had its seats <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> to be replaced with executive boxes. The Main Stand's enclosure received seats, and work also began on converting the Kenilworth Stand, which had a roof added at this time. The stand would also receive seats in stages over the coming years.|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, El Sol was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) {{on behalf of the}} United States Army, who designated her as an animal transport ship. Although there is no information about the specific conversion of El Sol, for other ships this typically meant that any second- or third-class passenger accommodations had to be <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{greatest}} {{in the southwest}} portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm's passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent of the homes (mostly wood)on the island, leaving 75 {{percent of the population}} homeless, with many others temporarily homeless in the immediate aftermath. In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything in their path to the sea. Power lines were completely <b>ripped</b> <b>out,</b> causing the water system to stop as well.|$|E
5|$|Harvey the Hound is the Flames' mascot. He {{was created}} in 1983 to serve both with the Flames and the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Harvey was the first mascot in the NHL. Harvey is famous for an {{incident}} in January 2003 where he had his tongue <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> by Edmonton Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish as he was harassing their bench. The incident made headlines throughout North America and led to much humour, including having many other NHL team mascots arrive at the 2003 All-Star Game with their tongues hanging out.|$|E
5|$|Prometheus– Punished by Zeus {{for giving}} mankind the Fires of Olympus, Prometheus was made mortal, and was {{attacked}} by an eagle that <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> and ate his liver, which regrew instantly, on a daily basis. Kratos encountered Prometheus near Typhon's lair. Prometheus was eventually freed by Kratos, died by self-immolation in fire, and his ashes empowered Kratos, giving him the ability called the Rage of the Titans. The character was voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in God of War II.|$|E

5|$|Before any troop {{transportation}} {{could be}} undertaken, {{all of the}} ships were hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, ten, including Henry R. Mallory, were designated to carry human passengers; the other four were designated as animal ships. The ten ships designated to carry troops had all of their second- and third-class accommodations <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> and replaced with berths for troops. Cooking and toilet facilities were greatly expanded to handle {{the large numbers of}} men aboard. Gun platforms were installed on each ship before docking at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to have the guns themselves installed. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for {{the race}} were overshadowed by {{speculation}} over IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard's job, after he tweeted that some team owners {{were trying to get}} him fired. Dixon claimed pole position {{for the race}}, the first IndyCar event in Detroit since 2008, and maintained his lead throughout the race. After 38 laps, James Hinchcliffe hit a dislodged piece of the track and continued straight into the tire wall. Further investigation discovered that the track was disintegrating in various places, and the event was red flagged. After a two-hour break, in which track officials <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> the damaged sections of track and filled the holes with concrete, the race was restarted, shortened to 60 laps. Rain also started to fall lightly, and shortly after the restart a caution was issued when Hélio Castroneves spun. Dario Franchitti gained four places after the red flag, benefiting from his softer red tires, to finish second behind his teammate.|$|E
5|$|The {{strong winds}} left {{considerable}} tree and powerline damage. At {{the worst of}} the storm, 23,000 of the island's 30,000power subscribers were without electricity. Damage to power lines totaled to $385,000 (2001USD, $468,700 2008USD). The strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation. Three cruise ships weathered the storm at Saint George Harbour, where the powerful winds <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> a post and snapped a mooring line, leaving a ship drifting in the harbor. One crew member was minorly injured. Over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings, resulting in them running aground or sinking. In all, 87boats were affected to some degree, with marine damage totaling to about $665,000 (2001USD, $809,600 2008USD). The winds also caused minor damage to 175properties on the island, primarily to houses. Damage to houses amounted to about $425,000 (2001USD, $517,400 2008USD). Overall damage was moderate, totaling to about $1.4million (2001USD, $1.7million 2008USD). No fatalities were reported, though a few storm-related injuries occurred.|$|E

Gorge revealed {{that she was}} his blood-mother, and he would help her Ascension. Feeling {{she had to leave}} the weaknesses of her humanity behind she partially destroyed the Isis International buildings. Gorge showed her that the power of all she had killed was at her disposal. She also saw Rath's creation at the hands of Satrina and suspected that they were still in league. Tracking him to the Serengeti, she killed Rubicante by <b>ripping</b> <b>out</b> his spine, but Rath revealed that he was actually here to help her.|$|R
5|$|Each dream {{acts as a}} {{character}} study, exploring the fears and future of the dreamer. Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each is killed {{is directly related to}} the role they had assumed when melding with Buffy in the previous episode—that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character's essence. Willow's card had been Spiritus, representing her magical powers; she is killed by having her spirit sucked out of her. Xander's card had been Animus, representing his heart; he is killed by having his heart <b>ripped</b> <b>out.</b> Giles had been represented by the card Sophus, a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher; he is killed by being scalped. Buffy's card, Manus, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the stalker is revealed as the primitive, first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a key difference between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, the British {{steamship}} Rosina {{encountered the}} hurricane. The storm damaged the pipes and smokestacks, <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> the ventilator, and washed 30,000oranges into the sea. Additionally, a Greek sailor was swept overboard and presumably drowned. The storm sunk or drove many ships ashore along the Yucatán Peninsula. Communications were disrupted {{in many areas}} after telegraph lines fell, while a number of roads were left impassible after trees toppled. In the Tampico area, there was considerable damage to the port and many ships being sunk or driven ashore. All of the bridges along Monterey and Mexican Gulf Railroad were destroyed. The roof at the general market was almost completely torn off. Many of the businesses suffered serious losses after rain subsequently poured in the building, with damage reaching at least $4,200 (10,000pesos). The chamber of commerce building collapsed with people inside, though no injuries or deaths occurred. Much of the land between Tampico and Cárdenas in San Luis Potosí was submerged due to flooding. In Barra, a city in Tamaulipas, the hospital was nearly destroyed, as was the marketplace. In San Luis Potosí, the casino and restaurant in Tamasopo were demolished. Twenty bridges were destroyed in San Luis Potosí. Railroad traffic between San Luis Potosí and Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo León, was completely disrupted.|$|E
5|$|The year 1912 saw {{a marked}} {{increase}} in militant action in Wales. Anger at {{the defeat of}} the Conciliation Bills saw the WPSU disrupt a speech by Lloyd George at the Pavilion in Caernarfon. The protesters, male and female, were treated harshly with clothes torn and hair <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> and were beaten by sticks and umbrellas. Later that year Lloyd George was again heckled by suffragettes whilst delivering a speech at the National Eisteddfod. Just two weeks later {{one of the most notorious}} events in the history of suffrage in Wales took place, when Lloyd George returned to his home town of Llanystumdwy to open the village hall. No sooner had he started speaking than he was interrupted by the cries of 'Votes for Women!' The hecklers were violently assaulted by the crowd. One was stripped to the waist before being rescued and another was almost thrown off a bridge to be dashed on the rocks of the River Dwyfor below. As trouble was anticipated the national press was present and the Daily Mirror and Illustrated London News devoted a full page of photographs to the incident. The local press not only attacked the suffragettes, but poured scorn on the crowd for tarnishing the image of a peaceful, Nonconformist, chapel-going Wales. The event is seen as the most dramatic event in the history of Women's suffrage in Wales.|$|E

5|$|The tornado {{continued}} northeast, becoming {{large and}} wedge-shaped. It then passed {{just north of}} Fairview, completely destroying multiple homes and debarking numerous hardwood trees. Pieces of debris were found speared through vehicles in this area. The tornado then briefly passed through a section of Morgan County {{near the town of}} Hulaco, destroying several older block-foundation homes and snapping numerous large trees off at the base. The tornado then crossed into Marshall County and impacted the rural community of Ruth, just north of Arab. A large but poorly-anchored brick home was swept completely away in this area, with the debris scattered 100 yards from the foundation. Several large trees on the property were <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> of the ground and missing, along with a trailer that was unable to be located {{at the time of the}} survey. Multiple other homes and structures were impacted in the Ruth area, and a gas station was completely destroyed. A shed was destroyed with pieces of large farm machinery stored inside thrown up to 20 yards away, a storage trailer was tossed 100 yards and found impaled by multiple planks of wood, and concrete power poles in the area were bent over. Arab's power grid was completely crippled by the tornado's effects, and many roads in the area were obstructed by downed trees and power lines. The tornado damaged and destroyed several other homes, garages, and sheds north of Union Grove before it crossed the Tennessee River, snapping numerous trees in a forested area before dissipating.|$|E

25|$|Again a {{human rights}} {{commission}} condemned the cramped conditions, so the government had the bars taken off the individual cells, and let the inmates move freely within each cell block. A prison riot in 1984 largely refigured the internal structure of the prison, and left the inmates with a greater measure of freedom to move around {{within the confines of}} the jail. The riot took place on the lower security lower floors; the maximum security cell blocks remained intact. The inmates <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> the toilets in their cells to assure they would not be limited to individual cells again; they <b>ripped</b> <b>out</b> the glass in the visitors booths to assure direct contact with visitors. And they began knocking holes out of the outer walls to communicate between floors and gain access to sunlight. This also gave them a direct way of communicating with the outside world. According to neighbors who lived in apartments across the street from the prison during the 1980s and 1990s, girlfriends, mothers, brothers, friends, would fill the streets below the prison every day to chat with their loved ones living inside its walls.|$|E
