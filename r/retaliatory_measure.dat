25|$|Furthermore, {{through their}} privateering activities, which {{apparently}} did not spare neutral powers, the Hollanders had come into conflict with the rich and very influential trade city of Hamburg, which confiscated a fleet of 52 Hollandic ships as a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> {{in the autumn of}} 1399. Holland regarded this as a declaration of war, and the situation on the seas this resulted in, brought trade along the North Sea coast virtually to a standstill. In the spring of 1401 Hamburg fitted out a large fleet, apparently to take the war to the coasts of Holland. That it did not come to that was due to mediation by the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Thorn, and Stralsund, who negotiated a truce, which eventually led to a peace that went into effect in 1403, after arbitration by the Flemish city of Ghent.|$|E
25|$|On November 6, 2017, Stephenson {{met with}} Makan Delrahim, {{assistant}} Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division, to discuss antitrust and concentration of media ownership concerns surrounding the acquisition, and possible options for satisfying them. Two days later, major media outlets publicly {{reported that the}} Justice Department had recommended that either the entire Turner Broadcasting group, or DirecTV, be divested {{as a condition of}} the merger. The Financial Times went further, stating that it had specifically demanded the divestment of CNN. Stephenson denied these reports, stating that he never offered to, nor had any intentions to sell CNN. CNN's media analyst Brian Stelter noted that media outlets were interpreting the alleged recommendations as being either a genuine concern for AT's scale following the merger, or a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> by the Trump administration against CNN.|$|E
25|$|In June 2017, the Senate voted 98 to 2 for a {{bill that}} had been {{initially}} drafted in January by a bipartisan group of senators over Russia′s continued involvement in the wars in Ukraine and Syria and its meddling in the 2016 election that envisaged sanctions on Russia as well as Iran, and North Korea; the bill would expand the punitive measures previously imposed by executive orders and convert them into law. An identical bill was introduced by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in July and passed in the house on July 25, with 419 votes in favor and 3 against. On July 27, the bill was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate, which provoked Russia′s president Putin into pledging response to ″this kind of insolence towards our country″. On August 2, president Donald Trump signed the bill into law (the ″Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act″). Simultaneously, the president issued two separate, simultaneous statements. One of those said, ″While I favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed. In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions″. The law forbids the president from lifting earlier sanctions without first consulting Congress, giving them time to reverse such a move. It targets Russia's defense industry by harming Russia's ability to export weapon, and allows the U.S. to sanction international companies that work to develop Russian energy resources. One of Trump′s statements noted that ″by limiting the Executive’s flexibility, this bill {{makes it harder for}} the United States to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together.″ The proposed sanctions also caused harsh criticism and threats of <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> {{on the part of the}} European Union.|$|E

2500|$|During {{all parts}} of the war, use of {{chemical}} and biological weapons were extremely limited, by both sides, [...] Italy used mustard gas and phosgene during the short Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Germany employed chemical agents such as Zyklon B against Jews, political prisoners and other victims in extermination camps during the Holocaust, and Japan employed chemical and biological weapons in China. In 1943 a U.S. ship carrying [...] a secret Chemical Warfare Service cargo of mustard gas as a precationary <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> was sunk in an air raid in Italy, causing 83 deaths and about 600 hospitalized military victims plus a larger number of civilian casualties. Generally speaking, World War II was conducted (1939–1945) without use of chemical or biological weapons on the conventional battlefield, and certainly not on the scale of the use of poison gas during World War I.|$|E

Despite receiving a plural majority (40-25-13), this second resolution failed to gain a two-thirds majority.

That month, the Indonesian Communist Party and affiliated trade unions lobbied for retaliatory economic measures against the Dutch. On 26 November 1957, a third Indonesian resolution on the West New Guinea dispute was put to the vote but failed to gain a two-thirds majority (41-29-11).

50|$|Eventually, the PAP {{decided to}} {{challenge}} {{the policies of the}} Central Government directly, both as a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> and to further its ideological grounds. It ran in the April 1964 Malaysian federal elections in coalition with other parties under the Malaysian Solidarity Council. The PAP was now a legitimate opposition party in the federal elections, and campaigned on a platform of eliminating racialism and a Malaysian Malaysia. Their rallies attracted large crowds. They decided to contest a minority of the seats however, to avoid any perception that they were trying to undermine the ruling party or being seen as agents of instability. The PAP only won one seat and 2.05% of the vote.|$|E

Of these 60,000, approximately 7,182 lost their citizenship between 1981 and 1997. The application of this law to the Turks of Western Thrace was a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> {{in response to the}} devastating state-sponsored pogrom which targeted the Greeks of Istanbul in September 1955.

50|$|One of {{the biggest}} Nazi raids {{to be held in}} the Netherlands during World War II took place in Putten. On 1 October and 2 October 1944, 661 men and boys, the {{majority}} of the male population, were deported from the town and 602 of them were sent to work in concentration camps such as Neuengamme and Birkenau. Five hundred and forty of them died in concentration camps and only 49 survived to return after the war. Following the war, two of the responsible German officers were tried and convicted for this action. The raids were a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> for an attack by the local resistance, that killed one Wehrmacht officer near Nijkerk. The first and second of October are commemorated every year. A war memorial at Putten Church and a memorial garden (Vrouwtje van Putten Herdenkingshof) commemorate the event and the loss of life.|$|E

The country formally became a vassal to the Ottoman Empire in 1538; it almost completely preserved its self-rule but needed to pay an ever-increasing annual tribute. During this failed military campaign, Bălţi, due to its crossroads location, served as a major headquarters of the Russian army and parts of the Moldavian armies. The town was again burned to the ground: according to one version, this was done as a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> by Nohai Tatars; according to another account, the burning was done by the retreating Russians.|$|E
