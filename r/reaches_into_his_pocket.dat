His memory of Cuddy staying by his side at his apartment was not real, and, in fact, he spent the night popping pills by himself. Hallucinations of Amber and Kutner then appear and tell House that while the story he invented about himself is nice, it's not true. House finally looks at Cuddy and is able to fearfully tell her that he is not okay.|$|E

The blood rushed to Hippolytes heart with such force that he was near fainting. The new purse, substituted for his own, and which contained his fifteen Louis dor, was worked with gilt beads. The rings and tassels bore witness to Adélaïdes good taste, and she had no doubt spent all her little hoard in ornamenting this pretty piece of work. It was impossible to say with greater delicacy that the painters gift could only be repaid by some proof of affection." [...] There and then Hipployte asks for Adélaïdes hand in marriage.|$|E

There he hopes to find a young prostitute whom he had loved, Slenje, but she is dead. He is seduced by Elva, who has been [...] "experimented upon" [...] when Winho was occupied by enemy troops. According to her, their enemies are the real whores, not prostitutes like herself. He enjoys the sex, but several incidents disturb him beyond his momentary flashes of synesthesia: Elva's legs are bizarrely scarred, her teeth have been filed into points; when her year-old boy in the next room cries because he has hurt his hand, Elva soothes him by sucking his little hand into her mouth; while Elva pleasures the soldier, he [...] "visualized her as some monstrous animal, chewing into my gut. It was the most hideous image of woman." [...] The next day, boarding a ferry, the soldier realizes that Elva had teased his torso with her teeth; these are now becoming open wounds. When he <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> to pay the ferryman, a tiny child's hand, severed at the wrist, seizes his fingers and will not let go.

She makes her way to a cafeteria and takes a salad, and pays for it while informing the waiter that she may not have enough money. After she sits down, she realizes that she has no cutlery, and returns to the service counter for a fork. When she comes back, she finds an African American man who appears to be homeless sitting down and eating a salad. She sits down and informs the man that that is her salad. He ignores her at first then laughs at her continued protests. She then attempts to take the salad away from him, at which point he slams his fist on the table and yells, frightening her. She watches him eat for several moments, not sure what else to do. Finally, the woman grabs her fork and snatches a piece of salad off of the plate. The man does not stop her, and she does it again and again. The man begins to mimic the way she eats and together they finish the salad. Afterwards, the man gets up and returns with two cups (assumed to be tea or coffee), and offers her sugar, which she declines. He then <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and pulls out a packet, which she accepts, opens, and puts in her drink.

5000|$|The {{next segment}} of his dream {{involves}} Tony waking up {{at home and}} {{getting ready to go}} to dinner with Carmela to meet Finn DeTrolio's parents at Nuovo Vesuvio, and Tony distractedly watching clips from several films on the kitchen television, including Chinatown and Scrooge. When they finally arrive at the restaurant, Finn's father is actually the deceased Detective Vin Makazian. Actress Annette Bening has taken the role of Finn's mother in the dream. Finn occasionally turns into A.J. during the course of the dinner, whenever they discuss their disappointment with Finn. Next, Tony's teeth start to fall out spontaneously. Vin Makazian/Mr. DeTrolio then starts singing [...] "Three Times a Lady" [...] and everyone at the table is enamored by his singing, except Tony, who tries to get Annette Bening's attention until she gets angry with him. Tony and Finn's father then go to the restroom. When Tony enters the bathroom stall, he reaches behind the vintage style toilet tank looking for a gun which is not there, an allusion to The Godfather. Vin then asks Tony, [...] "Are you gonna be able to come through on the thing?" [...] Tony replies, [...] "I did my homework," [...] <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> and takes out a paperback copy of The Valachi Papers. Then, Tony hears shots firing outside and when he gets past a huge crowd, he sees Tony B shooting Phil Leotardo in his car. Gloria Trillo, now apparently a reporter, takes an interview from the dying Phil who comments that he has children and grandchildren before Tony B mimes shooting him dead with his fingers shaped as a gun. A bystander shouts, [...] "Why didn't you stop him?" [...] to which Tony says he doesn't have a weapon, but the crowd bears down on Tony. Suddenly, day turns into night and he starts running from an angry mob, which includes Annette Bening, Carmela, Paulie Walnuts, Harold Melvoin and many other familiar faces of people who are alive; some of the mob are wearing period German clothing and carrying torches and pitchforks, a la Frankenstein. Tony runs down a long, dark alleyway, and Lee Harvey Oswald shoots at him with a high-powered rifle from a third floor window. At the end of the alley an ominous black SUV is idling, playing rap music. Suddenly Artie Bucco pops out of a nearby door, and he and Tony escape together, again in his father's old car, this time with Artie driving. Tony looks in the backseat and sees the deceased Richie Aprile and Gigi Cestone, two former Aprile Crew capos who had met their demise shortly after taking control of the [...] "cursed" [...] crew. Tony is then suddenly having wild sex with Artie's wife Charmaine Bucco, who is sucking Tony's thumb while Artie coaches him along. The dream jumps suddenly to Tony then appearing in his living room mounted on top of his racehorse Pie-O-My and Tony is affectionately rubbing the horse's neck. He tells Carmela he wants to move back in. Carmela replies by repeating her response when A.J. asked to move back home: [...] "There are some non-negotiable conditions." [...] In this case, the condition is that the horse can no longer stay in the house since Tony never cleans up after it. (Although Carmela's comment, [...] "You can't have your horse in here," [...] sounds like it is spoken as [...] "whores," [...] an apparent reference to Tony's history of infidelity, which led to their separation at the end of Season Four.) ...|$|E
