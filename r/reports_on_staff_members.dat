40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Educational Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Psychological {{violence}} is currently {{emerging as a}} priority concern in all workplaces owing to its serious negative consequences on victims? health. This study, using a cross–sectional mixed–methodology, investigates the nature and impact of psychological violence <b>on</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members?</b> health at FET Colleges and how they cope with it. Based on the findings, preventative and supportive strategies are proposed to address and ameliorate <b>staff</b> <b>members?</b> experiences of psychological violence and the impact thereof on all contexts of their health. Two instruments were used to collect quantitative data, namely a Psychological Violence Scale that has been developed, and a Symptom Checklist. These instruments were distributed simultaneously to the study population of 262 academic and administration <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> at FET Colleges. Purposive sampling was used and the sample size of 174 respondents returned the completed instruments. Twenty–nine respondents indicated their willingness to be individually interviewed for the qualitative part of the study. Quantitative findings indicated that psychological {{violence is}} prevalent in FET Colleges, which is experienced severely and originates mostly from superiors. The most prevalent and severe forms of psychological violence experienced by <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> include: excessive pressure to produce more work; being given unreasonable deadlines; being exposed to unmanageable workload; more tasks assigned to one as opposed to other <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> at similar post levels and complaints that fall on deaf ears. The most prevalent and severe experiences of <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> as determined by factor analysis include: unfair demands and lack of recognition, work excessively monitored, dysfunctional corporate communication and autocracy and intimidation. The respondents experienced new health symptoms emerging since the onset of psychological violence, namely: feeling chronically fatigued/tired, loss of concentration, disrupted sleep, feeling edgy, irritable, easily startled, constantly on guard, panic, stress headaches, depression and thinking about being violent toward others. Qualitative findings indicated that participants experienced managerial abuse as dysfunctional corporate communication, abusive verbal and non–verbal communication, dysfunctional conduct, disengagement, structural violence, dysfunctional management and unfair demands. Abuse experienced from the Department of Education includes; excessive pressure, intimidation, poor planning and the ineffective implementation of the new curriculum. Colleagues of equal status abused by means of inappropriate conduct, students abused through dysfunctional conduct and subordinates abused through disengagement. vii Psychological violence impacted negatively on the psychological, biophysical, spiritual, ecological and metaphysical health contexts of <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> Witnesses to psychological violence (secondary psychological violence) were perceived as conforming to avoid bullying owing to fear of becoming the next target. Findings from both datasets confirmed that <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> at FET Colleges experience psychological violence in various forms in that it {{has an impact on}} their health and that they have limited strategies with which to cope. Based on the findings, a number of preventative and supportive strategies are recommended on national, organisational, leadership, group, interpersonal and individual levels to address psychological violence at FET Colleges and to ameliorate its impact <b>on</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members?</b> health. This study contributes significantly towards the psychological violence literature in general and in particular, FET Colleges. The innovative multi–level preventative and supportive strategies forthcoming from this study are imperative to address psychological violence in workplaces and to ameliorate its impact <b>on</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members?</b> health.

Methods <b>Staff</b> <b>members</b> recruited from workshops completed a self-report inventory of emotional reactions to patients, the Feeling Word Checklist- 58, and substance abusers completed a self-report of DSM-IV personality disorder, the DSM-IV and ICD- 10 Personality Disorder Questionnaire. Correlational analysis and multiple regression analysis was used to assess the associations between personality disorders and emotional reations. Results Cluster B disorder features were associated with feeling distance to patients, and cluster C disorder features were associated with feeling helpful towards patients. Cluster A disorders had no significant impact on emotional reactions. Conclusion The findings confirm clinical experiences that personality disorder features in patients with substance abuse have an impact <b>on</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> reactions to them.

[...] The policy also provides that all on-the-record media interactions be reported to division/office management, as was urged under the former policy.

40|$|Background: Formaldehyde can be toxic, {{allergenic}} and carcinogenic. Evaporation of formaldehyde from formalin-treated cadavers in {{the anatomy}} dissection rooms can produce high exposure. This {{study was conducted}} to assess acute and chronic toxic effects of formalin-treated cadavers <b>on</b> medical students, <b>staff</b> <b>members,</b> and workers at the Anatomy department in the Alexandria Faculty of Medicine (AFM). Methods: A cross sectional approach was adopted to investigate medical students (n =  454). <b>Staff</b> <b>members</b> and workers at the Anatomy department (n =  16), and unexposed <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> and workers in the AFM (n =  19) were included in the study. Medical students filled self-administered predesigned questionnaire. Formalin-exposed and unexposed <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> filled a questionnaire and a Complete Blood Count was done for them. Results: The most frequently reported symptoms by medical students were unpleasant smell (91. 2 %), itching in the eyes (81. 3 %), and excessive lacrimation (76. 1 %). Majority of them reported duration of relief within one hour (> 80 %), and more than two thirds reported wearing laboratory coats and hand gloves. Formalin-exposed staff reported symptoms of skin disorders as drying (75 %), eczema (68. 8 %), and allergic contact dermatitis (87. 5 %), besides, eye irritation (68. 8 %), respiratory tract irritation (93. 8 %), and work-related bronchial asthma (53. 3 %). The mean RBCs and platelets counts were significantly lower among formalin-exposed staff (4. 08  ±  0. 65  ×  106 /ul and 237, 375  ±  71745. 73 /ul respectively) compared with unexposed staff (4. 95  ±  0. 50  ×  106 /ul and 280473. 68  ±  54456. 27 /ul respectively). WBCs count was abnormal (low or high) among formalin-exposed <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> (6. 2 %, and 18. 8 % respectively), while all unexposed staff had normal WBCs counts. Conclusion: The research highlighted the irritating action of formalin on medical students, and chronic toxic effects <b>on</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> This necessitates re-evaluation of the concentration of formalin, proper ventilation and assessment of working practices in the dissecting rooms at the Anatomy department...|$|R

This article uses the 1995 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities to examine claims of improved quality.
