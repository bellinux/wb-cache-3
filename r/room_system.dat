5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat <b>room</b> <b>system,</b> they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
25|$|The first {{practical}} vapour-compression {{refrigeration system}} {{was built by}} James Harrison, a British journalist who had emigrated to Australia. His 1856 patent was for a vapour-compression system using ether, alcohol, or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 {{on the banks of}} the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong, Victoria, and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapour-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat-packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation. He later entered the debate of how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated beef sales to the United Kingdom. In 1873 he prepared the sailing ship Norfolk for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom, which used a cold <b>room</b> <b>system</b> instead of a refrigeration system. The venture was a failure as the ice was consumed faster than expected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — ITU-T Rec. H. 32 x {{is still}} the {{predominant}} standards family for video conferencing <b>room</b> <b>systems</b> and multipoint controller units (MCU). Although most MCUs and <b>room</b> <b>systems</b> support SIP as a second signaling protocol some more advanced functionality is available with H. 323 signaling only. Analysis reveals that {{this seems to be}} not due to missing, standardized signaling primitives. Lack of broad support of these features in existing end points and infrastructure components and the fear of potential interoperability issues seem to hinder their adoption...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} {{concept in}} the context of state machines is the execution model of run-to-completion. That means that an actor is processing a message completely before it accepts the next message. Since the run-to-completion semantics is guaranteed by the execution environment, the programmer/modeler doesn't have to deal with classical thread synchronization. And this despite the fact that typical <b>ROOM</b> <b>systems</b> are highly concurrent because of the asynchronous communication.And maybe its worth to stress that the asynchronous nature of <b>ROOM</b> <b>systems</b> is not by accident but reflects the inherent asynchronicity of e.g. the machine being controlled by the software. Definitely this requires another mind set than the one that is needed for functional programming of synchronous systems.But after a short while of getting accustomed it will be evident that asynchronously communicating state machines are perfectly suited for control software.|$|R
