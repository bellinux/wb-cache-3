5000|$|According to {{the works}} of Cacciatori, Gorini and Kamenshchik, [...] and Bacry and Lévi-Leblond and the {{references}} therein, if you take Minkowski's ideas to their logical conclusion then not only are boosts non-commutative but translations are also non-commutative. This means that the symmetry group of space time is a de Sitter group rather than the Poincaré group. This results in spacetime being slightly curved {{even in the absence}} of matter or energy. This <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> is caused by a cosmological constant to be determined by observation. Due to the small magnitude of the constant, then special relativity with the Poincaré group is more than accurate enough for all practical purposes, although near the big bang and inflation de Sitter relativity may be more useful due to the cosmological constant being larger back then. Note this is not the same thing as solving Einstein's field equations for general relativity to get a de Sitter Universe, rather the de Sitter relativity is about getting a de Sitter Group for special relativity which neglects gravity.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to obtain critical insight {{on the role of}} crystalline incompatibilities in strain and curvature, induced in presence of line defects i. e. dislocations and disclinations, on the energy and geometry of specific features of the local microstructure, and on the bulk mechanical response of nanocrystalline/ultra-fine grained materials. To that end, studies are performed at the (1) inter-atomic and fine scale, and (2) at the mesoscale. The modelling approach is based on the field dislocation and disclination mechanics theory of continuously representated dislocations and disclinations. New, thermodynamically rigorous, multi-scale elastic constitutive laws based on the couple stress theory are developed to capture the effect of strain and curvature incompatibilities on the Cauchy and couple stresses. A new meso-scale elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model of defect incompatibilities based on a fast Fourier transform technique is developed. The desired scale transitioning is achieved via novel phenomenological defect density transport equations and the newly developed elastic constitutive laws. At the fine scale, the model is applied to study energetic interactions between strain and curvature incompatibilities associated with grain boundaries and their influence on triple line energies. Results reveal that incompatible lattice strains have the most significant contribution to the energy. Incompatible lattice curvatures have negligible energetic contributions but are necessary to characterize the geometry of grain boundaries. Finally, both incompatible lattice strains and curvatures are necessary to capture the structure sensitive mechanical behavior of grain boundaries. At the mesoscale, deformation of nanocrystalline aggregates characterized by <b>residual</b> <b>curvatures</b> is studied to identify the impact of the latter's presence on the local and bulk mechanical response of the aggregate. Relaxation of local stresses generated from <b>residual</b> <b>curvatures</b> reproduces the effect of GB dislocation emission. Uniaxial tensile loading of nanocrystalline microstructures containing <b>residual</b> <b>curvatures</b> reveals a softening in the yield stress which could explain the breakdown in Hall-Petch law in the nanocrystalline regime. Next, the possibility of characterizing incompatibilities using X-ray or neutron diffraction techniques is tested. Results reveal that only strains and their gradients contribute to the broadening of diffraction peaks; curvatures and their gradients have no contribution.

40|$|Real cloth {{exhibits}} bending effects, such as <b>residual</b> <b>curvatures</b> {{and permanent}} wrinkles. These are typically explained by bending plastic deformation due to internal friction in the ﬁbre and yarn structure. Internal friction also {{gives rise to}} energy dissipation which signiﬁcantly affects cloth dynamic behaviour. In textile research, hysteresis is used to analyse these effects, and can be modelled using complex friction terms at the fabric geometric structure level. The hysteresis loop {{is central to the}} modelling and understanding of elastic and inelastic (plastic) behaviour, and is often measured as a physical characteristic to analyse and predict fabric behaviour. However, in cloth simulation in computer graphics the use of hysteresis to capture these effects has not been reported so far. Existing approaches have typically used plasticity models for simulating plastic deformation. In this paper, we report on our investigation into experiments using a simple mathematical approximation to an ideal hysteresis loop at a high level to capture the previously mentioned effects. Fatigue weakening effects during repeated ﬂexural deformation are also considered based on the hysteresis model. Comparisons with previous bending models and plasticity methods are provided to point out differences and advantages. The method requires only incremental extra computation time...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In a {{companion}} paper [1] a process model {{was developed for}} investigation of residual stress development during autoclave or hot press processing of thermosetting polymer matrix composites. Several material property characterization studies are re-quired as input to this model. The present paper summarizes {{the results of the}} character-ization studies required for input to the model and validation of the model is accomplished by the intermittent cure of unsymmetric cross-ply laminates in which the processing-induced <b>residual</b> <b>curvatures</b> are measured. An IM 6 / 3100 graphite/bismaleimide composite system was chosen for the study. Longi-tudinal and transverse mechanical properties were shown to increase during the cure cycle due to increase in matrix strength and stiffness and development of the fiber/matrix bond. Thermal strains were shown to remain relatively constant during cure. Chemical strains occur early in the cure cycle and are completed before cure is fully developed. The vis-coelastic mechanical response of BMI is strongly dependent on the cure state. At low cure states the creep response is quite significant. As full cure is approached, the material becomes predominantly elastic. Based on the measured input data, the viscoelastic analy-sis showed that the contribution of chemical strains to residual stress was less than 4 % for a typical cure cycle. A good correlation was obtained between model predictions and ex-perimental warpage data for the cure cycle investigated. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 8, 2016 jcm. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R

40|$|Offshore {{pipelines}} under operating loads, i. e. under {{high temperature}} and pressure, {{are exposed to}} expansion and compressive forces, which may cause the pipeline to buckle globally. If significant lateral motion and excessive feed-in occurs at a specific location, the pipeline may form a sharp twist of high curvature where the resulting strain may be very large to initiate structural failure. Commonly used mitigation measures in the offshore industry are by continuous burial or rock damping to avoid buckling of the pipeline completely; and by using various methods to trigger lateral buckling in a controlled and effective manner at a relatively low axial compressive force, for example snake lay, artificial vertical imperfections & buoyancy modules. These mitigation measures require the implementation of additional methods on the seabed, which often appear with significant cost. Recent developments have shown how the use of intermittent <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> sections during reel-lay installation of pipelines {{can be used to}} control global pipeline thermal buckling in the operational phase. The method was first implemented in Statoil’s Skuld project in the Norwegian sea in 2012. Results have shown that every section of the <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> is triggered as expected and ensured the sharing of thermal expansion. No additional methods were required to ensure the utilization within acceptable criteria. The method was found to be rewarding and cost effective than the above mentioned conventional mitigation methods. The <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> sections are created as under-straightened sections in the vertical plane at the straightener of the reel-lay vessel. These convex upward residual sections create an additional imperfection in the pipeline and lead to pipe roll as it moves through the under-bend due to reversed bending. If the RCM is to be used effectively as a means for lateral buckling control, the <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> sections should acquire a position of stable equilibrium by ending the roll in the horizontal plane at the seabed. The tendency of the pipeline to bend and roll due to the <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> sections introduced on the reel ship can be estimated by energy approach. The total work done from the water surface to the seabed TDP is the sum of the bending and roll contribution. After initiating roll, the pipeline ends up in an equilibrium position when the total estimated work done is minimum and the corresponding angle gives the roll angle. Considering the aspects discussed above, the current work focuses on an analytical energy approach method for the estimation of the total work done to bend and twist the pipeline from the surface to the seabed; and estimate pipeline roll at the seabed TDP. Sensitivity studies of various parameters are carried out based on single pipe sections of 12 ” ID & 14 ” ID as well as 18 ” OD pipe-in-pipe in water depth of 360 m, 800 m and 1200 m.

A retrospective followup study was per formed on the long-term results of a group of 94 patients disabled by hypospadias.

The techniques used to solve these problems were circumferential advancement of penile skin, dorsal transposition flap of preputial skin, distally based transposition flap of penile skin, and full-thickness skin graft. Between one and nine operations were needed to achieve the desired result (mean and median of two operations). The complications after these procedures were 11 fistulas in nine patients, meatal stenosis caused by tight scarring in six patients, and a <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> after an orthoplasty that had to be released once before a urethroplasty could be performed.

40|$|Kinetic mixing {{between the}} metric and scalar {{degrees of freedom}} is an {{essential}} ingredient in contemporary scalar-tensor theories. This often makes hard to understand their physical content, especially when derivative mixing is present, {{as it is the}} case for Horndeski action. In this work we develop a method that allows to write a Ricci curvature-free scalar field equation and discuss some of the advantages of such rephrasing in the study of stability issues in the presence of matter, the existence of an Einstein frame and the generalization of the disformal screening mechanism. For quartic Horndeski theories, such procedure leaves, in general, a <b>residual</b> coupling to <b>curvature,</b> given by the Weyl tensor. This gives rise to a binary classification of scalar-tensor theories into stirred theories, for which the curvature can be substituted for, and shaken theories for which a <b>residual</b> coupling to <b>curvature</b> remains. Quite remarkably, we have found that generalized DBI Galileons belong to the first class. Finally, we discuss kinetic mixing in quintic theories for which non-linear mixing terms appears and in the recently proposed theories beyond Horndeski which display a novel form of kinetic mixing, in which the field equation is sourced by derivatives of the energy-momentum tensor.

40|$|In this paper, we give a {{conceptual}} explanation of dark energy {{as a small}} negative <b>residual</b> scalar <b>curvature</b> present even in empty spacetime. This curvature ultimately results from postulating a discrete spacetime geometry, very closely related to that used in the dynamical triangulations approach to quantum gravity. In this model, there are no states which have total scalar curvature exactly zero. Moreover, numerical evidence in dimension three suggests that, at a fixed volume, the number of discrete-spacetime microstates strongly increases with decreasing curvature. Because of the resulting entropic force, any dynamics which push empty spacetime strongly toward zero scalar curvature would instead produce typically observed states with a small negative curvature. This provides a natural explanation for the empirically observed small positive value for the cosmological constant (Lambda is about 10 ^(- 121) in Planck units.) In fact, we derive the very rough estimate Lambda= 10 ^(- 187) from a simple model containing only the two (highly-degenerate) quantum states with total scalar-curvature closest to zero.

In most cases, after release of all known causes of chordee, “residual” penile curvature can persist.

40|$|Umbilical is a {{hardware}} element {{that connects the}} subsea systems to the top side systems of a floating production unit. During its manufacture, storage and installation, sometimes it shows behaviour like snake as found {{in three of the}} Aker Solution s umbilical Agbami, Droshky and kipper in three different situations. An umbilical passes through many operations in the manufacturing plant like bundling, extrusion, reeling on and off the storage drum, transfer into installation vessel from storage reel. Different types of loading phenomenon may appear in these stages of operation. And from these loads even before being in the operation field, umbilical can experience different type of deformation in the manufacturing plant. Curvature is the main source of umbilical deformation in the manufacturing field. Curvature may introduce directly in the umbilical from operation loads of straightener, creeping or squeezing effect in tensioner. Curvature may also arise from internal friction and unbalanced bending moment which arises from design i. e. orientation, geometry and material property of the internal structural components. To find the solutions of avoiding different deformations at the different stages of the manufacturing plant and to ensure desire comfortable handling, it is necessary to predict their behaviours correctly at different loading conditions. Exact analytical and numerical modelling is needed to find and predict the exact behaviours. In this thesis work, number of modelling and simulations have been done in software USAP and BFLEX to investigate the reason of snaking behaviour of three umbilicals, occurred in the manufacturing plant of Aker Solutions. From the results of simulations it has found that umbilical Agbami experienced snaking when it was transferring from storage reel for installation work, due to having <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> from storage reel, gravity load and twisting rotation. The reason of <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> is creeping of its outersheath. Umbilical Droshky showed snaking deformation because of having <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> in its component steel tubes.

Materials and methods From March 1997 to March 2000 primary repairs were carried out on 40 boys (mean age 4. 5 years) with proximal hypospadias. After degloving the penile skin the meatus was at the mid-shaft in 10 boys, at the proximal penile shaft in 11, at the penoscrotal junction in 16, at the scrotum in two and at the perineum in one. The 21 patients with a mid or proximal shaft meatus were categorized as having mid-shaft and the other 19 as having posterior hypospadias.

The experimental data for seven polymers derived from measuring both the chip thickness and the <b>residual</b> radius of <b>curvature</b> show that the contribution of bending is up to about 12 %. This gives a correction to σY of about the same order but Gc is unaffected as (eb/γ) (hc/h) is a factor independent of the cutting depth. The corrected σY values are compared with the σY values in simple compression and it suggests a work hardening effect for the polyolefines. Also, the low bending strain in the chips of HMWPE and PP may be attributed their large degree of non-linearity observed in the compression test...|$|R
3000|$|There are, however, {{some studies}} {{relevant}} {{to the issue of}} degenerative changes in the lumbar spine in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The most significant of those are the recently published studies from Sweden by Danielsson and Nachemson [9, 10]. They analyzed two groups of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, one fused and the other braced, and compared those with an age and sex-matched control group. Both treated groups had a mean follow-up after treatment of 22  years. Both treated groups had the same <b>residual</b> <b>curvature,</b> 37 °. They had more lumbar pain, although mild, than the control group, but the pain level in the surgical group was slightly higher than in the braced group. Cervical pain was not analyzed. Was this increased pain in the two treated groups due to the residual lumbar curve, or was it due to a propensity for adolescent idiopathic patients to have more degeneration than nonidiopathic patients?

40|$|International audienceEqual channel angular {{extrusion}} (ECAE) is {{a relatively}} novel deformation process used to produce severe plastic deformation by simple shear of materials with the aim to improve their mechanical properties. In this study, the influence of ram speed, friction, processing route, number of passes and back-pressure on pressing force and inhomogeneous behaviour during ECAE of high density polyethylene and polypropylene was investigated by finite element modelling (FEM) and experimental testing. Digital image correlation method {{was used to measure}} the surface deformation of the sample during ECAE process. A good correlation was found between the FEM simulations and the experimental results. The strain distribution is not homogeneous and a large <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> is remaining after complete extrusion without back-pressure. In order to improve the homogeneity of strain distribution, it is suggested, based on the present results, to use a tool with a low corner angle in combination with the application of a back-pressure on the sample end at the exit channel...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The ideal {{replacement}} of the urethra is the urethra itself. However, when the urethra is not available, flaps or tubes are used as substitutes in hypospadias repair. The urethral plate, when preserved, is an excellent tool for tubularization and urethral reconstruction. Tubularized incise plate (TIP) repair has become increasingly popular {{for the treatment of}} proximal hypospadias, with encouraging results. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the feasibility and results of TIP in perineal and perineo-scrotal hypospadias. Subjects and methods: Out of a total of 262 hypospadias cases treated at our clinic between January 2006 and June 2010, 35 patients had perineal and perineo-scrotal hypospadias. Of these, 21 cases with a narrow and/or poorly developed urethral plate and <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> after penile degloving and urethral mobilization underwent hypospadias repair using proximal TIP combined with a distal Duckett tube made from the inner prepuce after transection of the urethral plate at the corona. The present study was conducted on the remaining 14 cases treated with TIP alone. We retrospectively reviewed their case sheets, operative photographs and videos. Chordee was corrected by penile degloving and mobilization of the urethral plate with the corpus spongiosum, followed by proximal urethral mobilization with or without single-stitch dorsal plication. After incision of the urethral plate and tubularization, the neourethra was covered with a dorsal dartos/tunica flap. Two glanular wings were raised for glanuloplasty. Scrotoplasty was performed to cover the proximal urethra. Results: The patients’ age ranged from 1 to 23 (mean 13) years. Of the 14 cases studied, 4 had perineo-scrotal and 10 perineal hypospadias. Correction of the curvature was possible by penile degloving and urethral plate mobilization in 12 patients, while two required single-stitch dorsal plication. The length of the urethral plate varied from 5 to 16 (average 9)  cm. The neourethra was covered with a dorsal dartos flap in nine and with a tunica vaginalis flap in six cases. None of the patients had <b>residual</b> <b>curvature</b> or stricture. Two patients developed a fistula which required re-do surgery. Conclusions: Tubularized incised plate urethroplasty is an effective method for the repair of perineal and perineo-scrotal hypospadias with an acceptable complication rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{residual}} stresses in two Ti/SiC unidirectional composite panels with thick cladding were measured using two experimental methods. The variation of in-plane {{residual stresses}} in the cladding {{of the materials}} was measured by using a crack compliance method, and the average fibre stresses were inferred from the results. The applicability of a simple bending theory for the calculation of the <b>residual</b> stresses from <b>curvature</b> measurements was confirmed by a finite element analysis. Using a matrix etching method, the longitudinal fibre strains were measured from the relaxation of fibres upon dissolving the matrix {{in a part of}} the composite. The stresses in the fibre and the matrix were then calculated using a concentric cylinder model. By combining the results of both methods, the out-of-plane stresses were also determined, so that the full stress state in the reinforced section of the material could be obtained. ...|$|R

Background. The repair of complications in patients who had undergone hypospadias repair is still an open problem. Patients and Methods. We conducted a retrospective study of patients treated for late complications after hypospadias repair. Study inclusion criteria were patients presenting urethral, corpora cavernosa deformity, and/or penile defects due to previous hypospadias repair. Exclusion criteria were precancerous or malignant lesions and incomplete data on personal medical charts. Preoperative evaluation included clinical history, physical examination, urine culture, residual urine measurement, uroflowmetry, urethrography, urethral sonography, and urethroscopy. The patients were classified into four different groups. Success {{was defined as a}} normal functional urethra, with apical meatus, no <b>residual</b> penile <b>curvature</b> or esthetic deformity of the genitalia. Results. A total of 1, 176 patients were entered in our survey. Out of the 1, 176 patients, 301 patients (25. 5 %) underwent urethroplasty (group 1), 60 (5. 2 %) corporoplasty (group 2), 166 (14. 1 %) urethroplasty and corporoplasty (group 3), and 649 (55. 2 %) complex genitalia resurfacing (group 4). Mean followup was 60. 4 months. Out of the 1, 176 cases, 1, 036 (88. 1 %) were considered successful and 140 (11. 9 %) failures. Conclusion. The majority of patients (55. 2 %) with failed hypospadias repair require surgical reconstruction to fully resurfacing the glans and penile shaft. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{precision}} integrated bandgap {{voltage reference}} in 0. 35 μm CMOS technology is here presented. The circuit uses natural npn bipolar transistors as reference diodes. A particular attention {{was paid to}} the compensation of the several offsets that could strongly influence the performances of the reference. A very simple sample and hold technique for offset compensation is here presented. The proposed technique is straight forward for all bandgap topologies which use diodes with a terminal connected to the ground node or to the supply node. The temperature coefficient (TC) of the generated output voltage is 12. 7 ppm/°C versus about 245 ppm/°C of the same circuit without offset compensation. A full description and an analytical expression for the proposed compensation technique are given. The results of the most relevant simulations are also reported. The circuit has been inserted in a test chip whose layout is shown. the aforementioned effects, based on a sample and hold stage, is presented. The proposed technique was tested on a bandgap circuit designed to realize a voltage reference for an integrated floating power supply [8], exploiting the low voltage signal devices (0. 35 μm CMOS) available in the used high voltage technology [9]. Anyway, this compensation technique does not depend on the properties of this technology and it {{can be used in a}} plain CMOS bandgap reference as well. No external trimming of the <b>residual</b> bandgap <b>curvature</b> has been implemented. The circuit topology and the equations which describe the basic bandgap behaviour are discussed in Section II, whilst Section III explains all the circuit modifications and the proposed compensation technique. Simulation results obtained in Spectre ® environment are shown in section IV. I...|$|R
