40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the interdiffusion and forced-flow behavior of helium and argon in Speer Moderator No. 1 graphite was performed. The data were employed to determine a mutual diffusion coefficient and to verify certain superposed-flow equations. In addition, two series of experiments at high values of the forced-flow component were conducted to investigate contributions of the backdiffusion mechanism of those pores whose diameters are equal to or smaller than the mean free path of the gas molecules, approaching Rhudsen or free-molecule difiusion. At small forced-flow rates, normal diffusion was the controlling diffusion mechanism, while Knudsen effects were negligible. Flow equations employed previously are applicable to these data. Experiments conducted at high forced-flow rates show the contribution of small channels, which appears to follow the Knudsen diffusion mechanism. A critical value of sweep rate was determined. If the sweep rate {{is lower than the}} critical, the contamination will increase, whereas sweep rates greater than this would require large <b>reprocessing</b> <b>capacities</b> without additional decrease in contamination.

The activity has been developed to get an overview about the challenges, implications, boundary conditions, assumptions and correlated consequences of different scenarios suggested or envisaged for the deployment of nuclear energy (mainly for electricity production) on a global or regional basis. In this context, the implications of the LWRs use (in terms of resources, fuel cycle facilities, waste production, etc.) and the possible transition to FRs, in terms of Pu availability, enlargement of <b>reprocessing</b> <b>capacities,</b> etc., are key points of the analysis. A reference scenario has been studied in detail and used as "unit of measure" for extrapolation to more complex scenarios (e. g. European scenarios).

40|$|AbstractAlthough many {{discussions on}} nuclear safety and {{sustainability}} have been occurred after Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, nuclear energy and nuclear fuel cycle including fast reactors (FR) would be still indispensable {{for the long}} term stable supply of electricity in Japan. Commercial FR would be introduced in the future by the replacement of light water reactors (LWR) to FR. There are several important factors to be considered for LWR-to- FR transition, such as FR deployment start-time and rates, enough and no excess plutonium supply for the FR, proliferation resistance, fuel cycle cost, and so on. Thus flexible fuel cycle system was proposed in this paper for the suitable transition from LWR to FR. The proposed system, Flexible Fuel Cycle Initiative (FFCI), removes ∼ 90 % uranium from LWR spent fuel in LWR reprocessing and residual material named recycle material (RM), which contains ∼ 50 % U, ∼ 15 % Pu and ∼ 35 % other nuclides, is treated in FR reprocessing to recover Pu and U for FR fresh fuel. If the FR deployment rate becomes lower, the RM (∼ 1 / 10 volume of original spent fuel) will be stored until the higher rate again. The FFCI has some merits compared with ordinary system that consists of full reprocessing facilities for both LWR and FR spent fuels. The economy is better for FFCI due to the smaller LWR reprocessing facility (only U removal). The FFCI can supply high Pu concentration RM, which has high proliferation resistance and flexibly respond to FR deployment rate changes. Volume minimization of spent LWR fuel is possible for FFCI by its conversion to RM. Several features of FFCI were quantitatively analyzed such as Pu mass balance, <b>reprocessing</b> <b>capacities,</b> spent LWR fuel amounts, RM amounts, and proliferation resistance to compare the effectiveness of the FFCI system with the ordinarily considered system. The calculated Pu balance revealed that the FFCI could supply enough but no excess Pu to FR. The results demonstrated the applicability of FFCI system to the smooth LWR-to-FR transition...|$|R

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies on water cooled thorium breeder reactor based on matured {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) plant technology concluded that reduced moderated core by arranging fuel pins in a triangular tight lattice array and using heavy water as coolant is appropriate for achieving better breeding performance and higher burn-up simultaneously [1 – 6]. One optimum core that produces 3. 5 GW thermal energy using Th- 233 U oxide fuel shows a breeding ratio of 1. 07 and averaged burn-up of about 80 GWd/t with long cycle length of 1300 days. The moderator to fuel volume ratio is 0. 6 and required enrichment of 233 U for the fresh fuel is about 7 %. The coolant reactivity coefficient is negative during all cycles despite it being a large scale breeder reactor. In order to introduce this sustainable thorium reactor, three-step deployment scenario, with intermediate transition phase between current light water reactor (LWR) phase and future sustainer phase, is proposed. Both in transition phase and sustainer phase, almost the same core design can be applicable only by changing fissile materials mixed with thorium from plutonium to 233 U with slight modification in the fuel assembly design.

Additional spent cores are produced {{at a rate of}} about 10 or 11 per year. Continued HFIR operation, therefore, depends on a significant near-term expansion of the pool storage capacity, as well as on a future capability of reprocessing or other storage alternatives once the practical capacity of the pool is reached. To store the much larger inventory of spent fuel that may remain on-site under various future scenarios, the pool capacity is being increased in a phased manner through installation of a new multi-tier spent fuel rack design for higher density storage. A total of 143 positions was used for this paper as the maximum practical pool capacity without impacting operations; however, greater ultimate capacities were addressed in the supporting analyses and approval documents. This paper addresses issues related to the pool storage expansion including (1) seismic effects on the three-tier storage arrays, (2) thermal performance of the new arrays, (3) spent fuel cladding corrosion concerns related to the longer period of pool storage, and (4) impacts of increased spent fuel inventory on the pool water quality, water treatment systems, and LLLW volume...|$|R
40|$|Central to the {{advancement}} of the U. S. economy is the efficient production of semiconductors, which in turn depends upon having accurate methods of planning semiconductor wafer fabrication facility capacity. A characteristic of water fabrication that makes capacity planning particularly difficult is the presence of time constraints between process steps, also known as time bound sequences. In a time bound sequence, there exists a step that must be completed within some fixed time interval of an earlier step. An example in semiconductor manufacturing is a furnace operation that must be started within two hours of a prior clean operation. If more than two hours elapse before the furnace operation can begin, the job must be sent back to the clean operation for <b>reprocessing.</b> ^ The <b>capacity</b> of a time bound sequence can be difficult to predict. At low equipment utilizations, lots flow through with few delays, and are rarely sent back for reprocessing. At higher arrival rates, however, or for highly variable systems, time bound sequences can rapidly become unstable. To know the capacity of some time bound sequences requires knowing the entire distribution of lot cycle times. This research uses simulation to understand the behavior of time bound sequences, and then develops analytic models to estimate their capacity. ^ This dissertation focuses first on the simplest type of the bound sequences, those that involve only two operations. For such sequences, the time constraint only applies to the time in queue for the second operation. In this case, a simple approximation based on M/M/c queueing formulas is shown to perform quite well in predicting the probability of reprocessing. This approximation provides a bound that can easily be included in spreadsheet capacity models. A fluid model is then developed for the more complex situation of time bound sequences with intermediate operations. Based on the behavior of the model, several practical guidelines are given for planning capacity in the presence of time bound sequences. The most significant of these guidelines is a method for selecting time constraint values for which the probability of reprocessing is very small, so that systems will be well-behaved. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{reprocessing}} {{of commercial}} power reactor fuels in existing or modified facilities has been examined for four different reprocessing rates. Existing capabilities in the 325 A hot cells will permit processing up to 2 kg of fuel per day using an 8 -stage centrifugal contactor and discarding the uranium-plutonium stream in the organic phase. The principal {{problems with this}} system are feed clarification, equipment reliability, and waste disposal. The cost is anticipated to be about $ 30, 000 per run for runs up to 10 kg each. Higher assurance of continued operation could be obtained by fabricating a spare contactor and replacement parts. An increased capacity of up to about 50 kg per day could be achieved by installation of two inch pulse columns in 325 A followed by separating the plutonium from the uranium by anion exchange. The existing dissolver system would be nearly adequate. The plutonium would then be sent to ARHCO for further purification and recovery. The first cycle waste would be collected and shipped to 324 without further concentration. The cost will be about $ 2, 000, 000 over a nine month period for equipment installation and checkout. After installation and checkout, operating costs will be about $ 1, 500, 000 per year. The annual throughput expected in this system {{will depend on the}} operating efficiency. At an operating efficiency of 75 % the average throughput would be slightly over one tonne per month. One disadvantage of this method. of operation is that it will occupy over half of the 325 hot cells, and could conflict with other work in the cells. The major uncertainties in this processing are possible zirconium fires during shearing, offgas cleanup and waste disposal problems. An increase to 200 kg per day could be achieved by installing 4 inch diameter pulse columns in the 324 hot cells. Columns of this size are possible in 324 but not in 325 A because of the higher operating space available in 324. The major drawback to this arrangement is that installation of a major dissolution and solvent extraction capability in 324 would severely limit the operation of the waste solidification program. An alternate combination of 324 and 325 A would be to provide dissolution in 324 and solvent extraction in 325 A. However, this would cause solvent extraction in 325 A to be the limiting step of the system. Throughput of about 100 kg per day might be achieved in a 2 inch column system, and perhaps 150 kg/day in 2 1 / 2 inch columns. Two parallel systems of 2 to 2 1 / 2 inch columns could achieve 200 kg/day. This alternative would still result in some interference with the waste programs because fuel receipt, shearing, dissolving, and waste solidification would all be done in the same facility. The Hot Semiworks which was established as a pilot plant for the Redox and Purex plants at Hanford is potentially available for use in commercial fuels <b>reprocessing.</b> The <b>capacity</b> could approach one tonne per day. The cost for refurbishing the Hot Semiworks for satisfactory operation has not been evaluated accurately. It will cost at least tens of millions and perhaps a hundred million to prepare the facility for operation. Likewise, operating costs would be high, and the need for such large quantities of waste is not clear...|$|R
40|$|As use {{of nuclear}} energy is {{expected}} to expand {{in different parts of}} the world, several codes that describe the nuclear fuel cycle system are currently under development, featuring a range of capabilities and different levels of flexibility and automation. Such codes model the addition or retirement of reactors, the demand for fresh fuel, and the need for spent fuel storage and recycling facilities as the production of nuclear energy varies with time. The codes enable analysis of various scenarios for the evolution of the nuclear energy system, and the timing of deployment of new facilities. Outputs may also include fuel material mass flows, economic analysis and metrics related to spent fuel or waste assessment. The study reported here is the first attempt for benchmarking the MIT code CAFCA against three independently developed fuel cycle simulation codes. It is also among the first publicly available benchmark exercises. Some reviews of the existing codes were previously reported, but focused mostly on their theoretical capabilities. Benchmarking studies, generally involving two or three codes, have been done over the last few years, but most remain unpublished. The codes included in this study are: CAFCA (developed at MIT), COSI (developed at CEA, France), DANESS (developed at ANL) and VISION (developed by DOE laboratories for the AFCI program). The purpose of this benchmark study is to evaluate the degree of convergence of the current versions of these codes and to compare their basic methodologies. This benchmark is not a comprehensive analysis of all the codes’ capabilities but constitutes a first step towards a more complete benchmark study. In order to compare all 4 codes, only the common capabilities were considered and assessed. Those capabilities are essentially those of CAFCA, as it is the simplest code. Consequently, some of the advanced capabilities of the other codes were disabled, and their complete features were not reflected in this benchmark study. In addition, economic evaluation of the fuel cycles was not considered, even though it is a capability common to the four codes. Furthermore, the initial runs showed that a degree of freedom should be removed to ease the comparison. For that reason <b>reprocessing</b> <b>capacity</b> profiles were provided by CAFCA and used as input by the other codes. Following a description of the codes, the report presents the four scenarios selected as the benchmark cases, including initial conditions. The time period of the simulation covers the 21 st century. Those scenarios differ from each other in either the nuclear energy supply growth rate (0 %, 1. 5 % or 3 %) or the type of advanced technology introduced in the midterm. The options for advanced reactors were: the “self-sustaining” fast reactor (with a fissile conversion ratio of one), fast burners of transuranics (TRU), or a combination of plutonium recycling (as mixed oxide) in the thermal light water reactors (LWRs) and fast burners. The scenarios, and hence the results, are for benchmarking purposes only and should not be considered realistic for policy studies or forecasts about the future of nuclear power. The set of constraints specified is minimal and only intended to provide a common framework for the simulations. The results are presented and commented on for each case. The first case, characterized by a very constraining zero energy growth rate, shows an excellent agreement among the codes, with identical ratios of fast reactors/thermal reactors over time. This excellent agreement was the iv result of the particular efforts made in order to get very close results (several iterations were performed to allow for adjustments). This case eventually shows how the models can produce very close results if sufficiently tuned to adhere to the same basic assumptions. This case also allowed us to identify a number of minor apparent discrepancies and explain them. In particular, it made obvious differences in results between COSI, which was tuned to track fuel batches (“discrete-flow code”) and CAFCA, DANESS and VISION, which deal with annual mass flows (”continuous-flow codes). The treatment of discrete batches of fuel by COSI, instead of timeaveraged quantities in the other codes, result in somewhat oscillatory flows and inventories of materials. Another factor leading to discrepancies among the codes is the time assumed to exist between the separation of transuranics and the manufacturing of fast reactor fuels. CAFCA speeds up the fuel manufacturing, to avoid the presence of separated transuranics in large quantities, while the other codes do not (as Pu-containing fuel has a very limited shelf-life at the initial fissile content due to Pu 241 decay with a half life of about 14. 4 years). Unlike the first cases, there was in the three other cases no attempt, beyond the common set of assumptions, to iterate to get the results of the other cases to converge. Therefore, these three cases are more a reflection of how the codes actually operate and show the level of variation in results that should be considered normal. These three cases were of great interest for comparing the different strategies for fast reactor deployment and their dependence for fuel on available TRU from the operation of light water reactors. Overall, the benchmark shows that, although the codes exhibit reassuring consistency, both internally and among themselves, differences still exist. The fact that <b>reprocessing</b> <b>capacity</b> profiles were externally provided may have disturbed some of the codes designed to internally calculate this variable. Although limitations inherent in the codes exist, the differences in the results generally do not reveal major flaws, but rather reflect differing assumptions and constraints embedded in the methods and approximations of the calculations. This benchmark reveals (or reminds us) that there is no single profile for a fuel cycle scenario but several profiles that depend on industrial practices with regards to manufacturing, storage and reprocessing of nuclear fuels. These practices may aim at differing priorities of reducing stocks of stored spent fuel, avoiding the presence of separated TRU to reduce proliferation risks, ensuring sufficient supply of fresh fuel for advanced reactors and spent fuel for reprocessing plants, and minimizing some costs. Such choices can either be intrinsic to the code (through built-in assumptions) or through user choices (for example, the level of conservatism in the algorithm ensuring fuel supply for fast reactors is a user input). Moreover, the parameters left to the user’s discretion are generally not the same from one code to another, or are expressed in different terms. Finally, complete consistency between the codes is difficult to obtain. Two major conclusions can be drawn from this benchmark. First, the overall results show good consistency and similar trends. Hence, utilization of various codes is likely to lead to similar conclusions. Second, one must not expect the various fuel cycle system simulation codes to provide identical outputs. Therefore, users must keep in mind that, although the results are internally consistent and meet each code’s set of requirements, they do not project unique scenarios for meeting such requirements.

40|$|American Nuclear Society. This paper {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of designing seed-and-blanket (S & B) sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) cores to generate a significant fraction of the core power from radial thorium-fueled blankets that operate in the breed-and-burn (B & B) mode. The radiation damage on the cladding material in both seed and blanket does not exceed the presently acceptable constraint of 200 displacements per atom (dpa). The S & B core is designed to have an elongated seed (or driver) to maximize the fraction of neutrons that radially leak into the subcritical B & B blanket and reduce the neutron loss via axial leakage. A specific objective {{of this study is}} to maximize the fraction of core power generated by the B & B blanket that is proportional to the neutron leakage rate from the seed to the blanket. Since the blanket feed fuel is very inexpensive and requires no reprocessing and remote fuel fabrication, a larger fraction of power from the blanket will result in a lower fuel cycle cost per unit of electricity generated by the SFR core. It is found possible to design the seed of the S & B core to have a lower transuranics (TRU) conversion ratio (CR) than a conventional advanced burner reactor (ABR) core without deteriorating core safety. This is due to the unique synergism between a low CR seed and the B & B thorium blanket. The benefits of the synergism are maximized when using an annular seed surrounded by inner and outer thorium blankets. Two high-performance S & B cores are designed to benefit from the annular seed concept: (1) an ultra-long-cycle core having a CR = 0. 5 seed and a cycle length of ∼ 7 effective full-power years (EFPYs) and (2) a high-transmutation core having a TRU CR of 0. 0. The TRU transmutation rate of the latter core is comparable to that of the reference ABR with a CR of 0. 5, and the thorium blanket can generate close to 60 % of the core power. Because of the high blanket power fraction along with the high discharge burnup of the CR = 0 seed, the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>capacity</b> per unit of core power required by this S & B core is only approximately 1 / 6 th that of the reference ABR core with a TRU CR of 0. 5. Although the seed fuel CR is nearly zero, the burnup reactivity swing is low enough to enable a cycle length of more than 4 EFPYs. This is attributed to a combination of reactivity gain in the thorium blankets over the cycle and the relatively high heavy metal inventory. Moreover, despite the very low leakage, the S & B cores feature a less positive coolant reactivity coefficient and large enough negative Doppler coefficient even when using nonfertile fuel for the seed, because of the unique physics properties of the U and Th in the thorium blankets. With the long cycles, the S & B SFR is expected to have a higher capacity factor, and therefore a lower cost of electricity, than conventional ABRs. The discharge burnup of the thorium blanket fuel is typically 70 MWd/kg such that the thorium fuel utilization is approximately 12 times that of natural uranium in light water reactors. A sensitivity study is subsequently undertaken to quantify the trade-off between the core performances and several design variables: amount of zirconium in the inert matrix seed fuel, active core height, coolant pressure drop, and radiation damage constraint. The effect of the criterion used for quantifying acceptable radiation damage is evaluated as well. It is concluded that a viable S & B core can be designed without significant deviation from typical SFR core design practices...|$|E
40|$|The {{nuclear fuel}} {{once-through}} cycle (OTC) scheme currently {{practiced in the}} U. S. leads to accumulation of uranium, transuranic (TRU) and fission product inventories in the spent nuclear fuel. Various separation and recycling options can be envisioned {{in order to reduce}} these inventories while extracting additional energy and sending the ultimate waste to a repository. Choosing one of these options has direct implications for the infrastructure requirements, natural uranium consumption, actinide inventories in the system, waste repository needs and costs. In order to account for the complexity of the nuclear enterprise, a fuel cycle simulation code has been developed using system dynamics (CAFCA). An economic module was added using spreadsheets. Four main advanced fuel cycle schemes are assessed here {{within the context of the}} US market: 1) the twice-through cycle scheme (TTC) : single-pass plutonium recycling in thermal spectrum LWRs using Mixed OXide (MOX) fuel; 2) Multi-recycling of TRU in sodium-cooled fast spectrum burner cores, characterized by a fissile conversion ratio lower than 1 (FBu); 3) Multi-recycling of TRU in sodium-cooled fast breeders with a conversion ratio of 1. 23 (FBr); and 4) A two-tier scenario: a TTC scheme is practiced as a transition scheme to fast reactors. The base case scenario assumes annual nuclear energy demand growth rate of 2. 5 % from 2020 on. The technologies for plutonium separation as well as MOX fuel fabrication are assumed to be available in 2025 while the first commercial fast reactors, as well as the possibility to recycle their spent fuel, are assumed to be available in 2040. (cont.) For fast reactors, the cores are assumed to be TRU fueled, and the technology to separate the minor actinides is supposed to be available at the latest 5 years before deployment of fast reactors. Limits are applied on the building rate of reprocessing plants, which are also subject to a 80 % minimum life-time loading factor requirement. It is found that, despite its higher cost, at the end of the century, the TTC scheme (single Pu-MOX recycle) does not lead to large improvements in terms of natural uranium consumption (16 %), repository needs (considering both fission products and MA from reprocessing facilities, and spent MOX fuel) and TRU inventory reduction (although some shifting of TRU from storage to reactors occurs). This is especially significant because it is the only advanced fuel cycle option that can be deployed in large scale in the next few decades. However, if the primary reason for introduction of the more expensive fast reactors is resource enhancement and/or control of TRU in the nuclear waste, thermal reactor recycling allows the introduction of fast reactors to be delayed by 20 - 25 years. Moreover, once fast reactors are introduced, their deployment is accelerated compared to a 1 -tier FR scenario. However, the two-tier scheme is the most expensive scheme as it combines the requirements of both the MOX technology and the FR technology. Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to assess the impact of secondary parameters. It is found that whatever the growth rate assumed, LWRs remain a significant part of the system at the end of the century, decades after fast breeders are introduced. (cont.) The reason is the fissile materials required for fabrication of start-up cores considerably affect the rate at which fast reactors can be deployed. As a result, the choice of the core design (compact core vs. large core) may be as significant as the choice of the conversion ratio. For example, the breeder scenario (CR= 1. 23) may lead to the same cumulative natural uranium consumption reduction (by 2100) as the self-sustaining reactors (CR= 1. 0) while leading to larger TRU inventory in the system and requiring greater fast reactor fuel <b>reprocessing</b> <b>capacity.</b> Allowing fast reactors to start with uranium only cores was not considered, as it will likely limit resource enhancement benefits of fast reactors. Still, in general, the higher the conversion ratio, the greater the fast reactor installed capacity, hence the greater the savings in natural uranium. Conversely, the best reduction in TRU from the OTC amount is obtained by the lower conversion ratio (45 % for a pure burner with conversion ratio 0. 0 by 2100). Doubling the minimum cooling time before reprocessing for all fuel types from 5 years to 10 years slows down the deployment of the fast reactors and therefore reduces their share in the total installed capacity. This is almost equivalent to replacing breeders with fast reactors with a conversion ratio of 0. 75. Finally, the results show that starting the separation of the TRU 10 years prior to introduction of the fast reactors instead of 5 years provides a mid-term advantage (faster initial deployment) that vanishes within 25 years. In the long term, the fast reactor penetration results are insensitive to the assumed industrial capacity to build reprocessing facilities for the base case or at lower nuclear energy growth rates. (cont.) However, the assumed industrial capacity can be a real constraint if the nuclear energy growth rates are 4 % or higher. by Laurent Guérin. Thesis (S.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of designing Seed and Blanket (S&B) Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) to generate a significant fraction of the core power from radial thorium fueled blankets that operate on the Breed-and-Burn (B&B) mode without exceeding the 200 Displacements per Atom (DPA) radiation damage constraint of presently verified cladding materials. The S&B core is designed to have an elongated seed (or “driver”) to maximize the fraction of neutrons that radially leak into the subcritical blanket and reduce neutron loss via axial leakage. The blanket in the S&B core makes beneficial use of the leaking neutrons for improved economics and resource utilization. A specific objective {{of this study is}} to maximize the fraction of core power that can be generated by the blanket without violating the thermal hydraulic and material constraints. Since the blanket fuel requires no reprocessing along with remote fuel fabrication, a larger fraction of power from the blanket will result in a lower fuel cycle cost per unit of electricity generated. A unique synergism is found between a low conversion ratio (CR) seed and a B&B blanket fueled by thorium. Among several benefits, this synergism enables the very low leakage S&B cores to have small positive coolant voiding reactivity coefficient and large enough negative Doppler coefficient even when using inert matrix fuel for the seed. The benefits of this synergism are maximized when using an annular seed surrounded by an inner and outer thorium blankets. Two high-performance S&B cores were designed to benefit from this unique synergism: (1) the ultra-long cycle core that features a cycle length of ~ 7 years; (2) the high-transmutation rate core where the seed fuel features a TRU CR of 0. 0. Its TRU transmutation rate is comparable to that of the reference Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR) with CR of 0. 5 and the thorium blanket can generate close to 60 % of the core power; but requires only one sixth of the <b>reprocessing</b> and fabrication <b>capacity</b> per unit of core power. Nevertheless, these reference cores were designed to set upper bounds on the S&B core performance by using larger height and pressure drop than those of typical SFR design. A study was subsequently undertaken to quantify the tradeoff between S&B core design variables and the core performance. This study concludes that a viable S&B core can be designed without significant deviation from SFR core design practices. For example, the S&B core with 120 cm active height will be comparable in volume, HM mass and specific power with the S-PRISM core and could fit within the S-PRISM reactor vessel. 43. 1 % of this core power will be generated by the once-through thorium blanket; the required <b>capacity</b> for <b>reprocessing</b> and remote fuel fabrication per unit of electricity generated will be approximately one fifth of that for a comparable ABR. The sodium void worth of this 120 cm tall S&B core is significantly less positive than that of the reference ABR and the Doppler coefficient is only slightly smaller even though the seed uses a fertile-free fuel. The seed in the high transmutation core requires inert matrix fuel (TRU- 40 Zr) that has been successfully irradiated by the Fuel Cycle Research & Development program. An additional sensitivity analysis was later conducted to remove the bias introduced by the discrepancy between radiation damage constraints [...] 200 DPA applied for S&B cores and fast fluence of 4 x 1023 n(> 0. 1 MeV) /cm 2 applied for ABR core design. Although the performance characteristics of the S&B cores are sensitive to the radiation damage constraint applied, the S&B cores offer very significant performance improvements relative to the conventional ABR core design when using identical constraint. Fuel cycle characteristics of the S&B cores were compared with those of the reference ABR, and a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). The fuel cycle cost of the S&B reactor with same LWR TRU transmutation rate as the reference (CR= 0. 5) ABR is 0. 53 cents/kWe-h versus 0. 73 cents/kWe-h for the ABR – about 27 % lower; it is even lower than that of contemporary PWRs. The longer cycle may enable the S&B cores to operate at a ~ 10 % higher capacity factor and thereby further improve their economic viability. The S&B cores can utilize at least 7 % of thorium energy value without a need to develop irradiated thorium reprocessing capability. This is ~ 12 times the amount of energy that the LWRs generate per unit of natural uranium mined. By softening the blanket spectrum the thorium utilization can increase by a factor of at least three when using thorium hydride rather than metallic fuel; Fully Ceramic Encapsulated (FCM) fueled blanket can achieve the discharge burnup of 481. 5 MWd/kg if the FCM fuel keeps its integrity up to such burnup – this is over 80 times the energy extracted by present PWR per unit mass of natural uranium. If reprocessed, the Trans-Th fuel bred in the S&B core can enable to support new fleets of 233 U-Th fuel self-sustaining energy systems that use thermal and epithermal reactors such as Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) and Reduced-moderation Boiling Water Reactors (RBWR). Alternatively, the S&B reactors can be used to close the LWR fuel cycle using a 3 -tier system: TRU extracted from Tier- 1 LWR is used for fueling the seed of Tier- 2 S&B cores while the 233 U (Trans-Th) extracted from Tier- 2 S&B blanket is used as the fissile feed for Tier- 3 LWR. It is estimated that in such a 3 -tier energy system 1 GWe of S&B SFRs can support 3. 3 GWe of PWRs versus ~ 1. 7 GWe of PWRs that can be supported by 1 GWe of CR= 0. 5 ABR. In summary, the Seed-and-Blanket core concept studied in this project is found highly promising as it offers:•	Improvement in the economic viability of Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors due to the significant reduction in the fuel cycle cost and possibly increase in the capacity factor that may be enabled by the longer cycles. The improved economics may justify earlier commercialization of SFRs. •	Significantly smaller investment in the construction of the fuel reprocessing and the remote fuel fabrication infrastructure required for a given capacity of SFRs. •	Several new promising fuel cycle options feature substantial increase of the thorium resource utilization without fuel reprocessing•	Supporting a large number of LWRs by a given capacity of SFRs on the S&B configuration. Thus, it enables to close the nuclear fuel cycle faster and with smaller investment. In conclusion, the S&B reactor concept we proposed is feasible and potential to significantly improve the economic viability of fast reactors and of LWR TRU transmuting system using existing structural materials. It enables significant utilization of thorium resource without reprocessing...|$|R
