40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate the effects of variability of training on the acquisition of motor skill of closed loop type tracking task using Rotary Pursuit, and to determine if there was a bilateral transfer effect to the non-dominant hand following practice with the dominant hand. Twelve healthy vol-unteer students (5 males and 7 females, aged 25 to 37) were randomly divided into a constant practice group and a variable practice group. A photoelectric rotary pursuit apparatus with stop clock and <b>repeat</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>timer</b> by Lafayette Instrumentation Co. was used for this study. Rotary pursuit is a closed loop task in which a subject attempts to keep a photoelectric stylus on a lighted target in motion. Subjects per-formed the clockwise circular pursuit task while standing. Experimental procedure was divided into three sessions, namely, pre-test, training, and post-test. The constant group practiced all 60 trials at 30 rpm. Variable practice group did a varied practice session with 15 trials at speeds of 20 rpm, 26 rpm, 34 rpm, and 46 rpm. No one in either group practiced with their non-dominant arm. A Mann-Whitney test and a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test were used for statistical analyses. The results of this study showed no differ-ent training effect between groups on the post-test with the dominant hand. However, bilateral transfer ef-fect of rotary pursuit task between hands was demonstrated. Possible mechanisms are discussed...|$|E

These schedules require operating an electric vehicle in a selected stop-and-go driving <b>cycle</b> and <b>repeating</b> this <b>cycle</b> pattern until the vehicle ceases {{to meet the requirements}} of the cycle. The heart of the system is a programmable read-only memory (PROM) that has the required test profiles permanently recorded on plug-in cards, one card for each different driving schedule. The PROM generates a direct current analog signal that drives a speedometer displayed on one scale of a dual movement meter. The second scale of the dual movement meter displays the actual speed of the vehicle as recorded by the fifth wheel. The vehicle operator controls vehicle speed to match the desired profile speed. The PROM controls the recycle start time as well as the buzzer activation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was {{to find out the}} effect of <b>repeating</b> <b>cycle</b> of feed deprivation followed by fixed refeeding on the food consumption and feed efficiency of grouper Cromileptes altivelis. The experimental fish weight was 10. 86 ± 1. 42 gram. The treatments included: (P 1) group received <b>repeating</b> <b>cycles</b> of 1 day food deprivation followed by 2 days refeeding in 14 cycles; (P 2) group received <b>repeating</b> <b>cycle</b> of 1 day food deprivation followed by 3 days refeeding in 10 cycles; (P 3) group received <b>repeating</b> <b>cycle</b> of 1 day food deprivation followed by alternating 2 and 3 days refeeding in 12 cycles and; (K) group fed daily as control. Each treatment was assigned to 3 aquaria containing 150 l recirculated sea water according to completely randomized design. Twenty individuals were stocked in each aquaria. The fishes were fed with floating pellet twice a day at 09. 00 and 15. 00 to satiation for four weeks. Water quality was monitored. The results showed that <b>repeating</b> <b>cycle</b> of food deprivation followed by fixed refeeding affected food consumption and feed efficiency in grouper Cromileptes altivelis. Food consumption of fishes from treatment groups showed lower food consumption than control, but they showed higher daily food consumption and feed efficiency.

40|$|Satellite {{altimeter}} {{data from}} the first 44 <b>repeat</b> <b>cycles</b> (2 years) of the Geosat Exact Repeat Mission (EWRM) were averaged to improve accuracy, resolution and coverage of the marine gravity field. Individual 17 -day <b>repeat</b> <b>cycles</b> were first edited and differentiated, resulting in the along-track vertical deflection (i. e., gravity disturbance). To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, 44 of these cycles were then averaged to form a single highly accurate vertical deflection profile. The largest contribution to the vertical deflection error is short-wavelength altimeter noise and longer-wavelength oceanographic variability; the combined noise level is typically 6 microrad. Both types of noise are reduced by averaging many <b>repeat</b> <b>cycles.</b> Over most ocean areas {{the uncertainty of the}} average profile is less than 1 microrad which corresponds to 1 mgal of along-track gravity disturbance. However, in areas of seasonal ice coverage, its uncertainty can exceed 5 microrad. To assess the resolution of individual and average Geosat gravity profiles, the cross-spectral analysis technique was applied to repeat profiles.

The treatment of many forms of malignant disease often involves the use of cytotoxic agents whose toxic effects include nausea and/or vomiting. Andrykowski et al.

However, after a few cycles of emetogenic chemotherapy during which the patient experiences emesis, the association of factors linked with chemotherapy (visual, gustatory, olfactory...|$|R
