During routine structural inspections large fatigue cracks were discovered on some of the main structural components of a Tippler structure. These cracks were situated in a safety-critical area of the structure and therefore rendered the structure unsafe for operation. Structural failure could affect throughput enormously as the Tippler forms {{the first step in a}} coal terminal’s operational process. A high operational availability is therefore expected from these structures. The complex <b>rotational</b> <b>working</b> of the Tippler structure complicates the analytical evaluation of the structure. A further complication is the ever-changing boundary conditions while the structure rotates, together with the weight reduction of the coal in the wagons when the wagons are offloaded. Both these factors need to be taken into account when determining the stress levels in the structure while operational. This study identifies the main factors that led to the development of the structural cracks. The analysis process consisted of constructing a linear static finite element model of the Tippler structure and verifying the accuracy of the model by means of strain gauge measurements on the actual structure. From this analysis accurate stress values were obtained for the structure under operational conditions. A short literature study identified additional factors that would have an effect on the fatigue life of the structure under the conditions as experienced at a coal terminal. In the last part of the study the information obtained form the analysis and literature sources were applied to verify the suitability of the proposed changes made to the structure.

40|$|Introduction. The {{paper is}} devoted to the {{theoretical}} study of stability of movement of the movable unit of the experimental setup intended for the exploration of the active <b>rotational</b> <b>working</b> organs of the car for soil treatment. This takes into account the design features of the mobile unit and features active rotary force interaction of working bodies with the soil. From the analysis of previously conducted both theoretical and experimental studies of this type of working bodies noted the possibility of breaking the stability of the mobile stroke unit, which in turn will {{have a negative impact on}} the enforcement of a given method of the experiment program. From the analysis of previous studies shows that the assumptions under which they were made, not allow you to fully take into account the nature of the effect occurring dynamic processes of interaction of active rotary working bodies with the soil on the experimental setup truck driving stability. Materials and Methods. To address the shortcomings in the research, based on a synthesis of the main provisions and laws of mechanics and the experimental data of active rotary force interaction of working bodies with the soil, carried out theoretical studies of stability of movement of the movable unit of the experimental setup in view of its design features and conditions of the experiment. Results. A theoretical study was composed of loading trolley design scheme of the experimental setup with regard to its design features and power factors acting on its working elements, namely, the wheel bearing and studied active rotary working bodies. Processing results of the study allowed the weary twist zone of stable and unstable movement of the movable unit Expo tal installation. The presence of unstable movement zone carts at-leads to a breach of the conditions set by the plan of experimental-governmental research and a negative impact on their quality and purity.

50|$|In {{mechanics}} mistuning {{is a lack}} of symmetry {{present in}} a real object that ideally is perfectly symmetric. This phenomenon is studied in relation to turbine disks, for example; it can cause an increase of the forced response that can bring about unexpected failures due to fatigue. Mistuning is caused by manufacturer tolerances, non-homogeneity of the material, the usage, etc., and so it is unavoidable. It has been observed that the amount of increase in the forced response of mistuned turbine disks strongly depends on the physical characteristics of the disk itself: actual efforts to limit the negative effects of this phenomenon upon turbine disks focus on understanding how to design a disk that is influenced minimally by mistuning in the <b>working</b> <b>rotational</b> speed.|$|R
40|$|With a {{facility}} {{based on a}} large vacuum chamber of 12 m length and 5 m diameter the German Aerospace Center DLR in Göttingen performs testing on space electric propulsion systems. This large chamber size gives the option for plasma plume measurements at a long distance, e. g. beyond 5 m, compared to the usually employed distance of 0. 5 - 1 m. The beam shape and properties at such long distances is of importance for plume-spacecraft interaction and for a space debris removal technique {{that is based on}} momentum transfer by ion beams. The goal of the investigation presented here was to measure the divergence of the beam of our radiofrequency ion thruster RIT 10 / 37 at a distance greater 3 m. The system has been named LDBS (long distance beam scanner), and in designing the system we selected an x-y-scanner working in a flat plane. This is a complement to <b>rotational</b> systems <b>working</b> at 0. 7 - 1. 5 m. Actuation of the scanner, and data acquisition are controlled by a computer. The system is not fixed to the vacuum chamber, and measurements could also be taken closer to the thruster. The maximum spacing from the thruster exit is approximately 8 m. This paper presents the new system and shows measurements taken on out RIT thruster. Despite the low thruster power the signal is clear and not disturbed by noise. At the 3. 85 m distance from our RIT engine we can deduce a 90...|$|R
30|$|With the {{introduction}} of arthroscopic-assisted ACL reconstructions, different techniques for femoral tunnel creation have been developed. The most popular technique for femoral tunnel creation in ACL reconstruction is the transtibial (TT) technique [13]. This technique {{has the advantage of}} effecting an isometric, or near-isometric, graft throughout knee range of motion [14]. However, advances in anatomy and biomechanics of the knee have shifted the concept of proper femoral tunnel position from the isometric point to restoration of the anatomy of the ACL. It is well documented that the ACL is made of two different bundles, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL), with different specific functions, as the AM bundle controls anteroposterior laxity whereas the PL bundle ensures <b>rotational</b> stability, but <b>working</b> synergically so that they cannot be considered as separate structures [15, 16]. Therefore, double-bundle reconstructions have been proposed to replicate the anatomy of the native ACL, with literature showing no definitive clinical superiority over single-bundle techniques [17, 18]. Recent studies have discussed the inability of TT drilling technique to accurately position femoral tunnels within native ACL insertion sites [3, 19 – 22] due to an inability to freely position the femoral tunnel, as it is predetermined by the tibial tunnel placement, allowing for limited adjustment [14, 23]. Independent drilling techniques, such as TP and out–in (OI) techniques, have been developed to achieve more accurate femoral tunnels independently from the tibial tunnels. With these techniques, the orientation of the femoral tunnel becomes more oblique in the coronal plane than with the TT technique, with the potential advantage of preventing anterior translation and internal rotation of the tibia, as suggested by some recent biomechanical studies [24 – 27].|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal for my efforts during this internship {{was to help}} prepare for the Space Launch System (SLS) integrated modal test (IMT) with Rodney Rocha. In 2018, the Structural Engineering Loads and Dynamics Team will have 10 days to perform the IMT on the SLS Integrated Launch Vehicle. After that 10 day period, we will have about two months to analyze the test data and determine whether the integrated vehicle modes/frequencies are adequate for launching the vehicle. Because of the time constraints, NASA must have newly developed post-test analysis methods proven well and with technical confidence before testing. NASA civil servants along with help from <b>rotational</b> interns are <b>working</b> with novel techniques developed and applied external to Johnson Space Center (JSC) to uncover issues in applying this technique to much larger scales than ever before. We intend to use modal decoupling methods to separate the entangled vibrations coming from the SLS and its support structure during the IMT. This new approach is still under development. The primary goal of my internship was to learn the basics of structural dynamics and physical vibrations. I was able to accomplish this by working on two experimental test set ups, the Simple Beam and TAURUS-T, and by doing some light analytical and post-processing work. Within the Simple Beam project, my role involves changing the data acquisition system, reconfiguration of the test set up, transducer calibration, data collection, data file recovery, and post-processing analysis. Within the TAURUS-T project, my duties included cataloging and removing the 30 + triaxial accelerometers, coordinating {{the removal of the}} structure from the current rolling cart to a sturdy billet for further testing, preparing the accelerometers for remounting, accurately calibrating, mounting, and mapping of all accelerometer channels, and some testing. Hammer and shaker tests will be performed to easily visualize mode shapes at low frequencies. Short analytical projects using MATLAB were also assigned to aid in research efforts. These included integration of acceleration data for comparison to measured displacement data. Laplace and Fourier transforms were also investigated to determine viability as a method of modal decoupling. In addition to these projects, I was also able contribute work that would benefit future interns and the division as a whole. I gave a short presentation and answered questions to aid in the recruitment of subsequent interns and co-ops for the division. I also assisted in revisions and additions to Intern/Co-Op Handbook to provide incoming employees with background information on the organization they are about to work for. I further developed tutorial on Pulse software, which was used for data acquisition for both experiments and will be helpful to interns and engineers that may be unfamiliar to the software. I gained a diverse range of experience throughout my internship. I was introduced to advanced dynamics and analytical techniques. This was through new experience with both hands on experimentation and analytical post processing methods. I was exposed to the benefits of interdepartmental collaboration and developed stronger skills in time management by coordinating two different tests at once. This internship provided an excellent opportunity to see how engineering theories applied to real life scenarios, and an introduction to how NASA/JSC solves technical problems...|$|R
