5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E

For the following year's event, Goebbels {{was involved in the}} planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> be filmed. Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolize him even more.|$|E
5|$|Hearing of Olid's rebellion, {{and of his}} {{clash with}} González, Cortés sent his cousin Francisco de las Casas to bring the rival captains into line. Cortés was {{confident}} {{that the majority of}} Olid's men would <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> las Casas, and only assigned him about 150 men for the expedition. Las Casas arrived off Triunfo de la Cruz as Olid was making preparations to attack Gil González Dávila, who was in the Naco valley.|$|E
5|$|Hedlund re-signed with Ottawa on June 20, 2006. However, he was waived on October 2. He cleared waivers a {{day later}} and was {{assigned}} to Binghamton. Against Syracuse on January 15, Hedlund helped Binghamton <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> a 3–2 lead with a goal in the third period. However, the Senators ended up losing the game in a shootout. In one of his final games for the Senators on February 23, Hedlund scored a goal against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. Before being traded, Hedlund recorded six goals and 21 assists in 56 games.|$|E

5|$|Monk's {{assistant}} Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) {{suspects that}} St. Claire's wife Miranda {{was the person}} who ordered her husband's assassination. Sharona's theory {{is supported by the}} fact that St. Claire is worth $150 million, but Monk thinks about other hypotheses, including one in which Miranda is having an affair with one of St. Claire's assistants. Things become clearer in Monk's mind when he watches a news report on the assassination attempt. Monk regroups everyone at the place of the campaign <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> recreate what happened that day.|$|E
5|$|Nixon won the Republican {{primary and}} Douglas the Democratic contest, with each also {{finishing}} {{third in the}} other party's contest (Boddy finished second in both races). The contentious Democratic race left the party divided, and Democrats were slow to <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> Douglas—some even endorsed Nixon. The Korean War broke out only days after the primaries, and both Nixon and Douglas contended that the other had often voted with Marcantonio {{to the detriment of}} national security. Nixon's attacks were far more effective, and he won the November 7 general election by almost 20percentage points, carrying 53 of California's 58counties and all metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 season saw long-time Red Sox fan {{favorite}} Wade Boggs defect to the Yankees after eleven {{seasons with}} Boston. Later in September 1993, the Yankees defeated Boston at Yankee Stadium via a last-moment reprieve. Trailing 3–1, Mike Stanley's apparent fly out {{with two outs}} in the ninth was nullified by a fan running onto the field prior to the pitch being thrown. The umpire had called time and when play resumed, Stanley singled. The Yankees would <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> score three runs and win on a Mattingly single.|$|E

In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> an audience of 50,000 partisans of candidate Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the divisive 2001 presidential elections that nearly resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which {{was recorded}} in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future. The same year he toured extensively in France, the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Each season {{normally}} {{consists of}} 12 to 16 rallies driven on surfaces ranging from gravel and tarmac to snow and ice. Points from these events are calculated towards the drivers' and manufacturers' world championships. The driver's championship and manufacturer's championship are separate championships, but {{are based on}} the same point system. In the current points system, points are awarded {{at the end of each}} <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> the top ten WRC (overall), junior and production car drivers that qualify as follows: 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1.

5|$|On 6 August 2010, Wilders, who {{had become}} a regular guest with American conservatives and libertarians, {{announced}} that he would speak at a rally on 11 September in New York to protest the plans for Park51, a Muslim community center with a prayer space to be built near the World Trade Center site. The <b>rally,</b> <b>to</b> be held on the ten-year anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks, was organised by Stop Islamization of America, which was supported by former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who was originally announced as a speaker at the event, but never confirmed his appearance and cancelled a video appearance. According to SIOA's website world leaders, prominent politicians and 9/11 family members would be speaking at the rally, but Wilders was not mentioned by name, though he did attend as he had announced.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio {{appearance}} announcing her candidacy. She attacked Downey almost continuously {{throughout the}} remainder of the year, accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of big business, and an agent of oil interests. She hired Harold Tipton, a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area, as her campaign manager. Douglas realized that Nixon would most likely be the Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions and hers would cause voters to <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> her. Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially undecided about running, but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas. Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race.|$|E

5|$|Riefenstahl {{eventually}} {{came to the}} notice of Hitler who was immediately captivated by her work. She is described as fitting in with Hitler’s ideal of Aryan womanhood, a feature he had noted {{when he saw her}} starring performance in Das Blaue Licht. After meeting Hitler, Riefenstahl was offered the opportunity to direct Der Sieg des Glaubens ("The Victory of Faith"), an hour-long propaganda film about the fifth Nuremberg Rally in 1933. The opportunity that was offered was a huge surprise to Riefenstahl. Hitler had ordered Goebbels Propaganda Ministry to give the film commission to Riefenstahl, but the Ministry had never informed her. Riefenstahl agreed to direct the movie even though she was only given {{a few days before the}} <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> prepare. She and Hitler got on well, forming a friendly relationship. The propaganda film was funded entirely by the NSDAP.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} conquests of Khwarezmia and the Russian Principalities, {{the latter}} by Subutai leaves Europe {{as the last}} continent yet to be conquered. However, Genghis Khan who is now 80 years old, dies before the conquest can be complete. His son, Ogatai, promises to continue the war, marking Poland as the first target. The Mongols, using numerical superiority alone are able to defeat the mounted Knights of Poland, Bohemia {{as well as the}} several German Duchies that <b>rally</b> <b>to</b> Poland's support. The final mission of the Genghis Khan campaign focuses on Pax Mongolica, the term used to describe the height of power enjoyed by the Mongolian Empire. The last major power in Eastern Europe, Hungary, is all that stands in the way of Mongolia's further incursions into Europe.|$|E
