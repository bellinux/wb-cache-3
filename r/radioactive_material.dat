5|$|While major {{releases}} of <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> {{ended with the}} reactor shutdown in the 1970s {{and many of the}} most dangerous wastes are contained, there are continued concerns about contaminated groundwater headed toward the Columbia River and about workers' health and safety.|$|E
5|$|A Maralinga cleanup {{operation}} codenamed Operation Brumby {{was conducted}} in 1967. Attempts were made to dilute the concentration of <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> by turning over and mixing the surface soil.

5|$|Besides Litvinenko, {{only two}} people left {{polonium}} trails: Lugovoy and Kovtun, who were school friends and worked previously for Russian intelligence in the KGB and the GRU, respectively. They left more significant traces of polonium than Litvinenko, indicating that they handled the <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> directly, and did not ingest it.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to tidal heating, {{the interior of}} Europa could also be heated by the decay of <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> (radiogenic heating) within the rocky mantle. But the models and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic heating alone, thus implying that tidal heating has {{a leading role in}} Europa.|$|E
5|$|The Chelmscombe Quarry {{finished}} {{its work}} as a limestone quarry in the 1950s and was then used by the Central Electricity Generating Board as a tower testing station.

50|$|The {{first use}} of <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> at NRDL predated the issuing of {{licenses}} by the Atomic Energy Commission, but the AEC later issued licenses for {{a broad spectrum of}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> to be used in research at the NRDL. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> specific to nuclear weapon testing were exempted from AEC licensing. For closure of the NRDL in 1969, the AEC issued licenses for decommissioning activities. AEC licenses for the shipyard and NRDL were terminated in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of nuclear power plants, nuclear {{pollution}} (the dispersal of <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials)</b> has become a serious problem for the environment. The amount of radiation in <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> may not be safe for living organisms, so {{it is important for}} all nuclear pollution to be removed. Nuclear waste naturally remains hazardous for hundreds of years, but when processed with geomelting, <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> are trapped {{in such a way that}} prevents radioactive emissions from being released, effectively neutralizing them.|$|R
5|$|An Environmental Protection Act in 1991 {{prohibited}} importing <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> {{for long-term}} storage or burial in Russia, but controversial legislation to allow imports for permanent storage {{was passed by}} the Russian Parliament and signed by President Putin in 2001. In the long term, the Russian plan is for deep geologic disposal. Most {{attention has been paid to}} locations where waste has accumulated in temporary storage at Mayak, near Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains, and in granite at Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.|$|E
5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> and contaminating their skin, clothing, and, presumably, their lungs. When {{they returned to}} their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything they touched. Warren demanded an immediate halt to the entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E

40|$|The {{accident}} at TEPCO’s Fukushima Dai-ichi NPS in March 2011 has caused massive emissions of <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> in Japan. The government {{was required to}} deal with environmental pollution by <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> promptly. However, {{at the time of}} the accident, there was no legal framework in Japan to deal with the diffusion of <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> outside NPS. The NERH and other governmental authorities announced their policies and guidelines without legal basis as emergency measures. Then the Act on Special Measures Concerning the Handling of Environment Pollution by <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Materials</b> Discharged by the NPS Accident Associated with the Tohoku District - Off the Pacific Ocean Earthquake That Occurred on March 11, 2011 （the “Act”）was established. However, substantial discussions on how to deal with environmental problems were not made in the legislative process of the Act. Such legislation has led to some of the current legal problems regarding the disposal of <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> and action toward decontamination. Furthermore, since the Act is applicable only to environmental pollution by the {{accident at}} Fukushima Daiichi NPS, there is no legal framework for environmental pollution from another nuclear accident. A general law concerning the handling of pollution by <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> should be enacted after adequate discussions...|$|R

5|$|As he {{continues}} his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma's ghost. The fingerprints on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with <b>radioactive</b> <b>material,</b> an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting and Refining Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in aluminum cans, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed an aluminum chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the aluminum alloy. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, and mechanisms for safe handling of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>material.</b> The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that {{were found to be}} workable, but less efficient or safe.|$|E
5|$|Rona's {{methods were}} also used {{as part of the}} {{experiments}} conducted by the Office of Human Radiation Experiments {{to determine the effects of}} human exposure to radiation. Early in her career, she had been exposed to the dangers of radium. Rona's requests for protective gas masks were denied, as Stefan Meyer downplayed the hazards of exposure. She purchased protective gear with her own money, not believing there was no danger. When vials of <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> exploded and the laboratory became contaminated, Rona was convinced her mask had saved her. Gleditsch had also warned her of the dangers the year Rona was sick and living in Paris, when Joliot-Curie died, emphasizing the risk of radium-related anemia. In her 1978 book about her experiences, Rona wrote about the damage to bones, hands, and lungs of the scientists studying radioactivity. Since they wore no gloves and frequently poured substances between vials without protection, she noted that their thumbs, forefingers, and ring fingers were often damaged. The secrecy surrounding the project makes it difficult to know if any of the scientists not directly working on any project knew specifically what their contributions were being used for.|$|E

5|$|The {{apartment}} in which Rona {{and her mother}} were living was seized when the communists invaded Hungary in 1919. Owing to political instability and the persecution of those with communist sympathies during the countering White Terror, an increasing amount of work at the Institute fell to Rona. When offered a position in 1921 to return to Dahlem and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, by Otto Hahn, Rona resigned. She joined Hahn's staff in Berlin to separate ionium (now known as Th-230) from uranium. Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic forced her transfer to the Textile Fiber Institute of Kaiser Wilhelm, as practical research was the only work permitted at the time. Theoretical research with no essential application was not a priority. Her training allowed her {{to return to a}} more stable Hungary and accept a position in a textile factory there in 1923. She did not care for the work and soon left, joining the staff of the Institute for Radium Research of Vienna in 1924 at the request of Stefan Meyer. Her research there focused on measuring the absorption and range of hydrogen rays, as well as on developing polonium as an alternative <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> to radium.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969, {{the last one}} was {{the most powerful and}} had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond. However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 kilotons, 1962), Kennebec (<5 kilotons, 1963), Par (38, kilotons, 1964), Barbel (<20 kilotons, 1964), Tweed (<20 kilotons, 1965), Cyclamen (13 kilotons, 1966), Kankakee (20-200 kilotons, 1966), Vulcan (25 kilotons, 1966) and Hutch (20-200 kilotons, 1969), {{the last one}} was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates. The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10−7 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test. This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield {{on the amount of}} retrieved radioactive rock. In order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test, so that explosion would expel <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> from the epicenter, through the shafts, to collecting volumes near the surface.
