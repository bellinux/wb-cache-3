40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyses}} decision-making and argumentation {{by high school}} students in a debate situation on a socioscientific issue, the use of embryonic stem cells in research and therapy. We tested the influence on the debates of two different contexts. Adolescent students {{at the high school level}} in the same grade (mean age 16. 4 years) from rural and urban zones of Provence, France participated in three debate sessions. During the first session students listed the background questions they want to ask the expert(s). They were also required to identify one or two major issues that would serve as an outline for the future debate. They then discussed these with the expert(s) during the second session and took note of the answers. During this session, control groups met with a neuroscientist whereas the experimental "contextualized" group met with the same neuroscientist together with a <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>association</b> of patients suffering from a neurodegenerative disease. Analysis of the students' arguments and decision-making revealed that contextualization introduced dynamism in the students' exchanges: they paid more attention to their peers' arguments and were more motivated to argue their own opinion. However, this type of contextualization may contribute to reinforcing ideology in scientific progress.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{activities}} of Emanuel Voska, an American Czech, during the First World War {{from the point of}} view of the Czechoslovak resistance movement abroad, propaganda, intelligence services and the immigrant associations. After the First World War, an image was created of Voska as the first Czech spy and one of the foremost associates of T. G. Masaryk. The study puts the image into a sharper relief and tries to answer the question how important were Voska's activities during the war in the context of the resistance movement abroad and what was his actual merit in the process of creation of independent Czechoslovak state. Voska left for America when he was 19 years old. He tried to make his name in business as well as in the immigrants associations, in which he presented himself as a freethinker, Sokol and left wing radical. His journey to Europe in 1914 when he contacted Masaryk and Wickam Steed placed him in a good position with regard to communications between the immigrant societies in the USA, the representatives of the Allies and the initial exile centre in Europe. After his return to USA, Voska became a leading <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>association</b> named "Bohemian National Alliance" which aimed to achieve the break-up of Austria-Hungary as well as an independent state of Czechs and Slovaks [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|La {{substance}} de cet article a été présentée au congrès de l'ACFAS, à Ottawa, le 7 novembre 1964. L'auteur y résume d'abord les étapes franchies par le bill 54 avant son adoption le 22 juillet 1964. Il rattache ensuite à l’évolution générale de la législation ouvrière canadienne les principales innovations introduites par le Code du travail dans trois domaines: le droit d'association, l’unité de négociation et le règlement des conflits. The new Québec Labour Code {{came into}} effect September 1 st, 1964. It replaces the former Labour Relations Act and, in full or in part, six other related Acts. It represents Title One {{of a future}} Code which will eventually comprise all Québec legislation pertaining to labour. Bill 54 — as the proposed Labour Code was known before being adopted — was brought before the Legislative Assembly on June 5, 1963, by the Honourable René Hamel, then Minister of Labour. It was simultaneously announced that the Parliamentary Committee on Industrial Relations would be revived and public hearings were set for late June. At these hearings, objections were so strong against certain sections, and recommendations so thorough-going {{that the government had}} to abandon its first idea to pass the Bill quickly. When the second version was tabled, January 15, 1964, it was found strikingly similar to the first one, even worse {{in the eyes of the}} labour movement. Following public manifestations which included the threat of a general strike, major amendments were made to the Bill and a third version was presented to the Legislative Assembly on April 30, 1964. The amendments were intended to wider the scope of the Code, to eliminate the legal obligation of the secret ballot strike vote and to delete a reference to the Civil Code which has been introduced in the second version of the Bill. Meanwhile the case of public services had been set aside for separate study. In March, a special Parliamentary Committee sat to examine all sections of the Bill relating to these employees. The Committee presented its report in May, but due to further interventions of labour bodies, the government went far beyond the Committee's recommendations. The fourth version of Bill 54, presented July 9, 1964, incorporated basic amendments to labour relations in public services : it granted the right to strike to all public service employees except policemen and firemen (except also public school teachers and public servants whose cases still remain unsettled) with limited special powers to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council when public health or safety would be endangered by a work stoppage. Seldom did a Bill provoke so many discussions between interested groups and the government and seldom did it undergo so many changes between its first « first reading » in June, 1963, and its unanimous adoption on July 22, 1964. The main changes introduced by the new Labour Code fit properly although differently in the evolution of Canadian labour law over the past hundred years. This evolution has centered successively around three aspects of labour relations : 1) the right of association, which dominated the last century ; 2) progressive government intervention in dispute settlement, a process which began with the present century and was topped by P. C. 1003 and the Québec Labour Relations Act in 1944; 3) determination of a special type of labour-management relations through certification of labour unions, a system entrusting a union with exclusive rights of representation for bargaining purposes regarding employees of a defined unit. RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION — The Labour Code has considerably widened the scope of application of the former Labour Relations Act, bringing under the jurisdiction of the Code new categories of employees previously deprived of such legal help in the exercise of their right to organize (s. 1, m). Among those who may now apply for certification are to be found : domestic servants, farm employees, provided they number at least three, engineers, architects, doctors, accountants and other professional employees wishing to organize, provided they do so as a separate group (s. 20). But this does not mean legal sanctioning of a real unionization of cadres : all employees with managing functions remain outside of the application of the Code. In certain fields where unionization is already recognized but difficult, the Code provides new support. Thus the owner of any land or limit where logging or mining operations are carried on must allow any <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>association</b> of employees holding a permit of the Labour Relations Board to pass and have access to the camps (s. 8 and 9). From now on and by law the employer must make the check-off of union dues for all his employees members of a certified association who authorize him in writing to do so (s. 38). Thus the recent Québec Labour Code continues the general trend of labour legislation over the last century, which has tended to give increasing protection to the right of association and to the groups organized in accordance. BARGAINING RIGHTS AND BARGAINING UNITS — By establishing the certification system, the law has imposed a definite type of labour-management relations. A very important aspect of this relationship is the bargaining unit. In his book on LABOUR POLICY AND LABOUR ECONOMICS IN CANADA, Professor H. D. Woods has underlined the tendency of Labour Relations Acts and Labour Relations Boards to favour single-employer bargaining units. He has pointed out the advantages of redrafting the legislation to eliminate this bias toward plant or single-employer units, in order to emphasize the importance of the judgment of the interested parties and the members of the Boards. He considers also that technological change and government economic planning call for larger bargaining units. The provisions contained in the new Labour Code ignore the school of thought represented by Professor Woods's study. The Code recognizes no other certification unit than one-employer units (s. 20). It has even suppressed the few elements in the Labour Relations Act that gave some support to larger units. Multi-employer bargaining and industry-wide bargaining will have to remain on a strictly voluntary basis. The few provisions in the Code that may lead in that direction (such as the inchoative status given to recognized associations already bargaining at the industry) will prove either too weak to be significant or, as in the case of the binding character of a collective agreement made by an employers' association on all its members, present and future, it may even hamper employer organization, a prerequisite to industry-wide bargaining. From the viewpoint of the bargaining unit, the Labour Code represents no progress from the original provisions of 1944 in that field. It even appears to run counter to present economic development and seems rather inspired by economic liberalism of the past century. DISPUTE SETTLEMENT — The biggest change concerns dispute settlement. A new trend had manifested itself in the June, 1961, amendments to the Labour Relations Act, which had introduced a first restriction to government intervention in that sphere. The Labour Code, emphasizing that trend, reduces government intervention to almost its simplest expression : it leaves only one step — conciliation — and a shortened over-all waiting period (60 days from the notice to the Minister of a deadlock in negotiations, 90 days in the case of a first convention) before the strike or lock-out becomes legal. These modifications correspond to a rather new way of thinking among Canadian labour experts, according to whom the best way for government to help solve industrial conflicts is, after intervening through a relatively short conciliation effort, to leave the parties free to use the economic weapon of the strike or the lock-out at their discretion. Solving the dispute is their own responsibility, to be put squarely on their shoulders. The restitution of the right to strike to public service employees (although it appeared only in the final version of the Bill) reflects the same approach to the problem. Even where public health or safety is involved, the Cabinet has no other power than to set up a fact finding board; after the appointment of such a board, the Attorney-General may petition a judge of the Superior Court for an injunction, and the judge may grant the injunction if he considers that a work stoppage would imperil the public health or safety; but the injunction must cease not later than twenty days after the 60 -day delay allowed to the board to file its report. Further than that, the government has no power, except the general power it always has to call the Legislative Assembly for ad hoc legislation, if the case would justify such an extraordinary measure. This new approach represents a complete reversal of trend in Canadian labour legislation, which was marked, from 1900 to 1950, by ever growing and more normative government intervention. In summary and in relation to past Canadian labour law, the provisions of the Québec Labour Code reveal the following orientations. They broaden the scope of the right of association and add new supports to its exercise. Concerning the bargaining unit, they seem to go contrary to the new forces shaping our economy. In dispute settlement, they rightfully reverse an over-saturated trend of increasing government intervention. As a whole, they represent a liberalization of labour-management relations. In the second case, the term would have to be understood in reference to economic liberalism of the past century. Save for that exception, the new Code appears as a landmark of real social progress...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesIdentify key informational and {{educational}} items (“messages”) to provide to physicians (general practitioners and specialists) and physiotherapists {{for the management}} of pain induced by exercise and mobilization (PIEM). Develop checklists to improve this management in daily practice. Material and methodsThe Delphi method for consensus-building was used to identify informational {{and educational}} messages for health professionals who deal with PIEM. Informed by the results <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extensive qualitative study, <b>a</b> panel <b>of</b> experts from 5 medical and paramedical disciplines concerned with PIEM and <b>a</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patients’ <b>association</b> were interviewed individually and iteratively in order to obtain a single, convergent opinion. ResultsDelphi consultation helped to determine 9  areas corresponding to 54  key messages of information and education for doctors and physiotherapists who deal with PIEM. These messages relate to: defining, characterizing, identifying, and evaluating PIEM; identifying factors that may cause or increase this pain; informing the patient in order to avoid misinterpretation of PIEM; preventing and treating PIEM; and dealing with it during physical therapy sessions. The method also enabled us to develop 2  synthetic instruments (checklists)  —  1 for physicians and 1 for physiotherapists — to help with the management of this pain. ConclusionConsulting <b>a</b> panel <b>of</b> experts comprising different categories of actors dealing with PIEM on the basis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thorough qualitative diagnosis in order to identify messages for a training program makes it possible to harmonize programs with the expectations of patients and the problems encountered by professionals. The formulation of this program and the institutionalization of two checklists should enable health professionals to identify, qualify, and deal more effectively with PIEM...|$|R
40|$|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Liver {{diseases}} {{represent a}} major health problem {{due to their}} complications and limited treatment possibilities. In Rwanda, given low accessibility to modern treatments, most people still rely on traditional medicinal plants. The symptomatology of many hepatic troubles (icterus) is evident for traditional healers who have <b>a</b> high probability <b>of</b> selecting efficient herbal medicines. OBJECTIVES: To document medicines used {{in the treatment of}} "hepatitis" in Southern Rwanda with the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to liver disorder recognition, control and treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 56 traditional health practitioners, each <b>a</b> legal <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official <b>association,</b> were interviewed and participated in plant collection for the preparation of botanically identified herbarium specimens. RESULTS: 68 multi-component and 65 single-component herbal recipes were identified for the treatment of liver diseases with <b>a</b> total <b>of</b> 86 different herbs from 34 families identified. The most represented were the Asteraceae and the Lamiaceae. Crassocephalum vitellinum, Hypoestes triflora and Erythrina abyssinica were the most widely used plants. The principle of polymedication for complex (i. e. multifactorial) diseases ("Ifumbi" in Rwanda), is a constant in every traditional practice. It is striking that the Rwandese therapy of liver diseases proposes so many single-herb preparations (49 % of all herbal preparations). Some of the recorded plants or other species from the same genus have previously been documented for liver protection using various in vivo and in vitro models. CONCLUSION: Herbal remedies for hepatitis are widely used and highly diverse in Southern Rwanda; further chemical, pharmacological and toxicological studies are clearly required to rationally develop the most important remedies.

40|$|Remarks on Correlations and Implications of the Mandibular Structure and Diet in Some Seals (Mammalia, Phocidae). Koretsky, I. A., Rahmat, S. J., Peters, N. — The diverse <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> Recent seals {{within the}} three extant subfamilies (Cystophorinae, Phocinae, Monachinae) {{of the family}} Phocidae exhibit dietary {{variations}} among species, feeding on invertebrates and <b>a</b> diversity <b>of</b> prey {{depending on the season}} and availability. To explain this variability, an introductory morphological examination of the mandibular structure of Recent seals from each subfamily was performed, focusing on: heights of the mandibular ramus and condyloid process; measurements of the masseteric fossa; and attachments of muscles of mastication. After measuring the condyloid angles (the inclination of the condyloid process in relation to the axis of the alveolar row) among the examined species, a correlation between the size ofthe angle, function, and diet was recognized. Seals with a tall mandibular ramus and greater condyloid angle (Cystophorinae) feed on larger-sized prey, while seals with a shorter ramus and lesser condyloid angle feed on small (Monachinae) to medium-sized (Phocinae) prey, regardless of the overall size of the seal. This study focused on the mandibular morphology of some living and fossil <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> Phocidae, providing <b>an</b> <b>association</b> between functional and ecological interpretations of modern seals in general and extrapolating this knowledge for fossil dietary preference...|$|R
40|$|The {{wind power}} {{increase}} of Gotland {{as well as}} other parts of Sweden during the last ten year period has meant that this renewable energy source has increased its share over other fossil sources. The year of 2011 became the first when the wind power produced more energy than an average nuclear reactor. Now that wind power is in an expansive phase, the land issue will be of great interest. Land with good wind resources will be of interest to wind energy developers.   The problems that this essay is based on are; how can landowners altering the economic conditions at a wind power establishment? What opportunities and obstacles exist for landowners who choose to set up wind power on their land? The purpose of this essay is to highlight the economic conditions that exist for landowners for the establishment of wind farms, with regard to compensation for the leasing and return on invested capital. The authors will also clarify the difficulties and opportunities arising from the process at an imaginary wind power establishment, which have emerged through interviews and research articles. The primary sources consist of interviews with actors for a planned wind farm in southeast Gotland, as well as <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trade <b>association</b> <b>of</b> companies working with wind power. Interviews were also made with a bank, where the experience in question funding for wind energy has been important for our problem as well with a wind turbine manufacturer for real facts about wind turbines.   Landowner’s interest in wind energy as a long term investment has in Lau on Gotland resulted in a project where local landowners have chosen to form a joint company to invest in a wind farm, with the goal that the park generally will be owned by local residents in the parish. Conclusions to be drawn from this study is that landowners who form a joint company, in this case Lau Wind AB will open an opportunity for landowners to take <b>a</b> larger share <b>of</b> the ownership and profits as wind power turbines on their land supplies. But also for locals who have opportunity to become owners of the wind through the purchase of shares in wind farm...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{knowledge}} about fertilization, inadequate income to purchase fertilizers, limited access to the right type of fertilizers, and national policies have been identified as prerequisites of Sub-Saharan smallholder farmers' low yield and food insecurity. This paper presents how the smallholder access to phosphorus (SMAP) method was developed in a transdisciplinary process in Kenya, and what insights have been gained in <b>a</b> first application <b>of</b> the SMAP method. The transdisciplinary SMAP method comprises (1) farmers' participation in a transdisciplinary process including extension officers and local scientists to construct farm-specific fertilization strategies based on (2) farm-specific soil testing and (3) the construction of cooperative strategies for purchasing fertilizers involving farmers, traders, and financial institutions in a timely manner. The method aims to improve farmers' participation in the value chain. The development of the method followed the Zurich 2000 conception of transdisciplinarity. The development co-led by <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cereal growers <b>association</b> and scientists from local and international universities included main actors of the national and local (phosphorus) fertilizer supply-demand chain. The first application of the SMAP method was evaluated by embedding <b>an</b> ANOVA (analysis <b>of</b> variance) study design following the ideas of experimental action research. There were significant effects of soil testing and a marginal significant effect of the transdisciplinary construction of farm-specific fertilization strategies.

40|$|Problem- Sweden is for {{the moment}} one of the {{countries}} in the world that is most dependent on the automotive industry. Significant companies within this industry at a global level move parts of, or entire operations abroad which increase the competition for Swedish companies. This fact conveys problem for the Swedish SMEs suppliers, as if a supplier only focus on the national market will not match the requirements from the OEMs such as integrated product development and delivery of complete systems on a JIT- basis. Considering these fact, SME suppliers in Sweden need to look for new opportunities on new markets, and create an understanding for how to act accordingly to the new market’s particular business conditions. Purpose- The main purpose of this thesis is to examine business conditions and prerequisites that applies for the buyers and the suppliers in the supply chain in the Mexican auto-motive industry, and further to develop <b>an</b> understanding <b>of</b> the logic of the interaction and integration between them. Derived from the obtained knowledge, <b>a</b> sub-purpose <b>of</b> this thesis is to present recommendations for how Swedish suppliers should enter and act accordingly on the new market. Method- In this thesis we have applied a case study method. We have conducted semi-structured interviews with four of the largest OEMs and five suppliers, all of whom have production in Mexico. We have in addition to the interviews with OEMs and suppliers supported the collected information with one interview with <b>a</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trade <b>association</b> within the Mexican automotive industry and one representative from a governmental institution. Results- Our analysis indicates that the conditions for Swedish automotive suppliers to enter the Mexican market are favorable. Factors such as Free Trade Agreements, the positive attitude towards Foreign Direct Investments and skilled but low labor costs all imply for opportunities for Swedish suppliers. Secondly, our analysis indicates that the OEMs are today doing supply base rationalizations. We consider that this is {{based on the fact that}} the OEMs are changing their ordering basis from purchasing single parts to complete systems in order to reduce costs and increase the efficiency. Thirdly, our analysis indicates that it is the buyer, no matter on what level in the supply chain it is acting, who forms the strategy of its suppliers. If the buyer has a lean approach, its suppliers are forced to use the same thinking and apply it to their suppliers in order to meet the pressures on costs reductions, product development and JIT delivery. This we entitle as a continues correlation, which permeate in the complete supply chain...|$|R
40|$|Summary This report {{consists}} of three separate texts: Dreaming of the daycentre by Finnur Magnússon, Primarily a good house by Tor Löfgren and Old immigrants with language problem by Kristina Hjelm. The articles of Hjelm Löfgren are reedited versions of their candidate degree essays in Social work {{at the university of}} Malmö. The report follows two thematic main paths often occurring in the research on the life conditions of old migrants; the question of residential and care forms, versus the importance of language within eldercare. Recently the discussion of ethnically specified residential setting has focused different kind of daycentres whose activities are adapted to the needs of old migrant groups. The activities of these organizations have gradually been getting the characters of being ”open houses” addressing their activities towards persons whose needs are social rather than medical. The point <b>of</b> departure is <b>a</b> local action in order to establish a daycentre for Persian speaking old migrants in Malmö – Iranians and Afghans. The report focuses the actions and steps taken by different actors such as civil servants, <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local migrants <b>association</b> involved in the daycentre project, as well as <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> aged Persian speaking migrants in Malmö. The report’s main ambition is not to highlight the process <b>of</b> establishing <b>a</b> daycentre itself. We rather focus on the questions such a process may raise and what implications it may have. Furthermore the report focuses the issue of the low representation of migrants within Swedish eldercare and the issue of language may be one of its causes. The idea of ethnically based solutions in Swedish eldercare can be seen from different angles. According to tradition the welfare society has dealt with the needs of aged citizens. The emergence of hitherto new groups within the care comes as a challenge. Individuals with habits and most of all: speaking different languages are now standing on the doorstep of the care apparatus and sometimes feeling that they are not let in. However the findings of the reports show that some of the old migrants by different reasons choose to place themselves outside the care system. Taking into account the findings of the texts in the report one can state that daycentres are important and in many cases they satisfy the social needs and demands of many old migrants. A daycentre offers the possibility of meeting others and thereby breaking negative social isolation. Another and perhaps most important part of our findings is the complexity of ethnic care solutions which sometimes tends to be neglected. Ethnic care solutions touch upon the issue of democracy, necessary care based priorities, the integration of non-Swedes as well as the crucial connection between care and communication and language...|$|R
