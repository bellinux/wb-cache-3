40|$|A new unique anoplocephaline cestode having spinose {{tegument}} was described. Anoplocephaloides romerolagi sp. n. {{was found}} in the bile duct of a volcano rabbit, <b>Romerolagus</b> <b>diazi,</b> from Mexico. This species is related to A. floresbarroetae, but is differentiated by the alternative position of genital pores.

40|$|The {{repertoires}} {{of bitter}} taste receptor (T 2 R) gene {{have been described}} for several animal species, but these data are still scarce for Lagomorphs. The aim of the present work is to identify potential repertoires of T 2 R in several Lagomorph species, covering a wide geographical distribution. We studied these genes in Lepus timidus, Lepus europaeus, Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus, <b>Romerolagus</b> <b>diazi</b> and Sylvilagus floridanus, using Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus as control species for PCR and DNA sequencing. We studied {{the identities of the}} DNA sequences and built the corresponding phylogenetic tree. Sequencing was successful for both subspecies of Oryctolagus cuniculus for all T 2 R genes studied, for five genes in Lepus, and for three genes in <b>Romerolagus</b> <b>diazi</b> and Sylvilagus floridanus. We describe {{for the first time the}} partial repertoires of T 2 R genes for Lagomorphs species, other than the common rabbit. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that sequence proximity levels follow the established taxonomic classification...|$|R
50|$|The {{volcano rabbit}} (<b>Romerolagus</b> <b>diazi),</b> {{also known as}} {{teporingo}} or zacatuche, is a small rabbit that resides {{in the mountains of}} Mexico. It is the world's second smallest rabbit, second only to the pygmy rabbit. It has small rounded ears, short legs, and short, thick fur and weighs approximately 390-600 g (0.86-1.3 lb). It has a life span of 7 to 9 years. The volcano rabbit lives in groups of 2 to 5 animals in burrows (underground nests) and runways among grass tussocks. The burrows can be as long as 5 m and as deep as 40 cm. There are usually 2 to 3 young per litter, born in the burrows.|$|R
40|$|Distribution and {{population}} {{size of the}} volcano rabbit or zacatuche (<b>Romerolagus</b> <b>diazi)</b> were investigated at El Pelado volcano, {{one of the four}} remaining core distribution areas left in Mexico. Latrines or fecal pellets were counted at 342 randomly selected sampling sites between 1986 and 1989. Rabbits also were censused directly from horseback along 29 line transects in October 1988. There was a significant correlation between the mean number of latrines and mean number of rabbits sighted within each of four categories of abundance. Spatial distribution was mapped based on these categories of abundance. Mean size of populations of volcano rabbit was estimated at 6, 488 individuals (range of 2, 478 - 12, 120). The lower value (2, 478) should be used for conservation efforts. Most volcano rabbits occurred at 3, 150 - 3, 400 m elev., mainly in the upper and middle southern slopes...|$|R
40|$|We link {{spatially}} explicit {{climate change}} predictions to a dynamic metapopulation model. Predictions of species' responses to climate change, incorporating metapopulation dynamics and elements of dispersal, {{allow us to}} explore the range margin dynamics for two lagomorphs of conservation concern. Although the lagomorphs have very different distribution patterns, shifts {{at the edge of}} the range were more pronounced than shifts in the overall metapopulation. For <b>Romerolagus</b> <b>diazi</b> (volcano rabbit), the lower elevation range limit shifted upslope by approximately 700  m. This reduced the area occupied by the metapopulation, as the mountain peak currently lacks suitable vegetation. For Lepus timidus (European mountain hare), we modelled the British metapopulation. Increasing the dispersive estimate caused the metapopulation to shift faster on the northern range margin (leading edge). By contrast, it caused the metapopulation to respond to climate change slower, rather than faster, on the southern range margin (trailing edge). The differential responses of the leading and trailing range margins and the relative sensitivity of range limits to climate change compared with that of the metapopulation centroid have important implications for where conservation monitoring should be targeted. Our study demonstrates the importance and possibility of moving from simple bioclimatic envelope models to second-generation models that incorporate both dynamic climate change and metapopulation dynamics.

5000|$|The {{area has}} a number of species found nowhere else. The natural {{vegetation}} is mostly forest with a mix of pine, oyamel fir and holm oak, with some concentrations of Abies religiosa. The most intact forest is found in the small canyons of the Nepanapa volcano and {{the west side of the}} Tláloc volcano. Other vegetation include fruit trees such as tejocote (Crataegus pubescens), capulin (Prunus serotona ssp capulli) blackberry (Rubus adenotrichus) and well as various scrubs, grass and flowers. The rugged terrain presents a number of micro climates which favor certain species. Depending on conditions oak, cedar, strawberry trees (Arbutus sp), pirul (Schinus molle), tepozan (Buddleia cordata), nopal cactus and maguey can be found. Wildlife includes 59 species of mammals such as zacatuche rabbits (<b>Romerolagus</b> <b>diazi),</b> which in danger of extinction along with coyotes, deer, lynx and moles. However, only sixteen of these species are still commonly seen because of habitat destruction. Species such as wild boar, bobcats and opossums are extinct in the area. [...] There are about 200 bird species native to the area in 128 classes, 33 families and eleven orders. Eighty percent of the species live in the area year round. There are twenty four amphibian species from ten classes, seven families and two orders and fifty six species of reptiles from thirty one classes, ten families and two orders. A notable areas for these two classes of animal is the corridor between the Ajusco and Chichinautzin mountains.|$|R
40|$|Paraheligmonella lamothei n. sp. (Heligmonellidae: Heligmonellinae) is {{described}} {{from the small}} intestine of a cottontail, Sylvilagus floridanus (Allen, 1890) (Leporidae), from Costa Rica. New morphological data on the synlophe and caudal bursa of Paraheligmonella romerolagi (Gibbons and Kumar, 1980), the most similar species, are also provided. The new species differs from P. romerolagi, parasitic of <b>Romerolagus</b> <b>diazi</b> (Ferrari-Pérez, 1893) from Mexico, mainly by the characters of the caudal bursa and the synlophe of the female within the posterior region of body. Males of P. lamothei n. sp. possess a caudal bursa not bell-shaped, with a pattern of type 2 - 2 - 1 for right lobe and 2 - 3 with a tendency to type 2 - 2 - 1 for left lobe, whereas males of P. romerolagi possess a bell-shaped caudal bursa, with a pattern of type 2 - 2 - 1 with a tendency to type 4 - 1 for both lobes. In P. lamothei n. sp. rays 3 are slightly longer than rays 2 and the genital cone is poorly developed, whereas in P. romerolagi rays 3 are much longer than rays 2 and the genital cone is large and bulbous. Females of P. lamothei n. sp. possess, at ovejector level, ventral and latero-ventral ridges hypertrophied and dorsal ridges reduced, whereas at the same level, females of P. romerolagi possess lateral ridges hypertrophied and dorsal and ventral ridges reduced. Additionally, hypertrophied cuticular ridges posterior to the vulva are present in P. lamothei n. sp., but absent in P. romerolagi.

40|$|The {{volcano rabbit}} <b>Romerolagus</b> <b>diazi</b> is an Endangered species endemic to Mexico, {{with a range}} of < 400 km 2. We {{investigated}} threats from destruction, fragmentation and degradation of habitat, hunting, and cattle grazing intensity in relation to the distribution and abundance of the volcano rabbit on the Iztaccihuatl volcano. Faecal pellet counts were taken as a proxy for rabbit abundance in 1, 718 random 0. 2 m 2 quadrats at 859 sampling points along 25 transects, covering an area of c. 100 km 2 at altitudes of 3, 400 – 4, 000 m. Presence of the species was significantly associated with absence of closed forest, absence of long grass types (not bunchgrass), shallow inclines, absence of cattle grazing, lower altitude, low hunting pressure (measured by proximity to ranger station), absence of bare ground and, contrary to previous findings, increased frequency of fire. The species was significantly more abundant in habitats with a greater percentage cover of zacaton (bunchgrass) and short grass types. It was significantly less abundant in areas with more hunting (measured by proximity to ranger station) and cattle grazing. Key conservation priorities are therefore the protection of the subalpine zacaton bunchgrass-dominated habitat type, strict enforcement of hunting laws and the removal of livestock from relevant national park boundary areas. However, the results suggest that frequent fires have a significant positive effect on the occurrence of the volcano rabbit as a result of habitat improvement and this is often a consequence of anthropogenic management of land for cattle grazing.

40|$|Speciation is {{primarily}} {{regarded as an}} ancestral split that results in two distinct taxonomic units, and proceeds in stages along a continuum from initiation (i. e., population divergence) to completion (i. e., reproductively isolated species). Establishing how and why populations diverge, including the primary mechanisms influencing these events is a major objective for evolutionary scientists. Focusing on incipient forms, researchers attempt to disentangle the antagonistic nature of selection, genetic drift, and gene flow in the speciation process. In chapter 1, I investigate the phylogenetic relationships of 14 closely related taxa within the mallard complex (Anas spp.) that underwent a radiation within the past one million years. Using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and 20 nuclear loci for one to five individuals per taxon, I further examine how recombination and hybridization affect species tree reconstructions. In general, relationships within major clades were robust to treatment of recombination (i. e., ignoring or filtering) and inclusion or exclusion of hybridizing taxa, but branch lengths and posterior support were sensitive to both treatments. Of the 14 taxa, the most confounded relationships were those within the New World (NW) group comprising the sexually dichromatic mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and the monochromatic American black duck (A. rubripes; 2 ̆ 2 black duck 2 ̆ 2), mottled duck (A. fulvigula), and Mexican duck (A. [p. ] <b>diazi).</b> Finally, <b>I</b> address discordance between nuclear, morphometric, and mitochondrial trees, {{particularly with regard to}} the placement of the Hawaiian duck (A. wyvilliana), Philippine duck (A. luzonica), and two spot-billed ducks (A. zonorhyncha and A. poecilorhyncha) and discuss how alternative modes of speciation (i. e., hybrid speciation) may lead to variance in these relationships. In Chapter 2, I attempt to disentangle the evolutionary relationships of the New World (NW) group using mtDNA and 17 nuclear loci for a larger per taxon sample size (24 - 25 individuals per taxon). In general, whereas both Florida and Gulf Coast mottled ducks were differentiated from one another and from the other taxa (mean ΦST = 0. 024 - 0. 064), mallards, American black ducks, and Mexican duck were not significantly differentiated among nuclear markers (mean ΦST 3 ̆c 0. 020). Using coalescent methods to estimate rates of gene flow between mallards and each of the monochromatic taxa generally supported hybridization, but I could not reject complete isolation for any pairwise comparison. Furthermore, species tree reconstructions revealed that phylogenetic relationships were sensitive to stochastic sampling of individuals likely due to incomplete lineage sorting or hybridization. I conclude that members of the NW Mallard group appear to be adaptive incipient morphs, and that future work should focus on genomic regions under selection to better understand the stage and process of speciation in this group. In Chapter 3, I use restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing methods to generate a pseudorandom sampling of 3, 563 autosomal and 172 sex-linked (Z chromosome) markers scattered across the genome to more rigorously test the mechanism of speciation between Mexican ducks (N = 105 individuals from six Mexican states and two US states) and mallards (N = 17). Specifically, I aim to determine the stage of speciation and whether speciation has been driven by few loci with large effects versus many loci with small effects, plumage associated differentiation, or genetic drift. Marker comparisons between mallards and Mexican ducks revealed strong discordance among autosomal ΦST = 0. 014), sex-linked (mean ΦST = 0. 091), and mtDNA (ΦST = 0. 12) markers. In general, divergence at autosomal loci followed a stepping stone model, with a gradual transition in genotypic frequencies from North to South...|$|R
