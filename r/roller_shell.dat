50|$|Vayeron is an Australian based {{company that}} has {{developed}} a hardware sensor device {{which is designed to}} be embedded within the conveyor roller itself. The Smart-Idler™ is an automated conveyor roller condition monitoring & prognostics technology that is embedded within conveyor rollers when they are manufactured. The device monitors bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell-wear to predict conveyor roller failure. This ultimately makes conveyor roller condition monitoring more efficient and reduces operational downtime. The Smart-Idler™ sensor operates without batteries, taking its power directly from the rotation of the conveyor roller, using a dynamo style energy harvesting method as it turns whilst in operation within the conveyor. Companies that make conveyor rollers can integrate the Smart-Idler™ within their conveyor roller products to create an enhanced roller offering for their clients - the owners and operators of conveyor systems. The embedded sensors have a multi-modal monitoring capability. Parameters such as bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and <b>roller</b> <b>shell</b> wear are monitored and analysed to determine roller condition deterioration and flag impending failure.|$|E

Based on the {{analyses}} of aluminum melt solidification and heat transfer {{during the process}} of twin-roll casting, a coupling mathematical model of thin-gauge high-speed casting was developed, which included the casting <b>roller</b> <b>shell.</b> At the same time, FEM was adopted to solve the coupling model. The temperature field, thermal stress field and strain field of aluminum melt in casting zone were simulated by this model. When the casting velocity is 7 m/min, and the thickness of strip is 2 mm, in the melt zone, the temperature of melt decreases rapidly as it approaches the rollers; the surface stress of strip is larger than the central stress; In the liquid zone and mushy zone, thermal stress is relatively small; in rolling zone, thermal stress is much larger than in the former two zones, and gradually increases along exports, then gradually decreases after the peak; the outsurface strain of the casting strip is larger than the inner strain, and the thermal stress gradually increases along exports...|$|E

50|$|Rock'n <b>Rollers</b> were <b>shell</b> shaped crisps made by Golden Wonder in the UK {{during the}} 1970s. They were {{named after the}} rock and roll revival in the 1970s. They were {{available}} in Salt & Vinegar and Cheese & Onion flavours. During the 1980s, Golden Wonder ceased to make them.|$|R
40|$|A study designed, fabricated, and {{optimized}} {{performance of}} a jatropha sheller, consisting of mainframe, rotary cylinder, stationary cylinder, transmission system. Evaluation and optimization considered moisture content, clearance, and roller speed as independent parameters while the responses comprised of recovery, bulk density factor, shelling capacity, energy utilization of sheller, whole kernel recovery, oil recovery, and energy utilization by extruder. Moisture content failed to affect the response variables. The clearance affected response variables except energy utilization of the extruder. <b>Roller</b> speed affected <b>shelling</b> capacity, whole kernel recovery, and energy utilization of the extruder. Optimization resulted in operating conditions of 9. 5 %wb moisture content, clearance of 6 mm, and roller speed of 750 rpm...|$|R
40|$|Sugar, a vital resource, {{is one of}} the key {{products}} {{extracted from}} sugarcane. During the extraction of this product, the sugarcane is passed through a series of grooved rollers. This project is concerned with the automation of the manufacture of these rollers. After reviewing the various methods that could be used to cut a series of grooves into the <b>roller</b> <b>shell,</b> the aim of the project was to develop a device or machine which will automate part of the manufacture of the roller shells. Speci¯cally, the design was to meet the following requirements: - Able to handle a typical sized roller and most if not all of the roller sizes used. - Able to complete assigned operations at an equivalent production rate as current processes employed, or better. - Able to sense roller position and status and then determine the appropriate course of action. - Able to operated safely by non-technical personnel. Rather than attempt to modify a traditional lathe, a novel approach was developed and pursued. This approach was to hold the roller stationary and rotate the cutting tool around the roller instead...|$|E
50|$|The {{seasonality}} of almonds {{bloom and}} blossom in March and are harvested by October. Trees {{are in a}} state of dormancy from late February to March. In June almonds begin to grow and the hard, green shell can be used in some culinary practices. From July to August, the almond shells, called hulls, begin to split and open, however, these hulls can be processed and used for alternative uses. August to October marks harvest season. The trees are shaken mechanically and almonds fall to the ground, left to sit for 8 to 10 days in the orchard the almonds dry out and become easier to separate from the shell. During processing, the almonds pass through a <b>roller</b> and become <b>shelled</b> and are then sent to separate bins according to their size.6 Controlled storage conditions are used to maintain the quality of the almonds until ready to ship or be processed further. For macaroons, the different types of almond uses are sliced, ground or flour.|$|R
40|$|Shell {{orientation}} {{experiments in}} a flume, wave tank, field current, and wave enviromnents have yielded abasic difference between wave and current orientations. Rose diagrams of current orieuted shells show one strong maximum; over {{two thirds of}} an assemblage of elongate conical or plate-form shells point into or away from the current, depending on the geometry and mass distribution of the shell. In shoaling, nonswash waves, long axes of the same forms are aligned parallel to the wave crests or ripple marks. Because of currents associated with wave progression, the maxima tend to be skewed, so that a wave orientation pattern forms an obtuse arrow pointing {{in the direction of}} wave progression. In low angle swash zones, orientations show the two maxima of wave patterns, but the shells are aligned perpendicular to the ripple marks by oncoming and outgoing swash. Equant plate-form <b>shells,</b> <b>rollers,</b> and elongate plates and cones with protuberances may develop typical orientation patterns, but commonly show nondiagnostic orientations. Heavy shells fail to develop diagnostic orientations when they become on{rapped in relatively, soft sediment. Shells may become ntangled on pro-jections on gravel and shell hash, thus developing nondiagnostic orientations. Shells are commonly oriented in a stable position by currents, then buried by scour around the shell margins. Under weak waves, cones are buried in wave orientation by detritus on the bottom. Under ipple-forming waves...|$|R
