40|$|Odontocete {{depredation}} involves stealing or damaging bait or prey already {{captured by}} fishing gear. The increase in depredation {{is of concern}} for small stocks of cetaceans because interactions with fishing gear can lead to serious injury or mortality through entanglement or ingestion. Using long-term data sets available for the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) community in Sarasota Bay, Florida, we investigated <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> interactions by (1) examining temporal patterns in depredation and associated behaviors from 2000 to 2007; (2) quantifying the behavior of dolphins that depredate or engage in associated behaviors; and (3) identifying factors associated with the rise in depredation locally. The number of incidents of dolphins (primarily adult males) interacting with recreational anglers and boaters increased following 2004. Depredation and associated behaviors increased during red tide lags and tourist seasons during times of prey depletion and heightened angler and boater activity. Dolphins {{with a history of}} fishing gear interactions shifted away from natural activity patterns and {{were more likely to be}} within 50 m of fishing lines. <b>Recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> interactions were attributed to a two percent population decline in Sarasota Bay in 2006 and need to be considered along with other cumulative human impacts in the development of conservation measures for dolphins...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{single case}} reports of {{asphyxiation}} in dolphins caused by fish {{lodged in the}} esophagus exist. However, {{the significance of this}} cause of mortality in a single population has not been documented. We performed a retrospective evaluation of pathology records from stranded bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Indian River Lagoon to evaluate the impact of this cause of death on this population. From 1997 to 2011, asphyxiation due to choking was identified as the cause of death in 14 of 350 cases (4 %). Sampling of an unrelated but adjacent population over this same period yielded 186 necropsy cases of bottlenose dolphins with no cases of asphyxiation. Asphyxiated animals presented with a fish lodged in the cranial esophagus associated with a dislocated and obstructed or compressed larynx. There was no clear sex predilection. Affected animals included 12 adults and two juveniles. The fish species involved included sheepshead, black chin tilapia and striped mojarra. In five cases, <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> was also present. Cetacean choking is related to selection of prey fish species with strong dorsal spines and may be secondarily associated with fish attached to fishing gear. Prey abundance and dolphin behavior may influence these selections. Environmental alterations leading to changes in prey availability or increased interactions with fishing gear may change the significance of fatal choking in dolphin populations...|$|E

Ten tunas (71. 1 - 86. 4 cm FL) were tagged in the northern Gulf of Mexico in April 2012 after being caught on typical <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> PSATs recorded point measurements of temperature, pressure (depth), and light level every 90 s (n[*]=[*] 2 tags, deployment duration 9. 5 days), 180 s (n[*]=[*] 4, duration 19 days), or 270 s (n[*]=[*] 4, duration 28. 5 days). Nine fish survived for their respective full deployment periods; one fish died after only 5 h following release. Depths ranged from 0 – 217 m with a mean of 28 m (SD[*]=[*] 8. 38 m) and temperatures ranged from 13. 9 – 32. 9 °C with a mean of 23. 8 °C (SD[*]=[*] 1. 3 °C) for all nine archived records. The nine blackfin spent 90 % of their time in depths from 0 – 57 m and 89 % of their time in temperatures from 21. 9 – 26. 6 °C. Over 87 % of the movements in the water column, either ascending or descending, were less than 12 m differences in depth between sequential short-duration data sampling. With appropriate concern regarding the matching of fish and PSAT sizes, these results suggest that external tags with fishery-independent reporting capabilities are an available option for smaller tuna species...|$|E

40|$|Research PaperRecreational {{fishing is}} a {{compound}} activity {{that includes the}} expectancy and catching of fish. The Australian national <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> survey provides catch and economic data for this activity for the 12 months May 2000 to April 2001. In addition to catch behavioral data, the survey provides economic data for that proportion of expenditure attributed by recreational fishers to <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing.</b> The estimated 3. 36 million Australian residents {{who participated in this}} activity over the period of the survey spent an estimated $ 1. 85 billion. Expenditure on boats and trailers of $ 940 million made up half of the expenditure attributed to fishing. The next most important expenditure classification, at $ 445 million, was travel and accommodation; while expenditure directly involved in fishing made up only 12 per cent ($ 220 million) of the incurred expenditure.

40|$|The distribution, behaviours, and {{composition}} of dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) nursery groups off Kaikoura, New Zealand, were examined. Data were collected during January?May 2005 and December 2005 ?April 2006 by systematic boat based surveys, group focal follows and photo-identification techniques. A total of 99 nursery groups were encountered on survey. Nursery groups were encountered in shallow water (20 m). Other group types (large groups, mating groups, adult non-mating groups) were not found in shallow water significantly more often than in deeper water. By staying in the shallower water, nursery groups may be protected from aggressive conspecifics and predators. More boats, especially private recreational boats, {{were found in the}} shallower waters, indicating that nursery groups are at greater risk from encounters with boat motors or <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> in such areas. Group focal follows of at least 30 - minutes were conducted on 56 nursery groups. Calves engaged in significantly more high energy behaviours (displays and head first re-entries) than non-calves in nursery groups. These groups were predominantly resting and compactly organized (interanimal distance less than 1 adult body length). Nursery groups showed a high level of synchrony, with 44 % of groups synchronizing their submergence and surfacings for most of the focal follow. Median group size was 14, with a minimum of 2 mother-calf pairs to a maximum of 50 mother-calf pairs. A total of 260 individuals were catalogued as members of nursery groups during the two field seasons. Of these, 112 individuals were seen in nursery groups on at least two different days.

40|$|Typical {{depredation}} {{behavior by}} cetaceans involves stealing or damaging prey items already captured by recreational or commercial fishing gear. Depredation among cetaceans {{has been reported}} to be increasing in both severity and frequency globally. This behavior is of particular concern for small stocks of cetaceans since any interaction with fishing gear has the potential to injure or kill animals leading to unsustainable losses. In Florida, depredation became evident in 2006 when the number of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) strandings resulting from fishing gear ingestion or entanglement sharply increased. For the resident dolphin community in Sarasota Bay, modeling showed continued mortalities from <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> interactions were not sustainable. The major goals of this study were to 1.) characterize depredation and recreational angler interactions involving dolphins in Sarasota Bay, 2.) reduce dolphin-angler interactions through outreach, 3.) examine a case study to investigate the link between dolphin hearing loss and angler interaction behavior, 4.) test the effectiveness of passive acoustics in monitoring dolphin depredation at a fishing pier. Findings from this study provided a better understanding of depredation and angler interactions. Results indicated that dolphin-angler interactions in Sarasota Bay are increasing in frequency and are affecting an increasing number of dolphins, specifically adult males. Some dolphins in Sarasota Bay appear to utilize depredation as a foraging method (not just an opportunistic behavior) and {{were significantly more likely to}} be within 50 m of an active fishing line. Depredation and angler interaction behavior appear to increase in times of prey depletion (such as during a red tide) and heightened angler fishing activity. Educational outreach using an informational card proved successful in a case study showing about a 30 % reduction in dolphin provisioning rates. The case study of F 201 offers preliminary evidence that hearing loss is linked to depredation behavior and death for wild dolphins. Also, by detecting echolocation clicks as a proxy for dolphin presence, passive acoustics showed potential as an inexpensive method for monitoring depredation in problematic areas. Conclusions from this study can be utilized by scientists and managers when assessing depredation rates for a cetacean community and implementing an action plan...|$|E
40|$|The use of pop-up {{satellite}} archival tags (PSATs) {{allows a}} researcher to overcome limitations associated with acoustic, conventional, or AT type tags. With PSATs, both {{data collection and}} retrieval are fishery-independent. Previous research techniques have provided information on longer-term movements, migrations, and behavior patterns, {{but there is still}} a need for additional tagging studies with “second generation” tags with depth and light data and increased memory that will further define the short-duration activity patterns and habitat utilization of juvenile swordfish in the North Atlantic. PSATs have been successfully used on other large pelagic fishes, but have yet to be used on juvenile swordfish. This project will investigate four topics: the post-release survival rates of juvenile swordfish (defined as 3 ̆c 119 cm LJFL, the minimum domestic retention length) after being released from the recreational rod-and-reel fishery in the Florida Straits, habitat utilization of juvenile swordfish following release, an exploratory analysis of the effectiveness of minimum size and bag limits in the recreational swordfish fishery, characterization of catch composition and disposition of the catch and bycatch. High-resolution PSAT technology will be used to estimate the post-release survival of 20 individual juvenile swordfish captured with standard <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> and techniques in the southeast Florida recreational swordfish fishery. These data will also be used to analyze behavioral interactions with the fishing gear, such as habitat utilization patterns. By combining the PSAT data with data from temperature-depth recorders (TDRs), additional information on swordfish interactions, such as effective fishing depths, will be assessed. Data gathered by the PSATs and TDRs will also be compared with other descriptions of swordfish behavior. This study will be a collaborative effort with the local recreational swordfish fishery, utilizing local fishermen to conduct the field work. Data from this study will aid in determining better management practices in terms of the efficacy of mandatory release of undersized fish. The data from the tags will also provide experimentally-generated estimates of recreational fishing mortality {{that can be used in}} ICCAT stock assessments. Providing more robust estimates of mortality and evaluating the size limits will aid in determining if the yield per recruit and the spawning potential ratio target values are being reached...|$|E

First, the changes that took place in <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> activities {{as a result of the}} Exxon Valdez oil spill must be determined, and then a d&r value must be placed on those changes. To estimate the impacts of the spill on sport fishing activity, one must consider the impact on the number of anglers, the number of sport fishing trips, the areas fished, the species fished for, and the length of these trips (Le., the number of days fished). Placing a dollar value on these changes is usually done using the travel cost or contingent valuation methodologies. Estimating precisely the changes in <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> behavior due to the Exxon Valdez oil spill is an extremely complex task. The complexity, in large part, is due to the fact that while it is possible to estimate the <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> activities that took place after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> activities that would have taken place in the absence of that spill are inherently unobservable. <b>Recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> data collected by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for the years preceding the Exxon Valdez oil spill exhibits three primary characteristics relevant to our task: (1) an upward trend in <b>recreational</b> <b>fishing</b> activities, (2) some year-to-year variation around that trend, and (3) variation in fishing patterns associated with variations in fishing quality, e. g., fishing might vary with the size of a particular salmon run.
