6000|$|With {{this feeling}} uppermost, he {{continued}} to waive {{the question of the}} chaplaincy, and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper business of his, but likely enough never to vex him with a demand for his vote. Lydgate, at Mr. Bulstrode's request, was laying down plans for the internal arrangements of the new hospital, and the two were often in consultation. The banker was always presupposing that he could count in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor, but made no special recurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother. When the General Board of the Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had notice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of the directors and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he had a vexed sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch business. He could not help hearing within him the distinct declaration that Bulstrode was prime minister, and that the Tyke affair was a question of office or no office; and he could not help an equally pronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office. For his observation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother's assurance that the banker would not overlook opposition. [...] "Confound their petty politics!" [...] was one of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative process of shaving, when he had begun to feel that he must really hold a court of conscience on this matter. Certainly there were valid things to be said against the election of Mr. Farebrother: he had too much on his hands already, especially considering how much time he spent on non-clerical occupations. Then again it was a continually <b>repeated</b> <b>shock,</b> disturbing Lydgate's esteem, that the Vicar should obviously play for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but evidently liking some end which it served. Mr. Farebrother contended on theory for the desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen's wit was stagnant for want of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he would have played very much less but for the money. There was a billiard-room at the Green Dragon, which some anxious mothers and wives regarded as the chief temptation in Middlemarch. The Vicar was a first-rate billiard-player, and though he did not frequent the Green Dragon, there were reports that he had sometimes been there in the daytime and had won money. And as to the chaplaincy, he did not pretend that he cared for it, except {{for the sake of the}} forty pounds. Lydgate was no Puritan, but he did not care for play, and winning money at it had always seemed a meanness to him; besides, he had an ideal of life which made this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small sums thoroughly hateful to him. Hitherto in his own life his wants had been supplied without any trouble to himself, and his first impulse was always to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a gentleman; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting half-crowns. He had always known in a general way that he was not rich, but he had never felt poor, and he had no power of imagining the part which the want of money plays in determining the actions of men. Money had never been a motive to him. Hence he was not ready to frame excuses for this deliberate pursuit of small gains. It was altogether repulsive to him, and he never entered into any calculation of the ratio between the Vicar's income and his more or less necessary expenditure. It was possible that he would not have made such a calculation in his own case.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{show that}} <b>repeated</b> <b>shock</b> and {{vibration}} during aero medical and ground transport are causing patient pain {{and may be}} adversely affecting patients’ medical outcome. Patients with spine and head injuries and other severe neurological injuries are the most vulnerable to <b>repeated</b> <b>shock</b> and vibration exposure caused by the vehicle. It is crucial to minimize {{the effects of these}} forces on patients during air and ground medical transport. The development of new medical evacuation platforms creates a need to better understand the effects of human exposure to shock and vibration. The use of human subjects to measure whole body vibration for the evaluation of patient transport systems generates a challenge for designers of and evaluators of enroute care systems. Therefore two different supine manikins were created for this project, manikin 1 and manikin 2. Manikin 2 was a modification of manikin 1 so that it would have a closer biodynamic response to that of humans when subjected to <b>repeated</b> <b>shock</b> and vibration. The main objective of this project was to test the two manikins under various conditions and compare the results. The manikins’ design was based on the standards of a 95 th percentile male. Another objective was to analyze the utilization of a litter air bladder to lower the consequences of human exposure to <b>repeated</b> <b>shock</b> and vibration due to aero medical transport. The vibration signals used to perform the test were derived from research performed at the United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory at Fort Rucker Alabama. The vibration signals were captured from field tests conducted on a medevac litter mounted in a HH- 60 M Black Hawk helicopter in different modes of flight. After processing the recorded data, laboratory vibration tests were conducted on the manikins placed in the supine position to obtain the acceleration and transmissibility magnitudes at different locations on the manikins and the stirrup of the litter. The square root of the sum of the squares (RSS) acceleration in the real time was calculated to examine various strap restraint and stirrup clearance configurations and the effects of the use of the air bladder. The results exposed the differences between manikin 1 and manikin 2. The resonant frequency of the manikins plus litter was approximately 4 Hz. In addition, the accelerations increased as the straps restraint was increased, which was expected as the manikins were less likely to move. For some conditions, the increase of stirrup clearance caused the acceleration values increase. Test results indicated the use of the air bladder between the manikins and litter resulted in an increase in acceleration values...|$|E

40|$|Objective: A {{model for}} the {{development}} of anxiety disorders (panic disorder with or without agoraphobia) is needed. Patients with an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) are exposed to <b>repeated</b> electric <b>shocks.</b> If the theory of anxiety development by aversive classic conditioning processes is valid, these <b>repeated</b> <b>shocks</b> should lead to an increased risk of anxiety disorders.

Micro dimples {{have been}} {{generally}} {{considered as a}} valuable texture which can improve lubrication and reduce wear of the sliding surfaces by acting as reservoirs of lubricants and grinding debris.

LPT experiments were performed on Oxygen-Free High Conductivity (OFHC) copper. Influences of experimental parameters on geometrical characteristics of micro dimples were investigated.

40|$|Supernova {{remnants}} {{are expected}} to contain braided (or stochastic) magnetic fields, which are in some regions directed mainly perpendicular to the shock normal. For particle acceleration due to <b>repeated</b> <b>shock</b> crossings, the transport {{in the direction of}} the shock normal is crucial. The mean squared deviation along the shock normal is then proportional to the square root of the time. This kind of anomalous transport is called sub-diffusion. We use a Monte-Carlo method to examine this non-Markovian transport and the acceleration. As a result of this simulation we are able to examine the propagator, density and pitch-angle distribution of accelerated particles, and especially the spectral properties. These are in broad agreement with analytic predictions for both the sub-diffusive and the diffusive regimes, but the steepening of the spectrum predicted when changing from diffusive to sub-diffusive transport is found to be even more pronounced than predicted.

40|$|Methods of measuring, {{evaluating}} {{and assessing}} whole-body vibration and <b>repeated</b> <b>shock</b> {{are offered in}} ISO 2631 (1974, 1985), BS 6841 (1987), and ISO 2631 (1997). This paper presents a comparison of guidance on {{the health effects of}} vibration and <b>repeated</b> <b>shock</b> given in these standards. International Standard 2631 (1974, 1985) offered a set of exposure limits. British Standard 6841 (1987) defines a measurement and evaluation procedure (based on frequency weightings and the vibration dose value, VDV), gives an action level {{that can be used to}} assess vibration severity, and mentions some appropriate actions (consideration of the fitness of exposed persons, design of safety precautions, regular health checks). International Standard 2631 (1997) is unclear in several important areas: which body postures and axes are to be assessed; whether evaluations of multi-axis vibration should be based on the "worst axis" or a combination of the frequency-weighted acceleration in all axes; why a new frequency weighting, W k, is proposed for vertical vibration when it is almost within the error tolerance of an existing weighting, W b; why a 1 · 4 multiplying factor is used to evaluate vibration with respect to health but not with respect to comfort; how to choose between different time-dependencies (overall r. m. s., VDV, running r. m. s., and no time-dependency); allowing use of either the maximum value of a running r. m. s. (i. e., MTVV) or the VDV; allowing different averaging periods when calculating the MTVV; using the crest factor to choose between r. m. s. and either the VDV or MTVV methods; defining two inconsistent criteria for deciding whether to use either the VDV or MTVV methods; giving no guidance on how MTVV values should be assessed; including two very different "health guidance caution zones" (for interpreting r. m. s. and VDV measures); providing ambiguous wording for the health guidance caution zones. Very different conclusions can be reached according to what is measured, how the vibration is evaluated and how it is assessed according to ISO 2631 (1997). However, even though it employs a slightly different frequency weighting for vertical vibration, and a 1 · 4 multiplying factor for horizontal vibration, ISO 2631 (1997) can be interpreted so as to provide evaluations similar to those made according to BS 6841 (1987). It is concluded that the recently revised International Standard for measuring, evaluating and assessing human exposures to vibration and shock will cause unnecessary confusion. © 1998 Academic Press. </p...|$|E
40|$|Observations {{indicate}} that most massive {{stars in the}} Galaxy appear in groups, called OB associations, where their strong wind activity generates large structures known as superbubbles, inside which the subsequent supernovae (SNe) explode, in tight space and time correlation. Acknowledging this fact, we investigate four main questions: 1) does the clustering of massive stars and SN explosions influence the particle acceleration process usually associated with SNe, and induce collective effects which would not manifest around isolated supernova remnants?; 2) does {{it make a difference}} for the general phenomenology of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs), notably for their energy spectrum and composition?; 3) can this help alleviate some of the problems encountered within the standard GCR source model?; and 4) Is the link between superbubbles and energetic particles supported by observational data, and can it be further tested and constrained? We argue for a positive answer to all these questions. Theoretical, phenomenological and observational aspects are treated in separate papers. Here, we discuss the interaction of massive stellar winds and SN shocks inside superbubbles and indicate how this leads to specific acceleration effects.
