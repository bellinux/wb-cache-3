5|$|When the College {{first opened}} in 1888 {{there was no}} uniform, instead the girls wore long cotton dresses, gloves and hat. A straw boater was {{introduced}} in the early 20th century, worn with a red and white hat band featuring the college crest with its burning bush woven into it in red. During this time Prefects wore <b>red</b> <b>silk</b> arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels include 16 silver {{trumpets}} {{dating from}} between 1780 and 1848. Nine {{of these are}} draped with <b>red</b> <b>silk</b> damask banners embroidered with coats of arms in gold, originally made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. They have not been used since the Corps of State Trumpeters was disbanded by the Duke of Wellington as a cost-cutting measure in the 19thcentury. The trumpeters' main job was to sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall. Today, the Band of the Household Cavalry and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force play their own trumpets at state occasions.|$|E
5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy <b>red</b> <b>silk</b> fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E

5|$|The {{most notable}} {{of the many}} rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were {{enhanced}} {{in the style of}} those at Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which leads from the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. This gallery leads to the first of the state rooms, the Officer's Room, where guests are greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a <b>red</b> <b>silk</b> canopy of estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held in this room since the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|The early {{variants}} of the Order were screw back badges to allow wear on clothing. Later variants (from 1943) {{hung from a}} standard Soviet pentagonal mount with a ring through the suspension loop. The mount was covered with an overlapping 24mm wide <b>red</b> <b>silk</b> moiré ribbon with 1.5mm wide white edge stripes and a 7mm wide white central stripe.|$|E

25|$|A Casa de Jantar da Rainha (Queen's Dining Room), {{a private}} {{dining room was}} never planned in the 1802 design of the Palace, but by 1880 {{there was a need}} for a {{communal}} space. The final room was decorated in <b>red</b> <b>silk</b> and rich wood grain trim from floor to ceiling, with a wood fireplace/stove on one wall (surmounted by a large mirror), while the opposite wall provides an entrance to adjacent Billiard Room. The floor is cover in inlaid parquet floor with a bronze lustre.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of travel in the 19th century, villages in Palestine remained isolated. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in cross-stitch. Ramallah women were famous for their distinctive dress of white linen fabric embroidered with <b>red</b> <b>silk</b> thread. The headdress or smadeh worn in Ramallah was common throughout northern Palestine: a small roundish cap, padded and stiffened, with gold and silver coins set in a fringe with a long veil pinned to the back, sometimes of silk and sometimes embroidered.|$|E

25|$|Bishops {{wear the}} {{above-mentioned}} purple cassock with scarlet piping, {{and add a}} pectoral cross suspended from a green and gold cord, a mozzetta over the rochet, and a purple zucchetto under the biretta.

30|$|To {{check the}} effect of natural {{sunlight}} on the synthesis of gold NPs, the irradiation of samples was implemented outdoor under natural sunlight.

500|$|For the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, {{the song}} was re-invented with a middle-eastern {{arrangement}} and risqué choreography which found Madonna wearing a gold corset, while simulating masturbation on a <b>red</b> <b>silk</b> bed, accompanied by two male dancers who wore the infamous cone bras designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier. The performance garnered a lot of attention, particularly when police in Toronto, Canada, threatened to arrest Madonna and charge her with indecency unless she altered the performance. Madonna refused and the show went ahead unaltered. The threatened arrest failed to materialise. Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. During The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993, Madonna wore a tuxedo and adopted a Marlene Dietrich-like persona, singing the song with a thick German accent. The overplayed accent and three-quarter time signature gave the performance a sense of parody. Dietrich's look in the 1930 film Morocco inspired the whole performance. The performance was included on [...] home video release, recorded on November 19, 1993 at Sydney, Australia.|$|E
500|$|Bani Na'im {{houses the}} tomb of Lot, a prophet in Islam and a righteous person in Judaism and Christianity, {{in the center of}} the town. The tomb is located within a rectangular-shaped mosque that {{contains}} an inner court and minaret. The lintel of the mosque's northern gate is built from stones dating to the Byzantine era when a church had possibly stood at the site. Lot's tomb was first mentioned by Saint Jerome, then by John of Wirtzburg in 1100, and Ali of Herat in 1173. While the Crusaders, who ruled the area from 1148 to 1187, were aware the tomb belonged to Lot, it remained a Muslim sanctuary unlike other Muslim edifices in Palestine which were converted to Christian use. In 1322, writer Sir John Mandeville writes [...] "two miles from Hebron, is the grave of Lot, Abraham's brother." [...] Ibn Battuta noted in 1326 that the tomb was covered by a [...] "fine building" [...] made of white stone and without columns. Muslim writers al-Suyuti and Mujir ad-Din wrote in the 15th and 16th centuries, respectively, that Lot was buried in Bani Na'im. Tawfiq Canaan, a researcher of Palestinian popular heritage, described the golden embroidered writing on the <b>red</b> <b>silk</b> cloth covering the tomb as reading, [...] "This is {{the tomb of}} prophet Lut, peace be upon him." ...|$|E
