25|$|In the 1970s, Sony {{developed}} the Betamax video tape <b>recording</b> <b>format.</b> Universal Studios and the Walt Disney Company {{were among the}} film industry members who were wary of this development, but were also aware the U.S. Congress was {{in the final stages}} of a major revision of copyright law and would likely be hesitant to undertake any new protections for the film industry. The companies therefore opted to sue Sony and its distributors in California District Court in 1976, alleging that because Sony was manufacturing a device that could be used for copyright infringement, they were thus liable for any infringement committed by its purchasers. The complaint additionally included an unfair competition claim under the Lanham Act, but this was dismissed early in the course of the lawsuit.|$|E
