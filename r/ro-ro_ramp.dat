The disembarkation of passengers, mainly using their own ships tenders was, until 2014 using a <b>ro-ro</b> <b>ramp</b> on the White Rock pier until an alternative pontoon and ramp were installed attached to the Albert Pier. Initially the ramp caused complaints as it was considered too steep to passengers to climb when tides were very low, in 2015 this was rectified with a longer ramp which reduced the gradient.|$|E
