40|$|<b>Reinforced</b> <b>construction</b> and {{strengthened}} building codes {{have been demonstrated}} to reduce expected damage from hurricanes in a cost effective manner. We examine whether <b>reinforced</b> <b>construction</b> (e. g. anchor bolts, hurricane clips, directional nailing) can provide efficient mitigation of property damage from tornadoes, using {{a case study of}} homes damaged in the May 3 1999 Oklahoma City Tornado. We find that if a package of wind resistant construction measures that cost no more than $ 500 could reduce insured losses by 30 %, wind resistant construction could have a positive net present value in the most tornado prone states. A 30 % reduction in wind damage is in line with estimates of damage reduction for construction in hurricane winds. The expected property damage reduction falls off rapidly in less tornado prone states...|$|R
