25|$|The {{contention}} of the proponents, {{that the tax}} <b>rate</b> <b>cuts</b> would more than cover any increases in federal debt, was influenced by a theoretical taxation model based on the elasticity of tax rates, known as the Laffer curve. Arthur Laffer's model predicts that excessive tax rates actually reduce potential tax revenues, by lowering the incentive to produce; the model also predicts that insufficient tax rates (rates below the optimum level for a given economy) lead directly {{to a reduction in}} tax revenues.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, economies {{globally}} experienced a slowdown. The US economy grew only 0.3% in April, May, and June 2002 {{from a year}} earlier, and the Federal Reserve made 11 <b>rate</b> <b>cuts</b> that year {{in an attempt to}} stimulate the US economy. The EU scarcely grew throughout the whole of 2002, and many members' governments (notably in Germany and France) lost control of public finances, causing large deficits that broke the terms of the EMU Stability and Growth Pact.|$|E

25|$|Mellon {{believed}} that the income tax should remain progressive but with lower rates than those enacted during World War I. He thought that the top income earners would willingly pay their taxes only if rates were 25% or lower. Mellon proposed tax <b>rate</b> <b>cuts,</b> which Congress enacted in the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926. The top marginal tax rate was cut from 73% to 58% in 1922, 50% in 1923, 46% in 1924, 25% in 1925, and 24% in 1929. Rates in lower brackets were also cut substantially, relieving burdens on the middle-class, working-class, and poor households.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2007–08 {{financial}} crisis {{there is a}} renewed interest in Hayek’s core explanation of boom-and-bust cycles, which serves as an alternative explanation to that of the savings glut as launched by Bernanke. Economists at the Bank of International Settlements, e.g. William White, emphasize the importance of Hayekian insights and the impact of monetary policies and credit growth as root causes of financial cycles. A. Hoffmann and G. Schnabl provide an international perspective and explain recurring financial cycles in the world economy as consequence of gradual interest <b>rate</b> <b>cuts</b> led by the central banks in the large advanced economies since the 1980s. N. Cachanosky outlines the impact of US monetary policy on the production structure in Latin America.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, the euro briefly fell to a four-month low against the dollar. [...] However, due to the unprecedented nature of the negative interest rate, {{the long-term effects of}} the stimulus measures are hard to predict. [...] Bank president Mario Draghi signalled the central bank was willing {{to do whatever it takes}} to turn around the eurozone economies, remarking [...] "Are we finished? The answer is no."

2500|$|Mellon became unpopular {{with the}} onset of the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover, in memoirs {{published}} decades later, wrote that Mellon advised him as President to [...] "liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate... it will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. People will work harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up from less competent people." [...] Hoover claimed credit for disregarding this advice and intervening in the market, though with little success. There is no corroboration that Mellon ever said such a thing, however, and the claim that he did is inconsistent with his published speeches, which supported anti-recessionary measures by the Federal Reserve. As Treasury Secretary, Mellon was an ex-officio member of the Federal Reserve Board. There, he successfully urged the Fed to cut its discount rate after the stock market crash in October 1929, and supported subsequent <b>rate</b> <b>cuts,</b> although only a third of the commercial banks were a part of the Federal Reserve and could benefit from the <b>rate</b> <b>cuts.</b> In November 1929, he recommended a cut of 1 percentage point in personal and corporate income tax rates. He supported Hoover's proposal to increase federal construction spending as an antirecession measure.|$|E
