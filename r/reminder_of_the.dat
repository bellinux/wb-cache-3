5|$|For many {{communities}} {{the existence of}} buildings that formerly housed residential schools are a traumatic <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system's legacy, {{and there has been}} much discussion about demolition, heritage status and how the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process.|$|E
5|$|The EPB {{was founded}} by Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, Juan Enrique Segarra-Palmer and Orlando González Claudio on July 26, 1976, with the date being symbolically used as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States {{invasion}} during the Spanish–American War. It can trace its origins back to the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and a constant <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, {{to the surprise of}} all.|$|E

Avoiding <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event: the athlete, if is {{encountered}} with {{an injury}} to trigger their PTSD, they involuntary ignore and block off certain <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event. These <b>reminders</b> could be people, activities, feelings associated with the event, or places which remind them of their accident; they do this to ensure no painful memories become stronger.|$|R
50|$|Changes in {{behavior}} due to avoidance (or its opposite, excessive proximity-seeking—refraining from going places, doing things, or having contact {{with things that}} are <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss; feeling drawn to <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person—wanting to see, touch, hear or smell things to feel close {{to the person who}} died). Both symptoms may coexist in the same individual.|$|R
50|$|By 1871, only 78 people {{remained}} in Star City. Today <b>the</b> only <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town are crumbling foundations and rusted mill equipment.|$|R
5|$|Between 1873 and 1875, mineowners Fletcher Burrows built a small {{model village}} at Howe Bridge, {{comprising}} cottages, shops, a village club, and a bath house for their employees. This Victorian village {{on either side}} of Leigh Road, together with St Michael and All Angel's Church, is a conservation area. The Ena Mill, one of Atherton's large spinning mills, complete with chimney, survives as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> textile industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1881 Barlow sat {{as member}} of the Wind Pressure (Railway Structures) Commission {{established}} at {{the recommendation of the}} Tay Bridge report. He led the design of the replacement Tay Bridge (188287) with his son Crawford Barlow as engineer. The new design used large monocoque piers to support a double railway track. The old brick and masonry piers from the first bridge were retained as breakwaters for the new piers upstream. They can still be seen today as a forlorn <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tragedy of 1879.|$|E
5|$|A small plaque erected by the Datchet Parish Council in 2000 is {{the only}} <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Divided Bridge. Datchet High Street which once {{continued}} on over the bridge to Berkshire ends abruptly at the Thames and the bank on the Buckinghamshire side is now occupied by a marina car park. The Crown and Angel public house on the Berkshire bank depicted {{in many of the}} contemporary drawings of the bridge was demolished {{at the same time as}} the bridge; a Victorian estate cottage now stands its place.|$|E

50|$|By 1920, Blair was a ghost town. Besides the {{historical}} marker <b>the</b> only <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town are <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> stone buildings and <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old mill.|$|R
5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E
5|$|Avoiding {{stereotypes}} and labeling {{based on personal}} dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{anti-ice}} {{was turned}} {{on for the}} two engines during taxi. The captain announced to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and {{they should not be}} worried seeing them in the retracted position. He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Sunderland {{moved to}} their present ground, Stadium of Light in Monkwearmouth, which was opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Built with an {{original}} capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team Ajax. The stadium bears a similar {{name to the}} Portuguese club Benfica's ground Estádio da Luz, albeit in a different language. Stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A Davy lamp monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner {{was presented to the}} club by the Durham Miners' Association, as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monkwearmouth Colliery pit the stadium was built on.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, {{the park was}} long known chiefly for its {{isolated}} location and primitive camping facilities. In August 1952it played host to the first Woodsmen's Carnival, an annual celebration of the lumbering industry, which was again active in the second growth forests in the area. The festival, originally sponsored by the Penn-York Lumbermen's Club, features lumberjack competitions as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, as well as displays of new equipment. In 1987the Galeton Rotary Club took over sponsorship, and renamed the event the Woodsmen's Show in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Local traditions include Lantern Night, {{which was}} held on 16 September and {{involved}} children in the town with candle lanterns made from hollowed out root vegetables such as Mangelwurzel or swede. It was the last remaining <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Watchet Fair (also known as St Decuman's Fair). Another tradition is Queen Caturn's Day on the last Saturday of November. Watchet was famous for its blue dye and Queen Caturn was so impressed she bestowed the town's folk with cider and cakes {{as a reward for}} this. The tradition is carried on with costumes and celebrations.|$|E
25|$|With four {{component}} parts, the RSGS logo has {{references to}} the Society's collection and historical geography (old map and compass), environment and nature (leaves), human geography (people), and physical geography (pebbles).

5|$|Shapinsay {{is one of}} the Orkney Islands off {{the north}} coast of {{mainland}} Scotland. There is one village on the island, Balfour, from which roll-on/roll-off car ferries sail to Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland. Balfour Castle, built in the Scottish Baronial style, {{is one of the}} island's most prominent features, a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Balfour family's domination of Shapinsay during the 18th and 19th centuries; the Balfours transformed life on the island by introducing new agricultural techniques. Other landmarks include a standing stone, an Iron Age broch, a souterrain and a salt-water shower.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the burial}} was first {{reported}} in the press, there had been doubts as to its veracity and scope, leading to it being frequently dismissed as an urban legend. In either case the event had become a cultural icon and a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North American video game crash of 1983; {{it was the end}} result of a disastrous fiscal year which saw Atari, Inc. sold off by its parent company Warner Communications. Though it was believed that millions of copies of E.T. were disposed of in the landfill, Atari officials later verified the numbers to be around 700,000 cartridges of various titles, including E.T.|$|E
5|$|Stretford Urban District {{became the}} Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough {{status in the}} United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre {{represents}} John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from {{the arms of the}} de Trafford family; the scythe is a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.|$|E

5|$|The “Copper-Coloured Mountain Paradise of Padmasambahva” (Zangdopari) is vividly {{displayed}} in a heart shape on every thangkha and also painted {{on the walls of}} the monastery as a constant <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legend. The paintings are set on a pedestal that represents the realm of the King of Nagas amidst Dakinis (mKha-hgro-ma), and the pinnacle in the painting denotes the domain of Brahma. The paintings also depict Klu (Naga) demigods with a human head and the body of a serpent, which are said to reside in lakes (said to denote that they are guarding the hidden treasures). Allegorically, they mean to represent the spiritual holy writings. The paintings also show what is termed as “Walkers in the Sky” (mKha-hgro-ma).|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, {{and should not be}} a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
40|$|Complicated {{grief is}} a {{recently}} recognized condition {{that occurs in}} about 7 % of bereaved people. People with this condition are caught up in rumination about <b>the</b> circumstances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> death, worry about its consequences, or excessive avoidance <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss. Unable to comprehend the finality and consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss, they resort to excessive avoidance <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss as they are tossed helplessly on waves of intense emotion. People with complicated grief need help, and clinicians {{need to know how}} to recognize the symptoms and how to provide help. This paper provides a framework to help clinicans understand bereavement, grief, and mourning. Evidence-based diagnostic criteria are provided to help clinicians recognize complicated grief, and differentiate it from depression as well as anxiety disorder.
