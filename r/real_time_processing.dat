40|$|Summary. <b>Real</b> <b>time</b> image <b>processing</b> {{requires}} processing {{huge amounts}} of data {{in a very short}} time. Having this data processed serially, as it is the case using a von Neumann architecture, meeting a <b>real</b> <b>time</b> constraint usu-ally needs a high clock frequency leading to bulky designs and high power consumption. FPGAs on the other hand can process data in parallel making them a suitable platform for <b>real</b> <b>time</b> image <b>processing</b> algorithms especially for mobile robots. This paper presents an implementation of a <b>real</b> <b>time</b> algo-rithm that extracts colour histograms from an image stream connected to an FPGA extension module that was designed for the Khepera robot. The colour histograms provide data being characteristic for a specific place and offer a useful technique for vision based navigation. ...|$|R
