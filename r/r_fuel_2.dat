40|$|Requirements for {{describing}} coniferous forests are changing {{in response to}} wildfire concerns, bio-energy needs, and climate change interests. At the same time, technology advancements are transforming how forest properties can be measured. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) is yielding promising results for measuring tree biomass parameters that, historically, have required costly destructive sampling and resulted in small sample sizes. Here we investigate whether TLS intensity data {{can be used to}} distinguish foliage and small branches (≤ 0. 635 cm diameter; coincident with the one-hour timelag fuel size class) from larger branchwood (> 0. 635 cm) in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) branch specimens. We also consider the use of laser density for predicting biomass by size class. Measurements are addressed across multiple ranges and scan angles. Results show TLS capable of distinguishing fine fuels from branches at a threshold of one standard deviation above mean intensity. Additionally, the relationship between return density and biomass is linear by fuel type for fine <b>fuels</b> (<b>r</b> <b>2</b> = 0. 898; SE 22. 7 %) and branchwood (r 2 =  0. 937; SE 28. 9 %), as well as for total mass (r 2 = 0. 940; SE 25. 5 %). Intensity decays predictably as scan distances increase; however, the range-intensity relationship is best described by an exponential model rather than 1 /d 2. Scan angle appears to have no systematic effect on fine fuel discrimination, while some differences are observed in density-mass relationships with changing angles due to shadowing...|$|R

Effects of thinning and prescribed fire on forest-floor fuels were studied in mixed-oak forests of south-eastern Ohio to examine fuel dynamics over time. Fuel characteristics were measured before, immediately after, and 3 years following fire and thinning treatments along 20 -m transects (n = 432) following Brown’s planar intersect method. Measurements {{were taken to}} determine litter, duff, 1 -h, 10 -h, 100 -h, and 1000 -h sound (1000 S) or rotten (1000 <b>R)</b> <b>fuel</b> mass. Coarse woody debris (CWD) was sampled on 432 additional 80 -m 2 belt-transects. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with post-hoc Bonferonni comparisons was used to analyse {{the change in the}} fuels over time. The specific effects of silvicultural treatments varied over time with changes in larger, sound fuels (1000 S and CWD) persisting longer than changes to finer (litter, duff, 1 -h, 10 -h, and 100 -h) or less-sound (1000 <b>R)</b> <b>fuels,</b> which appear to be more transient. Unlike in western North America where fuels accumulate over time, decomposition and productivity appear comparable in eastern mixed-oak forests.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a global model of climate policy, {{focusing on the}} choice between tax and cap-and-trade solutions. We assume that {{the world can be}} split into two regions, with two fuels that both lead to carbon emissions. Region A consumes all fuels, and is responsible for defining and implementing climate policy. Region B produces all of fuel 1 (oil), while <b>fuel</b> <b>2</b> (interpreted as either coal; natural gas; or renewables) is both produced and consumed in region A. We study three model variants. All involve full policy coordination within each country block, but no coordination across blocks; and all involve an optimal producer tax on fuel 1 by region B. In model 1, region A sets two fuel consumption taxes, one for each fuel. The optimal region A tax on fuel 1 then exceeds the Pigou level as defined by the region; while the tax set on <b>fuel</b> <b>2</b> is Pigouvian. Presence of a second fuel in region A reduces region B’s optimal tax on fuel 1. In model 2, region A sets a common carbon tax, which is lower (higher) for <b>fuel</b> 1 (<b>2)</b> than in model 1. In model 3, region A sets a carbon emissions cap. This enhances region B’s strategic position via the trade-off between <b>fuels</b> 1 and <b>2</b> in region A, following from the cap.

40|$|Abstract The lower {{troposphere}} {{is an excellent}} receptacle, which integrates anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions over large areas. Therefore, atmospheric concentration observations over populated regions would provide the ultimate proof if sustained emissions changes have oc-curred. The most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2), also shows large natural concentra-tion variations, which need to be disentangled from anthropogenic signals to assess changes in associated emissions. This is in principle possible for the fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2</b> component (FFCO 2) by high-precision radiocarbon (14 C) analyses because FFCO 2 is free of radiocarbon. Long-term observations of 14 CO 2 conducted at two sites in south-western Germany do not yet reveal any significant trends in the regional fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2</b> component. We rather observe strong inter-annual variations, which are largely imprinted by changes of atmospheric transport as supported by dedicated transport model simulations of fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2.</b> In this paper, we show that, depending on the remoteness of the site, changes of about 7 – 26 % in fossil fuel emissions in respective catchment areas could be detected with confi-dence by high-precision atmospheric 14 CO 2 measurements when comparing 5 -year averages if these inter-annual variations were taken into account. This perspective constitutes the urgently needed tool for validation of fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2</b> emissions changes {{in the framework of}} the Kyoto protocol and successive climate initiatives...|$|R
