5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the United States Numbered Highways, the U.S. relied on an informal network of roads, organized by various competing interests, collectively called the auto trail system. The surveyors of most trails chose either South Pass in Wyoming or a southern route through New Mexico to traverse the Rocky Mountains. Both options were less formidable than the higher mountain passes in Colorado, but left the state without a transcontinental artery. When the planners of the Lincoln Highway also decided to cross the Rockies in Wyoming, officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main <b>route</b> <b>in</b> Nebraska, enter Colorado, and return to the main <b>route</b> <b>in</b> Wyoming. While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way, the loop proved impractical and was soon removed.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, White Star {{refitted}} Suevic, {{adding the}} capacity for 266 second-class passengers, after which {{she returned to her}} Australian <b>route.</b> <b>In</b> March 1924, she completed her 50th voyage on that <b>route.</b> <b>In</b> 1928, though, Suevic was showing her age, and White Star sold her to Yngvar Hvistendahl's Finnhval A/S for £35,000, who renamed her Skytteren and sent her to Germaniawerft at Kiel to be converted into a whaling factory ship. She served with the Norwegian whaling fleets in Antarctic waters. 1936 AS Finnhval came under control of the Norwegian shipping agent Jørgen Krag who handled on behalf of the German Margarine Union. So until the war her hunting results were delivered to Germany.|$|E

5|$|Planning for Metro {{began with}} the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955 which {{attempted}} to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient {{to meet the needs}} of 1980. In 1959, the study's final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a moratorium on freeway construction through July 1, 1962. The National Capital Transportation Agency's 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report anticipated much of the present Blue Line <b>route</b> <b>in</b> Virginia with the route following the railroad right-of-way inside Arlington and Alexandria to Springfield. It did not include a <b>route</b> <b>in</b> Prince George's County. The route continued in rapid transit plans until the formation of WMATA.|$|E
