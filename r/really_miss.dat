500|$|On 9 May 2012, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{reported}} Lapinskas {{would be}} leaving EastEnders. His character departed 30 August 2012. Of his exit, Lapinskas said [...] "I'm having a fantastic time working on EastEnders and {{playing the role of}} Anthony Moon. Working with David Essex, Tony Discipline and the EastEnders cast has been an absolute pleasure. Although I will <b>really</b> <b>miss</b> EastEnders and everyone involved, I am very excited about future projects and what is next for me as an actor." [...] Lapinskas revealed that Anthony's exit plot sees him make a [...] "big mistake". Anthony realises how much he loves Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) but is unsure how to deal with her brother and father Joey (David Witts) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) respectively. Speaking to Soaplife, Lapinskas said [...] "Joey manipulates Anthony into challenging Derek, which is a big mistake. I can't give too much away, but I can tell you that after going up against Derek, Anthony {{has no choice but to}} leave the Square." [...] Magazine reports claim that Anthony packs his bags after losing everything to Joey and Derek, revising his gambling problem. Lapinskas hopes that Anthony will return someday. In an interview with Inside Soap, Lapinskas said that EastEnders was his first job outside of drama school and added that he has learnt a lot from the people he worked with. He also added [...] "I was quite disappointed when I found out Anthony {{would be leaving}}, I'd have liked to do a lot more stuff with him. It's a shame to not be a part of what's coming up." ...|$|E

I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it."

2500|$|In 1913, at age 21, Vita {{married the}} 27-year-old writer and {{politician}} Harold George Nicolson (21 November 1886 – 1 May 1968) {{in the private}} chapel at Knole. Nicknamed Hadji, or pilgrim, by his father, he was the third son of British diplomat Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock (1849–1928). Sackville-West's parents were opposed to the marriage under the grounds that Nicloson had an annual income of £250 as he was the third secretary at the British Embassy in Constantinople {{and his father had}} been made a peer only under Queen Victoria while another of Sackville-West's suitors, Lord Granby [...] had an annual income of £100,000 pounds, owned vast acres of land and was heir to an old title, the Duchy of Rutland. The couple had an open marriage. Both Sackville-West and her husband had same-sex relationships before and during their marriage, as did {{some of the people in}} the Bloomsbury Group of writers and artists, with many of whom they had connections. Writing in the third person Sackville-West wrote in her early years of her marriage she [...] "never knew the physical passion she had felt for Rosamund, she didn't <b>really</b> <b>miss</b> it either". Sackville-West saw herself as psychologically divided into two: one side of her personality was feminine, soft, submissive and attracted to men while the other side was masculine, hard, aggressive and attracted to women. Following the pattern of his father's career, Harold Nicholson was at different times a diplomat, journalist, broadcaster, Member of Parliament, and author of biographies and novels. The couple lived from 1912 to 1914 in Cihangir, a suburb of Constantinople (now Istanbul), the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Sackville-West loved Constantinople, writing a poem to celebrate the city that read: [...] "She has an early morning all her own/A blending of mist and sea and sun/Into an indistinguishable one". However, the duties of a diplomat's wife did not appeal to her and only during her time in the Ottoman Empire did she accept with good grace playing the part of a [...] "correct and adoring wife of the brilliant young diplomat" [...] as she sarcastically later wrote. After returning to England in the summer of 1914 to ensure that a pregnant Sackville-West would give birth in a British hospital, the couple bought Long Barn in Kent, where they lived from 1915 to 1930. The British declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914 following Ottoman naval attacks on Russia precluded a return to Constantinople. They employed the architect Edwin Lutyens to make many improvements to the house. The couple had two children: Nigel (1917–2004), who became a well-known editor, politician, and writer, and Benedict (1914–1978), an art historian. At Christmas 1917, Nicolson had to tell his wife that he contracted a venereal disease following one of his anonymous sexual encounters with either a man he met at a party that spring whose name he could not remember or a servant at the Knebworth estate and he probably passed it along to her, though subsequent medical tests established he did not.|$|E
