40|$|Abstract—In recent years, a {{recurrent}} <b>neural</b> network called <b>projection</b> <b>neural</b> network was proposed for solving monotone variational inequalities and related convex optimization problems. In this paper, {{we show that}} the <b>projection</b> <b>neural</b> network {{can also be used}} to solve pseudomonotone variational inequalities and related pseudoconvex optimization problems. Under various pseu-domonotonicity conditions and other conditions, the <b>projection</b> <b>neural</b> network is proved to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov and globally convergent, globally asymptotically stable, and globally exponentially stable. Since monotonicity is a special case of pseu-domononicity, the <b>projection</b> <b>neural</b> network can be applied to solve a broader class of constrained optimization problems related to variational inequalities. Moreover, a new concept, called com-ponentwise pseudomononicity, different from pseudomononicity in general, is introduced. Under this new concept, two stability results of the <b>projection</b> <b>neural</b> network for solving variational in-equalities are also obtained. Finally, numerical examples show the effectiveness and performance of the <b>projection</b> <b>neural</b> network.

In a previous study, we reported that noradrenaline (NA) microinjection into the dPAG of rats caused pressor response that was mediated by vasopressin release. Vasopressin is synthesized by magnocellular neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei. In the present study, we verified which nuclei mediated the cardiovascular response to NA {{as well as the}} existence of direct <b>neural</b> <b>projection</b> from the dPAG to hypothalamic nuclei. Then, we studied the effect of treating either PVN or SON with the nonselective synaptic blocker cobalt chloride (1 mM) on the cardiovascular response to NA (15 nmol) microinjection into dPAG. Attempting to identify <b>neural</b> <b>projections</b> from dPAG to hypothalamic nuclei, we microinjected the neuronal tracer biotinylated-dextran-amine (BDA) into the dPAG and searched varicosity-containing nerve terminals in the PVN and SON. Unilateral cobalt-induced inhibition of synapses in the SON did not affect the cardiovascular response to NA. However, unilateral inhibition of PVN significantly reduced the pressor response to NA. Moreover, cobalt-induced inhibition of synapses in both PVN blocked the pressor response caused by NA microinjected into the dPAG. Microinjection of BDA into the dPAG evidenced presence of varicosity-containing neuronal fibers in PVN but not in SON. The results from cobalt treatment indicated that synapses in PVN mediate the vasopressin-induced pressor response caused by NA microinjection into the dPAG. In addition, the neuroanatomical results from BDA microinjection into the dPAG pointed out the existence of direct <b>neural</b> <b>projections</b> from the dPAG site to the PVN. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

Seventy-three domestic chick embryos (Gallus domesticus) were used. FTC 2 ̆ 7 s were recorded from the cochlear ganglion via the recessus scala tympani in 44 animals. Biocytin was injected iontophoretically or with hydraulic pressure. Cochleae were processed as wholemounts with an avidin-HRP conjugate and DAB. Definitive labeling of <b>neural</b> <b>projections</b> to the papilla was then documented and distance of labelled neurons was measured from the apex in seven animals. Neural characteristic frequency (CF) was then displayed as a function of the distance from the apex expressed in percent. ^ The majority of FTC 2 ̆ 7 s exhibited the typical 2 ̆ 7 V 2 ̆ 7 shape described for older birds and appeared strikingly mature in thresholds (34 to 97 dBSPL), low (61. 9 ± 37) and high (64. 6 ± 33) frequency slopes (dB/octave), and tip sharpness (Q 10 dB = 5. 2 ± 3). CF 2 ̆ 7 s ranged from 188 to 1623 Hz. Some tuning curves displayed an unusual 2 ̆ 2 sawtooth 2 ̆ 2 shaped pattern. The most significant sign of immaturity was the limited expression of high frequencies that in part may be due to the developing middle ear transfer function, and to immature basal regions of the papilla. The tonotopic map for the E 19 chick cochlea was comparable to maps reported by Manley et al. (1987) for P 2 and P 21 chicks at least for 200 to 1600 Hz.

Abstract — Neurobiology investigates how {{anatomical}} and physiological relationships in the nervous system mediate behavior. Molecular genetic techniques, applied to species such as the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{have proven to be}} an important tool in this research. Large databases of transgenic specimens are being built and need to be analyzed to establish models of neural information processing. In this paper we present an approach for the exploration and analysis of neural circuits based on such a database. We have designed and implemented BrainGazer, a system which integrates visualization techniques for volume data acquired through confocal microscopy as well as annotated anatomical structures with an intuitive approach for accessing the available information. We focus on the ability to visually query the data based on semantic as well as spatial relationships. Additionally, we present visualization techniques for the concurrent depiction of neurobiological volume data and geometric objects which aim to reduce visual clutter. The described system is the result of an ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration between neurobiologists and visualization researchers.
