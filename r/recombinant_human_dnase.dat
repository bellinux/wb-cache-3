It is defined as a persistent irreversible dilatation and distortion of medium-sized bronchi. Patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis frequently have difficulty expectorating the infected sputum.

30|$|CF and COPD airways are {{characterized}} by high levels of DNA [49] and actin [60] in the lung lumen, which are released by necrotic neutrophils [36]. Excess DNA and actin adversely alter mucus rheology and increase viscosity, leading to decreased mucociliary clearance [48]. Therefore, another approach to increase mucociliary clearance in CF and COPD lungs is to decrease mucus viscosity by cleaving extracellular DNA. Dornase alfa is a <b>recombinant</b> version of <b>human</b> <b>Dnase</b> 1 protein that {{is used as a}} therapeutic for CF [61]. Dnase 1 cleaves extracellular DNA in the lung lumen leading to reduced DNA length/concentration and, therefore, reduced sputum viscosity.

Because of their portability, newer-generation vibrating-mesh nebulizers offer greater convenience for the patient, but their efficiency in deliver-ing rhDNase has not been determined. METHODS: We compared a newer-generation vibrating-mesh nebulizer (Omron MicroAir) to a Pari LC with the Pari ProNeb Ultra compressor (a commonly employed rhDNase administration system). With the Next Generation Pharmaceutical Impactor, we determined aerosol particle distribution. We also measured mass output efficiency, nebulization time, and mass of rhDNase that deposited on a filter during simulated breathing. RESULTS: The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of aerosol from the MicroAir (MMAD 4. 3 m, GSD 2. 8 m) was equivalent to that from the Pari LC (MMAD 4. 2 m, GSD 2. 7 m). During simulated breathing the MicroAir had a higher total mass output efficiency (88 %) than the Pari LC (68 %) (P<. 001), and total nebulization time was shorter with the MicroAir (6. 1 min vs 7. 2 min, P. 03). When nebulized to dryness, the mass of rhDNase delivered to the filter was comparable with the MicroAir (1. 30 0. 4 mg) and Pari LC (1. 21 0. 05 mg).

40|$|Malaria {{remains one}} of the {{greatest}} burdens to global health, causing nearly 500, 000 deaths in 2014. When manifesting in the lungs, severe malaria causes acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). We have previously shown that a proportion of DBA/ 2 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) develop ALI/ARDS and that these mice recapitulate various aspects of the human syndrome, such as pulmonary edema, hemorrhaging, pleural effusion and hypoxemia. Herein, we investigated the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of malaria-associated ALI/ARDS. Mice developing ALI/ARDS showed greater neutrophil accumulation in the lungs compared with mice that did not develop pulmonary complications. In addition, mice with ALI/ARDS produced more neutrophil-attracting chemokines, myeloperoxidase and reactive oxygen species. We also observed that the parasites Plasmodium falciparum and PbA induced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) ex vivo, which were associated with inflammation and tissue injury. The depletion of neutrophils, treatment with AMD 3100 (a CXCR 4 antagonist), Pulmozyme (<b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNase)</b> or Sivelestat (inhibitor of neutrophil elastase) decreased the development of malaria-associated ALI/ARDS and significantly increased mouse survival.

P. L. Shah, S. F. Scott, R. A. Knight, M. E. Hodson. ERS Journals Ltd 1996. ABSTRACT: In cystic fibrosis (CF), neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation results in high levels of neutrophil elastase (NE). Some of these proteases are sequestered by the large amounts of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present in puru-lent sputum. Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase), a new treatment in CF, depolymerizes DNA. Our concerns were that this might release proteases bound to DNA, which could be potentially harmful. The in vitro and in vivo effects of rhDNase on NE and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) were evaluated. The acute effects of rhDNase were evaluated in CF patients during the first 6 days of treatment. Medium-term effects were evaluated in stable CF patients observed on rhDNase over 6 months. Sputum samples were collected at regular intervals and NE activity was measured by a fluorimetric assay and IL- 8 with a radioimmunoassay. In vitro addition of rhDNase resulted in a twofold increase in protease activity and this was reflected in an acute transient rise on initiation of treatment with rhDNase. Medium-term treatment {{was associated with a}} decline in NE activity and IL- 8. These in vivo results are encouraging, since the increase in protease activity was transient and the trend over 6 months was a reduction in both inflammatory markers...|$|E

A rabbit posterolateral intertransverse process fusion {{model was}} used to {{evaluate}} the effect that different doses of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> bone morphogenetic protein- 4 delivered in a porous hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate ceramic had on osteogenesis and spinal fusion. Objective. To study the biologic effect and threshold dose of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> bone morphogenetic protein- 4 in enhancing spinal fusion. Summary of Background Data. Biologic manipulation for spinal fusion is an area undergoing active research. The enhancing effects of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 7 on spinal fusion have been proved, and clinical trials of their application are in progress. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>human</b> bone morphogenetic protein- 4 is another osteoinductive protein that has the ability to induce heterotopic bone formation, and its potential for enhancing spinal fusion has not yet been studied. Methods. For this study, 24 adult New Zealand white rabbits underwent single-level unilateral posterior intertransverse process spinal fusion at L 5 -L 6. The animals were divided into four groups using different graft materials: allograft as well as hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate augmented with 0, 1. 25, and 5 ug of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> bone morphogenetic protein- 4, respectively. The local changes were evaluated by sequential radiograph, manual palpation, histo morphology, and microradiography. Results.

40|$|Abstract Background Bronchiectasis is {{predominantly}} an acquired disease process {{that represents the}} end stage {{of a variety of}} unrelated pulmonary insults. It is defined as persistent irreversible dilatation and distortion of medium-sized bronchi. It has been suggested that with widespread use of high-resolution computed tomography, more bronchiectasis diagnoses are being made. Patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis frequently have difficulty expectorating sputum. Sputum therefore is retained in the lungs and may become infected, leading to further lung damage. Mucolytic agents target hypersecretion or changed physiochemical properties of sputum {{to make it easier to}} clear. One drug, <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase,</b> breaks down the DNA that is released at the site of infection by neutrophils. Mucus clearance along with antimicrobial therapy remains an integral part of bronchiectasis management. Chest physiotherapy along with mucolytic agents is commonly used in practice without clear supportive evidence. Objectives To determine whether ingested or inhaled mucolytics are effective in the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted experts in the field and drug companies. Searches were current as of June 2013. Selection criteria Randomised trials of mucolytic treatment in people with bronchiectasis but not cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Data extraction was performed independently by two review authors. Study authors were contacted for confirmation. Main results Four trials (with a combined total of 528 adult participants) were included, but almost none of the data from these studies could be aggregated in a meta-analysis. One trial (with 88 participants) compared bromhexine versus placebo. Compared with placebo, high doses of bromhexine with antibiotics eased difficulty in expectoration (mean difference (MD) - 0. 53, 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 81 to - 0. 25 at 16 days); the quality of the evidence was rated as low. A reduction in sputum production was noted with bromhexine (MD - 21. 5 %, 95 % CI - 38. 9 to - 4. 1 at day 16); again the quality of the evidence was rated as low. No significant differences between bromhexine and placebo were observed with respect to reported adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 2. 93; 95 % CI 0. 12 to 73. 97), and again the quality of the evidence was rated as low. In a single small, blinded but not placebo-controlled trial of older (> 55 years) participants with stable bronchiectasis and mucus hypersecretion, erdosteine combined with physiotherapy over a 15 -day period improved spirometry and sputum purulence more effectively compared with physiotherapy alone. The spirometric improvement was small (MD 200 mL in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and 300 mL in forced vital capacity (FVC)) and was apparent only at day 15, not at earlier time points. The remaining two studies (with a combined total of 410 participants) compared <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> (RhDNase) versus placebo. These two studies were very different (one was a two-week study of 61 participants, and the other ran for 24 weeks and included 349 participants), and the opportunity for combining data from the two studies was very limited. Compared with placebo, <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> showed no difference in FEV 1 or FVC in the smaller study but showed a significant negative effect on FEV 1 in the larger and longer study. For reported adverse events, no significant differences between <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> and placebo were noted. In all of the above comparisons of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> versus placebo, the quality of the evidence was judged to be low. Authors' conclusions Given the harmful effects of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> in one trial and no evidence of benefit, this drug should be avoided in non–cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, except in the context of clinical trials. Evidence is insufficient to permit evaluation of the routine use of other mucolytics for bronchiectasis. High doses of bromhexine coupled with antibiotics may help with sputum production and clearance, but long-term data and robust clinical outcomes are lacking. Similarly, erdosteine may be a useful adjunct to physiotherapy in stable patients with mucus hypersecretion, but robust longer-term trials are required. Generally, clinical trials in children on the use of various mucolytic agents are lacking. As the number of agents available on the market, such as RhDNase, acetylcysteine and bromhexine, is increasing, improvement of the evidence base is needed. Plain language summary Mucolytic drugs (to help make phlegm easier to cough up) for people with bronchiectasis Review question: This review considered the question of whether mucolytics may be helpful for people with bronchiectasis who do not also have cystic fibrosis. Studies of participants with cystic fibrosis were not included in this review, and we are unable to draw any conclusions on this treatment's relevance to people with cystic fibrosis. Background: Bronchiectasis is a lung condition that usually develops after a series of lung problems (such as childhood infections, problems in lung structure, tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis). A lot of mucus (phlegm) collects in the lungs, causing discomfort and the need to cough it up. The phlegm also collects bacteria, which can add to breathing difficulties. Mucolytic drugs break down phlegm, which can make it easier to cough up. Study characteristics: Four studies (with a total of 528 participants) were identified that met the inclusion criterion of comparing mucolytic treatment versus no mucolytic treatment. All studies were conducted in adults. One study considered bromhexine versus placebo, two compared RhDNase versus placebo (one for a period of two weeks and the other over a period of 24 weeks) and the fourth compared erdosteine with physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone in elderly patients. The small number of studies available for review and their different designs meant that only descriptions of the individual studies were possible with very limited opportunities for combining the studies in single analyses. Key results: No strong evidence is available to support the use of these drugs in people with bronchiectasis (from causes other than cystic fibrosis); however it is not possible to draw any clear conclusions, as so few studies have been reported. Quality of the evidence: Details of the way patients were allocated to receive or not receive mucolytics were not clearly described in any of the four studies. This was considered carefully in the review in relation to our level of uncertainty in interpreting the results. When this is taken into account, together with the imprecision of the results, estimates of the usefulness of mucolytics as treatment were generally judged to be of low quality in relation to (non–cystic fibrosis) bronchiectasis...|$|E

Both actin and DNA co-localize in the filaments previously identified as DNA alone. Treatment of sputum samples with <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> I or the actin-filament-severing protein, gelsolin, both previously found to decrease viscosity, dissolves the sputum fiber bundles.

Methods: Twenty-five patients received <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin 4 days before the operation, and 28 patients comprised the control group. All the hematologic parameters of the patients are measured on the day of admission, the day before the operation (fourth day), the first day after the operation, and 1 week later. Results: In the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin group the mean hemoglobin concentration increased on the morning of the operation (14. 5 ± 0. 52 g/dL in the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin group and 12. 4 ± 0. 65 in the control group, P <. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Erythropoietin {{has been}} shown to be {{protective}} against hypoxic-ischemic and inflammatory injuries in cell culture, animal models of brain injury, and clinical trials of adult humans. The rationale for our study was that early administration of high-dose <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin may reduce perinatal brain injury (intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia) in very preterm infants and improve neurodevelopmental outcome. We investigated whether administration of high-dose <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin to very preterm infants shortly after birth and subsequently during the first 2 days is safe in terms of short-term outcome. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-masked, single-center trial with a 2 : 1 allocation in favor of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin. Preterm infants (gestational age: 24 to 31 weeks) were given <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin or NaCl 0. 9 % intravenously 3, 12 to 18, and 36 to 42 hours after birth. RESULTS: The percentage of infants who survived without brain injury or retinopathy was 53 % in the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin group and 60 % in the placebo group.

For 5 infants who were in the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin group and had a gestational age of < 26 weeks, withdrawal of intensive care was decided (3 of 5 with severe bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage, 2 of 5 with pulmonary insufficiency); no infant of the control group died. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin treatment did not result in significant differences in blood pressure, cerebral oxygenation, hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet count. CONCLUSIONS: No significant adverse effects of early high-dose <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin treatment in very preterm infants were identified. These results enable us to embark on a large multicenter trial with the aim of determining whether early high-dose administration of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin to very preterm infants improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months' and 5 years' corrected age...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the therapeutical effect of pleural injection of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> endostain, cisplatin and <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> endostain combined with cisplatin to MPE nude mice. Methods MPE model was built by intrpleural injection of Lewis lung cancer cells (LCC) into BALB/c nude mice. Intrpleural injection of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> endostain (E), cisplatin (P) and <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> endostain combined with cisplatin (EP) was performed, MPE volume was measured, immunohistochemistry of CD 31 was carried out to calculate micro vessel density (MVD), angiogenesis and apoptosis gene expression was detected. Results MPE volume was reduced by intrapleiral injection of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> endostain and <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> endostain combined with cisplatin, MPE volume was positive correlated with MVD. Vescular epidermal growth factor-α (VEGF-α) expression reduced simultaneously with expression of hypoxia induced factor- 1 (HIF 1 -α) elevated at the same time. Conclusion MPE model could be made by intrapleural injection of LLC. Intrapleural injection of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> endostain could reduce MPE volume of nude mice. The potential molecular mechanism of the therapeutical effects of intapleural injection of recombiant endostatin might be related to the downregulation of VEGF-α expression and neovascularization...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{distress}} and progressive lung destruction in cystic fibrosis {{can be attributed}} to bacterial persistence and the accumulation of viscous purulent secretions in the airways. More than 30 yr ago it was suggested that the large amounts of DNA in purulent secretions contribute to its viscosity and that bovine pancreatic DNase I could reduce the viscosity. To evaluate the potential clinical utility of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> I (rhDNase) in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed rhDNase. Catalytic amounts of rhDNase greatly reduce the viscosity of purulent cystic fibrosis sputum, transforming it within minutes from a nonflowing viscous gel to a flowing liquid. The reduction in viscosity is associated with a decrease in size of DNA in the sputum. Inhalation of a rhDNase aerosol may be a simple direct approach that will help individuals with cystic fibrosis and other patients with pneumonia or bronchitis to clear their airways of purulent secretions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Non-cystic {{fibrosis}} bronchiectasis (nCFb) is {{an acquired}} condition of variable etiology. Medical treatment basically involves antibiotics and chest physiotherapy. An impaired mucociliary clearance {{seems to be}} one of the mechanisms behind nCFb, and inhaled therapy with mucoactive agents has frequently been used to try to correct it. The most often used mucoactive agents in this setting are N-acetylcysteine, hypertonic saline solution (HS), mannitol powder and <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> (rhDNase). Reviewing the international medical literature on the use of these drugs for patients with nCFb from 1992 to the present day, we retrieved 88 articles, only 12 of which met our selection criteria for this analysis. We found only 2 papers and 2 reviews on the use of rhDNase in children, and in adults 3 trials on HS, 5 on mannitol powder and 2 on rhDNase. In conclusion, no observational or randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been published on the use of these drugs in children with nCFb, while the few conducted on adult patients report some evidence of their effects. Further studies are needed on inhaled mucoactive drugs for the treatment of children with nCFb...|$|E
40|$|Extracellular DNA is an {{adhesive}} {{component of}} staphylococcal biofilms. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> I (rhDNase) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using a 96 -well microtiter plate crystal violet binding assay, we found that biofilm formation by S. aureus was efficiently inhibited by rhDNase at 1 – 4 μg l− 1, and pre-formed S. aureus biofilms were efficiently detached in 2 min by rhDNase at 1 mg l− 1. Pre-treatment of S. aureus biofilms for 10 min with 10 mg l− 1 rhDNase increased their sensitivity to biocide killing by 4 – 5 log units. rhDNase at 10 mg l− 1 significantly inhibited biofilm formation by S. epidermidis in medium supplemented with subminimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. We also also found rhDNase significantly increased the survival of S. aureus-infected C. elegans nematodes treated with tobramycin compared to nematodes treated with tobramycin alone. We concluded that rhDNase exhibits potent antibiofilm and antimicrobial-sensitizing activities against S. aureus and S. epidermidis at clinically achievable concentrations. rhDNase, either alone or in combination with antimicrobial agents, may have applications in treating or preventing staphylococcal biofilm-related infections...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Repairing tendon {{injuries}} with <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> platelet-derived growth factor-BB {{has potential}} for improving surgical outcomes. Augmentation of sutures, {{a critical component}} of surgical tendon repair, by coating with growth factors may provide a clinically useful therapeutic device for improving tendon repair. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to (a) coat Vicryl sutures with a defined dose of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> platelet-derived growth factor-BB without additional coating excipients (e. g. gelatin), (b) quantify the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> platelet-derived growth factor-BB released from the suture, and (c) use the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> platelet-derived growth factor-BB-coated sutures to enhance tendon repair in a rat Achilles tendon transection model. Methods: Vicryl sutures were coated with 0, 0. 3, 1. 0, and 10. 0 mg/mL concentrations of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> platelet-derived growth factor-BB using a dip-coating process. In vitro release was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Acutely transected rat Achilles tendons were repaired using one of the four suture groups (n = 12 per group). Four weeks following repair, the tensile biomechanical and histological (i. e. collagen organization and angiogenesis) properties were determined. Results: A dose-dependent bolus release of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> platelet-derived growth factor-BB occurred within the first hour in vitro, followed by a gradual release over 48 h. There was a significant increase in ultimate tensile strength (p < 0. 01) in the two highest <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> platelet-derived growth factor-BB dose groups (1. 9 ± 0. 5 and 2. 1 ± 0. 5 MPa) relative to controls (1. 0 ± 0. 2 MPa). The modulus significantly increased (p = 0. 031) with the highest <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> platelet-derived growth factor-BB dose group (7. 2 ± 3. 8 MPa) relative to all other groups (control: 3. 5 ± 0. 9 MPa). No significant differences were identified for the maximum load or stiffness. The histological collagen and angiogenesis scores were comparable in all groups, although there was a trend for improved collagen organization in the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> platelet-derived growth factor-BB-treated groups (p = 0. 054). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> platelet-derived growth factor-BB can be used to reproducibly coat Vicryl sutures and improve remodeling in a rat Achilles tendon transection model by significantly decreasing the resulting cross-sectional area, thus improving the material properties of the repaired tendon...|$|R

40|$|<b>Recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> (rhDNase) is an {{established}} treatment in cystic fibrosis (CF), {{but it may}} liberate cationic mediators bound to DNA in the airways. An alternative mucolytic therapy is hypertonic saline (HS); however, HS may potentiate neutrophilic inflammation. We compared the effect of rhDNase and HS on cationic proinflammatory mediators in CF sputum. In a randomized, crossover trial, 48 children with CF were allocated consecutively to 12 weeks of once-daily 2. 5 mg rhDNase, alternate-day 2. 5 mg rhDNase, and twice-daily 7 % HS. Sputum levels of total interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), free IL- 8, myeloperoxidase, eosinophil cationic protein, and neutrophil elastase (NE) activity were measured before and after each treatment. The change in mediator levels from baseline with daily rhDNase and HS was not significant; however, with alternate-day rhDNase, {{there was an increase}} in free IL- 8. When changes in mediator levels with daily rhDNase were compared with alternate-day rhDNase and HS, no significant differences were detected. Only changes in NE activity were associated with changes in lung function. In summary, we were unable to show that rhDNase or HS promote airway inflammation in CF...|$|E
30|$|In this study, we also {{measured}} cfDNA as a sepsis biomarker [25]. The {{release of}} cfDNA from neutrophils during sepsis {{has been identified}} as a protective mechanism to trap pathogens in so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [46]. However, NETs can also activate endothelial cells and induce collateral tissue damage in the lungs, heart, and liver [47, 48]. Studies investigating the effects of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> on the effects of NETs in murine models of sepsis have demonstrated benefits from delayed DNase treatment [49] and from DNase as an adjunctive treatment to antibiotics [48]. Another source of cfDNA in sepsis is mitochondrial DNA [50], which was found to contribute to acute kidney injury and cytokine production in polymicrobial sepsis models [51]. Our results demonstrate that the type of fluid used for resuscitation does not affect plasma cfDNA concentrations during early sepsis in mice. Furthermore, {{the presence or absence of}} albumin in these resuscitation fluids did not appear to modulate cfDNA concentrations during early sepsis. These findings suggest that the choice of resuscitation fluid is unlikely to affect production of NETs during early sepsis and that cfDNA may be a reasonable biomarker to confirm the induction of sepsis in mice undergoing CLP.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{elucidate}} cell free DNA (cfDNA) clearance kinetics {{following an}} acute bout of high intensity exercise by measuring circulating DNase activity reduction (AR). Design and methodsSerum cfDNA concentration and DNase-AR were measured {{prior to and}} post (immediately post, 7 and 30 min post) an acute bout of rowing exercise until exhaustion. ResultsSerum cfDNA concentration was significantly (P≤. 001) elevated immediately post (2. 5 -fold) and 7 min post exercise (2. 3 -fold) with a return close to baseline at 30 min post exercise (1. 5 -fold). The rise in cfDNA {{was accompanied by a}} concomitant, significant (P≤. 001) decrease in serum DNase-AR from 15. 1 % prior to exercise to 3. 1 % AR at cessation of the exercise test and 7 min post exercise (3. 9 % AR). DNase-AR returned close to baseline at 30 min post exercise (5. 2 % AR). ConclusionsA single bout of high intensity exercise is a potent stimulus for enhancing circulating DNase activity in healthy people. Acute exercise may therefore be considered as a non-pharmacological stimulus to trigger DNase activity. This finding may be relevant for pathological conditions associated with increased cfDNA concentrations like cystic fibrosis, where pharmacological <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>DNase</b> (rhDNase) treatment has been successfully used to improve patients' health and physical function...|$|E

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Anemia {{is common in}} {{patients}} with chronic heart failure, and is related to increased morbidity and mortality. The etiology of anemia in heart failure is complex and still not fully resolved. The review will describe current advances {{in the understanding of}} the pathophysiology of anemia and the potential therapeutic effects of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin. Recent findings Recent attempts to resolve the preponderant etiology of anemia in chronic heart failure have further defined its multifactorial nature. Impaired renal perfusion and function resulting in blunted erythropoietin production as well as impaired erythropoiesis in the bone marrow account for a vulnerable erythropoietic system. Moreover, fluid retention causes hemodilutional anemia. Correction of anemia with <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin seems feasible and is currently being evaluated in a phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin improves cardiac function in chronic heart failure through the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells and exerts cytoprotective effects during acute myocardial infarction. Although <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin shows great promise, we should not neglect other treatable causes of anemia. Summary Although the etiology of anemia in chronic heart failure is clearly multifactorial, correction of anemia with <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin seems promising. In addition to correction of anemia, <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> erythropoietin might exert important protective and regenerative effects on the myocardium...|$|R
