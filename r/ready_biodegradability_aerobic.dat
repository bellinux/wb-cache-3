In this study the "O 2 /CO 2 Headspace Test with GC-TCD" is used for the assessment of synthetic ester lubricants. The effects on biodegradability in water and soil of both additives and usage are examined and discussed. Ester based cutting fluids, gear fluids and hydraulic fluids with and without additives are used under defined conditions in machine tools and hydraulic and plain bearing test benches. The lubricants are characterised additionally with respect to kinematic viscosity, acidity and elemental composition. Furthermore, a formulated mineral oil is characterised before and after usage in the hydraulic test bench. Early results clearly show that the mineral oil is far less biodegradable than the ester oils and that their biodegradability is not affected by usage. The biodegradability of the ester oils mainly depends on the characteristics of the base fluids and is not affected by the additives. Antioxidants influence stability and biodegradability indirectly, since they prevent oxopolymerisation effects. Other effects of usage on biodegradation of lubricants are not detected.

The {{effect of the}} spacer structure and the head group polarity on the ecological properties {{of a series of}} dimeric dodecyl ammonium surfactants has been investigated. Standard tests for <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradability</b> assessment (OECD 310) were conducted for C 12 alkyl chain gemini surfactants containing oxygen, nitrogen or a benzene ring in the spacer linkage and/or a hydroxyethyl group attached to the nitrogen atom of the head groups. According to the results obtained, the gemini surfactants examined cannot be considered as readily biodegradable compounds. The negligible biotransformation of the gemini surfactants under the standard biodegradation test conditions was found to be due to their toxic effects on the microbial population responsible for aerobic biodegradation. Aquatic toxicity of gemini surfactants was evaluated against Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity values to Daphnia magna, IC 50 at 48 h exposure, ranged from 0. 6 to 1 mg/L. On the basis of these values, the gemini surfactants tested should be classified as toxic or very toxic to the aquatic environment. However, the dimeric quaternary ammonium-based surfactants examined result to be less toxic than their corresponding monomeric analogs. Nevertheless the aquatic toxicity of these gemini surfactants can be reduced by increasing the molecule hydrophilicity by adding a heteroatom to the spacer or a hydroxyethyl group to the polar head groups.

40|$|The fate {{of organic}} {{chemicals}} in the environment is determined by both abiotic and biological processes and microbial degradation of chemicals is a key parameter for their environmental risk assessment. The majority of chemicals have been tested for <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradability</b> in aqueous systems (e. g. OECD 301 / 310 test) for regulatory purposes, whereas only few data exist for other environmental systems such as soil. This lack of data is mainly due to the high cost {{and complexity of the}} necessary simulation tests. Thus, it would be advantageous to extrapolate the biodegradability potential of chemicals from aqueous medium to soil. Hence, we compared the fate of different environmentally relevant chemicals. The worldwide most applied herbicide, 2, 4 -D, and two environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ibuprofen and the antibiotic ciprofloxacin were analysed as model compounds for their turnover in water and soil systems. Isotope labelled compounds (13 C, 14 C) were incubated in mineral medium (OECD test 301) and in an agricultural soil (OECD test 307). The results revealed the processes responsible for compound biodegradation including biotic and abiotic processes. The carbon redistribution into mineralisation, biomass and non-extractable residues (NER) formation during degradation was traced, allowing to establish a quantitative relationship between the degradation in the two systems. Moreover, to elucidate the potential effects of these compounds on the environment, those compounds that proved to be toxic to activated sludge microbial communities, were also tested for their toxicity towards soil microorganisms. In the aqueous system, 85 % of the initially applied 14 C 6 - 2, 4 -D and 68 % of the 13 C 6 -ibuprofen were mineralised within 28 days, indicating <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradability.</b> In soil, only 57 % of 2, 4 -D and 45 % of ibuprofen were mineralised. Parent compounds and metabolites decreased to < 2 % of the spiked amounts. In soil, 37 % of the initially applied labelled 2, 4 -D and 30 % of ibuprofen were recovered as NER, mainly in the form of biomolecules, e. g. amino acids and phospholoipid fatty acids. In contrast, ciprofloxacin was recalcitrant to degradation and transformation in water systems. In soil, however, a low but significant mineralisation was observed. The lower bioavailability of antibiotics in soil seems to reduce the compound’s toxicity allowing its biodegradation. NER formation from ciprofloxacin was fast and independent of the microbial activity. Overall, the data suggest that NER formation from abiotic processes (e. g. sequestration of parent compounds) and from biogenic residues are competitive processes in soil. Whereas based on their <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradability</b> and the high contribution of biomass residues to NER formation, 2, 4 -D and ibuprofen obviously are not hazardous for the environment; the data clearly demonstrated that ciprofloxacin is persistent, and strongly inhibits the microbial activity in the environment, e. g. activated sludge and soil bacterial communities. Thus, this compound is a hazardous pollutant for the environment and the ecosystem, and consequently much more attention needs to be given to contamination of soil by antibiotics, which often has been neglected. In order to generate consistent data and provide a validated assessment of the environmental risk of a chemical, biodegradation tests in soil using compounds isotopically labelled in the most stable(s) position(s) of the molecule should be performed. In addition, the generally accepted concept of NER and the methodology for their determination need to be revised with respect to distinguishing the non-biogenic (potentially hazardous) and the biogenic (harmless) NER. Nevertheless, simulation tests cannot always be implemented. For these cases some general rules for extrapolating results from water-based <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradability</b> tests to the biodegradation in soil systems can be deduced from the results of this study: i) mineralisation is higher in water than in soil for readily biodegradedable and non-toxic compounds, ii) for compounds which are highly toxic towards microorganisms, the mineralisation and metabolisation is higher in soil systems because the reduced bioavailability in soil reduces their toxicity iii) lipophilic compounds tend to form NER and are less biodegraded in soil than in aqueous systems, iv) compound elimination with low mineralisation indicates formation of potentially hazardous NER, and v) high mineralisation accompanied by microbial biomass growth generally results in the formation of non-hazardous biogenic NER...|$|R

The study was performed with two poorly water-soluble chemicals—a solid, anthraquinone, and a liquid, isodecyl neopentanoate—and five BIMs were compared to the direct addition method (reference method), i. e., (i) ultrasonic dispersion, (ii) adsorption onto silica gel, (iii) dispersion using an emulsifier, (iv) dispersion with silicone oil, and (v) dispersion with emulsifier and silicone oil. A two-phase evaluation strategy of solid and liquid chemicals was developed involving the selection of the most relevant BIMs for enhancing the biodegradability of tested substances. A description is given of a BIM classification ratio (RBIM), which enables a comparison to be made between the different test chemical sample preparation methods used in the various tests. Thereby, using this comparison, the BIMs giving rise to the greatest biodegradability were ultrasonic dispersion and dispersion with silicone oil or with silicone oil and emulsifier for the tested solid chemical, adsorption onto silica gel, and ultrasonic dispersion for the liquid one...|$|R
40|$|Biodegradation tests {{according}} to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development standard 301 F (manometric respirometry test) with technical iminodisuccinate (IDS) revealed <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradability</b> for all stereoisomers of IDS. The IDS-degrading strain Agrobacterium tumefaciens BY 6 was isolated from activated sludge. The strain {{was able to}} grow on each IDS isomer {{as well as on}} Fe 2 +-, Mg 2 +-, and Ca 2 +-IDS complexes as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. In contrast, biodegradation of and growth on Mn 2 +-IDS were rather scant and very slow on Cu 2 +-IDS. Growth and turnover experiments with A. tumefaciens BY 6 indicated that the isomer R,S-IDS is the preferred substrate. The IDS-degrading enzyme system isolated from this organism consists of an IDS-epimerase and a C-N lyase. The C-N lyase is stereospecific for the cleavage of R,S-IDS, generating d-aspartic acid and fumaric acid. The decisive enzyme for S,S-IDS and R,R-IDS degradation is the epimerase. It transforms S,S-IDS and R,R-IDS into R,S-IDS. Both enzymes do not require any cofactors. The two enzymes were purified and characterized, and the N-termini were sequenced. The purified lyase and also the epimerase catalyzed the transformation of alkaline earth metal-IDS complexes, while heavy metal-IDS complexes were transformed rather slowly or not at all. The observed mechanism for the complete mineralization of all IDS isomers involving an epimerase offers an interesting possibility of funneling all stereoisomers into a catabolic pathway initiated by a stereoselective lyase...|$|R
40|$|For {{predicting}} the environmental {{fate of a}} chemical a knowledge of its biodegradability is essential. Several kinds of tests, standardized by the OECD and EEC for the determination of ultimate biodegradability (mineralization), are available. The degradation is determined by nonspecific analyses such as the measurement of DOC (e. g. modified OECD screening test), microbial oxygen uptake (modified MITI test; manometric respirometry test) or the microbial release of COsub 2 (modified Sturm test). For testing the biodegradability of two stroke engine oils a special test {{was developed by the}} CEC (Co-Ordination European Council) : the CEC L- 33 -T- 82. In this test the criterion for biodegradability is the elimination of the characteristic CHsub 3 CHsub 2 - groups as determined by IR-spectroscopy. Comparative studies with three synthetic lubricant base stocks revealed that significant differences may occur for this substance class. The degradation of the three substances was 100 percent in the CEC-te st, whereas in the manometric respirometry test degradation levels below 40 percent were obtained; in the modified Sturm test the degradation was between 44 and 85 percent. In the manometric respirometry test no substance fulfilled the criterion of <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradability,</b> whereas all three substances reached the pass level in the CEC- test. Results obtained in the CEC-test and in mineralization tests should be in good agreement when no significant formation of microbial biomass and no formation of hydrophilic metabolites takes place. Both parameter contribute to a high percentage of biodegradation in the CEC-test, but low apparent biodegradability in tests for ultimate biodegradability...|$|R
40|$|The {{biodegradability}} {{of several}} potential endocrine disrupting compounds, namely 4 -n-nonylphenol (4 -n-NP), nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP 1 EO), nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP 2 EO), bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan (TCS), di-(2 -ethylhexyl) -phthalate (DEHP), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) was evaluated in this study, using OECD method 301 F (manometric respirometry test) and activated sludge as inoculum. According to the results, 4 -n-NP and BPA meet the strict definition of <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradability</b> {{and they are}} not expected to be persistent during the activated sludge process. Partial biodegradation was observed for DEHP (58. 7 +/- 5. 7 %, n = 3). TCS (52. 1 +/- 8. 5 %, n = 3) and NP 1 EO (25. 9 +/- 8. 1 %, n = 3), indicating their possible biodegradation in wastewater treatment systems, while no biodegradation was observed for NP 2 EO, PFOA and PFNA. Experiments in the co-presence of a readily biodegradable compound showed the absence of co-metabolic phenomena during 4 -n-NP, BPA and TCS biodegradation. Using first order kinetics to describe biodegradation of the target compounds, half-lives of 4. 3 +/- 0. 6, 1. 3 +/- 0. 2, 1. 8 +/- 0. 5, 6. 9 +/- 2. 6 days were calculated for 4 -n-NP, BPA, TCS and DEHP, respectively. Toxicity tests using marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri showed that biodegradation of 4 -n-NP, NP 1 EO, BPA and TCS is a simultaneous detoxification process, while possible abiotic or biotic transformations of NP 2 EO, DEHP, PFOA and PFNA during respirometric test resulted to significant increase of their toxicities.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Tecnologias Ambientais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe wineries, annually, labor large {{quantities}} of grapes and have very high consumption of water, resulting in the generation of {{large quantities}} of wastewaters. The winemaking is a seasonal activity, for this reason generates, for a year, wastewaters with significant differences {{in terms of volume}} and composition, having different biodegradability. Initially, in this dissertation was studied the degradation of a wastewater, from the 2 nd racking, an aerobic system with different quantities of biomass, where it was obtained efficiencies of removal of COD of around 83 %, 78 % and 73 % for the biomass volumes of the 1, 25; 10 and 20 ml. Later, it was studied the degradation of a synthetic wastewater, in the same treatment system, with volumes of biomass of 10 and 20 ml, where it was found that 10 ml of biomass was the ideal quantity (based on the efficiency of removal of COD). The same aerobic system was applied, to the synthetic wastewater, to different temperatures (20, 25 e 30 ºC), noting that the temperatures of 25 ºC and 30 ºC had greater removal of COD (about 93 % and 89 %, respectively) and polyphenols (about 72 % and 70 %, respectively). For the temperatures studied, was determinate the kinetics of degradation (obtaining higher k to higher temperatures), where it was found that in higher temperatures is obtained more biodegradability. Determining the mathematical relation between the removal of COD and polyphenols, {{it was found that the}} temperatures of 25 and 30 ºC represent better this relation, with significant coefficients of determination for α= 0, 001.

30|$|For 21 {{biocidal}} products with complete dossiers {{available from the}} regulatory authorization process in the EU, confidential information on product composition and a base set of data were provided by the German Environment Agency. These data were complemented by retrieving information from the CAR for the a.s. prepared {{in the course of}} authorization in the EU, from the ECHA database ([URL] for those substances among the other components in the formulated products (i.e. the additives) that were registered under REACH, from producer’s safety data sheets (SDS) obtained through Internet search, and from the ECOTOX database ([URL] provided by the US EPA. In case of multiple data for the same end point or a toxicity estimate given as a concentration range, the lowest value was used. With regard to aquatic toxicity, median effect concentrations (EC 50) for invertebrates (Daphnia magna, 48  h EC 50 immobility), fish (various species, 96  h LC 50 mortality), and green algae (various species, 72  h EC 50 growth rate) were compiled. If data for the preferred end point were not available, other end points were taken as surrogate such as inhibition of yield in algae, effects in other algal species, immobilization of other crustacean species, EC 50 for longer or shorter exposure times, and no observed effect concentrations (NOEC). In addition, information on <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradability</b> as defined in guidelines OECD 301 and OECD 310 was compiled for the additives. No quality assessment of the compiled data and no literature search to extend these data available within regulatory processes were performed. Data were compiled for the additives in the base formulations, i.e. pigments were not considered.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the fate and toxicity of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), polyacrylamide and acrylamide monomer in soil under aerobic conditions for mixtures of commercially available products that have application as an anti traction material (ATM) (Southwest Research Institute patent pending for ATM). The <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of petroleum hydrocarbons in several formulations was determined using a simple microcosm/respirometric method based on carbon dioxide production and TPH depletion. The microcosms consisted of 1 L mason jars fitted with sealed rubber caps that allowed headspace gas samples to be collected in a sealed system. The analytical procedure included the detection of peaks for the compounds in TPH by gas chromatography and identification of peaks with a mass spectrometer (GCMS). Mole fractions of the major components in TPH (undecane, dodecane, tridecane and tetradecane) were calculated from the detected peaks. The extracted soil was analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) content in order to examine the carbon balance. The method described here provides a simple and inexpensive method for determining the <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of organics in soil. Results indicated that, for the polyacrylamide (PAM) treatments in soil, there was no significant CO 2 production in the headspace of the microcosm within the experimental time period. Total organic carbon values obtained for the initial and final soil showed no significant PAM biodegradation within a time period of 161 days. This confirms that PAM biodegradation is a slow process and may take several years...|$|R
30|$|Combining the {{available}} information described above, {{the following is}} qualitatively concluded: UV- 320, UV- 327, UV- 328 and UV- 350 are phenolic benzotriazoles of very similar chemical structure. The simulations of degradation pathways show a common pathway in the stepwise degradation of the side chain in ortho position to the hydroxyl group. Therefore, the findings for the individual substances can be generalized and used for a read-across assessment. The substances for which tests on <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradability</b> are available show little or no degradation at all. Hence, these substances are potentially persistent by fulfilling the screening criteria according to REACH, Annex XIII. This is confirmed by QSAR calculations (with UV- 350 being a borderline case). For UV- 327, UV- 328 and UV- 350, it was shown in a laboratory simulation study that the substances bind to soil and sediment and that the DT 50 values are longer than 100  days. The results of a simulation field study for UV- 327 and UV- 328 estimate the DT 50 values for the substances to be 151 – 218  days under favourable conditions. For a closely related substance (P), aerobic and anaerobic simulation studies are available. The degradability of this substance and its main metabolite M 1 {{can be used for}} a best case read-across meaning that UV- 320, UV- 327, UV- 328 and UV- 350 are expected to degrade at a lower rate and hence are assessed as being more persistent. Depending on the organic content of the system, the DT 50 values (encompassing dissipation and degradation) in sediment under aerobic conditions will be approximately 248  days for M 1 and under anaerobic conditions at least 238  days. Hence, M 1 has to be considered as very persistent in the environment. This in turn means that the four phenolic benzotriazoles should be as well. A case study on sediments from a highly contaminated area in the US supports these findings. In this case, UV- 327 and UV- 328 were found in considerable amounts in deeper layers of the anaerobic sediment up to 25  years after the industrial releases of the substances ceased. The concentrations found can only be explained if the DegT 50 of the substances is much longer than 180  days.|$|R
