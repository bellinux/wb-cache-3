With server capacity growing, so does the corresponding heat accumulation in data centers and server racks. There is little clear consensus of how heat as an environmental threat to server racks is mitigated. This study addresses how system administrators can address thermal threats to server racks through its own methodology and instrumentation; an approach based on heat mitigation standards and own experimentation. An own rack health indicator has been created. InteliRack facilitates its own calculation of a health metric for server <b>racks.</b> <b>Based</b> on principles of thermal segregation in terms server placement and temperature relationships in the rack. Various experimentation of technical and physical nature was implemented to manipulate server performance and analyze effects of realistic and unrealistic scenarios.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining the accidental forklift truck impact forces on steel storage <b>racks.</b> <b>Based</b> on first principles of mechanics, simple models of a loaded forklift truck and a drive-in racking structure are presented. Model masses, as well as stiffness and damping coefficients are calibrated against experimental results obtained from tests of a forklift truck and a drive-in racking structure. Comparisons between experimental results and solutions obtained from the simple mechanical models show that the simple models accurately reproduce the static and dynamic behaviours of their associated structures. Based on the drive-in rack impact test results presented in a companion paper (Gilbert and Rasmussen, submitted for publication) [1] and the simple mechanical models for drive-in racks, actual impact forces are calculated and presented. Finally, using the impact test results and the simple mechanical models, the actual motion of the forklift truck body is calculated. This motion, being a common characteristic to all drive-in racking impacts, allows impact forces to be obtained for various pallet loads, impact elevations and rack characteristics. Thus, the paper concludes with a general method for calculating forces generated under forklift truck impact. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining the stiffness and strength of steel storage <b>rack</b> <b>base</b> plate assemblies. Base plate assemblies are usually bolted to an upright and to a concrete floor, and {{they are used to}} provide resistance against the flexural buckling of the upright and/or the overall down-aisle buckling of the frame. The semi-rigid stiffness is usually determined by means of a test of two pre-loaded uprights connected to a concrete block in a dual-actuator set-up. Guidance for conducting the test is provided in the European Standard EN 15512. However, several aspects of the test need clarification, notably the test set-up and the transducer arrangement for measuring the rotations of the base plate. This paper provides recommendations for how best to conduct the test, and proposes an alternative test method to that given in the EN 15512 Specification. The paper also identifies the contributions to the deformations of base plate assemblies, including the deformations of the supporting floor, the base plate assembly itself and the upright, and proposes simple expressions for calculating the stiffness associated with each contributing deformation where applicable. Furthermore, the paper proposes a deformation criterion for determining the ultimate design moment for base plate tests which do not attain a peak moment.

In automated storage and retrieval systems this leads to revise the traditional control policies aimed at picking time minimisation and {{to pay more attention}} to rack configuration, which has been not a research concern from the time-based perspective. Proper models for energy calculation should be developed by introducing new factors neglected in time analysis, such as the weight of unit loads and the differentiation of shifts along the horizontal and vertical axis as regard energy requirements, due to different contribution of gravity, inertia and friction. In this study, a classification of <b>racks</b> <b>based</b> on system height is proposed in order to select the proper crane specifications needed to compute the torque to be overcome by motors to serve a given location within a rack. An overall optimisation model based on Constraint Programming hybridised with Large Neighborhood Search is developed, allowing the joint application of the best control policies for storage assignment and sequencing both for time and energy-based optimisation, as well as the introduction of multiple weight unit loads and energy recovery. Simulations analysis is performed in order to assess the impact of the rack shape on energy saving. Results show how, regardless the demand curve and the optimisation objective, the best performances in terms of energy efficiency are reached by the intermediate height rack shapes, while the lower ones outperform when considering travel time performance...|$|R

This study aims to determine and select the warehouse location with the companys management criteria and optimal design of warehouse layout, followed by designing the layout and the existing facilities at the warehouse in accordance with the principles of the warehouse layout design. The layout design refers to: (1) facility layout problem (FLP) which is divided into Static, Dynamic and Stochastic Layout Problem, (2) facility re-layout problem (FRLP), (3) systematic layout planning (SLP). Warehouse site selection uses value of consideration factors which are keys of success of the company. After the step of location selection is location determination of the warehouse uses calculation of both extrapolation request and the required number of racks, while warehouse layout design uses the activity relationship chart, activity relationship diagram, and area allocation diagram to determine the room positions and warehouse facilities in the area.

40|$|Information on {{the seismic}} {{response}} of chemical containers located in storage racks is very limited. Unfortunately, no clearly established data and statistics exist related to potential damage of chemical racking systems during earthquakes. Hence, this work presents an approach for developing fragility curves for chemical racking {{systems in the}} cross-aisle direction through dynamic non-linear analysis. It aims to simulate the structural behaviour of various racking systems in the cross-aisle direction for the worst-case scenario, in order to quantify the vulnerability of chemical racks in seismic areas and {{to better understand the}} associated natech risk. Analytical fragility curves and a fault tree model were derived and used to evaluate the probabilities of chemical containers falling from racks. The damage state limits were considered as four levels of intensity of loss of containment. Three damage modes (overturning, sliding, and buckling), two types of chemical containers (205 l metal drums and 1000 l IBCs), three types of <b>rack</b> <b>base</b> anchoring (unanchored, anchored-brittle, and anchored-plastic), and four rack heights (3, 4. 5, 6, 7. 5, 9 m) were considered in the analysis. Overall, twenty-four fragility curves were developed based on twenty-six strong motion records from the PEER Strong Motion database. However, the analytical method employed in this study can also be used for deriving fragility curves for other merchandise types of racking structures. In order to assess the natech risk of a chemical rack containing a flammable substance, to test the developed fragility curves, and to illustrate the natech risk assessment and mapping capabilities of RAPID-N, a case study based on the 1786 Olivieri earthquake scenario was conducted. The findings demonstrate that chemical racks loaded with IBCs are more vulnerable than those loaded with drums. Moreover, although a very robust anchorage reduces the probability of collapse of the rack, it increases the probability of chemical containers falling. JRC.

40|$|Abstract. The {{prevalence}} of cloud computing environments and the ever increasing reliance of large organisations on computational resources {{has meant that}} service providers must operate at unprecedented scales and levels of efficiency. Dynamic resource allocation (DRA) policies {{have been shown to}} allow service providers to improve resource utilisation and operational efficiency in presence of unpredictable demands, hence maximising profitability. However, practical considerations, such as power and space, have led service providers to adopt <b>rack</b> <b>based</b> approaches to application servicing. This co-location of computation resources, and the associated common provision of utilities it encourages, has immediate implications for system dependability. Specifically, in the presence of rack crash failures which can lead to all the servers within a rack becoming unavailable, resource allocation policies need to be cognisant of failures. In this paper, we address this issue and make the following specific contributions: (i) we present a modular architecture for failure-aware resource allocation, where a performance- oriented DRA policy is composed with a failure-aware resource allocator, (ii) we propose a metric, called Capacity Loss, to capture the exposure of an application to a rack failure, (iii) we develop an algorithm for reducing the proposed metric across all applications in a system operating under a DRA policy, and (iv) we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture on a large-scale DRA policy in context of rack failures, ultimately concluding that our approach reduces the number of failed requests as compared to a single random allocation. The main benefit of our approach is that we have developed a failure-aware resource allocation framework that can work in tandem with any DRA policy. ...|$|E
40|$|Planning multi-variant {{products}} in the early stage of the design process is still a challenge. In the present paper, a specification technique is introduced in order to define multi-variant products using degrees of freedom of shape attributes (in the following shape-DoFs) within the product structure. Our goal is to plan variety actively {{at the beginning of}} product development and not to describe variety by change of parameter values of the product's components as introduced in variant trees. Shape-DoFs are classified in the fields of shape attributes (dimension, position, shape as well as their combinations) {{on the one hand and}} mandatory or optional components on the other hand. Set up on this taxonomy graphical symbols are introduced to be used in product modeling. As application example, a welded pipe <b>rack</b> <b>based</b> upon the assembly structure modeling the product structure in this way is visualized in the first step. The second step is to translate the shape-DoFs into design parameters and identify relationships between them. The result is a parameter plan, as well as a configuration concept. Both can be seen as basis for CAD-modeling the product as design template which is the third step. In case of our example, Autodesk Inventor (without the ETO-Environment) is used to create the CAD-data. Discussing the effects of the proposed method, it will be shown that different shape-DoFs may cause various impacts in the whole product development process. Regarding these effects, scenarios can be performed in order to identify the cost and resource optimal variation possibilities of the product. In addition, it will be shown that different kinds of modularity according to PINE (e. g. cut-to-fit-modularity) can be predefined in the product model by using shape-DoFs...|$|E

40|$|In aviary {{systems for}} laying hens, it is {{important}} to provide suitable nest access platforms in front of the nests, allowing hens to reach and explore each of the nests easily. This access platform is needed to achieve good nest acceptance by the hens and thereby prevent mislaid eggs. In the present experiment, the behavior of hens using 2 different nest access platforms, a plastic grid and 2 wooden perches, was examined. Furthermore, the nests were placed {{on both sides of the}} aviary rack (corridor side and outdoor side), either integrated into the aviary rack itself (integrated nest; IN) or placed on the walls of the pens (wall nest; WN), resulting in a 2 × 2 factorial design Four thousand five hundred white laying hens were housed in 20 test pens. The eggs in the nests and mislaid eggs were collected daily, and the behavior of hens on the nest accesses was filmed during wk 25 and 26, using focal observation and scan sampling methods. More balancing, body contact, and agonistic interactions were expected for nests with perches, whereas more walking and nest inspections were expected for nests with grids. There were more mislaid eggs and balancing found in pens equipped with nests with wooden perches. More agonistic interactions and balancing, less standing, and a longer duration of nest inspection were found with the WN compared with the IN. Interactions between platform design and position of the nests were found for duration of nest visits, body contact, and walking, with the highest amount for WN equipped with plastic grids. Nests on the corridor side were favored by the hens. Nest-related behaviors, such as nest inspection, standing, and walking, decreased over time as did the number of hens on the nest accesses, whereas sitting increased. These results indicate that the hens had more difficulties in gripping the perches as designed. The lower number of hens on the nest access platforms in front of IN may be due to a better distribution around nests and tier changes within the aviary <b>rack.</b> <b>Based</b> on these results, grids rather than perches provide for improved nesting behavior...|$|E

When the need for bicycle parking is not met several problems arise such as an increase in bicycle thefts, jammed sidewalks and a decreased interest in using bicycles. My aim with this paper has been to answer {{the question of how to}} create parking facilities in an urban environment based on cyclists' needs. Through a literature survey, following the method "Trattmodellen" (the funnel model) the question has been answered and divided under the headings cyclist, bike, bicycle racks, bicycle garage and bicycle operators and hosts. Cyclists want to park in a secure bike rack near their destination point, a distance of 25 meters is optimal. Front wheel holding racks are easy to park in but provide little security. A frame holding bike rack affords greater security but at the cost of intuitiveness. There are also racks that combine front wheel and frame holding. All racks can be combined with canopies for protection from precipitation, this raises the rack's status significantly. Bicycle Hosts can, by clearing away scrap bicycles in bicycle racks and making the streets tidy, also contribute to a higher status. At stations and nodes a bicycle garage can be needed. In addition to indoor parking, a garage can also provide services such as showers, a repair shop and a café. The main conclusion of this work is that there is a relationship between the duration for which the bike is parked, the distance the cyclist is willing to walk from the parking area to the target point and the requirement for secure bicycle <b>racks.</b> <b>Based</b> on this connection bicycle parking can be planned with various types of bicycle racks at various distances so that all cyclist's needs are met. Solving the bicycle parking issue will lead to an increase in bicycle traffic. However, to drastically increase bicycle traffic on the expense of car traffic more is required.
