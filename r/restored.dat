50|$|For data {{integrity}} purposes, System <b>Restore</b> {{does not allow}} other applications or users to modify or delete files in the directory where the <b>restore</b> points are saved. On NTFS volumes, the <b>Restore</b> Points are protected using ACLs. Since its method of backup is fairly simplistic, it may end up archiving malware such as viruses, for example in a <b>restore</b> point created before using antivirus software to clean an infection. Antivirus software is usually unable to remove infected files from System Restore; the only way actually to delete the infected files is to disable System <b>Restore,</b> which will result in losing all saved <b>restore</b> points; otherwise they will remain until Windows deletes the affected <b>restore</b> points. However stored infected files in themselves are harmless unless executed; they will only pose a threat if the affected <b>restore</b> point is reinstated. Windows System <b>Restore</b> is not compatible with <b>restore</b> points made by third party applications.|$|R
50|$|<b>Restoring</b> force, in {{a physics}} context, {{is a force}} that gives rise to an {{equilibrium}} in a physical system. If the system is perturbed away from the equilibrium, the <b>restoring</b> force will tend to bring the system back toward equilibrium. The <b>restoring</b> force is a function only of position of the mass or particle. It is always directed back toward the equilibrium position of the system. The <b>restoring</b> force {{is often referred to}} in simple harmonic motion. The force which is responsible to <b>restore</b> original size and shape is called <b>restoring</b> force.|$|R

50|$|System <b>Restore</b> also {{suffered}} from a bug in the date-stamping functionality that could cause System <b>Restore</b> to date-stamp snapshots that were taken after 8 September 2001 incorrectly. This could prevent System <b>Restore</b> from locating these snapshots and cause the system <b>restore</b> process to fail. Microsoft released an update to fix this problem.|$|R
40|$|A common way for {{virtual machine}} cluster (VMC) to {{tolerate}} failures {{is to create}} distributed snapshot and then <b>restore</b> from the snapshot upon failure. However, restor-ing the whole VMC suffers from long <b>restore</b> latency due to large size snapshot files. Besides, different latencies would make the virtual machines not start at the same time. The prior started virtual machine (VM) thus cannot communicate with the VM that is still <b>restoring,</b> leading to the TCP backoff problem. In this paper, we present a novel <b>restore</b> approach called HotRestore, which <b>restores</b> the VMC rapidly with-out compromising performance. Firstly, HotRestore re-stores the single VM through an elastic working set which prefetches the working set in a scalable win-dow size, thereby reducing the <b>restore</b> latency. Sec-ond, HotRestore constructs the communication-induced <b>restore</b> dependency graph, and schedules the <b>restore</b> line to mitigate the TCP backoff problem. Lastly, a <b>restore</b> protocol is proposed to minimize the backoff duration. Additionally, a prototype has been implemented on QE-MU/KVM. The experimental results demonstrate that HotRestore can <b>restore</b> the VMC within a few second-s whilst reducing the TCP backoff duration to merely dozens of milliseconds. ...|$|R
