40|$|Abstract: Biological {{treatment}} of {{heavy crude oil}} production wastewater is well-established method for remediation of these wastes.

Fixed-film bioreactors with 15 h hydraulic retention times have decreased chemical oxygen demand by 74. 8 %, total suspended solids by 90. 9 %, oil by 80. 6 %, and phenols and sulfides by 100 %.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of clamped circular monolithic and sandwich plates of equal areal mass and thickness has been measured by loading the plates at mid-span with metal foam projectiles. The sandwich plates comprise AISI {{304 stainless steel}} face sheets and either AL- 6 XN stainless steel pyramidal core or AISI 304 stainless steel square-honeycomb lattice core. The <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shock</b> loading is quantified by the permanent transverse deflection at mid-span of the plates {{as a function of}} projectile momentum. It is found that the sandwich plates have a higher shock resistance than monolithic plates of equal mass, and the square-honeycomb sandwich plates outperform the pyramidal core plates. Three-dimensional finite element simulations of the experiments are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. The finite element calculations indicate that the ratio of loading time to structural response time is approximately 0. 5. Consequently, the tests do not lie in the impulsive regime, and projectile momentum alone is insufficient to quantify the level of loading. 2005 Published by Elsevier SAS...|$|E
