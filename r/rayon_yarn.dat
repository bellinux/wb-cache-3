The advantages are that there would only be one parameter to tune and {{no need for a}} dynamic model. A stability analysis is proposed from a simple phenomenological artificial muscle model. Step and sinus-wave tracking responses performed with pneumatic McKibben muscles are reported showing the practical efficiency of the method to combine accuracy and load robustness. In the particular case of the McKibben artificial muscle technology, we suggest that the dynamic performances in stability and load robustness would result from the textile nature of its braided sleeve and its internal friction which do not obey Coulomb’s third law, as verified by preliminary reported original friction experiments. Comparisons are reported between three kinds of braided sleeves made of <b>rayon</b> <b>yarns,</b> plastic, and thin metal wires, whose similar closed-loop dynamic performances are highlighted. It is also experimentally shown that a sleeve braided with thin metal wires can give high accuracy performance, in step as in tracking response.

Using a handheld 4100 ExoScan FTIR spectrometer with a diffuse reflectance sample interface, in-situ non-invasive micro-analysis {{was successful in}} three fibre residue and fibre degradation studies: 1. Evaluating the non-ionic detergent Dehypon LS 54 for wet cleaning. Dehypon LS 54 is a new commercial detergent available for textile conservation. DRIFTS {{was used to assess}} its removal from fibres in the cleaning process. Detergent traces in washed but unrinsed fabrics showed characteristic spectral peaks. ATR FTIR could not detect any detergent. 2. Identification of oils characterising historical Turkey red (TR) calico dyeing. DRIFTS revealed traces of oils on calico fabric for historical TR manufactured in mid- 19 th century. Distinctive spectral absorbances for oil bonded to fibres were detected in known TR textiles. These were absent in un-oiled calico and textiles that looked like TR but not made by the process. Thus DRIFTS offers a quick, non-invasive analytical screening tool to identify historical TR textiles. 3. Degradation assessment for historical viscose rayon fibres. Viscose rayon is weak when wet - an issue for textile conservation. Its strength reflects excess hydroxyl groups, amorphous polymeric structure, and low degree of polymerisation, and is affected by manufacturing methods and ageing.

Thus, to overcome the problem, natural colourant is introduced as a substitute to synthetic colourant. Peel of Hylocereus polyrhizus or red-purple fleshed dragon fruits could be an attractive and potential source of red colourant for textile industry as the peel possess high content of betacyanin. Despite the potential, as a natural colourant, betacyanin cannot adheres well with certain types of fabric. This study provides determination of suitable yarns to be dyed with dragon fruit peel. Betacyanin was extracted from dragon fruit peel by simple water extraction at 100 °C and adsorption process was carried out by soaking polyester cotton, rayon, and <b>rayon</b> coolmax <b>yarns</b> into stock solution for optimum time at 90 minutes.

Freundlich model gave the best result for the adsorption isotherm. The applicability of Freundlich isotherm model showed the heterogeneous adsorption surface with sites have different energies of adsorption as the Freundlich model assumes.

40|$|Biobased thermoplastics, such as poly(lactic acid), have {{attracted}} much attention {{in recent years as}} an alternative to oil-based plastics both in academia and industry. Based on renewable raw materials these polymers offer advantages in terms of decreased dependence on fossil resources and reduced CO 2 footprint in accord with sustainability ideas and climate protection. In order to improve the properties of these materials, reinforcement with biobased fibers represents a promising option. An alternative route to glass and natural fiber reinforcement was taken and intensively investigated. The novel approach is based on the use of cellulose man-made fibers, in particular <b>rayon</b> tire cord <b>yarn,</b> as a biogenic reinforcing component. It was demonstrated that short fiber rayon reinforcement leads to dramatic improvements in the mechanical properties of various biobased and partially biobased matrix materials. While stiffness is easily enhanced also with natural fibers, the use of rayon results in considerable improvements in strength and impact properties in contrast to natural fiber reinforcement. For example, an enhancement of more than 500 % was observed in notched Charpy impact strength of poly(lactic acid). In the present contribution results concerning composite mechanical properties will be presented for various biobased matrix materials with special emphasis {{on the role of the}} fiber-matrix interphase. By reactive extrusion this interphase can be tailored from being weak (anti-coupling), intermediate (no modification) or strong (covalent coupling). Implications for the composite properties as a function of matrix stiffness will be discussed. Other factors influencing the composite properties such as fiber length and fiber diameter will be considered as well.

40|$|The present chapter {{considers}} {{the possibilities of}} reinforcing thermoplastic matrix materials with cellulose man-made fibers, in particular high performance <b>rayon</b> tire cord <b>yarn.</b> Mechanical properties of the composites such as tensile strength, stiffness, and impact properties are in the focus of interest. Composite and fracture surface morphology is accessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{and the quality of}} fiber–matrix adhesion is revealed. Advantages and disadvantages of using coupling agents are discussed. Thermoplastics both from fossil and from renewable resources are used as matrix materials. From the first group, polypropylene is the most important example and is considered in detail while polyethylene, polybutene- 1, impact modified polystyrene, ABS are briefly sketched. On the bio-based side, the emphasis is on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) as the most easily commercially accessible inexpensive bioplastic. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are also considered but in less detail. Composites are manufactured by a specially developed melt compounding method on twin screw extruders and shaped by injection molding. In general, rayon reinforcement proves to be superior to natural fiber reinforcement, in particular in terms of impact strength. For PP–rayon the properties are even comparable to those of short glass fiber reinforced polypropylene (GFPP) and PC/ABS with advantages in terms of impact strength compared to GFPP. With 30 % rayon in PP, tensile strength is tripled, modulus is doubled, and notched impact strength is doubled at room temperature and quadrupled at - 18 °C. For the bio-based thermoplastics, rayon is an ideal reinforcement since the bio-based character is preserved. Strength and modulus always increase, and at the same time, impact strength is increased dramatically for brittle products such as PLA. This is true in particular for a specially designed fiber–matrix interphase using a decoupling agent...|$|R

40|$|Rayon was and {{continues}} to be an important fiber to the textile and fashion industry. Prior to rayon 2 ̆ 7 s invention, only natural fibers such as cotton, silk, flax, and wool were available for clothing and home furnishings. Rayon, invented in 1846, began to be manufactured in the United States in 1911. Called artificial silk until 1924 when the name rayon was coined, rayon was a less expensive alternative to silk clothing and accessories. This paper focused on the time period of 1910 - 1924. The start date 1910 was selected because rayon production in the United States started in 1911. The year 1924 was chosen as a stop date for this project because acetate was invented in 1924 making rayon no longer the only manufactured fiber. This topic was important to study because little to no research had been done to address how rayon was introduced to consumers and to assess its impact on the fashion world. Seven research questions guided the research. These questions were: What was the early history of rayon production and introduction to the public? What names did manufacturers use when selling rayon? What type of products featured rayon? How were the above products promoted to the public? What were the stated advantages of rayon during this time period? What were the stated disadvantages of rayon during this time period? Why was rayon perceived as inferior to silk? This study utilized a grounded theory and content analysis to analyze data collected from the retailers 2 ̆ 7 newspaper Women 2 ̆ 7 s Wear, the woman 2 ̆ 7 s fashion magazine Harper 2 ̆ 7 s Bazar, and the woman 2 ̆ 7 s home magazine Good Housekeeping. Manufacturers and the industry used a variety of names to describe rayon which seemingly caused confusion for the consumer. The terms artificial silk, art silk, fiber (fibre) silk, fiber (fibre), chemical silk, manufactured silk, scientific silk, rayonner, and rayon silk were all used to describe one type of fabric. The majority of products made of rayon were hosiery; along with sweaters, draperies and curtains, embroidery and trim, bed spreads, dresses, scarves, blouses, women 2 ̆ 7 s suits, hats, and socks. During the time period of 1910 - 1924, many advantages and disadvantages were apparent. The major advantage of rayon was its luster; the second major advantage was cost. Rayon was lower in cost than silk. Other advantages of rayon included its ability to cover and it wore well as dress trimmings and embroidery. In spite of these advantages, there were many disadvantages. Rayon was susceptible to heat and moisture, only one-eighth as strong as silk, and weaker when wet. Women who purchased rayon {{did not know how to}} properly care for the fiber. Rayon fibers were coarser than silk which produced a coarser weave, had poor elasticity, poor abrasion resistance, poor dye affinity, and lacked the necessary qualities to produce a twistable <b>yarn.</b> <b>Rayon</b> was seen as inferior to silk for four main reasons. First, was the industry 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of the fiber rayon. Terms such as 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 true 2 ̆ 2 silk made consumers think that silk was the optimal choice, but that they might have to settle for rayon, the imposter. Cost perceptions was the second major reason rayon that was seen as inferior. The majority of rayon products were priced less expensively than silk products. For many consumers, cheaper prices equaled lower quality. Third was confusion about the terminology used. A variety of terms were used to describe rayon: artificial silk, art silk, fiber (fibre) silk, fiber (fibre), chemical silk, scientific silk, rayonner, wood silk, and rayon silk. With this list of terms, consumers would not necessarily know what specific product they purchased or the correct fiber content. The fourth, and final reason, was poor information provided about rayon to the consumer...|$|R

However, the blooming population has created scarcity of the available agricultural land in this region. Thus, it becomes indeed difficult to satisfy increased demand of cotton. This has geared up the research direction in finding its option from manmade fibers. Replacement option must not be thought off {{only in terms of}} quantity but also quality. Synthetic origin based materials (Nylon Polyester etc.) although undergone modifications via various processes (texturising/short staple spinning) are not able to offer comfort similar to natural cellulosic cotton. This has directed researchers to develop man made yarn obtained from viscose solution of natural regenerated cellulose. Thereby, it was nomenclatured as regenerated cellulose initially and later on as viscose rayon. Fabric obtained out of this yarn has exhibited good simulation with natural cotton fiber fabric, especially in comfort associated characteristics. However, viscose <b>rayon</b> <b>yarn</b> lags behind from cotton in service properties and technical properties.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} such as load-deflection {{relationship and}} {{modulus of rigidity}} on the twisting of yarn in stationary state have been studied by many researchers. But on the twisting of yarn in rnnning state there are few fundamental studies, experimental or theoretical, except Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory. Tobisch derived his theory {{on the assumption that}} the number of twists of yarn per unit length, or twist density, was uniform everywhere in the twisting field, but this is true only when the delivery velocity is very small or the internal friction of yarn is negligible. The author has made theoretical and experimental studies on the twisting of yarn in running state, considering it as a visco-elastic body made of homogeneous and uniform materials. The studies may be briefly summerized in the following outline. 　(1) A yarn of total length L is fixed at both ends. This yarn is divided into two parts, the length l of it being twisted and the other length L-l free from twisting. If a point fixed between these two parts is suddenly released, twisting will be transmitted to the untwisted part. The theory of this transient transmission of twisting has been treated by solving the following partial differential equation :　p(∂^ 2 θ/∂t^ 2) = G(∂^ 2 θ/∂x^ 2) + η(∂^ 3 θ/∂t∂x^ 2) 　where p = the density of yarn　θ = angle of torsion at x along the yarn　t = time G = modulus of rigidity of yarn. 　η = tangential coefficient of viscosity at the cross section of yarn. 　In the case under consideration, let the angles of torsion along the yarn and at the end of the lenght l be Θ and θ_ 0 respectively. Then the following relation holds : θ=Θ-θ_(0 x) /L. The solution of the above differential equation by the use of this relation and initial and boundary conditions in this case has shown that the twist density of yarn transmitted to the untwisted part is exponentially increased with time and approaches to θ_ 0 /L. 　(2) A high speed camera by which 64 pictures could be taken per second was used in order to confirm the above theory. The results measured coincided satisfactorily with the theory. 　(3) When the yarn was fixed at one end and free at the other and the twisting moment was applied at the free end, the above differential equation was solved under the initial and boundary conditions in this case. The twist density of yarn in this transient case also approaches exponentially to θ_ 0 /L with time. 　(4) In the running yarn, the following transformation of coordinates was used : x=ξ+vt, where v is the velocity of the running yarn, x is a fixed coordinate in yarn and ξ is in space. By solving this transformed equation, it has been shown that the twist density of running yarn with only internal friction is in steady state exponentially decreased from the twisting element, say the aperture of flyer, to the nip point of delivery roller. 　(5) Also by the solution of the above transformed equation, Ball 2 ̆ 7 s distribution diagram of twist in the twisting fields of the ring frame and mule has proved to be the distributed one in a case when the yarn is considered as a visco-elastic body with solid friction. 　(6) In the yarn with plasticity, the twisting field is divied into two Zones : an elastic zone ξ= 0 -ξ_ 1. and a plastic zone ξ=ξ_ 1 -L. The equations of twist density in elastic and plastic zones have been derived under considerations of the boundary conditions. An experiment of twisting <b>rayon</b> <b>yarn</b> with the flyer frame showed that these twe zones occurred and could be explained by substituting appropriate numerical values into the above derived equations. 　(7) When the internal friction of yarn is negligible or the delivery velocity of yarn is very small, Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory is applicable. So, in such a state, the double twisting principle of tyre cord has been analyzed by this theory. 　(8) The re-distribution of twists in the twisting field by the invasion of twisted yarn into the untwisted field or by its regression from the twisting field with the introduction of untwisted yarn is occasionally important in spinning operation, especially in false twisting of worsted spinning and rotating funnel of high draft system in cotton spinning. The state of this re-distribution was experimentally studied by photographing the twisting operation in one twisting field, and the results measured could be qualitatively explained by the above described theorics. 　(9) The permanent deformations of twisted yarn set by steam or initially applied tension were studied by measuring the free rotating angle about the axis of the yarn loaded axially. According to these experiments, the permanent sets are 0 - 28...|$|E
