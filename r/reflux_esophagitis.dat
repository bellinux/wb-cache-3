2500|$|The {{main cause}} of Barrett's {{esophagus}} {{is thought to be}} an adaptation to chronic acid exposure from <b>reflux</b> <b>esophagitis.</b> [...] The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased substantially in the Western world in recent years. The condition is found in 5–15% of patients who seek medical care for heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease), although a large subgroup of patients with Barrett's esophagus do not have symptoms. Diagnosis requires endoscopy (more specifically, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a procedure in which a fibreoptic cable is inserted through the mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) and biopsy. The cells of Barrett's esophagus, after biopsy, are classified into four general categories: nondysplastic, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and frank carcinoma. [...] High-grade dysplasia and early stages of adenocarcinoma can be treated by endoscopic resection and new endoscopic therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, whereas advanced stages (submucosal) are generally advised to undergo surgical treatment.

We evaluated prospectively the presence of occult acid <b>reflux</b> disease, <b>esophagitis</b> and the accuracy of pH monitoring in the prediction of esophagitis in a population of distressed infants. A 24 -hour esophageal pH monitoring with an antimony electrode and an upper gastro-intestinal tract endoscopy with grasp biopsies were performed on 60 distressed infants, aged 1 to 6 months, after failure of a cow's milk elimination diet. A 24 -hour esophageal pH monitoring was considered abnormal (> 5 % of investigation time with a pH 5 % in 10 (38 %). Histology of the esophagus was normal in 10 (50 %) children with an abnormal pH monitoring. The mean reflux index was similar in the group with (4. 66 %) and without esophagitis (5. 00) (p=NS). The sensitivity and specificity to predict <b>esophagitis</b> with a <b>reflux</b> index of 5. 0 % or more was 38. 5 and 70. 6, respectively. There was not a reflux index that could be related to a clinical useful sensitivity and specificity to predict <b>esophagitis.</b> Acid gastro-esophageal <b>reflux</b> disease (GER) and/or histological esophagitis were diagnosed in 33 % and 43 % of distressed infants, respectively.

There is a positive correlation between postprandial fundus relaxation and number of TLESRs and also between proximal gastric emptying and esophageal acid exposure. However, new studies suggest that a high number of TLESRs and reflux events may occur even with accelerated gastric emptying, and prolonged gastric retention might be associated with less rather than more esophageal acid exposure.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux and {{progressive}} esophageal dilatation can develop after gastric banding (GB). HYPOTHESIS: Gastric banding {{may interfere with}} esophageal motility, enhance reflux, or promote esophageal dilatation. DESIGN: Before-after trial in patients undergoing GB. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1999 and August 2002, 43 patients undergoing laparoscopic GB for morbid obesity underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, 24 -hour pH monitoring, and stationary esophageal manometry before GB and between 6 and 18 months postoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Reflux</b> symptoms, endoscopic <b>esophagitis,</b> pressures measured at manometry, esophageal acid exposure. RESULTS: There {{was no difference in}} the prevalence of <b>reflux</b> symptoms or <b>esophagitis</b> before and after GB. The lower esophageal sphincter was unaffected by surgery, but contractions in the lower esophagus weakened after GB, in correlation with preoperative values. There was a trend toward more postoperative nonspecific motility disorders. Esophageal acid exposure tended to decrease after GB, with fewer reflux episodes. A few patients developed massive postoperative reflux. There was no clear correlation between preoperative testing and postoperative esophageal acid exposure, although patients with abnormal preoperative acid exposure tended to maintain high values after GB. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative esophageal dysmotility and gastroesophageal reflux are not uncommon after GB. Preoperative testing should be done routinely. Low amplitude of contraction in the lower esophagus and increased esophageal acid exposure should be regarded as contraindications to GB. Patients with such findings should be offered an alternative procedure, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass...|$|R

50|$|An {{increase}} in eosinophils, i.e., {{the presence of}} more than 500 eosinophils/microlitre of blood is called an eosinophilia, and is typically seen in people with a parasitic infestation of the intestines; autoimmune and collagen vascular disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis) and Systemic lupus erythematosus; malignant diseases such as eosinophilic leukemia, clonal hypereosinophilia, and Hodgkin's disease; lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia; extensive skin diseases (such as exfoliative dermatitis); Addison's disease and other causes of low corticosteroid production (corticosteroids suppress blood eosinophil levels); <b>reflux</b> <b>esophagitis</b> (in which eosinophils will {{be found in the}} squamous epithelium of the esophagus) and eosinophilic esophagitis; and with the use of certain drugs such as penicillin. But, perhaps the most common cause for eosinophilia is an allergic condition such as asthma.

The unpleasant postoperative sequela which we have termed the "gas-bloat syndrome" was noted in 1971 to be present in the early postoperative period in approximately one-half the patients. Late follow-up, however, averaging four years indicates a marked reduction in this disorder with either absence or clinical insignificance in 87 % of patients. Nonetheless, moderate symptoms persist in 11 % and severe symptoms requiring active treatment in 2 %. Manometric study of the lower esophageal sphincter indicates nearly a three-fold increase in resting pressure following Nissen fundoplication (p less than. 001).

40|$|Recent {{progress}} {{in the area of}} ulcer and gastritis is still dominated by findings and reports on Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which in turn are the two major causes of peptic ulcers. Although the prevalence of H. pylori is declining in most developed countries, it is still contributing to a significant proportion of peptic ulcers globally. The interrelationship of H. pylori gastritis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux has become more apparent. H. pylori-induced gastric body gastritis is associated with reduced acid production, and thus with reduced <b>reflux</b> and <b>esophagitis.</b> The controversies regarding the interactions between H. pylori and NSAIDs have still not been settled. With the availability of the new COX- 2 -specific inhibitors, the current scenario of NSAID-related gastroduodenal complications will certainly change.

40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is {{a normal}} {{physiologic}} process, consisting in the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus. It occurs several times per day in healthy infants, children, and adults. In contrast, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is present when the reflux of gastric contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. Distinguishing GER from GERD may often be tricky. The diagnosis of GERD has to be inferred by performing tests showing excessive frequency or duration of <b>reflux</b> events, <b>esophagitis,</b> or a clear association of symptoms and signs with reflux events {{in the absence of}} alternative diagnoses. Only in older children and adolescents with typical reflux symtoms, a time-limited trial of acid suppressive treatment may be useful as diagnostic test.

5000|$|Based {{on their}} {{surgical}} observations, Windsor and Collis in 1967 proposed that blood loss {{was due to}} local trauma to the stomach where it rides to and fro in the hiatus on respiration.

Cameron and Higgins in 1986 described linear gastric erosions, later called [...] "Cameron lesions", in people with x-rays showing one-third or more of the stomach above the diaphragm. (figure 1). Over 6 years, Cameron and Higgins studied 109 persons with large hiatal hernias, 55 with anemia and 54 without anemia, at esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Cameron lesions, often multiple, were found at or near the level where the herniated stomach was constricted by the diaphragm. The lesions were typically white, superficial, linear, and oriented along the crests of inflamed appearing mucosal folds (figure 2). Small amounts of blood were often seen on the lesions (Fig 3). Mucosal folds at the diaphragm level were often seen rubbing against each other on respiration (Fig 4). It was proposed that the lesions were caused by mechanical trauma at the level of constriction by the diaphragm [...] Cameron lesions were found in 42% of persons with anemia compared to 24% in those without anemia, a statistically significant difference, p<0.05. Spots of fresh or clotted blood were seen on the lesions in 25% of persons with anemia compared to 7% without anemia, also a significant difference, p<0.05. In the 109 persons in this study, 15 had <b>reflux</b> <b>esophagitis,</b> 11 had peptic ulcers, and 7 had Barrett's esophagus, but none of these findings correlated with anemia. Thus, in people with large hernias, Cameron lesions with evidence of slow bleeding were associated with iron deficiency anemia.|$|E

The paper stated that these three children had undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with intravenous secretin administration, and that, subsequently, the children's gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms had both improved significantly. As {{a result of this}} research, the University of Maryland (where Horvath was working at the time) filed a patent application for the use of secretin to treat autism, but ended up giving the rights to the patent to Beck, since she was the first to suspect that secretin might be an effective autism treatment. In 1999, Horvath {{published a}}nother study of 36 children, which concluded that [...] "Unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially <b>reflux</b> <b>esophagitis</b> and disaccharide malabsorption, may contribute to the behavioral problems of the non-verbal autistic patients." [...] In an accompanying editorial, Pasquale Accardo and Howard Bostwick of New York Medical College wrote that Horvath's study [...] "demonstrates consistent physiologic abnormalities (increased density of Paneth’s cells along with diminished pancreatic secretin secretion) in autism that are not known to occur in any other specific gastrointestinal disorder." [...] That same year, researchers from the University of North Carolina, led by Adrian Sandler, published a randomized trial in which they reported that secretin was no more effective as an autism treatment than a placebo. Horvath replied, {{in a letter to the}} editor, that [...] "It is unusual for a single dose of a drug to result in full recovery from a chronic disease," [...] and also criticized the study for not including children with gastrointestinal symptoms. Horvath also argued that tests used to measure behavioral improvements may be unreliable when used in these trials, because [...] "These tests were designed to diagnose autism, not to assess drug-induced changes." [...] However, a study by researchers from the University of Chicago also concluded that secretin was not an effective autism treatment, and a total of 15 studies, performed after Sandler's study, arrived at the same conclusion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To review current {{understanding}} and approach to diseases resulting from gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in infants and children. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Very few randomized or blinded controlled trials {{have been reported}} in this area. MEDLINE searches for gastroesophageal reflux, gastroesophageal <b>reflux</b> disease, <b>esophagitis,</b> and pulmonary aspiration, using age-limited (all childhood) data, find most articles. Very thorough reviews undertaken by both European and North American societies for pediatric gastroenterology provide up-to-date consensus statements. MAIN MESSAGE: Gastroesophageal reflux is a normal phenomenon recognized in infants as "spitting up. " Understanding the mechanism of transient lower esophageal relaxation episodes allows physicians to counsel concerned parents that reflux and spitting up occur universally, but are less visible in children older than 6 to 12 months. In infants and children, GER can result in a variety of diseases and can cause esophageal and tracheopulmonary damage. Investigation of these diseases can be specific and accurate. Therapy is available, but no drug will stop reflux. Some children suffer intractable GER with secondary complications (GERD) despite medical treatment.

Patients with a PPI prescription for the treatment ofulcers, gastroesophageal <b>reflux</b> disease, <b>esophagitis</b> or epigastralgiawere excluded as well as patients hospitalized twice during the studyperiod. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists guidelineson SUP were used to assess the appropriateness of de novo PPIprescriptions. Results Among 255 patients in the study, 138 (54. 1 %) received aprophylaxis with PPI, of which 86 (62. 3 %) were de novo PPI prescriptions. 93. 5 % of patients received esomeprazole (according to thehospital drug formulary) mainly orally at 40 mg qd. 79. 1 % of patientshad no risk factors for SUP. 17. 9 % and 3. 0 % had one and two riskfactors, respectively. 95 % of the patients with PPI were not hospitalizedin the intensive care unit (ICU) before their stay in the visceralsurgery ward. At discharge, PPI therapy was continued in 34. 2 % ofpatients with a de novo PPI prescription. Discussion & Conclusion This study highlights the over-utilizationof PPIs in non-ICU patients and the inappropriate continuation of PPIprescriptions at discharge. The PPI dosage prescribed for prophylaxiswas probably too high compared with the data of the literature. Treatment recommendations for SUP are needed to restrict PPIuse for justified indications...|$|R
