500|$|Events {{covered a}} wide variety of {{scientific}} topics, and combined talks, demonstrations, video presentations and panel discussions. A number of events addressed [...] "big questions". For example, a roster of scientists including physicist William Phillips, philosopher Patricia Churchland, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, philosopher Daniel Dennett, cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky, and cancer researcher Harold Varmus, debated [...] "What It Means to Be Human" [...] in a panel discussion moderated by Charlie Rose. A recurring theme was the wider implications of scientific results, as exemplified by a discussion on the promises and consequences of personal genomics involving biochemist Paul Nurse, sociologist Nikolas Rose, and human genome project leader Francis Collins. A number of events explored the interface between science and the arts; for instance, a panel including psychologist Nancy C. Andreasen, choreographer and dancer Bill T. Jones, and actor and writer Michael York focused on the scientific study of creativity. Other audiences saw physicists Lawrence Krauss and radio host Ira Flatow presenting modern cosmology, paleontologist Richard Leakey exploring the sixth extinction, and chemist F. Sherwood Rowland and Rensselaer Polytechnic president Shirley Ann Jackson discussing new ways of satisfying humanity's energy needs. A number of events were co-productions with the festival's partners, such as a discussion between <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich</b> and neurologist and author Oliver Sacks on perception, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and musician Mark Oliver Everett's exploration of the scientific legacy of his father, Hugh Everett, at the Museum of Modern Art.|$|E

2500|$|Not to be dissuaded, Abumrad and Krulwich {{continued}} to collaborate. By 2004 Radiolab {{had become an}} hour-long, science-themed program characterized by Abumrad's unique sound design style, and <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich</b> appeared as a [...] "guest host" [...] on a program about time in early June. By the following episode (Space, aired two weeks later), they were co-hosts, launching into the program's first official season in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 Abumrad {{was given}} an {{assignment}} to interview ABC News science reporter <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich</b> {{and the two men}} discovered they had a lot in common: both were alumni of Oberlin College (though 25 years apart), and both had worked at WBAI before moving on to WNYC and NPR. They became fast friends and began collaborating on experimental radio pieces, the first of which they sent to Ira Glass for a proposed Flag Day episode of This American Life. [...] "It was horrible," [...] said Glass of the tape in an interview with Abumrad and Krulwich. [...] "It's just amazing that you were able to put together such a wonderful program after that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 24, 2012, in a podcast titled [...] "The Fact of the Matter", {{the program}} ran a segment about the yellow rain {{incidents}} in Laos and surrounding {{countries in the}} 1970s. Included in the story was an interview with Hmong veteran and refugee Eng Yang, with his niece Kao Kalia Yang serving as translator.

PBS aired a program on its science show NOVA, hosted by <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich,</b> that described the difficulties in photographing the tapestries and the math used to fix them.|$|E
5000|$|On September 24, 2012, Radiolab aired {{a segment}} on yellow {{rain and the}} Hmong people, during which <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich</b> interviewed Yang and her uncle Eng Yang. [...] During the two-hour interview, of which {{less than five minutes}} was aired, Yang was brought to the point of tears over [...] "Robert’s harsh {{dismissal}} of my uncle’s experience." ...|$|E
50|$|Host <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich</b> {{left the}} program {{at the end of}} the first season. He was {{replaced}} by astrophysicist Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium.

50|$|Around {{the start}} of the millennium, many first time camera {{recordings}} originated from Malaysia, recognizable by the burn-in Malay subtitles. VCDs often appeared 2 to 3 days before the theatrical release. In some cases, they were even available online 3 months before release. <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich</b> sees two possibilities as the main reason for such early availability of these illicit recordings. Someone in Hollywood shows movies {{a couple of days before}} they show them in America, or some people get prints sent to them from people in the Californian movie business.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 the science-themed show Radiolab aired an {{interview}} with Hmong refugee Eng Yang and his niece, author Kao Kalia Yang, to discuss Eng Yang's experience with yellow rain. The hosts took the position that yellow rain was unlikely {{to have been a}} chemical agent. The episode prompted a backlash among some listeners, who criticized <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich</b> for insensitivity, racism, and their disregard for Yang's personal experience with the region in question. The negative response prompted host Krulwich to issue an apology for his handling of the interview.|$|E
5000|$|Nova ScienceNow (styled NOVA scienceNOW) is a spinoff of {{the long-running}} and venerable PBS science program Nova. Premiering on January 25, 2005, {{the series was}} {{originally}} hosted by <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich,</b> who described it as an experiment in coverage of [...] "breaking science, science that's {{right out of the}} lab, science that sometimes bumps up against politics, art, culture". At the beginning of season two, Neil deGrasse Tyson replaced Krulwich as the show's host. Tyson announced he would leave the show and was replaced by David Pogue beginning season 6.|$|E
50|$|Biologist Randy Olson {{adds that}} anti-science groups {{can often be}} so motivated, and so well funded, that the {{impartiality}} of science organizations in politics can lead to crises of public understanding of science. He cites examples of denialism (for instance of global warming) to support this worry. Journalist <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich</b> likewise argues that the stories scientists tell are invariably competing with the efforts of people like Adnan Oktar. Krulwich explains that attractive, easy to read, and cheap creationist textbooks were sold by the thousands to schools in Turkey (despite their strong secular tradition) due {{to the efforts of}} Oktar.|$|E

5000|$|As his {{commencement}} {{address to}} Caltech students, journalist <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich</b> delivered a speech entitled [...] "Tell me a story". Krulwich says that scientists are actually given {{many opportunities to}} explain something interesting about science or their work, and that they must seize such opportunities. He says scientists must resist shunning the public, as Sir Isaac Newton did in his writing, and instead embrace metaphors the way Galileo did; Krulwich suggests that metaphors only become more important as the science gets more difficult to understand. He adds that telling stories of science in practice, of scientists' success stories and struggles, helps convey that scientists are real people. Finally, Krulwich advocates {{for the importance of}} scientific values in general, and helping the public to understand that scientific views are not mere opinions - but hard won knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|Erik Johansson (born April 1985) is a Swedish-born artist {{based in}} Prague who creates surreal images by {{recombining}} photographs and other materials. He captures ideas by combining images {{in new ways}} to create {{what looks like a}} real photograph, yet with logical inconsistencies to impart an effect of surrealism. Some finished images are the combination of [...] "hundreds of original photographs" [...] as well as raw materials, and Johansson spends dozens of hours using image manipulation software such as Adobe Photoshop to alter the image digitally and to illustrate his idea. Reporter <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich</b> wrote that Johansson creates a [...] "meticulous fantasy" [...] which is [...] "part photograph, part construction, part drawing" [...] with [...] "so many layers of foolery in his images, you can't pull the illusion apart, it fits together so perfectly." ...|$|E
5000|$|Schena is {{considered}} the foremost authority on micorarray technology. In 2001, Schena was featured on the Nova television documentary [...] "Cracking the Code of Life", a two-hour special hosted by ABC News Nightline correspondent <b>Robert</b> <b>Krulwich.</b> Schena first introduced microarrays as pre-symptomatic diagnostic tools on the 2001 Nova program. Schena holds {{the first and second}} positions on [...] "The Microarray Family Tree", a historiograph of 13 influential papers published in the microarray field, written by Eugene Garfield. The Scientist also credited Schena with creating the first array. Schena was proclaimed the [...] "Father of Microarrays" [...] in an article written by Lloyd Dunlap, contributing editor of Drug Discovery News, in an account of Schena's pioneering work to decipher Parkinson's disease. Schena and Rene Schena reside in Los Altos, California.|$|E
