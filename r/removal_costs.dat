5|$|Damage {{and efforts}} to control the spread of emerald ash borer have {{affected}} businesses that sell ash trees or wood products, property owners, and local or state governments. Quarantines can limit the transport of ash trees and products, but economic impacts are especially high for urban and residential areas due to treatment or <b>removal</b> <b>costs</b> and decreased land value from dying trees. Costs for managing these trees can fall upon homeowners or local municipalities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once is costly, so slowing down {{the rate at which}} trees die through removing known infested trees and treating trees with insecticides can allow local governments more time to plan, remove, and replace trees that would eventually die. This strategy saves money as it would cost $10.7 billion in urban areas of 25 states between 2009–2019, while removing and replacing all ash trees in these same areas at once would cost $25 billion. Some urban areas such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, have large amounts of ash with slightly more than 20% of their urban forest as ash.|$|E

40|$|In early spring, {{there is}} a need to treat large volumes of cool tile water {{containing}} high nitrate concentrations. However, lower nitrate removal rates in denitrifying woodchip bioreactors have been observed when hydraulic retention time (HRT) and water temperature are low. One potential approach to improve woodchip bioreactor performance is to provide an alternative and readily available energy source to the denitrifying microorganisms through electrical stimulation. Previous work has demonstrated the capability of bio-electrochemical reactors (BER) to remove a variety of water contaminants, including nitrate, with the presence of a soluble carbon source. The objective of this study was to evaluate the denitrification rate of electrically augmented woodchip bioreactors and conduct a simple TEA to understand the possibilities and limitations for full-scale BER implementation for treatment of agricultural drainage. Three duplicated up-flow column woodchip bioreactors were studied: two controls (non-energized, and without electrodes), two electrically enhanced bioreactors using a 316 stainless steel anode coupled with graphite cathodes, and two electrically enhanced bioreactors using with graphite for both anode and cathodes. Both pairs of electrically enhanced bioreactors demonstrated higher denitrification rates than controls when 500 mA of current was applied. While this technology appeared promising from the perspective of denitrification rate, the techno-economic analysis revealed that higher N <b>removal</b> <b>cost</b> ($/kg N) is needed. With our current reactor design, opportunities to make this technology cost effective require denitrification efficiency of 85 % at 100 mA. This work informs the design of electrically stimulated woodchip bioreactors with optimized performance to achieve lower capital and maintenance costs, and thus lower N <b>removal</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R
50|$|Under the Oil Pollution Act, federal, tribal, state, and {{any other}} person can recover <b>removal</b> <b>costs</b> from a {{responsible}} party so long as such entity has incurred costs from carrying out oil removal activities {{in accordance with the}} Clean Water Act National Contingency Plan. Reimbursement claims must first be made to the responsible party. If the potentially responsible party refutes liability or fails to distribute the reimbursement within 90 days of the claim, the claimant may file suit in court or bring the claim to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund described below. In some instances, claims for removal cost reimbursement can be initially brought to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund thus sidestepping the responsible party. For example, claimants advised by the EPA, governors of affected states, and American claimants for incidents involving foreign vessels or facilities may initially present their claims to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. When claims for removal cost reimbursement are brought to the fund, the claimant must prove that <b>removal</b> <b>costs</b> were sustained from activities required to avoid or alleviate effects of the incident and that such actions were approved or directed by the federal on-scene coordinator.|$|E
