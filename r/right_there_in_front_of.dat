50|$|The {{move from}} TRIZ to SIT was {{motivated}} {{by the desire to}} create a method that is easier to learn and retain (achieved through a smaller number of rules and tools), more universal in application (achieved through elimination of engineering specific tools) and tighter in keeping the problem solver within a real inventive framework (the Closed World principle).TRIZ also favors using existing resources for solving a problem. But in contrast to SIT, this principle is scattered around the method. It {{can be found in the}} principle of Ideal Final Result (“the best system is when there is no system” - Altshuller). The difference between TRIZ and SIT in this respect is that in SIT the Closed World condition is the most important principle.

The DSi's size was changed midway through development, delaying its release. Its original design included two DS game card slots, because of demand from both fan communities and Nintendo employees, which consequently made it larger.

A quick hands-on investigation led them to abandon the dual-slot design, which made the DSi approximately 0.12 in slimmer. Ever since the handheld's in-company unveiling, its internal designs were finished along with assembly and durability specifications.

5000|$|The Closed World {{condition}} {{is crucial to}} SIT’s methodology. The first step in using SIT is to define the problem world. Once defined, the problem solver knows that all the building blocks for the solution are <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him and that the solution simply requires the reorganization of the existing objects. This adds great focus and power to the method. It also can turn every real problem into an amusing puzzle.The Closed World condition deals with the resemblance between the problem world and the solution world. The condition stipulates that {{in the development of}} a new product - or when addressing a problem - one must utilize only elements already existing in the product/problem, or in the immediate environment. This condition forces us to rely on resources already at our disposal, rather than [...] "importing" [...] new external resources for the solution. The Closed World condition often provokes resistance as it runs counter to some of the most common intuitions about creative thinking, especially the ubiquitous notion of [...] "thinking out of the box". The essential claim of [...] "thinking out of the box" [...] is that in order to produce ideas that are new and different, you need to somehow move beyond normal thinking patterns, to a universe located outside the metaphorical box. The Closed World condition, by contrast, forces the thinker to find a creative solution by heavily limiting the space of possibilities. Since the scope of possibilities is artificially limited there is no choice but to reconsider the relations between elements found within the problem and pay closer attention to them: their arrangement in space and time; their assigned functions and their necessity. Thus, the Closed World condition sets us on a collision course with our fixedness, allowing us to arrive at solutions which are both innovative (different from the usual) and simple (since based on existing and known elements).|$|E

The old conventions no longer work in this new world of volatile and increasingly unpredictable demand and supply. The enterprise needs to become more 'connected' to its own parts, {{as well as its}} partners up and down the chains it participates in. So too, we need to embrace new ways of looking at customers to gain deeper, more insightful impressions of what they are telling us about the way they want to buy our products and services.

This is the world of dynamic supply chain alignment where, increasingly, supply chains are the business. In the follow-up to his hugely successful Strategic Supply Chain Alignment, John Gattorna's Dynamic Supply Chain Alignment, explores how to create and sustain multiple supply chains with a level of flexibility and responsiveness that allow you to respond to opportunities and threats; at the same time aligning with your suppliers, your partners and your customers.

40|$|In {{this article}} an {{overview}} is given of traditional methodological approaches to stagewise cognitive developmental research. These approaches are evaluated and integrated {{on the basis}} of catastrophe theory. In particular, catastrophe theory specifies a set of common criteria for testing the disconti-nuity hypothesis proposed by Piaget. Separate criteria correspond to distinct methods used in cognitive developmental research. Such criteria are, for instance, the detection of spurts in develop-ment, bimodality of test scores, and increased variability of responses during transitional periods. When a genuine stage transition is present, these criteria are expected to be satisfied. A revised catastrophe model accommodating these criteria is proposed for the stage transition in cognitive development from the preoperational to the concrete operational stage. Suppose that a team of developmental researchers stumbled upon a genuine stage in the development of some behavior. Would they be able to detect the stage that was <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them? If they did notice it, how would they know what they had found? How would they be able to tell that it was a stage? What pattern of results would they look for? Despite the hundreds of studies of psychological development in recent decades, these questions still have no definitive answers. There is no uniform empirical criterion used by developmental researchers to determine when they have found a stage (K. W Fischer, 1983, p. 5). The concept of stages, as proposed by Piaget (Piaget & In-helder, 1969), is a major subject of discussion in the field of cognitive development (Campbell & Bickhard, 1986; Emde &...|$|E

To call such an interviewdiscussion Rogerian therapy seems an unfair representation of that treatment approach; to ascribe our insomniacs ' improvement to this reveals a remarkable view of the power of a brief discussion.

Eisenman's other 2 points—the problems of self-report and demand characteristics in a therapy study —were both considered in our own discussion. However, these are important issues and do deserve a careful look. Our paper reported a clinical study of the use of relaxation training to treat insomnia. Our only measure of success or failure was our 5 s ' report. The objection to such data, of course, is the impossibility of knowing whether or not your 5 is consciously or unconsciously "fudging " for you.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{evolution}} of a dramaturgy of light in the staging of Wagnerian opera in Germany in the 1880 s and ’ 90 s. It argues that the discovery of a new lighting technology and a subsequent appreciation of the importance of shadow had a profound influence on the development of scenography, modern performance practice and notions of audience immersion. As a fundamental scenographic material light raises key issues about not only what is seen on stage, but how we look and feel. It directs our attention and determines what is perceived by an audience - emphasising shape and volume, yet it is also able to create ‘ambiguities of depth and scale’ (Tufnell & Crickmay, 1990 : 170). These were the possibilities sought by Adolphe Appia in his response to notions of the ‘gesamtkunstwerk’ but which were ultimately frustrated by Wagner’s scenographic practice at Bayreuth. Adolphe Appia’s notion of ‘active light’ (‘lumière actif’ or ‘Gestaltendes Licht’) envisaged light as not simply an illuminating agent but as an expressive force that should be modulated like music. When choreographed, light is a poetic and active agent, animating the stage space and becoming a co-player in the drama. Appia’s articulation of the importance and function of shadow and its manipulation through light represents a paradigmatic shift in staging practice. In previous eras shadows on the stage were a necessary by-product of light that needed to be accommodated. Appia’s vision placed light and shadow and its movement over time, as central to the dramatic experience and the audience’s immersion in the world on stage. This new vision of a ‘choréographie’ of scenographic elements heralded a new genealogy of performance practice. This paper reflects on the development of a dramaturgy of light and darkness inspired by Wagner’s music that was to revolutionise staging practices across Europe and beyond. Welton argues that “the visual experience of light is one of proximity. It is <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> you, and the pleasures and terrors of the dark surely rest on the collapse of distance as a result. (2013 : 5) Layers of light and shadow in performance stimulate sensorial perception which Machon argues demands ‘a new taxonomy for holistic appreciation in immersive theatres. ’ (2013 : 80) From Wagner’s ‘mystical gulf’ to Appia’s ‘choréographie’, light and darkness are fundamental aspects of ‘immersive’ audience experiences. This paper attempts to explore ‘the curious hold which light and shadow can exercise over the imagination of the audience’ (Jones, 1941 : 123). It seeks to investigate the ‘descent into endless night’ (ibid) through the layering of darkness and shadow as a fundamental scenographic strategy in creating a sense of audience ‘immersion’...|$|E
