40|$|Many Mars in situ {{instruments}} require fine-grained high-fidelity {{samples of}} rocks or soil. Included are instruments for {{the determination of}} mineralogy as well as organic and isotopic chemistry. Powder can be obtained as a primary objective of a sample collection system (e. g., by collecting powder as a surface is abraded by a <b>rotary</b> <b>abrasion</b> tool (RAT)), or as a secondary objective (e. g, by collecting drill powder as a core is drilled). In the latter case, a properly designed system {{could be used to}} monitor drilling in real time as well as to deliver powder to analytical instruments which would perform complementary analyses to those later performed on the intact core. In addition, once a core or other sample is collected, a system that could transfer intelligently collected subsamples of power from the intact core to a suite of analytical instruments would be highly desirable. We have conceptualized, developed and tested a breadboard Powder Delivery System (PoDS) intended to satisfy the collection, processing and distribution requirements of powder samples for Mars in-situ mineralogic, organic and isotopic measurement instruments...|$|E
40|$|Paper can be {{coated with}} liquid flame spray (LFS) {{generated}} nanoparticles {{to control the}} wettability of its surface from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic. The adhesion of the nanoparticles on paper is of interest both for understanding the product durability during its lifetime and for product safety issues. Poor particle adhesion influences the desired functional properties and released nanoparticles cause health and environmental concerns. To investigate the wear resistance of LFS-TiO_ 2 and -SiO_ 2 coated papers, the nanoparticle surfaces were exposed to <b>rotary</b> <b>abrasion</b> tests. The changes in the samples were analyzed by contact angle measurements and high resolution field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). After abrasive action with another paperboard surface, only relatively small changes in wettability of superhydrophobic/hydrophilic coatings were found. A more severe abrasive action will {{remove some of the}} nanoparticle coating, but the hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of the surface is still maintained to large extent. The results indicate that the wear resistance of LFS nanocoated paper surfaces differs and depends on the nanoparticle material type used for the coating. This is clearly reflected as changes in surface structure shown by FE-SEM and wettability. The results can help understanding which paper-related application areas could be targeted with the LFS-nanoparticle coating process...|$|E
