Using a post-Newtonian point particle model for the pre-merger phase of the binary inspiral, I calculate the maximum allowable errors for the mass and relative velocity and positions of the binary during numerical simulations of the binary inspiral. These maximum allowable errors are compared to the errors of state-of-the-art numerical simulations of multiple-orbit binary neutron star calculations in full general relativity, and are found to be smaller by several orders of magnitude. A post-Newtonian model for the error of these numerical simulations suggests that adaptive mesh refinement coupled with second order accurate finite difference codes {{will not be able to}} robustly obtain the accuracy required for reliable gravitational wave extraction on Terabyte-scale computers. I conclude that higher order methods (higher order finite difference methods and/or spectral methods) combined with adaptive mesh refinement and/or multipatch technology will be needed for robustly accurate gravitational wave extraction from numerical <b>relativity</b> <b>calculations</b> of binary coalescence scenarios.

The three different outcomes of unstable models, namely migration to the stable branch, total dispersion, and collapse to a black hole, are also present for self-interacting boson stars.

40|$|Starting with a post-Newtonian {{description}} of compact binary systems, we derive {{a set of}} equations that describes {{the evolution of the}} orbital angular momentum and both spin vectors during inspiral. We find regions of phase space that exhibit resonance behavior, characterized by small librations of the spin vectors around a fixed orientation. Due to the loss of energy and orbital angular momentum through radiation reaction, systems can eventually be captured into these resonance orientations. By investigating the long-term evolution of compact binaries with a variety of initial conditions, we find that the distribution in parameter space can be strongly affected by resonance captures. This has the effect of significantly reducing the size of search space for gravitational wave sources, in turn improving the chances of detecting such sources through methods of template matching. Furthermore, by calculating the expected spin distribution {{at the end of the}} inspiral phase, we can predict what are the most likely initial conditions for the plunge phase, a result of great interest for numerical <b>relativity</b> <b>calculations.</b> Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Phys.

40|$|One often-used {{approximation}} in {{the study}} of binary compact objects (i. e., black holes and neutron stars) in general relativity is the instantaneously circular orbit assumption. This approximation has been used extensively, from the calculation of innermost circular orbits to the construction of initial data for numerical <b>relativity</b> <b>calculations.</b> While this assumption is inconsistent with generic general relativistic astrophysical inspiral phenomena where the dissipative effects of gravitational radiation cause the separation of the compact objects to decrease in time, it is usually argued that the timescale of this dissipation is much longer than the orbital timescale so that the approximation of circular orbits is valid. Here, we quantitatively analyze this approximation using a post-Newtonian approach that includes terms up to order ({Gm/(rc^ 2) }) ^{ 9 / 2 } for non-spinning particles. By calculating the evolution of equal mass black hole / black hole binary systems starting with circular orbit configurations and comparing them to the more astrophysically relevant quasicircular solutions, we show that a minimum initial separation corresponding to at least 6 (3. 5) orbits before plunge is required in order to bound the detection event loss rate in gravitational wave detectors to 95 % for a range of initial separations that include all modern calculations of the innermost circular orbit (ICO).

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{investigation}} of general relativistic effects on the observed X-ray continuum of Kerr black holes {{in the context of}} the light bending model (Miniutti & Fabian, 2004). Assuming a ring-like illuminating source, co-rotating with the underlying accretion disk, we study the shape and normalisation of the primary and disc reflected continuum as well as the dependence of the observed spectrum on the line of sight for various source heights and radii. These calculations are performed using Monte-Carlo methods to compute the angle dependent reflection spectrum from the disc. The effects of general relativity are illustrated by a comparison with Newtonian and Special <b>Relativity</b> <b>calculations.</b> We find that relativistic distortions can strongly affect the shape of the reflected spectrum. Light bending can dramatically increase the observable reflected flux and reduce the primary emission. In addition, multiple reflections due to the reflected photons deflected toward the disc can alter significantly the shape of the spectrum above 10 keV. Large variations of the ring radius at constant height can lead to an (unobserved) anti-correlation between primary and reflected flux. In another side, the variability behaviour of several sources can be reproduced if the ring source radius is small (< 5 r_g), and its height varies by a large factor. In particular, a non-linear flux-flux relation, similar to that observed in several sources, can be produced. We compare our model with the flux-flux plot of NGC 4051, and find an agreement for low inclination angles (< 20 deg.), ring source radius < 3 r_g and a height varying between 0. 5 to 10 r_g.

40|$|The growing {{fields of}} {{spintronics}} and nanotechnology have created {{increased interest in}} developing the means to manipulate the spin of electrons. One such method arises from {{the combination of the}} spin-orbit interaction and the broken inversion symmetry that arises at surfaces and interfaces, and has prompted many recent investigations on metallic surfaces. A method by which surface states, in the absence of spin orbit effects, have been successfully investigated is the Green function embedding scheme of Inglesfield. This has been integrated into a self consistent FLAPW density functional framework based on the scalar relativistic K¨olling Harmon equation. Since the spin of the electron is a direct effect of special <b>relativity,</b> <b>calculations</b> involving the spin orbit interaction are best performed using solutions of the Dirac equation. This work describes the extension of Green’s function embedding to include the Dirac equation and how fully relativistic FLAPW surface electronic structure calculations are implemented. The general procedure used in performing a surface calculation in the scalar relativistic case is closely followed. A bulk transfer matrix is defined and used to generate the complex band structure and an embedding potential. This embedding potential is then used to produce a self consistent surface potential, leading to a Green’s function from which surface state dispersions and splittings are calculated. The bulk embedding potential can also be employed in defining channel functions and these provide a natural framework in which to explore transport properties. A relativistic version of a well known expression for the ballistic conductance across a device is derived in this context. Differences between the relativistic and nonrelativistic methods are discussed in detail. To test the validity of the scheme, a fully relativistic calculation of the extensively studied spin orbit split L-gap surface state on Au(111) is performed, which agrees well with experiment and previous calculations. Contributions to the splitting from different angular momentum channels are also provided. The main advantages of the relativistic embedding method are the full inclusion of the spin orbit interaction to all orders, the true semi infinite nature of the technique, allowing the full complex bands of the bulk crystal to be represented and the fact that a only small number of surface layers is needed in comparison to other existing methods.
