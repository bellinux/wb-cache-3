5|$|The unit's first {{operation}} was the successful <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lofoten Islands in 4 March 1941. The next two planned operations were both cancelled {{and it was}} not until 22 April 1942 that No. 4 Commando took part in another raid, Operation Abercrombie, a <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> French coastal town of Hardelot. On 22 August 1942, No.4 was one of three commando units selected for the Dieppe raid. Under the command of Lord Lovat, No.4 Commando landed on the right flank of the main landings and successfully silenced a German gun battery. This was the only complete success of the operation, which was eventually aborted, after less than 10 hours, following heavy losses.|$|E

5|$|Derfflingers first combat {{operation}} was a <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> English coastal towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. One raid {{had already been}} conducted by the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group, on the town of Yarmouth in late 1914. Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{the commander of the}} High Seas Fleet, decided to conduct another <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> English coast. His goal was to lure a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be isolated and destroyed. At 03:20 on 15 December, Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, with his flag in , departed the Jade estuary. Following Seydlitz were Derfflinger, , , and , along with the light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two squadrons of torpedo boats. The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, until they reached the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet departed to provide distant cover. The main fleet consisted of 14 dreadnoughts, eight pre-dreadnoughts and a screening force of two armored cruisers, seven light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats.|$|E

It served with PLeLv 48 and was converted into a photo-reconnaissance aircraft in 1944 before being destroyed by a Soviet bombing <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airfield at Lappeenranta on 2 July 1944. By then, it had flown over 222 hours in Finnish service.|$|E

5|$|At {{the height}} of the second World War in 1941, the Oval – {{including}} terraces, offices, kits and club records – was destroyed in a bombing <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nearby Harland & Wolff Shipyard. Glentoran approached Distillery to play at Grosvenor Park, which they did until the Oval was rebuilt with help from other clubs, most notably Cliftonville. During this time, Glentoran considered resigning from senior football to become a junior club, but after borrowing kits from Distillery and Crusaders they continued to compete at Grosvenor until 1949. Out of 14 league games at Grosvenor Park however, they were only victorious over Linfield on one occasion.|$|E
5|$|Bombs often {{landed on}} the estate during the blitz of Bristol. In September 1940, during a <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton, bombs cut off the estate's water supply, and during a later raid, one bomb badly damaged the lantern roof light over the hallway. In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down. As a result damp, and latterly birds, entered the house through the roof light, until the house came into the {{ownership}} of the National Trust and was repaired.|$|E

Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|E

5|$|During a <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} Italian city of Verona on 12 October 1944, Raw's {{aircraft was}} hit by two anti-aircraft shells that destroyed its hydraulics system and an engine, wounded the radio operator and opened 166 holes in the fuselage. Despite this damage, Raw was able to return the B-24 safely to its base. He suffered frostbite to his feet, as damage to the plane's nose caused icy winds to enter the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|During the Italo-Turkish War, the Italian {{military}} {{feared that}} Ottoman naval {{forces in the}} Mediterranean would stage <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Italian supply and troopships headed for Italian East Africa. In order to prevent such a raid, Rear Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel was ordered to clear the harbor of Beirut of what Ottoman naval vessels he might find there. Revel's force consisted of two armoured cruisers: Giuseppe Garibaldi and Francesco Ferruccio. Both cruisers were of the Giuseppe Garibaldi class and armed with two 10inch guns in turrets, ten 6inch guns, six 4.7inch guns, ten 6-pounders, ten 1-pounders, 2 Maxim machine guns, and five torpedo tubes.|$|E

Upon arrival Rear-Admiral Richard Peirse, commander of the East Indies Station, hoisted his flag in Euryalus. By this time the preliminary bombardments of the Turkish defences of the Dardanelles had already occurred, and the sisters {{were transferred}} north in March as the Turks east of the Canal proved to be reasonably quiet.|$|E
5|$|Fears grew {{about the}} threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were particularly concerned about the potential of a French <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich {{and the experience of}} Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated by a French attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the recent events of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E

Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but they were old and in a poor state of repair, and so were unable to defend themselves when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.|$|E
