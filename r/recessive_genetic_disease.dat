40|$|Isodisomy (ID) is {{a genetic}} anomaly {{defined as the}} inheri-tance of two copies of the same genetic {{material}} from one parent. ID in an offspring is a rare cause of <b>recessive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases</b> via inheritance of two copies of a mutated gene from one carrier parent. We studied a newborn female with a mut ° form of methylmalonic acidemia and complete ab-sence of insulin-producing. 8 cells in otherwise normal-ap-pearing pancreatic islets, causing insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient died 2 wk after birth. Serotyping of the HLA antigens, DNA typing of HLA-B and HLA class H loci, study of polymorphic DNA markers of chromosome 6, and cytogenetic analysis demonstrated paternal ID, involv-ing at least a 25 -centiMorgan portion of the chromosome pair that encompasses the MHC. ID probably caused meth-ylmalonic acidemia by duplication of a mutated allele of the corresponding gene on the chromosome 6 inherited from the father. It is also very likely that ID was etiologically related to the agenesis of. 8 cells and consequent insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in our patient.

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common lethal autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases</b> in the Caucasian population, with a frequency of about 1 in 3000 livebirths. CF is due to a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encoding the CFTR protein, a cyclic adenosine 5 '-monophosphate (cAMP) -regulated chloride channel localized in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. CFTR is a multifunctional protein which, in addition to be a Cl-channel, is also a regulator of multiple ion channels and other proteins. In particular CFTR has been reported to play a role in the outflow of adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) from cells, but this remains controversial. Extracellular nucleotides are signaling molecules that regulate ion transport and mucociliary clearance by acting on P 2 nucleotide receptors, in particular the P 2 Y(2) receptor. Nucleotides activating the P 2 Y(2) receptor represent thus one pharmacotherapeutic strategy to treat CF disease, via improvement of mucus hydration and mucociliary clearance in airways. Phase II clinical trials have recently shown that aerosolized denufosol (INS 37217, Inspire(R)) improves pulmonary function in CF patients: denufosol was granted orphan drug status and phase III trials are planned. Here, we review what is known about the relationship between extracellular nucleotides and CFTR, the role of extracellular nucleotides in epithelial pathophysiology and their putative role as therapeutic agents.

40|$|The {{principal}} aim of gene therapy for <b>recessive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases</b> is {{to supplement the}} loss of function of an endogenous gene. For the treatment of many diseases regulation of transgene expression at physiological levels, expression of multiple splice variants, and correct tissue specificity are of utmost importance for effective therapy. We therefore believe {{the use of a}} complete genomic locus, in which the native promoter and regulatory regions drive and control expression, is an elegant and effective alternative to traditional complementary DNA (cDNA) vectors utilising heterologous promoters. Viral vectors have proved, over the years, to be an effective means of gene delivery in vitro and in vivo, but the size of complete genomic loci precludes their use in most viral systems. One notable exception comprises the amplicon-type vectors based on human herpesviruses, such as the herpes simplex virus type I (HSV- 1) amplicon vector. The large genome of HSV- 1 (152 kb) confers upon HSV- 1 amplicons a very large transgene capacity sufficient to accommodate approximately 95 % of human genomic loci. The combination of the large transgene capacity, a broad range of cell tropism, and the ability to infect dividing and non-dividing cells makes HSV- 1 amplicons an excellent vector system to develop for the delivery of large genomic loci. Here we review recent work which has shown that HSV- 1 amplicons can be used for the delivery and expression of large genomic inserts > 100 kb to cells in culture to rescue phenotypes in cellular models of <b>genetic</b> <b>disease.</b> We then discuss applications for high capacity HSV- 1 amplicons in vivo and their potential to facilitate the use of large genomic inserts in gene therapy treatment regimes...|$|R

Tay-Sachs disease has provided the prototype for the prevention of severe <b>recessive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Molecular analysis of the Hex A gene (HEXA) of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals affected with Tay-Sachs disease revealed that three common mutations cause the infantile and adult onset forms of the disease; a four base insertion in exon 11, a splice junction mutation in intron 12 and a point mutation in exon 7 (G 269 S). A study was undertaken to determine whether mutation analysis would be useful in TSD screening programs in identifying carriers and clarifying the status of individuals whose enzyme assays are inconclusive. Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who had been diagnosed as carriers, inconclusives by enzyme assay and non-carriers with low normal enzyme levels in the Mount Sinai Tay-Sachs Disease Prevention Program were examined for the presence of the three mutations using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization. The insertion mutation was present in 29 of 34 carriers and 2 of 36 inconclusive individuals, the splice junction mutation was found in 4 of 34 carriers and the G 269 S mutation was found in 1 of 34 carriers.
