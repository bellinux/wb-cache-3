40|$|Resonant DC/DC {{converters}} are {{the class}} of converters, which have L-C <b>resonant</b> <b>tank</b> serving as {{a major part of}} the power conversion process. The fundamental concept of the resonant converter is that the circulating energy in an L-C resonant circuit is manageable by changing the operating frequency, and therefore the converter can condition the input power to the desired output voltage. The development in power conversion technology is steady demand for high power efficiency and high power density. A high efficiency is achieved by using series resonant converter (SRC) topology. It may operate in either continuous or discontinuous conduction modes. After exploring the advantages of using a resonant converter, the series resonant converter is implemented. Increasing the frequency is desirable for power converters operation. However, the switching losses will increase by increasing the frequency of operation. Hence, the efficiency of the system reduces drastically. In order to reduce switching losses and increasing high frequency operation, a series resonant converter has been developed. The <b>resonant</b> <b>tank</b> of SRC consists of a resonant capacitor and a resonant inductor connected in series. The output load resistance is in series with the <b>resonant</b> <b>tank</b> and the impedance of the <b>resonant</b> <b>tank</b> is a function of the switching frequency, and hence the voltage across the output impedance can be modulated by the switching frequency...|$|E
30|$|In the literature, several {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for avoiding the frequency control. One of the earliest approaches is the phase modulated resonant converters (PMRC) that {{was published in the}} late 80 ’s. In [22], a constant frequency resonant converter is designed by implementing two conventional SRC or PRC whose outputs are connected either in parallel or in series. These converters are operated at a constant frequency, whereas the output voltage is controlled by the phase displacement at the inverter stages. The disadvantages of PMRCs are the unbalanced inductor currents and capacitor voltages at the resonant tanks. Moreover, the circulating currents at light loads and high component stresses are some of the major drawbacks [23]. In [24], clamped mode resonant converters (CMRC) have been proposed. These converters regulate the output voltage by controlling the pulse width of square voltage across the <b>resonant</b> <b>tank.</b> The major disadvantage of these type of converters {{lies in the fact that}} each couple of switching elements have different peak and RMS currents. A further approach is proposed in [19], where the output voltage can be regulated by the utilization of a variable inductor in the <b>resonant</b> <b>tank.</b> The shortcoming of this approach is the low efficiency due to the operation at far from the resonance frequency. A classical type PRC operating as a constant current source at resonance frequency has been reported in [25]. Reference [26] offers another technique by employing a switched capacitor at the <b>resonant</b> <b>tank</b> for controlling the output voltage gain. A recent approach proposed by [27], is a pulse-width modulation (PWM) operated secondary <b>resonant</b> <b>tank</b> (SRT) converter, which is comprised of a conventional full-bridge PWM inverter and a <b>resonant</b> <b>tank</b> connected at the secondary side of the transformer. The voltage/current regulation is achieved by the closed-loop control of the PWM generator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{fundamental}} {{characteristics of a}} novel third-order RF balanced-to-unbalanced filter, namely, a balun filter, for integrated RF module applications are pre-sented. This center-tapped transformer-based new device works concurrently as a balun, an extracted-pole bandpass filter, and a matching network. As coupled <b>resonant</b> <b>tanks</b> are employed to perform the balun type of operation, traditional coupled-resonator filter theory can thus be used to design and analyze such a new device. Moreover, an extracted-pole technique is used not only for creating a transmission zero, but also provides a capability to match the filter with a complex load. In addi-tion to providing a simple design procedure for the device, its working mechanism is also revealed mathematically. Specifically, return-loss sensitivity with respect to each resonator admittance and complex load matching capability are discussed in details.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} {{for the implementation of}} balanced ultra-wideband (UWB) bandpass filters with common-mode noise suppression. To a first-order approximation, the differential-mode filter response is described by the canonical circuit model of a bandpass filter, i. e., a cascade of series-connected resonators alternating with shunt-connected parallel <b>resonant</b> <b>tanks.</b> Thus, the series branches of the balanced filter are implemented by means of inductive strips and patch capacitors, whereas the shunt sections are realized through mirrored stepped-impedance resonators (SIRs) and low-impedance (i. e., capacitive) short transmission-line sections. For the differential mode, the symmetry plane is a virtual ground, the wide strip sections of the SIRs are effectively grounded, and the SIRs behave as grounded inductors parallel connected to capacitors. However, for the common mode, where the symmetry plane is an open (magnetic wall), the SIRs act as shunt-connected series resonators, thus providing transmission zeros at their resonance frequencies. By properly tailoring the location of these transmission zeros, rejection of the common mode over the differential filter passband can be achieved. To illustrate the potential of the approach, an order- 5 balanced bandpass filter covering the regulated band for UWB communications (3. 1 – 10. 6 GHz) is designed and fabricated. The filter exhibits common-mode rejection above 10 dB over the whole differential filter passband, with differential-mode insertion losses lower than 1. 9 dB and return losses better than 10 dB.
