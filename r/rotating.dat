5|$|Many players {{prefer to}} play the Hammond through a <b>rotating</b> speaker cabinet known, after several name changes, as a Leslie speaker, after its {{inventor}} Donald J. Leslie. The Leslie system is an integrated speaker/amplifier combination in which sound is emitted by a <b>rotating</b> horn over a stationary treble compression driver, and a <b>rotating</b> baffle beneath a stationary bass woofer. This creates a characteristic sound because of the constantly changing pitch shifts that result from the Doppler effect created by the moving sound sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a <b>rotating</b> mirror. Because the mirror keeps <b>rotating</b> while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the <b>rotating</b> mirror at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a funnel cloud is any <b>rotating</b> cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a <b>rotating</b> cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any <b>rotating</b> cloud below a cumuliform cloud.|$|E

50|$|In general, the {{operation}} of rotation does not work correctly on non-spherical QGA quadric surface entities. Rotation also does not work correctly on the QGA point entities. Attempting to <b>rotate</b> a QGA quadric surface {{may result in a}} different type of quadric surface, or a quadric surface that is <b>rotated</b> and distorted in an unexpected way. Attempting to <b>rotate</b> a QGA point may produce a value that projects as the expected <b>rotated</b> vector, but the produced value is generally not a correct embedding of the <b>rotated</b> vector. The failure of QGA points to <b>rotate</b> correctly also leads to the inability to use outermorphisms to <b>rotate</b> dual Geometric Outer Product Null Space (GOPNS) entities. To <b>rotate</b> a QGA point, it must be projected to a vector or converted to a CGA point for rotation operations, then the <b>rotated</b> result can be re-embedded or converted back into a QGA point. A quadric surface <b>rotated</b> by an arbitrary angle cannot be represented by any known QGA entity. Representation of general quadric surfaces with useful operations will require an algebra (that appears to be unknown at this time) that extends QGA.|$|R

5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is <b>rotating</b> {{underneath}} the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a <b>rotating</b> frame of reference.

5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a <b>rotating</b> mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used <b>rotating</b> mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the <b>rotating</b> mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and <b>rotating</b> mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a <b>rotating</b> mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a <b>rotating</b> mirror R, forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E

If the star is allowed to rotate nonuniformly, and viscosity is neglected, then, as was pointed out by Fred Hoyle in 1947, there is no limit to the mass for which it is possible for a model white dwarf to be in static equilibrium. Not all of these model stars will be dynamically stable.|$|E
