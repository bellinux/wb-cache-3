5|$|Returning to Chicago {{with his}} prisoner, Tintin is praised as a hero, but gangsters kidnap Snowy and send Tintin a <b>ransom</b> <b>note.</b> Tracing the kidnappers {{to a local}} mansion, Tintin hides in a suit of armour and frees Snowy from the dungeon. The {{following}} day, Tintin is invited to a cannery, {{but it is a}} trap set by gangsters, who trick him into falling into the meat-grinding machine. Tintin is saved when the machine workers go on strike and then apprehends the mobsters. In thanks, he is invited to a banquet in his honour, where he is kidnapped and thrown into Lake Michigan to drown. Tintin survives by floating to the surface, but gangsters posing as police capture him. He once again overwhelms them, and hands them over to the authorities. Finally, Tintin's success against the gangsters is celebrated by a ticker-tape parade, following which he returns to Europe.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} noted, handwriting {{experts at}} the time stated that the Thomas's <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> from his previous conviction of extortion bears similarity in both style {{in regard to the}} wording and in form of the actual structure of the letters formed to the Degnan <b>ransom</b> <b>note.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> {{was unusually}} {{long and the}} police were told by the FBI that it was also very unusual for a <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> to be written at the crime scene. It was {{considered}} by the police to be staged and included an unusual use of exclamation marks and acronyms {{and did not have}} any fingerprints.|$|E

Additionally he hosts <b>Ransom</b> <b>Notes</b> Radio, a nationally syndicated radio show on politics and finance that runs daily in about 30 markets. <b>Ransom</b> <b>Notes</b> is syndicated by the Wall Street Business Network, a division of Salem Communications.|$|R
50|$|The {{title is}} derived from the joke ducknapping of the tour mascot, a stuffed duck, and the {{subsequent}} backstage appearance of cod <b>ransom</b> <b>notes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Evidence against Hauptmann {{included}} $20,000 of {{the ransom}} money {{found in his}} garage and testimony alleging handwriting and spelling similarities to that found on the <b>ransom</b> <b>notes.</b> Eight handwriting experts (including Albert S. Osborn) pointed out similarities between the <b>ransom</b> <b>notes</b> and Hauptmann's writing specimens. The defense called an expert to rebut this evidence, while two others declined to testify; the latter two demanded $500 before looking at the notes and were dismissed when Fisher declined. Others experts retained by the defense were never called to testify.|$|R
25|$|The police {{suspected}} that the <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> had been written by the child's mother and that the <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> and appearance of the body had been staged by the parents in order {{to cover up the}} crime. However, in 1998, the District Attorney said that due to a new DNA analysis, none of the immediate family members were under suspicion for the crime.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> and a {{practice}} draft were written {{with a pen}} and pad of paper from the Ramsey home.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{previously}} {{had been convicted}} of an attempted extortion – with a <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> that threatened the kidnapping of a little girl.|$|E
50|$|William Hamm, Jr. {{was kidnapped}} in Saint Paul by the Barker-Karpis Gang in the 1930s. The {{subsequent}} {{investigation by the}} FBI employed the first attempt at raising latent fingerprints from paper <b>ransom</b> <b>notes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Linguistic {{analysis}} of the <b>ransom</b> <b>notes</b> indicated the authors were likely fluent in Chinese and proficient in English, as the versions of the notes in those languages were probably human-written while the rest seemed to be machine-translated.|$|R
50|$|Reilly {{argued that}} the {{evidence}} against Hauptmann was entirely circumstantial, as no reliable witness had placed Hauptmann {{at the scene of}} the crime, nor were his fingerprints found on the ladder, the <b>ransom</b> <b>notes,</b> or anywhere in the nursery.|$|R
25|$|The Chicago Police couldn't {{find any}} prints originally, hence the {{necessity}} to send the <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> to the FBI for further processing, indicating that they were incapable of finding {{it in the first}} place.|$|E
25|$|A {{handwriting}} expert, Cina Wong, after {{a three-week}} {{analysis of the}} <b>ransom</b> <b>note,</b> believes {{it was written by}} the child's mother Patsy, as the author of the note used four different variations of the letter 'A', and that JonBenét's mother uses the same four types of 'A'.|$|E
25|$|According to {{statements}} that Patsy Ramsey gave to authorities on December 26, 1996, {{she realized that}} her daughter was missing after she found a two-and-a-half-page ransom letter on the kitchen staircase. The <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> demanded $118,000 for the child's safe return—almost the exact value of a bonus her husband had received earlier that year.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Ransom</b> <b>Notes</b> are a co-ed {{a cappella}} group {{that aims to}} have fun and {{participate}} in ICCAs. They were the first group at Kenyon to incorporate choreography in their sets. Founded as an all-male group in 2010 they became co-ed in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next day}} Hickman sent {{the first of}} three <b>ransom</b> <b>notes</b> to the Parker home, {{demanding}} $1,500 in $20 gold certificates. All his communications {{over the next few days}} were signed with names such as [...] "Fate," [...] "Death," [...] and [...] "The Fox." ...|$|R
50|$|Several <b>ransom</b> <b>notes</b> {{and other}} {{communications}} {{were sent to}} the Temple, some were relayed to the police, who thought they were hoaxes and others dismissed as fraudulent. For a time, Mildred Kennedy, McPherson's mother, offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the return of her daughter.|$|R
25|$|Verburgh spent 10 {{days in the}} hospital. It was {{determined}} that Verburgh, a Belgian immigrant, couldn't write English well enough even by the crude standards of the <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> itself {{for him to have}} written it. He sued the Chicago Police Department for $15,000 but was awarded $20,000, which is approximately $222,000 in 2010 dollars. Five thousand dollars ($55,000 in 2010 dollars) of the $20,000 awarded to Verburgh was awarded to his wife.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigative team}} {{reviewed}} the case, including the 911 call, <b>ransom</b> <b>note,</b> {{and other aspects}} of the case in re-created rooms of the Ramsey house. The documentary included past investigative footage with that of this investigative team, which included former FBI agent Jim Clemente, Dr. Henry Lee, former chief investigator for the Boulder District Attorney James Kolar, forensic patholigist Dr. Werner Spitz, James Fitzgerald, former Scotland Yard criminal behavior analyst Laura Richards, and Stan Burke.|$|E
25|$|The flyers {{had been}} taken {{prisoner}} on Wednesday, 13 August by a Villista desperado named Jesus Renteria. The bandit sent the <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> to a rancher at Candelaria, along with telegrams which he forced the airmen to write to their fathers and the Secretary of War, the Commanding General of the Southern Department, and the commanding officer of U.S. forces in the Big Bend District. Renteria demanded $15,000 not later than Monday, 18 August, or the two Americans would be killed.|$|E
50|$|The getaway car {{used for}} obtaining the ransom money {{was found by}} police, and it was {{identified}} as having been stolen some weeks earlier. Investigators had Hickman's fingerprints on file, owing to his previous arrest and incarceration. They matched them to fingerprints found on the <b>ransom</b> <b>notes</b> and on the getaway car.|$|R
50|$|The {{paucity of}} {{documents}} (<b>ransom</b> <b>notes,</b> threatening letters, etc) in most criminal cases in a forensic setting {{means there is}} often too little text upon which to base a reliable identification. However, the information provided may be adequate to eliminate a suspect as an author or narrow down an author from {{a small group of}} suspects.|$|R
40|$|The {{conversation}} at {{dinner in the}} dormitory that night centered on the Lindbergh case. Was Hauptmann innocent or guilty? Everyone had an opinion, {{and for a while}} <b>ransom</b> <b>notes,</b> wooden ladders and gold certificates were the main topics of interest. Eventually the talk drifted around to our friend Huey from Louisiana, and more opinions flowed freely {{back and forth across the}} table...|$|R
25|$|After the Degnan murder, {{but before}} Heirens became a suspect, Chicago police interrogated 42-year-old Richard Russell Thomas, a drifter {{passing through the}} city of Chicago {{at the time of}} Degnan's murder, found in the Maricopa County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona. Police {{handwriting}} expert Charles B. Arnold, head of the forgery detail of the Phoenix police in Thomas's hometown of Phoenix, noted similarities between the handwritten Degnan <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> and Thomas' handwriting when Thomas wrote with his left hand, and suggested that Chicago police investigate Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Among {{evidence}} demonstrated toward Heirens's {{guilt is}} the fingerprint {{evidence on the}} Degnan <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> and on the doorjamb of Frances Brown's bathroom door. However, suspicions on the veracity of doorjamb fingerprints found at the Brown crime scene have arisen, including charges that the police planted the fingerprint since it allegedly looks like a rolled fingerprint, the type that you would find on a police fingerprint index card. Both sets of prints have come under serious question as to their validity, good faith collection and possible contamination; even the possibility of their being planted.|$|E
25|$|Once the Franks family {{received}} the <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> the following morning, Leopold called {{a second time}} and dictated {{the first set of}} ransom payment instructions. The intricate plan stalled almost immediately when a nervous family member forgot the address of the store where he was supposed to receive the next set of directions; and it was abandoned entirely when word came that a man named Tony Minke had found the boy's body. Their kidnapping ruse exposed, Leopold and Loeb destroyed the stolen typewriter and burned a robe used to move the body. Convinced that they had done everything they could to hide their tracks, they went about their lives as usual.|$|E
50|$|Sackheim {{received}} a letter requesting $500 for her niece's safe return, which police investigated. Later <b>ransom</b> <b>notes</b> arrived and she received mysterious telephone calls. Police could not locate the contact man even though he advertised frequently in the Paris edition of an American newspaper. By September Sackheim offered a reward requesting information which {{would lead to the}} finding of De Koven's presumed abductors.|$|R
2500|$|Ransom, Roger L[...] Economic History Association. August 24, 2001. Referenced November 20, 2005. Citing Beard; Hacker; Egnal; Ransom and Sutch; Bensel; and McPherson, <b>Ransom</b> <b>notes</b> that [...] "regional {{economic}} specialization ... generated {{very strong}} regional divisions {{on economic issues}} ... economic changes in the Northern states were a major factor leading to the political collapse of the 1850s ... the sectional splits on these economic issues ... led to a growing crisis in economic policy".|$|R
50|$|ASAN's {{early work}} mostly focused on {{fighting}} {{the use of}} aversives, restraint, and seclusion in special education; in December 2007, they spoke out publicly against Autism Speaks, and against the NYU Child Study Center's <b>Ransom</b> <b>Notes</b> ad campaign, which compared autism, ADHD, OCD, and eating disorders to kidnappers holding children hostage. This counter-campaign put ASAN on the public's radar and {{has been referred to}} as the neurodiversity movement's coming of age. ASAN continues to protest Autism Speaks.|$|R
25|$|Leopold (then 19 years old) and Loeb (18) {{settled on}} the {{kidnapping}} and murder {{of a young boy}} as their perfect crime. They spent seven months planning everything from the method of abduction to disposal of the body. To obfuscate the precise nature of their crime and their motive, they decided to make a ransom demand, and devised an intricate plan for collecting it, involving a long series of complex delivery instructions to be communicated, one set at a time, by phone. They typed the final set of instructions involving the actual money drop {{in the form of a}} <b>ransom</b> <b>note,</b> using the typewriter stolen from the fraternity house. A chisel was selected as the murder weapon, and purchased.|$|E
25|$|Gru {{successfully}} shrinks and steals the Moon, {{and rushes}} back to Earth {{to attend the}} recital—only to find a <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls. After arriving at Vector's headquarters, Gru surrenders the Moon, but Vector reneges on the deal, flying off with the girls and the Moon. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefario has discovered {{that the effects of}} the shrink ray are temporary; the bigger the object's original size, the faster the shrinkage will wear off. As the Moon starts to expand in Vector's ship, Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions execute a daring mid-air rescue of the girls just as the Moon explodes out of Vector's ship and launches itself back into orbit, with Vector trapped on it.|$|E
500|$|On November 11, 2004, it was {{reported}} that a number of the inflatables had been stolen from Burger King roofs nationwide. Burger King chief marketing officer Russ Klein said, [...] "As to the motives behind these apparent 'spongenappings', we can only speculate. We did receive one <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> related to an inflatable SpongeBob disappearance in Minnesota." [...] The chain offered a year's supply of Whopper sandwiches as a reward for information leading to the return of inflatables stolen in November. One was found attached to a railing at the football-field 50-yard line at an Iowa college, and another under a bed in Virginia. A <b>ransom</b> <b>note</b> was found for a third: [...] "We have SpongeBob. Give us 10 Krabby Patties, fries, and milkshakes." [...] Steven Simon and Conrad (C.J.) Mercure Jr. were arrested after stealing an inflatable from a Burger King in St. Mary's County, Maryland. While facing up to 18 months in jail and a $500 fine, Simon and Mercure said they were proud of what they did; Simon said, [...] "Once we got caught by the police, we were like, now we can tell everybody." [...] The following year Burger King took [...] "extra security precautions", when Stormtroopers from George Lucas' Star Wars guarded the delivery of Star Wars toys to a Burger King in North Hollywood.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to Hauptmann's {{possession of the}} ransom money, the State introduced evidence showing a strong similarity between Hauptmann's handwriting and {{the handwriting on the}} <b>ransom</b> <b>notes.</b> The State also introduced photographic evidence demonstrating that the wood from the ladder left at the crime scene matched a plank from the floor of Hauptmann's attic. Condon and Charles Lindbergh both testified that Hauptmann was [...] "John". Another witness, Amandus Hockmuth, testified that he saw Hauptmann near the scene of the crime.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the Regulators' {{arrests of}} {{suspected}} Raiders {{took place between}} June 29 and July 10, 1864, when the main offenders were tried and hanged. The Regulators were able to round {{up most of the}} Raiders by attacking them at their headquarters; while the Raiders put up considerable resistance, they were overthrown by the Regulators. In his diary, <b>Ransom</b> <b>notes</b> that the first night of arrests were successful because, [...] "thirty or forty of the worst characters in camp had been taken outside".|$|R
500|$|Derek and Mavis {{have been}} {{described}} by What's on TV as [...] "an old-fashioned pair who were made for each other", and were typically featured in comic storylines, such as one in 1995 that saw their garden gnome kidnapped and transported around the world; Derek and Mavis received pictures of the gnome in various exotic locations, sent to them with <b>ransom</b> <b>notes.</b> It transpired that the kidnapper was Derek's friend Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden). The Daily Record labelled this storyline one of [...] "Coronation Street's Classic Comic Moments" [...] in 2008.|$|R
