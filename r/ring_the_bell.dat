5|$|Wetheral Priory Gatehouse was {{probably}} {{built in the}} 15th century and formed {{the entrance to the}} priory's outer courtyard. Wetheral Priory was a small Benedictine institution, founded by Ranulf le Meschin following the Norman invasion of Cumbria {{at the beginning of the}} 12th century. The motherhouse of the priory was St Mary's Abbey in York. The priory was known for a special right of sanctuary for criminals that had been granted to it by Henry I, allowing the priory to shelter felons who could reach the church and <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> there.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 3 {{begins on}} September 27, 1998, 24 hours {{prior to the}} events of Resident Evil 2. Jill Valentine, a former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member, {{attempts}} to escape from Raccoon City. Nearly all of Raccoon City's citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. On her way to the Raccoon City Police Department, Jill runs into fellow team member Brad Vickers, who is killed by a new enemy. This creature, named Nemesis, is a bio-organic weapon programmed to target surviving S.T.A.R.S. members, witnesses of Umbrella's experiments. As she evades Nemesis, Jill encounters three surviving members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.): Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef. Nicholai explains to Jill and Carlos that a rescue helicopter can be contacted if they manage to reach the city's Clock Tower and <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b>|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} for the WWE Championship between Champion John Cena and CM Punk. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon had {{threatened}} to have Cena fired if Punk won. During the match, two separate signature Attitude Adjustment moves by Cena failed to score the victory. More than 30 minutes into the match, Punk performed his Go to Sleep maneuver, striking Cena's ribs and causing Cena {{to fall out of}} the ring. As Punk rolled Cena back into the ring, McMahon and John Laurinaitis emerged from backstage and distracted Punk, resulting in Cena placing Punk in the STF submission hold. Punk did not submit, but McMahon signaled the referee to award Cena the match and sent Laurinaitis to <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> This was reminiscent of the Montreal Screwjob in 1997, where a conspiracy orchestrated by McMahon led to Bret Hart losing his WWF Championship to Shawn Michaels by submission despite Hart never submitting.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack in the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys had been invited to <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Chapel Bell {{has served}} as an {{athletic}} tradition at the University of Georgia. The ringing of the Chapel Bell after a Georgia victory is a tradition that has endured since the 1890s. In Georgia football's early days, the playing field was located only yards from the chapel, and first-year students were compelled to <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> until midnight in celebration of a Bulldog victory. Today, students, alumni, fans and townspeople still rush to the Chapel to <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> after a victory. The bell is also utilized for University meetings and events, weddings and remembrance ringing. The bell was rung in memory of victims of the September 11th attacks in 2001. After the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, the University of Georgia partook in a nationwide mourning by ringing the Chapel Bell {{in honor of the}} victims of the shooting.|$|E
25|$|It {{has become}} legendary that, every single {{morning of the}} long seven-year period between the College's closure in 1881 and reopening in 1888, President Ewell would arise and <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> calling {{students}} to class, so it could never be said that William and Mary had abandoned its mission to educate the young men of Virginia.|$|E

25|$|The North Star is a 5 foot high, 44 inches wide, 1576 lbs. bell {{acquired}} by 1642MTL {{as a goal}} and victory celebration. It was inaugurated on October 25, 2015 by Montreal mayor Denis Coderre where it was rung twice in a Montreal Impact victory against Toronto FC.

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of Engine 819's {{new home in}} 1965, Mayor Austin Franks shared {{one of the two}} keys to the gate with long-time railfan James Norris. Norris' father had taken the locomotive out for her first run in 1943 and young James always remembered his late-father when he saw the engine. Despite being in his late 50s and in failing health, James Norris faithfully visited the locomotive every week to knock off the bird nests and occasionally replace some broken glass in the cab. He would open the gate on Sundays while he was there to let kids climb on the locomotive, <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> and answer their many questions.|$|E
25|$|A common sight {{today is}} the highly publicized events in which a celebrity or {{executive}} from a corporation stands behind the NYSE podium and pushes the button that signals the bells to ring. Many consider the act of ringing the bells to be quite an honor and a symbol of a lifetime of achievement. Furthermore, due {{to the amount of}} coverage that the opening/closing bells receive, many companies coordinate new product launches and other marketing-related events to start on the same day as when the company's representatives <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> This daily tradition wasn't always this highly publicized either. In fact, it was only in 1995 that the NYSE began having special guests ring the bells on a regular basis. Prior to that, ringing the bells was usually the responsibility of the exchange's floor managers.|$|E

25|$|The New Inn {{situated}} about 100 metres to {{the east}} of the Corinthian Arch. Built in 1717 specifically to provide accommodation for visitors to the gardens, the red brick Inn included a mini brewery where barley was brewed into beer, a farm and dairy. The Inn closed in the 1850s, it then being used as a farm, smithy and kennels for deer hounds. The building was purchased in a ruinous condition by the National Trust in 2005. In 2010 work started on converting it into the new visitor centre, and since 2011 this has been the entrance for visitors to the gardens. They formerly used The Oxford Gates. The New Inn is linked by the Bell Gate Drive to the Bell Gate next {{to the east}}ern Lake Pavilion, so called because visitors had to <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> by the gate to gain admittance to the Garden.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the people}} who <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> are {{business}} executives whose companies trade on the exchange. However, there have also been many famous people from outside the world of business that have rung the bell. Athletes such as Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees and Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps, entertainers such as rapper Snoop Dogg, singer and actress Liza Minnelli and members of the band Kiss, and politicians such as Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani and President of South Africa Nelson Mandela have all had the honor of ringing the bell. Two United Nations Secretaries General have also rung the bell. On April 27, 2006, Secretary-General Kofi Annan rang the opening bell to launch the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment. On July 24, 2013, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon rang the closing bell to celebrate the NYSE joining the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative.|$|E
25|$|Many years later, a 12-year-old Digory Kirke and {{his friend}} Polly Plummer arrive {{in the ruins of}} Charn through Digory's uncle's magic. The {{children}} find the bell that Jadis left to break the spell. Despite Polly's warning not to <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> Digory does so. Jadis is awakened and by holding on to them is transported with them back to London in the year 1900. She initially aims to conquer the world to which she is transported, but finds that her magic does not work there. Digory, seeking to correct his mistake, attempts to transport her back to Charn, but they end up instead in the world of Narnia at the moment of its creation by the lion Aslan. As Aslan approaches, she attacks him with the rod of iron she has torn by main strength from a London lamp post; but when this has no effect, she flees.|$|E

25|$|As on-air WCW President, Flair began abusing {{his power}} much like Bischoff had, favoring villains over fan {{favorites}} and even awarding the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship (which was vacated by Scott Steiner due to injury) {{to his son}} David and resorting to whatever means necessary to keep him as United States Heavyweight Champion. Flair eventually formed a stable of followers which included Roddy Piper, Arn Anderson and the Jersey Triad to keep things in order. Flair's reign as president {{came to an end}} on the July 19 episode of Nitro, when he faced and lost to Sting for the position. During the course of the match, Sting had Flair in his Scorpion Death Lock, but with the referee knocked unconscious, no decision could be reached. A returning Eric Bischoff came to the ring and began ordering the timekeeper to <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> which he eventually did, awarding the match and the presidency to Sting (who promptly gave it up upon receiving it).|$|E
25|$|Next was a Last Man Standing {{match between}} Kane and Shane McMahon. Before the match began, McMahon {{attacked}} Kane, {{who was doing}} his entrance, with a steel chair. As the referee officially called to <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> to start the match, Kane pushed McMahon away to block another chair shot. After multiple shots with the chair, McMahon targeted Kane's knee using the ring post. Later, Kane attempted to perform a big boot on McMahon, but he accidentally hit the referee. After back and forth action, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver onto the steel steps on McMahon but McMahon countered into a bulldog and performed a Coast-to-Coast into the steel steps, which were positioned against Kane. In the end, McMahon attempted a Leap of Faith, {{from the top of}} the arena TitanTron, which was roughly 25 feet tall. but Kane moved and McMahon fell through the floor. Kane won the match when McMahon did not stand up in time to answer the referee's 10 count.|$|E
500|$|A {{great part}} of the modern image of the bell as {{a relic of the}} {{proclamation}} of American independence was forged by writer George Lippard. On January 2, 1847, his story [...] "Fourth of July, 1776" [...] appeared in Saturday Review magazine. The short story depicted an aged bellman on July 4, 1776, sitting morosely by the bell, fearing that Congress would not have the courage to declare independence. At the most dramatic moment, a young boy appears with instructions for the old man: to <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> The story was widely reprinted and closely linked the Liberty Bell to the Declaration of Independence in the public mind. The elements of the story were reprinted in early historian Benson J. Lossing's The Pictorial Field Guide to the Revolution (published in 1850) as historical fact, and the tale was widely repeated for generations after in school primers.|$|E

500|$|Snake Rattle 'n' Roll {{features}} two snakes – Rattle and Roll – as {{they make}} their way through 11 [...] isometric levels. The object in each level is to eat enough [...] "Nibbley Pibbleys" [...] – small round creatures found throughout each level – to gain enough weight to ring a bell on top of a weighing machine located {{at the end of the}} level; this causes a door for the next level to open. Players maneuver their snakes throughout the level with the control pad and are able to pick up Nibbley Pibbleys by pressing the B button on the controller. The snakes' lengths increase when they eat; players' snake length grows more quickly when they eat Nibbley Pibbleys of their own color, and they grow the most when they eat yellow ones. Located in each level are dispensers which randomly spew out Nibbley Pibbleys; however, they also spew out bombs which can damage the snakes. When a snake reaches a long enough length, the tail begins to flash, which means the snake is heavy enough to exit that level. [...] At that point, they must find and jump on the scale in order to <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> and open the exit door.|$|E
2500|$|The ferry {{operates}} from 0800 on weekdays, 0900 on Saturdays, and 1000 on Sundays. Service finishes at 1730 on all days.
