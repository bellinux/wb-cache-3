5000|$|The Birdy uses 18 inch (355mm ETRTO) wheels. This {{allows for}} a compact folded size but makes finding <b>replacement</b> <b>wheels,</b> tubes and tires more difficult.|$|E
50|$|The {{streetcar}} {{version of}} the PCC trucks had 26 in resilient wheels, instead of the 28 in solid wheels intended for rapid transit use, and restricted speed to 50 mph. The slower speed was adequate for most CTA needs. <b>Replacement</b> <b>wheels</b> were solid, but remained at 26 in.|$|E
50|$|Garth Tander pitted on lap 20 {{after the}} wheel nut {{fell off the}} front left wheel. The hub was damaged {{returned}} to the pits and a <b>replacement</b> <b>wheel</b> {{was not able to}} be fitted successfully and his car was pushed into the garage to attempt a repair.|$|R
50|$|Special {{machinery}} and training {{is required to}} service the PAX tires. Michelin was confident enough in its service network that it guaranteed a replacement within 12 hours, if the Michelin dealer could not repair the original tire, or did not stock the replacement. Michelin also worked with Honda (for the Odyssey minivan) and Acura (for the RL luxury sedan) to ensure each dealer carried {{a full set of}} <b>replacements</b> <b>wheel</b> tire combinations in inventory. However, Canadian models of Odyssey did not offer PAX tires.|$|R
50|$|Fifteen cars (in {{three rows}} of five) go nowhere and {{nobody seems to}} care, Señor Gelato accidentally drives his ice-cream {{tricycle}} into a three-legged table that Mama had told Juan and Pedro to take in to Señor Chipito for repairing (and {{they have to get}} a <b>replacement</b> <b>wheel</b> with fifteen spokes, but Juan initially thinks that it has more as he cannot tell which one he had started counting from), and Scrap and Glimmer are playing marbles in the lounge of the Dolls' House (but Glimmer is losing, rather badly, and his ten red marbles go missing).|$|R
5000|$|Mercury {{was known}} for many {{different}} color combinations for its models whereas a company like Corgi may have had only two at the most. For example, the 1:43 scale Fiat 600 Multipla was issued in at least 13 different two-tone combinations (Spano 2015). The company also made several gift sets, like the [...] "Squadra Corse Ferrari" [...] set with a 250LM and four different colored 330P roadsters. The set came with several <b>replacement</b> <b>wheels</b> for the Ferraris (Ralston 2009, 66).|$|E
50|$|Replacing {{the wheels}} {{on a car}} with larger ones, {{normally}} for a perceived improvement in appearance, also involves using tires with a reduced profile number (often as low as 35%) to keep the overall rolling radius within a few per cent of the original tire. If this is not done, gearing and speedometer accuracy are affected. All other things being equal, larger <b>replacement</b> <b>wheels</b> give a harsher ride because of the shorter and stiffer tire sidewall, in exchange for better handling and higher cornering limits due to the lower sidewall flex. In contrast, a car designed to have large wheels from the outset may have a more normal tire profile and gives a smoother ride due to the larger rolling radius of the tire.|$|E
50|$|Constructed in brick on a gritstone {{with stone}} quoins and window dressings, the {{original}} 21 bay 5 storey building was 43.8 metres long and 8.4 metres wide. The staircase and ancillary services {{were in a}} central projection leaving production floors uncluttered, This was an important advance in mill architecture. The mill was powered by a single waterwheel which, by 1801, {{had been replaced by}} two, a system which continued (with <b>replacement</b> <b>wheels</b> by Wren and Bennet in 1847) until turbines were installed in 1928. In its original form, the mill was built with a high parapet which concealed a low pitch roof but probably {{at the same time as}} the second wheel was added c. 1800, the roof was raised, as a result of which the mill acquired a usable sixth storey.|$|E
50|$|Garcia {{competed in}} {{wheelchair}} basketball at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. It {{was the first}} time the Spanish national team had qualified for the Paralympics in 16 years. In London, he was coached by Oscar Trigo. His team finished fifth overall. He played in the opening game against Italy, which his team won. When Rafael Muino Gamez broke his wheel in the game against Italy, Garcia brought him a <b>replacement</b> <b>wheel.</b> In London, he made one 3 pointer. He was a member of the national team at the 2013 European Championships. His team finished with a bronze medal after defeating Sweden.|$|R
50|$|The Tour became duller after Heusghem and Scieur {{settled into}} a sullen truce but it wasn't without incident. Scieur broke 11 spokes on the last but one stage, from Metz to Dunkirk and again fell foul of Desgrange's rules. He {{managed to get a}} <b>replacement</b> <b>wheel</b> but new rules for that year's Tour said he didn't have the right to use it unless he could show Desgrange's judges that the {{original}} was beyond use. No judge saw the incident and so Scieur carried the broken wheel on his back for 300 km to the finish. He said it left a mark on his back for 15 years.|$|R
500|$|A week later, Simpson rode in Paris–Roubaix in {{the hope}} of bettering his {{previous}} year's ninth place. As the race reached the paved section he went on a solo attack, at which point he was told that [...] rider Raymond Poulidor was chasing him down. Simpson increased his speed, catching the publicity and press vehicles ahead (known as the caravane). A press car swerved to avoid a pothole; this forced him into a roadside ditch. Simpson fell, damaging his front wheel and injuring his knee. He found his team car and collected a <b>replacement</b> <b>wheel,</b> but by then the front of the race had passed. Back in the race he crashed twice more, finishing 88th.|$|R

2500|$|The {{qualifying}} race to set {{the grid}} order for the main race started at 13:20 Macau Standard Time (...) [...] Weather conditions {{at the start of}} the qualifying race were dry and sunny with an air temperature of [...] and a track temperature at [...] Kobayashi failed to take the start because he stalled in his starting position. On the grid, pole position starter Jarvis made a good getaway but Asmer—despite initial fears his clutch would slip out of his grip—acclerated quicker off the line and moved into the lead heading towards Mandarin Bend. Further back, separate crashes involving multiple cars prompted the deployment of the safety car. Mortara was slow to get going and then made contact with Buemi at Lisboa corner and Tsukakoshi was caught up in the melee. Tsukakoshi survived the impact and rejoined the race but Grosjean picked up a puncture and this caused Senna to swerve in avoidance. Grosjean was able to drive slowly to pit lane for a <b>replacement</b> <b>wheel</b> but consequently went one lap down on Asmer. The incident enabled to Bird to gain ten positions to run in fifth and Oshima was now running in sixth but Guerrieri's race ended early when he crashed as well. Lou Meng and Kit Meng went into the pit lane for debris removal and a replacement front wing respectively.|$|R
50|$|Ricciardo {{caught up}} to Magnussen while Hülkenberg took {{advantage}} of Bottas to overtake the driver for seventh position shortly afterwards. Ricciardo moved {{to the outside of}} Magnuseen on the backstraight and passed him after the McLaren slid while defending eleventh place on lap eleven. Pérez attacked Massa going into the fourth turn and overtook him for third place on the next lap through turns five and six. Massa attempted to reclaim the position driving into the turn seven hairpin, but locked his tyres and temporarily bowed out of the battle. Both Williams cars - as well as both Ferrari drivers - had to change from a two-stop to a three-stop strategy as a result of high tyre wear. Magnussen also converted to a three-stop as a result of high tyre wear, but teammate Button was able to conserve his tyres well enough to continue with the two-stop. Sutil and Bianchi twice impacted each other at the first turn with the second collision causing the Sauber driver to stop at the corner with a puncture, and debris was littered on the track. Bianchi's right-rear tyre was punctured and he went to the pit lane for a <b>replacement</b> <b>wheel,</b> but his car's floor was damaged, causing a loss in downforce which meant he had difficulty driving his car {{for the remainder of the}} race.|$|R
50|$|In a {{field test}} {{starting}} in 2004, the trains on the connection from the brown coal strip mine near Wählitz to the Schkopau Power Station were equipped with C-AKv-couplers {{which showed that}} regular <b>wheel</b> <b>replacements</b> shrunk below a third due to reduced wear. The solution has been kept and it spawned further investigations.|$|R

5000|$|The Parisienne still sold {{well when}} GM decided {{to drop the}} line after the 1986 model year with no <b>replacement.</b> A front <b>wheel</b> drive model with the Bonneville name had similar {{dimensions}} versus the 1982 mid-size model, classifying the car as a full-size by the EPA; however, the wagon model (known just as [...] "Safari") continued until 1989.|$|R
5|$|While {{coming across}} the Piquet and Rossiter battle Lotterer moved in front of {{teammate}} Jarvis to claim second place. Rusinov entered the pit lane from the LMP2 lead for left-rear bodywork repairs and Rast was handed the No. 26 Oreca. Piquet was able to pass Rossiter for eighth position overall while Turner moved ahead of the other Ford car to run in third in LMGTE Pro. The second round of pit stops began one minute later when Jarvis entered the pit lane and {{the remainder of the}} LMP1 field followed in response for driver changes. Benoît Tréluyer pushed hard and lost control of his car's back-end at Vale corner, allowing Jani to move into second position. Christensen's right-front tyre was punctured at Becketts corner and he made a pit stop for a <b>replacement</b> <b>wheel</b> which promoted Turner to second in the class. After changing drivers in the No. 42 Strakka Racing Gibson, Danny Watts overtook González at Brooklands corner for second position in LMP2. Hartley went to the outside of Wainwright driving through Farm Curve and his car's right-front quarter made contact with Wainwright's left-rear section. Hartley went over the bonnet of the No. 86 Porsche but avoided flipping over; both cars went off the track, skidding across the gravel trap, and into the barriers {{at the end of the}} Complex. Both Hartley and Wainwright retired from the event and a full course yellow flag was necessitated to allow the cars to be extracted from the track.|$|R
50|$|The Speedcrane in 1925 was a steam-driven, 15-ton {{capacity}} crane {{that sat}} on four wheels. Ten models were built by Manitowoc from this basic model. Eventually, after listening to customer feedback, Moore redesigned the crane and installed a gasoline engine. Another major change was the <b>replacement</b> of the <b>wheels</b> with a crawler base that allowed for better traction. The first model from the redesigned Speedcrane was a Model 100.|$|R
2500|$|In 1929, Andrew Kucher of Ford began {{experimenting with}} the [...] "Levapad" [...] concept, metal disks with {{pressurized}} air blown {{through a hole}} in the center. Levapads do not offer stability on their own. Several must be used together to support a load above them. Lacking a skirt, the pads had to remain very close to the running surface. He initially imagined these being used in place of casters and wheels in factories and warehouses, where the concrete floors offered the smoothness required for operation. By the 1950s, Ford showed a number of toy models of cars using the system, but mainly proposed its use as a <b>replacement</b> for <b>wheels</b> on trains, with the Levapads running close to the surface of existing rails.|$|R
50|$|The Klann linkage is a planar {{mechanism}} {{designed to}} simulate the gait of legged animal and function as a <b>wheel</b> <b>replacement.</b> The linkage consists of the frame, a crank, two grounded rockers, and two couplers all connected by pivot joints. It was developed by Joe Klann in 1994 as an expansion of Burmester curves which are used to develop four-bar double-rocker linkages such as harbor crane booms. It is categorized as a modified Stephenson type III kinematic chain.|$|R
50|$|The look of {{the truck}} is {{different}} due to a new, custom-built superstructure, which is fixed on the front structure of the safety arc and the rear structure. The roof construction is made of steel tubes and covered by a fabric, whereas the panels are made of tin and openable upwards. The mounting of spare wheels is totally different {{at the rear of}} the truck in a perpendicular position. Their position creates more ease for the race crew when a <b>wheel</b> <b>replacement</b> is necessary.|$|R
50|$|The {{hull of the}} Mk F3 is of {{all-welded}} steel armour measuring 10 to 20 mm, {{providing the}} two occupants with protection from small arms fire and shell splinters. The layout is conventional, with the driver's compartment at the front on the left, engine compartment {{to the right and}} the 155 mm gun above at the rear. A splashboard is mounted {{at the front of the}} hull to stop water from rushing up the glacis plate when the vehicle is fording streams. A <b>replacement</b> road <b>wheel</b> is often carried on the glacis plate. The driver has a single-piece hatch that opens to the left, and is provided with three daylight periscopes, the centre one of which is replaceable by an image intensification (or thermal) periscope for night driving. The commander is seated behind the driver and has a two-piece hatch that opens to either side. The commander is also provided with three daylight periscopes.|$|R
50|$|The R-17 was an {{improved}} {{version of the}} R-11. It could carry nuclear, chemical, conventional or fragmentation weapons. At first, the Scud-B was carried on a tracked transporter erector launcher (TEL) {{similar to that of}} the Scud-A, designated 2P19, but this was not successful and a <b>wheeled</b> <b>replacement</b> was designed by the Titan Central Design Bureau, becoming operational in 1967. The new MAZ-543 vehicle was officially designated 9P117 Uragan. The launch sequence could be conducted autonomously, but was usually directed from a separate command vehicle. The missile is raised to a vertical position by means of hydraulically powered cranes, which usually takes four minutes, while the total sequence lasts about one hour.|$|R

UH’s participation in IRIS is to provide an infrared camera, and QUIRC has been deemed adequate for the job after some modification and refurbishment. Herein, I discuss the refurbishments and modifications made to QUIRC from May to August of 2007 to prepare it for its new environment and imaging purposes on IRIS. Modifications include <b>replacement</b> of filter <b>wheel</b> electronics, programming of a new filter wheel controller, redesign of the cooling system, and additional thermal and electrical insulation of the detector. 1...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{not until}} 1930, after the <b>replacement</b> of {{artillery}} <b>wheels</b> by spoke wheels that the distinctive radiator shape first used on the 6-cylinder models in 1906 was finally abandoned. In 1930, before {{the worst of the}} Depression, the Big Nine was introduced which together with the 6-cylinder Ensign and Envoy constituted the complete range. [...] Here standardisation was taken a step further with the bodies on 9 hp four-cylinder and 15 hp six-cylinder being almost indistinguishable except for bonnet length. The Big Nine was soon followed by the Big Twelve and sales for the second six months of 1931 exceeded those of the whole of the previous year. In 1932 there was a Royal visit to the Canley works by the Duke of Gloucester who came to open the Canley Pavilion outside which he took delivery of a new 6-cylinder model.|$|R
50|$|The PXL-2000 {{has several}} weak points. The most common fault is a decayed drive belt, common to most tape {{mechanisms}} of the 1980s, and fogged blue filters. The blue filter is a glass optical component that is fitted behind the lens to prevent infrared light {{from reaching the}} CCD and producing miscoloured images. They tend to become fogged in stored PXLs, possibly {{as a result of}} outgassing from the plastic components of the camera. This issue can be fixed by disassembling the camera, removing the blue filter, and cleaning it with a window cleaning solution like Windex. Many PXL-2000 cameras have also suffered damage from leaking electrolyte from old batteries, but this is usually not serious and can be easily repaired. Cameras left with tapes inserted {{for long periods of time}} may also need the tape path to be cleaned and a pinch <b>wheel</b> <b>replacement.</b>|$|R
500|$|In the {{original}} 1876 production, the Rhinemaidens were wheeled around on stands behind semi-transparent screens. The stage machinery and the lighting effects {{were designed by}} Carl Brandt, who was the foremost stage technician of the time. One innovation which Cosima did eventually approve was the <b>replacement</b> of the <b>wheeled</b> stands with giant, invisible [...] "fishing rods" [...] on which the Rhinemaidens were dangled. Wires continued {{to be used in}} the Bayreuth productions of Siegfried Wagner and, later, those of his widow Winifred, who ran the Bayreuth Festival until the end of the Second World War. Similar techniques have been used in more modern productions. In the 1996 Lyric Opera of Chicago Ring cycle, repeated in 2004–05, the Rhinemaidens were suspended on bungee cords anchored in the fly space above the stage, enabling them to dive up and down, as intended by Wagner. The Rhinemaidens were played on-stage by gymnasts, mouthing words sung by singers standing in a corner of the stage.|$|R
5000|$|The classic farm tractor is {{a simple}} open vehicle, with two very large driving wheels on an axle below and {{slightly}} behind a single seat (the seat and steering wheel consequently are in the center), and the engine {{in front of the}} driver, with two steerable wheels below the engine compartment. This basic design has remained unchanged for a number of years, but enclosed cabs are fitted on almost all modern models, for reasons of operator safety and comfort. In some localities with heavy or wet soils, notably in the Central Valley of California, the [...] "Caterpillar" [...] or [...] "crawler" [...] type of tracked tractor became popular in the 1930s, due to superior traction and flotation. These were usually maneuvered through the use of turning brake pedals and separate track clutches operated by levers rather than a steering wheel.Four-wheel drive tractors began to appear in the 1960s. Some four-wheel drive tractors have the standard [...] "two large, two small" [...] configuration typical of smaller tractors, while some have four large, powered wheels. The larger tractors are typically an articulated, center-hinged design steered by hydraulic cylinders that move the forward power unit while the trailing unit is not steered separately.In the early 21st century, articulated or nonarticulated, steerable multitrack tractors have largely supplanted the Caterpillar type for farm use. Larger types of modern farm tractors include articulated four-wheel or eight-wheel drive units with one or two power units which are hinged in the middle and steered by hydraulic clutches or pumps. A relatively recent development is the <b>replacement</b> of <b>wheels</b> or steel crawler-type tracks with flexible, steel-reinforced rubber tracks, usually powered by hydrostatic or completely hydraulic driving mechanisms. The configuration of these tractors bears little resemblance to the classic farm tractor design.|$|R
