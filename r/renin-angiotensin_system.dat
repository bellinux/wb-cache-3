They have heightened activity of sympathetic and <b>renin–angiotensin</b> <b>systems.</b> We tested the hypothesis that blockade of sympathetic and <b>renin–angiotensin</b> <b>systems</b> in these patients may offer a survival benefit using a large cohort of patients with long-term follow up. Methods and Results-—Medical records of 321 consecutive patients from our institution who had received renal transplantation between 1995 and 2003 were abstracted. Survival was analyzed as a function of pharmacological therapies adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. The characteristics of the 321 patients were as follows: age at transplant, 4413 years; 40 % male; 89 % with hypertension; 36 % with diabetes, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 60 %. Over a follow-up of 104 years, there were 119 deaths. Adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, use of a beta-blocker therapy (P= 0. 04) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or receptor blocker (P= 0. 03) was associated with better survival. This treatment effect was seen across all major clinical subgroups and was supported by propensity score analysis. The propensity score–adjusted 10 -year survival was 95 % in those taking both groups of medications, 72 % in those taking either of them, and 64 % in those taking neither (P= 0. 004). Conclusions-—Use of beta-blocker and angiotensin blocking therapies is associated with higher survival after renal transplantation, indicating their potential protective role in this high-risk population.

40|$|There {{have been}} only a few reports on the sympathoadrenal and <b>renin-angiotensin</b> <b>systems</b> in {{children}} of small gestational age. {{the purpose of the}} present study was to investigate plasma levels of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) activity, angiotensin and catecholamines in 8 - to 13 -year-old children and to determine whether there are correlations between the components of these systems with both birthweight and BP (blood pressure) levels. This clinical study included 66 children (35 boys and 31 girls) in two groups: those born at term with an appropriate birthweight [AGA (appropriate-for-gestational age) group, n = 31] and those born at term but with a small birthweight for gestational age [SGA (small-for-gestational age) group, n = 35]. Concentrations of angiotensin, catecholamines and ACE activity were determined in plasma. Circulating noradrenaline levels were significantly elevated in SGA girls compared with AGA girls (P = 0. 036). in addition, angiotensin 11 and ACE activity were higher in SGA boys (P = 0. 024 and P = 0. 050 respectively). There was a significant association of the circulating levels of both angiotensin 11 and ACE activity with BP levels in our study population. Although the underlying mechanisms that link restricted fetal growth with later cardiovascular events are not fully understood, the findings in the present study support the link between low birthweight and overactivity of both sympathoadrenal and <b>renin-angiotensin</b> <b>systems</b> into later childhood.

30|$|Hydralazine is {{a direct}} {{arterial}} vasodilator without significant effects on the venous system. Its mechanisms of action are complex and involve inhibition of calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, either by cell membrane hyperpolarization or by induction of cGMP [31, 32]. Hydralazine increases heart rate and has a slight positive inotropic effect. Hydralazine is indicated for severe hypertension associated with increased SVR, especially {{in the presence of}} bradycardia. However, hydralazine causes a reflex increase in sympathetic tone and can worsen myocardial oxygen consumption, so should be used with caution in patients with known heart disease (e.g., heart failure, coronary artery disease, or valvular dysfunction).

25|$|Although {{the kidney}} cannot {{directly}} sense blood, long-term regulation of blood pressure predominantly {{depends upon the}} kidney.

Renin {{is the first in}} a series of important chemical messengers that make up the <b>renin-angiotensin</b> <b>system.</b> Changes in renin ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone. Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney's absorption of sodium chloride, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment and raising blood pressure. When renin levels are elevated, the concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.|$|E
