5000|$|Deck tennis is a {{sport that}} was played on the decks of {{passenger}} and cruise ships and is still practiced to a small extent. The sport is a hybrid between tennis and quoits, and is played with either the rubber disk or ring, or a similarly-sized <b>rope</b> <b>ring.</b> The sport has been standardized and formalized in several countries under names such as [...] "tennikoit" [...] or [...] "ring tennis".|$|E
5000|$|As they {{cruise the}} Mediterranean, Fred's sea-sickness keeps him in bed. During this time, Emily begins a {{relationship}} with a Commander Gordon (Percy Marmont), a dapper, popular bachelor. Finally feeling well enough to appear on deck, Fred is immediately smitten with a German [...] "princess" [...] (Betty Amann), who hits him in the eye with the <b>rope</b> <b>ring</b> used to play deck tennis (a combination of tennis and quoits which was at the time widely played shipboard). Both begin spending their time on board with their new paramours to the virtual exclusion of each other, and each plans to dissolve the marriage. In Colombo, the couple accidentally and awkwardly end up next to each other in a rickshaw.|$|E
50|$|Reward Challenge: The {{challenge}} {{was composed of}} 3 legs. At the first leg, from the shore, castaways would run to a mudpit, where they would find their own paddle, corresponding their tribe color. Then, {{they would go to}} the second leg. There, they would tie a basket at their waist level at their back. Using their paddle and hands, they would find three rope rings in their designated sandpile corresponding their tribe color. Once they found one, they would shoot it at their basket using the paddle. One member from each tribe who finds the three rope rings first would advance to the last leg. At the last leg, from their tribe mat, they would shoot each <b>rope</b> <b>ring</b> to a pole with hoops for each ring. Whoever shot all the rope rings first wins reward for their tribe.|$|E

50|$|Day 13: Stef {{finally came}} back {{after she was}} cured of the cobra's bite. Bulan practiced their {{throwing}} after they read the treemail that said throwing {{would be part of}} the reward challenge. At the Reward Challenge, Arnold was the first to find a <b>rope</b> <b>ring</b> and it progressed as he found all the three rope rings, that made Tala's third consecutive win. It lead him at getting an immunity bracelet. Then, Richard called Jon Hall and Akihiro Sato and asked Tala who they {{want to be part of}} their tribe. Tala chose Jon Hall as he was considered the biggest threat of the previous season while Akihiro Sato, last season's Celebrity Sole Survivor, went to Bulan. For the Temptation Reward, Arnold volunteered to go and declined the money to strengthen the tribe's trust to him. As a reward, Tala enjoyed their fresh shower and hot coffees. Back to their camps, Akihiro and Jon taught their tribemates how to improve their shelters and gave some advice about playing the game.|$|E
50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single <b>rope</b> <b>ring</b> discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|E
40|$|An {{inertial}} {{energy storage}} device is disclosed which uses flywheel made of flexible material {{such as a}} twisted <b>rope</b> <b>ring.</b> A small number of the strands of the <b>rope</b> <b>ring</b> have a tensile strength that is {{lower than that of}} most of the other strands so that should any of these strands fail, they will begin to whiplash allowing such a failure to be detected and braked before a castastrophic failure occurs. This accomplished by the inclusion of glass tubes located around the periphery of the flywheel. The tubes are in communication with a braking fluid reservoir. The flywheel and glass tubes are enclosed within a vacuum-tight housing. The whiplashing of a broken strand breaks one or more glass tubes. This causes the housing to be flooded with the braking fluid thereby braking the rotation of the flywheel...|$|E

5000|$|The {{choice of}} cage or ring {{is more than}} {{aesthetic}} however, as it impacts the type of strategies that a fighter can implement. For example, a popular and effective strategy in a cage is to pin an opponent into {{the area where the}} fence meets the mat, and then pummel him with strikes. Randy Couture is well known for this tactic. Defensively, the cage is often used as support to fend off take-down attempts, or as a support to get from underneath and opponent (known as [...] "walking up the cage"). These positions are not possible in a <b>roped</b> <b>ring.</b> On the other hand, the <b>roped</b> <b>ring</b> can result in entangled limbs and fighters falling through the ropes, requiring the referee to sometimes stop the fight and reposition the fighters in the center, as well as carrying the possibility for either fighter to sustain an injury. In either a cage or ring, a fighter is not allowed to grab the fence or ropes. Some critics feel that the appearance of fighting in a cage contributes to a negative image of MMA in popular media.|$|R

50|$|Turnbuckles {{find common}} use to tension the ropes in {{professional}} wrestling rings and boxing rings, where {{they serve as}} the attachment between the <b>ring</b> <b>ropes</b> and <b>ring</b> posts. Rather than the usual bare metal, here the turnbuckles are covered with padding {{in order to protect}} participants and staff. Turnbuckles even play a part in professional wrestling where they are often dramatically used by participants as part of their offensive repertoire.|$|R

50|$|Springboarding {{involves}} a wrestler using {{any of the}} <b>ring</b> <b>ropes</b> to bounce upward.
