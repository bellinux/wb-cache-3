50|$|The {{states of}} Nevada and Ohio use <b>reference</b> <b>markers</b> {{very similar to}} California's postmile markers. Like California, these two states record mileages through {{individual}} counties in their respective route logs. Ohio's system is nearly identical to California's with its <b>reference</b> <b>markers</b> listing the route number, 3-letter county abbreviation, and mileage through the county. The Nevada system is also similar, utilizing 2-letter county abbreviations. However, Ohio uses standard mileposts in addition to <b>reference</b> <b>markers</b> on freeways, while Nevada uses standard mileposts in conjunction with postmile panels on Interstate highways only.|$|R

40|$|Objective: External {{radioactive}} <b>reference</b> <b>markers</b> {{have been}} used to localize the canthomeatal (CM) line and correct for head rotation in perfusion brain SPECT. This ensures that regardless of the subject’s head position or rotation under the SPECT camera, reconstructed transaxial slices are reori-ented parallel to the CM line. This study was undertaken to demonstrate the value of external radioactive <b>reference</b> <b>markers</b> in dopamine SPECT imaging. Methods: We compared visual and marker methods of reorienting the transaxial slices between dopamine and perfusion brain SPECT studies, respectively. These con-sisted of imaging normal controls and patients with Alzhei-mer’s or Parkinson’s disease using a triple-head camera. Intra- and interoperator variability of the visual and marker methods of reorientation was determined for both perfusio...|$|R
