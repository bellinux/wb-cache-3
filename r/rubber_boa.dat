5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include <b>rubber</b> <b>boa,</b> western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and <b>rubber</b> <b>boa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Only four {{species of}} {{reptiles}} are {{documented in the}} park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and <b>rubber</b> <b>boa,</b> {{as well as one}} lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000kcal/day.|$|E
50|$|Characteristics of <b>rubber</b> <b>boas</b> {{behavior}} {{also set}} {{them apart from}} other snakes. <b>Rubber</b> <b>boas</b> are {{considered one of the}} most docile of the boa species and are often used to help people overcome their fear of snakes. <b>Rubber</b> <b>boas</b> are known to never strike at or bite a human under any circumstances but will release a potent musk from their vent if they feel threatened. They are primarily nocturnal and likely crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk) which partially contributes to how rarely they are encountered. Because of the temperate regions they inhabit <b>rubber</b> <b>boas</b> hibernate during the winter months in underground dens.Hunting - <b>Rubber</b> <b>boas</b> primarily feed on young mammals such as shrews, voles, mice, etc. When nestling mammals are encountered they will try to consume the entire litter if possible and fend off the mother with their tail, this is why individuals will often have extensive scarring on their tails. <b>Rubber</b> <b>boas</b> have also been known to prey on snake eggs, lizard eggs, lizards, young birds, young bats, and there have even been instances of them eating other snakes.Predation - <b>Rubber</b> <b>boas</b> can be preyed upon by almost any reasonably sized predator in their habitat. When threatened, <b>rubber</b> <b>boas</b> will curl into a ball, bury their head inside, and expose their tail to mimic their head. While this is thought to be a primary defense technique against predators, it is doubtful that this behavior is effective in most cases being that many predators are too large (raptors, coyotes, raccoons, cats, etc.). In reality the best defense of <b>rubber</b> <b>boas</b> is their secretive nature.|$|R

There are four amphibians that live in or around Gerber Reservoir: the Pacific tree frog, Oregon spotted frog, western toad, and the long-toed salamander.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>boas</b> {{have been}} known to inhabit a wide variety of habitat types from grassland, meadows and {{chaparral}} to deciduous and conifer forests, to high alpine settings. They can be found at elevations anywhere from sea level to over 10000 ft. They are not as tolerant of higher temperatures as other snake species and cannot inhabit areas that are too hot and dry, but can live in areas that are surprisingly cold, especially for a snake. <b>Rubber</b> <b>boas</b> also spend a large amount of time under shelter (rocks, logs, leaf litter, burrows, etc.) and thus must live in habitats that can provide this, as well as adequate warmth, moisture, and prey. It is also thought that <b>rubber</b> <b>boas</b> maintain a relatively small home range as many individuals are often captured in the same vicinity year after year, although individuals may occasionally migrate due to competition, lack of prey, or other pressures.|$|R
5|$|The few {{amphibians}} {{present in}} the forest include the Rocky Mountain tailed frog, long-toed salamander, and Columbia spotted frog, which has been listed as a sensitive species. Common snakes include bullsnakes, garter snakes, and <b>rubber</b> <b>boas.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Meadow voles are an {{important}} prey for many hawks, owls, and mammalian carnivores, and they are also taken by some snakes. [...] Almost all species of raptors take microtine (Microtus spp.) rodents as prey. Birds not usually considered predators of mice do take voles; examples include gulls (Larus spp.), northern shrike (Larius borealis), black-billed magpie (Pica pica), common raven (Corvus corax), American crow (C. brachyrhynchos), great blue heron (Ardea herodias), and American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus). In Ohio, meadow voles comprised 90% of the individual prey remains in long-eared owl (Asio otus) pellets on a relict wet prairie, and in Wisconsin, meadow voles comprised 95% of short-eared owl (A. flammeus) prey. [...] Most mammalian predators take microtine prey. The American short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) is major predator; meadow voles avoid areas frequented by short-tailed shrews. [...] Other major mammalian predators include the badger (Taxidea taxus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), weasels (Mustela spp.), marten (Martes americana), and domestic cat (Felis catus). [...] Other animals reported to have ingested voles include trout (Salmo spp.), Pacific giant salamander (Dicampton ensatus), garter snake (Thamnophis spp.), yellow-bellied racer (Coluber constrictor flaviventris), gopher snake (Pituophis melanoleucas), rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis), and <b>rubber</b> <b>boa</b> (Charina bottae).|$|E
50|$|The family Boidae {{consists}} of the nonvenomous snakes commonly called boas and {{consists of}} 43 species. The genus Charina consists of two species, {{both of which are}} found in North America. Charina bottae is sometimes also known as the coastal <b>rubber</b> <b>boa</b> or the northern <b>rubber</b> <b>boa</b> and is {{not to be confused with}} the southern <b>rubber</b> <b>boa</b> (Charina umbratica). There is debate on whether the southern <b>rubber</b> <b>boa</b> should be a separate species or a subspecies (Charina bottae umbratica).

50|$|The <b>rubber</b> <b>boa</b> is a {{primitive}} snake compared to its much larger relatives native to Latin America, {{which include the}} boa constrictor, emerald tree boa, and green anaconda. The <b>rubber</b> <b>boa</b> has retained the club-like tail of its Erycine ancestors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>boas</b> are {{the most}} northerly of boa species. The {{distribution}} of <b>rubber</b> <b>boas</b> covers {{a large portion of}} the western United States, stretching from the Pacific Coast east to western Utah and Montana, as far south as the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains east of Los Angeles in California, and as far north as southern British Columbia. There have also been rare sightings in Colorado and Alberta in addition to the states/provinces that they are known to thrive in California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and extending to its northernmost range in British Columbia, this is also the highest latitude of any boa, that is to say the closest point to either pole for a boa.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>boas</b> are {{viviparous}} (give {{birth to}} live young) and can {{have up to}} 9 young per year, but many females will only reproduce every four years. Mating occurs shortly after reemergence from hibernation {{in the spring and}} young are born anywhere from August to November later that year.|$|R
5|$|There are few {{reptiles}} in the forest.
