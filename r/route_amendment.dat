Node's movement, specifically movement of central node (sink) in these networks cause to increase routing updating overhead and consequently to increase power consumption and decrease network life span. Directed Diffusion algorithm is one of methods in sensor network which is a data-oriented algorithm. One of {{the important}} definitions of basic algorithm is not supporting central node's movement. In case of movement of central node, data packs pass on unreliable rout toward central node. In fact, they pass a rout on which the central node is not present at the time being and it has moved to another place. Therefore, route of data is out of order {{and there is the}} need to build new routes. This problem causes to create lots of overhead and waste energy. In this article, it is tried to solve mentioned problem of central node's movement by learning automata. In suggested algorithm by learning automata a <b>route</b> <b>amendment</b> tree is built which prevents from creation of the whole route and its overhead...|$|E

5|$|The network {{expanded}} rapidly {{during the}} early decades of the 20th century; by 1944 its main routes were completed, with the addition of its newest line occurring as late as 2007. The pace of expansion fell sharply after the Second World War. In the late 1990s expansion resumed at a quicker pace, and four new lines were planned for the network. Despite this, the network's expansion has been largely exceeded by the transportation needs of the city and is said to be overcrowded. As of 2015, two modernisation plans have been presented: City of Buenos Aires law 670, proposing the creation of 3 new lines, F, G and I; and the PETERS plan, wherein 2 lines are created and the I line is postponed for future expansion, plus several other <b>route</b> <b>amendments.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} using datalink communication for convective weather reroutes in the National Airspace System. Flight trajectories from a day in 2006 were surveyed for weather avoidance re-routes, and those <b>route</b> <b>amendments</b> were assessed to determine the proportion that could be satisfied by existing Controller-Pilot Data Link Communication protocols {{and the number of}} datalink messages needed to satisfy the clearance issued. All 753 clearances could be described by a datalink message. The messages were grouped into four categories: deviation, heading, route clearance, and offset. Fifty-two percent of the weather avoidance maneuvers were satisfied by a deviation message. Deviation datalink messages are easy to load, send, and receive for both the controller and pilot. Some form of a heading message satisfied 25 % of the clearances, and 17 % could be described by a route clearance message. The remaining 6 % were satisfied by an offset. The results identify the specific datalink messages that should be considered in the development of weather avoidance automation. I...|$|R

40|$|The Tactical Separation-Assisted Flight Environment (TSAFE) is {{designed}} to alert air traffic controllers to imminent conflicts (predicted loss of separation within approximately 3 minutes). It generates constant-velocity (“dead-reckoning”) trajectory predictions similar to those generated by Conflict Alert, the legacy system that currently performs the tactical alerting function in theUnited States. UnlikeConflictAlert, however, it also generates predictions based on pilot intent as specified in the latest flight-plan route and assigned altitude. The intended route is not always known, however, because controllers sometimes neglect to enter <b>route</b> <b>amendments</b> into the host computer. Hence, both the constant-velocity predictions and the flight-plan-based predictions are checked for conflicts. To reduce false alerts, the time horizons of the two predicted routes are {{a function of the}} degree of conformance to the current flight-plan route. Alerting performance was tested using archived tracking data for 100 actual operational errors, and TSAFE was found to provide timely warnings significantly more consistently than ConflictAlert. When tested ona sample of general traffic data, TSAFEwas found to produce substantially fewer false alerts than Conflict Alert. I...|$|R

NASA and American Airlines (AA) are conducting an operational trial of DWR at the AA System Operations Center in Fort Worth, Texas. The trial includes only AA flights in Fort Worth Center airspace. Over the period from July 31, 2012 through October 31, 2012, 45 % of routes proposed by DWR and evaluated by AA users (air traffic control coordinators and flight dispatchers) were rated as acceptable as proposed or with some modifications. The wind-corrected potential flying time savings for these acceptable routes totaled 470 flying min. DWR identified reroutes offering an additional 4, 066 min of potential flying time savings for AA flights, but these routes were not evaluated due to staffing limitations. A sector congestion analysis shows that in only three out of 83 DWR routes rated acceptable by AA staff were the flights predicted to fly through a congested sector inside of 30 min downstream of present position. This shows that users considered sector congestion data provided by DWR automation and in nearly all cases did not accept routes through over-capacity sectors...|$|R

40|$|The Dynamic Weather Routes (DWR) tool is a {{ground-based}} trajectory automation system that continuously and automatically analyzes active in-flight aircraft in en route airspace to find simple modifications to flight plan routes {{that can save}} significant flying time, while avoiding weather and considering traffic conflicts, airspace sector congestion, special use airspace, and FAA routing restrictions. Trials of the DWR system have shown that significant delay savings are possible. However, some DWR advised routes are also rejected by dispatchers or modified before being accepted. Similarly, of those sent by dispatchers to flight crews as proposed route change requests, many are not accepted by air traffic control, or are modified before implementation as Center <b>route</b> <b>amendments.</b> Such actions suggest that the operational acceptability of DWR advised route corrections could be improved, which may reduce workload and increase delay savings. This paper analyzes the historical usage of different flight routings, varying from simple waypoint pairs to lengthy strings of waypoints incorporating jet routes, {{in order to improve}} DWR route acceptability. An approach is developed that can be incorporated into DWR, advising routings with high historical usage and savings potential {{similar to that of the}} nominal DWR advisory. It is hypothesized that modifying a nominal DWR routing to one that is commonly used, and nearby, will result in more actual savings since common routings are generally familiar and operationally acceptable to air traffic control. The approach allows routing segments with high historical usage to be concatenated to form routes that meet all DWR constraints. The relevance of a route's historical usage to its acceptance by dispatchers and air traffic control is quantified by analyzing historical DWR data. Results indicate that while historical usage may be less of a concern to flight dispatchers accepting or rejecting DWR advised route corrections, it may be important to air traffic control acceptance of DWR routes...|$|R

2500|$|According to {{constitutional}} theorist and scholar Lawrence G. Sager, {{some commentators}} have seriously questioned whether Article V is the exclusive means of amending the Constitution, or {{whether there are}} <b>routes</b> to <b>amendment,</b> including some <b>routes</b> in which the Constitution could be unconsciously or unwittingly amended {{in a period of}} sustained political activity {{on the part of a}} mobilized national constituency. For example, Akhil Amar argues that the Constitution may be constitutionally amended outside of Article V. He rejects the notion that Article V excludes other modes of constitutional change, arguing instead that the procedure provided for in Article V is simply the exclusive method the government may use to amend the Constitution. He asserts that Article V nowhere prevents the People themselves, acting apart from ordinary Government, from exercising their legal right to alter or abolish Government via the proper legal procedures. Bruce Ackerman argues that the Constitution can be amended by something he calls a [...] "structural amendment" [...] whereby the people alter their Constitutional order via succeeding elections. Similarly, Sanford Levinson believes that Constitutional amendments have been made outside of Article V and as such it is not exclusive.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} airline industry on the route between the U. S. and China by examining various issues including market liberalization, airline alliances, and airline mergers. The first chapter focuses on the liberalization in {{the airline industry}} between the U. S. and China. As a highly regulated industry, the airline industry has been of interest to policymakers who try to understand the impact and magnitude of airline market restrictions. The aviation agreement between the U. S. and China restricts the routes as well as the number of carriers and flights permitted on these <b>routes.</b> An <b>amendment</b> in 2007 allowed additional routes, and introduced new carriers to participate in these routes. This paper examines detailed transaction data on passenger aviation over a six-year period, and analyzes the impact of the sequential introduction of nonstop routes. In this paper, I also estimate a structural econometric model of demand and supply for air travel, which allows me to conduct counterfactual analysis. The second chapter studies alliances between carriers from the U. S. and China. As international airlines have expanded in recent decades, increasing demand for international air travel between the U. S. and China has prompted U. S. airlines to forge alliances with their overseas counterparts in China to extend the reach of their networks. An airline alliance is an agreement between two or more airlines to cooperate on a substantial level, including unlimited code-sharing between partners. Code-sharing is usually associated with changes in air fares and traffic volume for related routes. In theory, code-sharing should allow providers of complementary routes to set lower prices, and we can check for this in the data. This paper uses a five-year panel data {{to examine the effects of}} airline alliances on air fares and traffic volume in the U. S. -China market. The third chapter considers the relationship between mergers and code-sharing. Policymakers typically view the effect of code-sharing on prices as similar to that of mergers. This paper tests to see if that holds true in this context. In particular, this paper studies the impact of Delta and Northwest merger on their international routes between the U. S. and China. I estimate the price effect on the routes where Delta and Northwest previously code-shared with each other before they merged. I find that merger did not have much impact on price in the markets where Delta and Northwest previously code-shared...|$|R
