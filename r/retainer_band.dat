50|$|Anayama Nobutomo (1506 - January 1, 1561) was a Japanese samurai of the Sengoku period. He {{was the son}} of Anayama Nobutsuna. Nobutomo {{served the}} Takeda clan of Kai Province and held the title of Izu-no-kami (伊豆守), or Defender of Izu. He enjoyed special status in the Takeda <b>retainer</b> <b>band</b> due to his {{marriage}} to Takeda Nobutoras daughter. Nobutomo fought with distinction during the attack on Suwa Yorishige in 1542. After his death on New Years Day 1561, he was succeeded by his son Anayama Nobukimi.|$|E
40|$|The pin <b>retainer</b> <b>band</b> is a 1 - 1 / 4 in. wide {{by about}} 1 / 32 in. thick steel band that is {{stretched}} over the pins circumferentially {{at the joints}} of the solid rocket booster (SRB) motor case segments. Its purpose is to hold the retaining pins in place during flight. Since the band is thin and is mounted stretched, or under tension, over the pins which are greased in place, {{it is necessary to}} protect it thermally. Three typical areas of the band location on the SRB motor case joints were chosen for verifying the cork thermal prection system (TPS) performance on the band: the joint in front of the attach ring, at the aft skirt joint in front of the kick ring and in an unperturbed area at the forward segments of the SRB motor cases. The kick ring area pin <b>retainer</b> <b>band</b> cork TPS passed the test requirements in the region where there are no phenolic splice caps. In the splice cap areas where the band TPS is closed out around the splice with K 5 NA, additional amounts of K 5 NA material is required to adequately protect the steel band. TPS requirements were easily met in the one location where the ends of the steel band are joined together after installation and tensioning. The attack ring area pin <b>retainer</b> <b>band</b> TPS did not quite pass the heat load requirements with the. 375 in. thick cork TPS as used for the kick ring area band. It is recommended that the cork thickness here be increased to. 50 in. The unperturbed area band TPS presented no problems...|$|E

50|$|The {{function}} of a foreskin retainer {{is to keep the}} glans penis covered by the available foreskin. A foreskin retainer can be used when newly grown foreskin is neither long enough nor tight enough to keep the glans covered itself, but is long enough that it can be stretched past the glans (which is necessary to facilitate the use of a <b>retainer).</b> Rubber <b>bands,</b> o-rings, Band-Aids, and cones with both ends open can be used as retainers.|$|R

40|$|Redesigned field joint {{protection}} system installations were performed between 7 and 15 Nov 1989 at the Thiokol Corporation Static Test Bay T- 18. The {{purpose of the}} installations was to develop procedures for two field {{joint protection}} system redesign concepts (Concepts 1 and 3), and to evaluate the processing capability of each concept. The Concept 1 (Double Cork Band Design) configuration consists of two cork bands with K 5 NA ablation compound applied between them and to the bottom edge of the aft cork band. The Concept 3 (K 5 NA Design) configuration consists of a single layer of K 5 NA over the joint/heater/sensor/pin <b>retainer</b> <b>band</b> area...|$|E
40|$|This {{course is}} a {{continuation}} of DLA 1203, Chairside Assisting I. It will require the student to utilize basic chairside assisting skills and principles of four-handed sit-down dentistry, learned in DLA 1203, during dental procedures. Specialty procedures and instrumentation in the areas of restorative, prosthetic, orthodontic, pediatric dentistry, oral surgery, and endodontics will be introduced and practiced. Dental terminology and materials are integrated throughout this course and current OSHA and CDC guidelines for infection control and handling of hazardous materials will be followed. II. EXPECTED LEARNING OUTCOMES AND RELATED COMPETENCIES: Upon completion of the course, the student will be able to: 1. Demonstrate a basic understanding of restorative dentistry including the armamentarium necessary {{and the role of the}} dental assistant. 1. 1 Describe the classification of cavity forms. 1. 2 Distinguish between cavity walls, floors, and angles used in cavity preparation. 1. 3 Describe the steps of cavity preparation. 1. 4 Describe the placement requirements of common medications used under amalgam and composite restorative material. 1. 5 Identify the parts and describe and demonstrate the assembly and placement of a circumferential matrix <b>band,</b> <b>retainer,</b> and wedge. 1. 6 Identify and assemble the armamentarium and materials used in an amalgam and composite restorative procedure. 1. 7 Describe the function of the basic instruments used in the amalgam and composite restorative procedure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere is a thirteenth <b>retainer</b> in the <b>band</b> of thanes who {{eventually}} fail Beowulf {{in his last}} fight, and his enigmatic presence has often been noted {{as part of a}} possible allegorical reading of the episode as strongly allusive to Gethsemane and the betrayal of Christ. Yet {{it seems to me that}} this discreet and, as it were, intersticial character is functionally perhaps more rewarding to study than it may seem at first. His theft of a cup, which he unfortunately reinvests into the symbolic system of indebtedness, ultimately compells a particular reading of Beowulf's hamartia, and hence of his ultimate tragedy. The fault, or the tragic flaw, may therefore be pointed out to reside not so much exclusively in the character of the hero as an individual man, but rather in a more communal and societal dimension. I would like to approach the poem from that particular angle, which does not at all imply a cultural study of the context, but simply a particular analysis of the text itself. For my suggestion happens to be corroborated, I think, by a cursive survey of those elements of the poem which have sometimes been called digressive, and which are really those textual hinges, when the scop swerves off from a diegetic telling of his story (as for instance to mention the thirteenth retainer). Thematic and structural links may be brought to light by a diachronic reading, which make for what I consider like a performative depth and momentum of the poem...|$|R
