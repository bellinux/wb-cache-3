50|$|Ben Roethlisberger put up {{the most}} {{prolific}} numbers of his young career in his return from a knee injury, but he was ultimately out dueled by Carson Palmer. Roethlisberger outpassed his counterpart 386-227 and each threw three touchdowns, but his three interceptions were backbreakers. Ultimately, the Bengals simply made too many big plays, including a 94-yard kickoff <b>return</b> by <b>Tab</b> Perry, for the Steelers to keep pace.|$|R
5000|$|Examples of {{characters}} include letters, numerical digits, common punctuation marks (such as [...] "." [...] or [...] "-"), and whitespace. The concept also includes control characters, {{which do not}} correspond to symbols in a particular natural language, but rather to other bits of information used to process text {{in one or more}} languages. Examples of control characters include carriage <b>return</b> or <b>tab,</b> as well as instructions to printers or other devices that display or otherwise process text.|$|R

25|$|On the Bengals second {{offensive}} {{play of the}} game, Palmer {{suffered a}} season-ending knee injury after being hit by Pittsburgh's Kimo von Oelhoffen, but his 66-yard pass to wide receiver Chris Henry (who was also injured on the play) set up kicker Shayne Graham's 23-yard field goal. Then after forcing a punt, backup quarterback Jon Kitna completed three consecutive passes for 40 yards and rushed for 11, while running back Rudi Johnson finished the drive with a 20-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 10–0. Steelers defensive back Ike Taylor returned the ensuing kickoff 36 yards to the 40-yard line. Aided by a 15-yard penalty on cornerback Tory James, the Steelers subsequently drove 60 yards in eight plays and scored with Ben Roethlisberger's 19-yard touchdown pass to Willie Parker. The ensuing kickoff was <b>returned</b> by <b>Tab</b> Perry for 32 yards to his own 43-yard line, and then the Bengals drove 57 yards in 14 plays. Kitna completed the drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh, retaking their 10-point lead, 17–7. But on the Steelers ensuing drive, Roethlisberger's 54-yard completion to Cedrick Wilson set up his 5-yard touchdown pass to Hines Ward, cutting the score to 17–14 at halftime.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, Alaric and Damon {{arrive at}} the house John's phone calls were tracked to and they run into a vampire named Henry (Evan Gamble). Henry attacks Alaric but Damon throws him off {{recognizing}} him from the tomb. Henry tells them that John helped him {{get used to the}} modern world and in <b>return,</b> Henry keeps <b>tabs</b> on the other vampires from the tomb. Henry's phone rings and Damon offers to answer it since it is John but when he does not, Henry suspects that something is not right and he tries to attack Alaric again who stakes him in the heart and kills him. Alaric and Damon talk about not finding anything about Isobel and Alaric decides that he should stop looking for answers and let it go.|$|R
50|$|The {{framework}} {{combines a}} user interface written in Microsoft Excel with a processing engine written in GNU C. Developers have expressed an intention {{to support a}} full open source run-time environment. According to PSCF's creators, Excel {{was chosen as the}} initial user interface platform because of its popularity in the financial community.The PSCF user enters model parameters in Excel and then launches a control panel implemented in Excel VBA. When the user runs an analysis from within the control panel, his or her entries are converted to a C program, which is then compiled and executed. Outputs from the C program are <b>returned</b> to new <b>tabs</b> in the Excel workbook. The C program performs a multi-year budget simulation using random number generation routines from the open source Boost C++ Library.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 163 - 165) This {{thesis is}} the specification {{and design of}} a portable, full-screen text editor (PED). PED has sufficient text capibilities for the most experienced typist and the most particular programmer. The editor also has the flexibility to be installed for use on any terminal with control and escape keys. The editor capibilities include such features as moving text, copying text, deleting text and changing text [...] all {{with the use of}} cursor control and full-screen display. PED allows scanning a file by moving the window up, down, left, or right, and editing a file by typing changes directly onto the text as it appears in the window. The cursor is positioned by the use of the four ???cursor motion??? keys marked with arrows and by the <b>return</b> and <b>tab</b> keys. In addition, PED provides capabilities used by the experienced typist. Such capabilities include setting of left and right margins and setting and clearing tab stops. Consistent with an electronic typewriter interface, PED will have a displayable columnar ???editor ruler??? as a visual reference for performing these functions. PED is designed for portability. This portability is achieved by designing each task of the editor as a seperate module. It is also important that PED's least portable tasks be isolated as seperate modules. Once these dependent tasks have been isolated, their implementation becomes easier. This makes PED more portable, for use on other computers...|$|R
40|$|The MouseBook ([URL] {{databases}} and web portal {{provide access to}} information about mutant mouse lines held as live or cryopreserved stocks at MRC Harwell. The MouseBook portal integrates curated information from the MRC Harwell stock resource, and other Harwell databases, with information from external data resources to provide value-added information above and beyond what is available through other routes such as International Mouse Stain Resource (IMSR). MouseBook can be searched either using an intuitive Google style free text search or using the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) ontology tree structure. Text searches can be on gene, allele, strain identifier (e. g. MGI ID) or phenotype term and are assisted by automatic recognition of term types and autocompletion of gene and allele names covered by the database. Results are <b>returned</b> in a <b>tabbed</b> format providing categorized results identified {{from each of the}} catalogs in MouseBook. Individual result lines from each catalog include information on gene, allele, chromosomal location and phenotype, and provide a simple click-through link to further information as well as ordering the strain. The infrastructure underlying MouseBook has been designed to be extensible, allowing additional data sources to be added and enabling other sites to make their data directly available through MouseBook...|$|R
