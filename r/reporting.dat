5|$|Veracruz is {{the most}} {{dangerous}} place in Mexico for journalists; at least nine journalists have been killed since Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa took office in 2010, many of them by the Los Zetas drug cartel. Most of these reporters were killed under unclear circumstances, and few arrests have been made in their respective investigations. Given the high levels of corruption, criminal impunity, and drug-related attacks against the press all across Veracruz, many local journalists have decided to leave the state and relocate in other parts of Mexico. The atmosphere in Veracruz has also forced many media outlets to self-censor and stop <b>reporting</b> on the drug violence. With traditional <b>reporting</b> being too dangerous and intimidating, social media and blogs are often the only outlets for <b>reporting</b> serious crimes.|$|E
