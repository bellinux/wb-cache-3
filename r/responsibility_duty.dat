The stupendous epics of India, the holy Bible itself, the Homeric canticles, the Nibelungen, the Cid Campeador, the Inferno, Shakspere's dramas of the passions and of the feudal lords, Burns's songs, Goethe's in Germany, Tennyson's poems in England, Victor Hugo's in France, and many more, are the widely various yet integral signs or land-marks, (in certain respects the highest {{set up by the}} human mind and soul, beyond science, invention, political amelioration, &c.,) narrating in subtlest, best ways, the long, long routes of history, and giving identity to the stages arrived at by aggregate humanity, and the conclusions assumed in its progressive and varied civilizations.... Where is America's art-rendering, in any thing like the spirit worthy of herself and the modern, to these characteristic immortal monuments? So far, our Democratic society, (estimating its various strata, in the mass, as one,) possesses nothing--nor have we contributed any characteristic music, the finest tie of nationality--to make up for that glowing, blood-throbbing, religious, social, emotional, artistic, indefinable, indescribably beautiful charm and hold which fused the separate parts of the old feudal societies together, in their wonderful interpenetration, in Europe and Asia, of love, belief, and loyalty, running one way like a living weft--and picturesque <b>responsibility,</b> <b>duty,</b> and blessedness, running like a warp the other way. (In the Southern States, under slavery, much of the same.)... In coincidence, and as things now exist in the States, what is more terrible, more alarming, than the total want of any such fusion and mutuality of love, belief, and rapport of interest, between the comparatively few successful rich, and the great masses of the unsuccessful, the poor?

Kierkegaard had Judge William speak again in his 1845 book Stages on Life's Way. Here he described the enemies the single individual faces when trying to make a commitment, probability and the outcome. [...] There is a phantom that frequently prowls around when the making of a resolution is at stake-it is probability-a spineless fellow, as dabbler, a Jewish peddler, with whom no freeborn soul becomes involved, a good-for-nothing fellow who ought to be jailed instead of quacks, male and female, since he tricks people out of what is more valuable than money. Anyone who with regard to resolution comes no further, never comes any further than to decide on the basis of probability, is lost for ideality, whatever he may become. If a person does not encounter God in the resolution, if he has never made a resolution in which he had a transaction with God, he might just as well have never lived. But God always does business wholesale, and probability is a security that is not registered in heaven. Thus it is so very important that there be an element in the resolution that impresses officious probability and renders it speechless. There is a phantasm that the person making a resolution chases after the way a dog chases its shadow in the water; it is the outcome, a symbol of finiteness, a mirage of perdition-woe to the person who looks to it, he is lost. Just as the person who, if bitten by serpents, looked at the cross in the desert and became healthy, so the person who fastens his gaze on the outcome is bitten by a serpent, wounded by the secular mentality, lost both for time and for eternity.

40|$|As professionals, music {{teachers}} {{are faced with}} a range of ethical responsibilities that are tied to the particular benefits that the music education profession, by its very existence, promises to contribute to graduates’ musical abilities and future musical options. However, the ethical dimensions of music education are too often overlooked, both in the preparation of new teachers and in evaluating the practices of in-service teachers. This study provides a philosophical review of key aspects of normative ethics that merit being acknowledged and addressed if music education is to be most fully ethical and {{music teachers}} most productively professional. To clarify this ethical <b>responsibility,</b> <b>duty,</b> consequentialist, and virtue ethics are briefly surveyed and common grounds between them are noted in order to recommend a range of criteria for an applied professional ethics of music education. Certain teaching practices from school music and individual lessons are offered as evidence that ethical failings are often involved in many common music teaching practices and that an applied ethics can help music teachers to be most fully professional and effective.

Face-to-face interviews, using standardised, open-ended questions {{were conducted with}} 20 club officials from four sports: soccer, hockey, tennis and surf lifesaving. Thematic content analysis {{identified a number of}} salient themes. Formal sun protection policies were well-implemented in surf lifesaving, but less so in soccer, hockey and tennis clubs, which often had informal sun protection practices in place. Officials perceived sun protection to be important, which was related to perceived exposure levels, the type of sport, length of time played and the season. Consistent logistical and practical considerations emerged, including limited resources, availability of shade, and lack of control over sporting facilities, uniform regulations and games scheduling. Sun protection efforts often focused on children more than adult players. Reciprocal responsibility was an important theme, where it was perceived that responsibility for sun protection should be equally shared between the club and the member. In this study it was found that reciprocal <b>responsibility,</b> <b>duty</b> of care and sport-specific practical requirements might significantly influence the success of policy, environmental and education initiatives for sun protection in sporting settings. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethical and {{empirical}} {{exploration of the}} late discovery of genetic origins in two contexts, adoption and sperm donor-assisted conception. This exploration has two interlinked strands of concern. The first is the identification of ‘late discovery’ as a significant issue of concern, deserving of recognition and acknowledgment. The second concerns the ethical implications of late discovery experiences {{for the welfare of}} the child. The apparently simple act of recognition of a phenomenon is a precondition to any analysis and critique of it. This is especially important when the phenomenon arises out of social practices that arouse significant debate in ethical and legal contexts. As the new reproductive technologies and some adoption practices remain highly contested, an ethical exploration of this long neglected experience has the potential to offer new insights and perspectives in a range of contexts. It provides an opportunity to revisit developmental debate on the relative merit or otherwise of biological versus social influences, from the perspective of those who have lived this dichotomy in practise. Their experiences are the human face of the effects arising from decisions taken by others to intentionally separate their biological and social worlds, an action which has then been compounded by family and institutional secrecy from birth. This has been accompanied by a failure to ensure that normative standards and values are upheld for them. Following discovery, these factors can be exacerbated by a lack of recognition and acknowledgement of their concerns by family, friends, community and institutions. Late discovery experiences offer valuable insights to inform discussions on the ethical meanings of child welfare, best interests, parental <b>responsibility,</b> <b>duty</b> of care and child identity rights in this and other contexts. They can strengthen understandings of what factors are necessary for a child to be able to live a reasonably happy or worthwhile life...|$|E
40|$|Intelligence {{and passion}} {{are not enough}} for humans to become all that they can be. Hitler and the Nazis too {{had a lot of}} {{intelligence}} and passion. But what they did not have is the wisdom of how to use their intelligence and passion for the good of mankind. Nevertheless, the question of developing how we, humans, ought to use our intelligence and passion is often neglected in modernity when compared with the obsession we have of increasing our grit and wit. This obsession reflects the current state of education whereby the function of education today is often cheapened to: (1) giving away power without ensuring that power is equally matched by <b>responsibility,</b> <b>duty,</b> moral, and obligation to others, and (2) providing knowledge without offering the purpose behind it. The result of giving away power without character has made possible the world where the educated could use the power they received through education to take advantage of those who are less fortunate. And the consequence of teaching the “what” without the “why” has robbed students of the purpose behind their own education. To solve these critical issues, this paper begins its investigation on Aristotle’s axiom that happiness is what all humans seek. Afterward, through scientific research, it will show how the common pursuit of one’s own happiness backfires. Instead, it will suggest how learning to live for less not more is actually what leads one toward one’s “complete happiness,” growth, virtue, freedom from one’s own desires, being fully “human,” as well as the fulcrum upon which the world can shift from being the world of takers towards a world of givers. This process is called “altruistic human flourishing. ” And the education which can facilitate this process of altruistic human flourishing is called “Altruistic Education. ” Altruistic Education is what this paper offers as the solution to bettering the world. It accomplishes such goal by cultivating students who are not only capable but also compassionate, teaching the “why” of education as much as the “what, 2 ̆ 2 and to help students gain not only knowledge but, more importantly, how to find the joy and beauty in applying that knowledge above and beyond themselves...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} actions {{performed}} by {{a large number of}} persons are often characterized by apathy, impulsivity and goal-neglect in contemporary times. While being fully capable of exercising the theoretical reasoning consistent with their desires and beliefs, an increasing number of persons generally fail {{to take into account the}} necessity of practical reasoning focused on valuing the other-regarding <b>responsibility,</b> <b>duty</b> and obligation. They are endowed with the faculty of theoretical rationality and yet they have no regard for the necessity of deliberation about and valuation of future consequences of an action. In such a case, the apathetic and goal-neglecting impulsive persons fail to properly execute actions. What is at stake is that apathetic disposition and impulsive intentionality constrains the working of the relation of emotion, reason and thought towards purposeful action and moral doing. It needs to be acknowledged that agential autonomy of human nature and voluntary nature of human actions as these are mediated through practical reason have an intimate relation with the health of human brain and the richness of information it is endowed with. What is nowadays increasingly observed as human actions driven by socially pervasive undesirable whims and reprehensible impulses may often be simply the result of malfunction of cognitive control of brain over internal information and asymmetry in coupling of external information with brain. A human agent suffering from apathy, impulsivity and goal-neglect may not be successful in bringing the cognitive reason and perceptual information to leave a stamp on his/her moral practices in day to day life. Such a situation may allow for manifold standards of moral practices in the real world. Such a multiplicity in the practices of morality is tragically not always accounted in theories of ethics. It must however be accounted. Classical postulates on the concept of a rational agency and the rationalist claim regarding universality of the practical reason needs to account for the general observations of at least two pervasive real-life constraints on moral practices since these dual constraints produce exceptions in standard moral practices. One is grounded in observations of pervasive apathy, and another derives from the phenomena of impulsivity and goal-neglect on part of a large number of people. Whereas apathy may often be caused by malfunction of cognitive control function of the pre-frontal cortex and corti-costriatal circuitry of the human brain, goal neglect may largely be the result of asymmetry in coupling and transferring of perceptual data and external information to human brain. In case of lesions of and damages to the pre-frontal cortex of brain, malfunctioning of the cognitive control functions begins and, inter alia, the human agents begin suffering from apathy. In case of irregularity in the functioning of corti-costriatal brain circuitry, the processing of reward-related (internal and external) informational resources is hampered and, inter alia, the human agents witness losing control over the process of regulation of impulsive decisions and actions. Both situations are symptomatic of the ‘psychic akinesia’ (also called ‘athymormia’) - auto-activation deficit. ...|$|E

São Paulo (SP) : Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo; 2005. This cross-sectional, non experimental survey aimed {{to analyze the}} work relation among nursing workers at two hospital institutions in Recife – PE, Brazil and the information they possess about their rights, <b>responsibilities,</b> <b>duties</b> {{and benefits}}. Data were collected through interviews with workers at one public and one private hospital, as well as non participant observation by the researcher between May and September 2004. After data collection and analysis, {{it was observed that}} women predominated (92, 6 %) among the 324 subjects in the two institutions, with older persons at the public institution, and a predominance of people who had not finished secondary education (66 %). The public institution employed a higher number of nurses (29, 8 %), while the private hospital revealed a greater quantity of other nursing categories. At the two hospitals, workers performed other functions apart from what they could perform through their professional training; a large majority of the workers (96, 6 %) assumed the post they were hired for. At both institutions, subjects worked more at the wards (44, 1 %); there was a predominance of workers who had spent between 0 and 5 years on the job and in their current function. The existing employment contract was the single legal system at the public hospital while, at the private institution, employment contracts were ruled by the Consolidation of Labor Laws. With respect to identifying what occupational health promotion programs existed at the hospitals, most of the interviewees (51, 9 %) mentioned the existence of an Internal Accident Prevention Commission. When questioned about their rights, they managed to identify most of them, with percentage scores ranging from 59, 3 % to 96, 6 %; in terms of duties, these were identified with scores from 51, 9 % to 75, 1 %, and particularly mixed up with responsibilities. Participants did not manage to identify their responsibilities adequately, with scores ranging from 22, 5 % to 47, 2 %, and mixed them up with their duties, except for the responsibility in case of error. What their benefits is concerned, participants mainly mixed them up with their rights, with correct answers ranging from 14, 2 % to 48, 8 %. Workers gave many incorrect answers, mixing up rights, <b>responsibilities,</b> <b>duties</b> and benefits, which demonstrates their vulnerability as citizens and workers. Information about work-related issues – in this case workers’ rights, <b>responsibilities,</b> <b>duties</b> and benefits must be offered in their training courses and reinforced in permanent education programs in their employment institutions. This study suggests that information about rights, <b>duties,</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and benefits should be socialized among workers, giving them the opportunity to actually exercise their citizenship...|$|R
