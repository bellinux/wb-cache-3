25|$|BWRs are {{characterized}} by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary <b>reactor</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel.</b> A boiling water reactor uses 235U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity. During normal operation, pressure {{is controlled by the}} amount of steam flowing from the <b>reactor</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> to the turbine.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, {{six years}} after the disaster, {{radiation}} levels inside the Unit 2 containment building were crudely estimated to be about 650 Sv/h. The estimation was revised later to 80 Sv/h. These readings were the highest recorded since the disaster occurred in 2011 and the first recorded in that area of the reactor since the meltdowns. Images showed a hole in metal grating beneath the <b>reactor</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel,</b> suggesting that melted nuclear fuel had escaped the vessel in that area.|$|E

25|$|In {{the reactor}} core, {{high-pressure}} systems cycle water between the <b>reactor</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> and heat exchangers. These systems transfer heat to a secondary heat exchanger via the essential service water system, using water pumped {{out to sea}} or an onsite cooling tower. Units 2 and 3 were equipped with steam turbine-driven emergency core cooling systems that could be directly operated by steam produced by decay heat, and which could inject water directly into the reactor. Some electrical power was needed to operate valves and monitoring systems.|$|E
25|$|On 17 March, Unit 6 was {{reported}} to have a single operational air-cooled diesel-generator as well as dry switchgear (inside the only GE Mark II reactor building) and this was to be used to power pumps in Unit 5 to run the Make-up Water Condensate System (MUWC) to supply more water. Preparations were made to inject water into the <b>reactor</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> once external power could be restored to the plant, as water levels in the reactors were considered to be declining. NISA reported that connections from the grid to all units was complete 20 March through new cables and transformers.|$|E
25|$|The coolant water must {{be highly}} {{pressurized}} to remain liquid at high temperatures. This requires high strength piping {{and a heavy}} pressure vessel and hence increases construction costs. The higher pressure can increase {{the consequences of a}} loss-of-coolant accident. The <b>reactor</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> is manufactured from ductile steel but, as the plant is operated, neutron flux from the reactor causes this steel to become less ductile. Eventually the ductility of the steel will reach limits determined by the applicable boiler and pressure vessel standards, and the pressure vessel must be repaired or replaced. This might not be practical or economic, and so determines the life of the plant.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear fuel in the <b>reactor</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> {{is engaged}} in a fission chain reaction, which {{produces}} heat, heating the water in the primary coolant loop by thermal conduction through the fuel cladding. The hot primary coolant is pumped into a heat exchanger called the steam generator, where it flows through hundreds or thousands of small tubes. Heat is transferred through the walls of these tubes to the lower pressure secondary coolant located on the sheet side of the exchanger where the coolant evaporates to pressurized steam. The transfer of heat is accomplished without mixing the two fluids to prevent the secondary coolant from becoming radioactive. Some common steam generator arrangements are u-tubes or single pass heat exchangers.|$|E
25|$|At 20:05 JST on 12 March, the Japanese {{government}} ordered seawater to be {{injected into}} Unit 1 {{in a new}} effort to cool the reactor core. The treatment had been held {{as a last resort}} since it ruins the reactor. TEPCO started seawater cooling at 20:20, adding boric acid as a neutron absorber to prevent a criticality accident. The water would take five to ten hours to fill the reactor core, after which the reactor would cool down in around ten days. The injection of seawater into the <b>reactor</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> was done by fire department trucks. At 01:10 JST on 14 March, injection of seawater was halted for two hours because all available water in the plant pools had run out (similarly, feed to Unit 3 was halted). NISA news reports stated 70% of the fuel rods had been damaged when uncovered.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{as workers}} {{struggled}} to supply {{power to the}} reactors' coolant systems and restore power to their control rooms, a number of hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred, the first in Unit 1, on 12 March and the last in Unit 4, on 15 March. It is estimated that the hot zirconium fuel cladding-water reaction in Reactors 1–3 produced 800 to 1000 kilograms of hydrogen gas each. The pressurized gas was vented out of the <b>reactor</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> where it mixed with the ambient air, and eventually reached explosive concentration limits in Units 1 and 3. Due to piping connections between Units 3 and 4, or alternatively from the same reaction occurring in the spent fuel pool in Unit 4 itself, Unit 4 also filled with hydrogen, resulting in an explosion. In each case, the hydrogen-air explosions occurred {{at the top of}} each unit, that was in their upper secondary containment buildings. Drone overflights on 20 March and afterwards captured clear images of the effects of each explosion on the outside structures, while the view inside was largely obscured by shadows and debris.|$|E

50|$|Lessons {{learned at}} Fort St. Vrain have led more recent reactor designs of the HTGR type to adopt {{different}} strategies to confront issues that occurred there.

Others, such as the Adams Atomic Engine (using nitrogen), the Romawa Nereus (using helium), and General Atomics GT-MHR (using helium) have favored simplification of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor concept as much as possible, down to practically a reactor and a gas turbine linked together with the reactor using a right-sized, inherently safe core with no water used in the plant design.

2500|$|A primary {{characteristic}} of PWRs is a pressurizer, a specialized pressure vessel. Most commercial PWRs and naval reactors use pressurizers.
