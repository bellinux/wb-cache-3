25|$|Adjacent to the Jamestown Exposition site on Hampton Roads at Sewell's Point, a new coal pier {{was being}} built. Completion {{of the entire}} {{railroad}} took 2 additional years. The low gradient VGN was considered an engineering marvel {{of the time when}} it was completed in 1909. Soon, coal and other commodities began <b>rolling</b> <b>through</b> Victoria.

25|$|Operations at the Amboy {{headquarters}} and depot continued {{in this manner}} until 1894. That year, Illinois Central completed {{an assessment of the}} effects of the completion of a new east-west rail line from Iowa to Chicago. Completion of the east-west line had shifted rail traffic from the north-south route through Amboy. The result was fewer scheduled passenger trains and less cargo <b>rolling</b> <b>through</b> Amboy and the railroad decided to downgrade the section of track from Freeport to Centralia (including Amboy) to a sub-division. The headquarters in Amboy were closed and the locomotive repair and maintenance facilities were mostly abandoned and relocated to Freeport, Illinois and Clinton, Illinois.|$|E

25|$|The first {{main event}} of the night, was the match for the WWE Championship between the {{champion}} Eddie Guerrero and the challenger Kurt Angle. The match was centered around both men maneuvering around on the mat. Guerrero performed a DDT and Frog Splash on Angle {{that would result in}} a pin attempt; Angle then recovered and applied an ankle lock but Guerrero escaped the hold by <b>rolling</b> <b>through</b> it and throwing Angle out of the ring. As Angle was outside, Guerrero loosened his ring boot. As Angle returned to the ring, he tried to apply the hold again. This time, Guerrero pushed Angle off with his other foot, allowing him to break free from Angle's hold. With Angle confused, Guerrero pinned Angle with a roll-up to win the match and retain the WWE Championship.|$|E
25|$|Playing a {{shortened}} 50-game season, the Spurs {{earned an}} NBA-best 37–13 record (.740 win percentage, and only season since Duncan was drafted the Spurs {{did not win}} at least 50 games in a season as of 2016). The team was just as dominant in the playoffs, <b>rolling</b> <b>through</b> the Western Conference {{with a record of}} 11–1. In the NBA Finals, they faced the New York Knicks, who had made history by becoming the first eighth seed to ever make the NBA Finals. The Spurs won the series and the franchise's first NBA Championship in Game 5 at the Knicks' home arena, Madison Square Garden. Duncan was named the NBA Finals MVP. The Spurs became the first former ABA team to reach and to win the NBA Finals. They also won the 1999 McDonald's Championship in the off-season and were the last champions of that tournament as it was disbanded right after.|$|E
25|$|The British National Antarctic Expedition {{departed}} the UK {{less than}} {{five months after the}} Discovery was launched and only a week after the ship left Dundee. This left little time for the ship to undergo sea trials and the voyage to New Zealand was also the brand new vessel's shakedown cruise. Scott's first impression of the ship was poor, considering her slow and unresponsive while the shallow hull, built with no protuberances to work well in ice, provided minimal stability. Discovery rolled heavily once in the open sea (she was recorded <b>rolling</b> <b>through</b> 94 degrees - 47 degrees either side of vertical- in the Southern Ocean) and tended 'gripe' (wander to and fro along her course). Shackleton described the ship as a bad sailer, carrying too much sail aft and not enough forward while Scott also worried that the design of the ship's hull was unsuitable for work in pack ice. But once the expedition reached the Roaring Forties the ship proved to have excellent seakeeping and, because she was heavy and carried relatively little sail area for her size, she could make good progress in high winds and heavy seas without having to reef. The Discovery's unusual rounded, overhanging stern (one of the main changes from the original Bloodhound design) not only provided more protection for the rudder but also prevented all but the largest following seas breaking {{over the back of the}} ship and kept the decks dry, although the stern was prone to 'slamming' into waves, making the officer's accommodation and wardroom noisy.|$|E

25|$|A {{little before}} 5:00p.m. as the {{artillery}} fight began to wane, Confederate Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder fell mortally wounded. He had been ill {{that day and}} was taken onto the field in an ambulance wagon. While attempting to direct his troops, {{he was struck by}} a shell fragment. Winder's left arm and side were torn to pieces, and he died a few hours later. As a result, command of the division devolved on William Taliaferro, who was completely ignorant of Jackson's battle plan. Dispositions on his part of the field were still incomplete; Garnett's brigade was isolated from the main Confederate line, with its flank dangerously exposed to the woods. The Stonewall Brigade was to have come up to support them, but remained a half mile distant behind the artillery. Before leadership could properly be restored to the division the Union attack began. Geary and Prince were sent against the Confederate right. The Federal advance was swift and threatened to break the Confederate line, prompting Early to come galloping to the front from Cedar Mountain where he was directing troop dispositions. Early's stabilizing presence and the raking fire of the Confederate guns halted the Union advance on the Confederate right. On the left Crawford attacked Winder's division, sending one brigade directly at the Confederate line and another brigade through the woods on a flanking movement. The Federals came from the woods directly into the flank of the 1st Virginia Infantry, who under the pressure from attack on two fronts broke for the rear. The Federals pushed on, not waiting to reform their lines, <b>rolling</b> <b>through</b> the outflanked 42nd Virginia until they found themselves in Taliaferro's and the artillery's rear. The Stonewall Brigade came up and was swept aside by Crawford's troops before it had a chance to react. Jackson ordered the batteries withdrawn before they were captured, but Taliaferro and Early's left were hit hard by the Union advance and threatened to break.|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{the show}} {{received}} {{a positive response}} from many music critics. Mike Weatherford of the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote, [...] "The spectacle rivals Celine Dion's 'A New Day' as the singer transforms from fragile soul to the rock warrior alter ego of her album title, I Am ... Sasha Fierce." [...] Melissa Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly wrote in her review of the show, [...] "Once Beyoncé took to the stage, she hardly left it. Appearing both on her own and with back-up dancers, she worked the theater {{from left to right}} throughout the showcase. She sang, danced, and looked good while she did it... Indeed, the mezzo-soprano is as easy on the eyes as she is on the ears." [...] John Griffiths of Us Weekly described the concert as [...] "lavish".

500|$|William III's {{birthday}} fell on 4November, and for orthodox Whigs the {{two days}} therefore became an important double anniversary. [...] William ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5November be amended to include thanks for his [...] "happy arrival" [...] and [...] "the Deliverance of our Church and Nation". In the 1690s he re-established Protestant rule in Ireland, and the Fifth, occasionally marked by the ringing of church bells and civic dinners, was consequently eclipsed by his birthday commemorations. [...] From the 19th century, 5November celebrations there became sectarian in nature. [...] Its celebration in Northern Ireland remains controversial, unlike in Scotland where bonfires continue to be lit in various cities. [...] In England though, as one of 49official holidays, for the ruling class 5November became overshadowed by {{events such as the}} birthdays of Admiral Edward Vernon, or John Wilkes, and under George II and George III, {{with the exception of the}} Jacobite Rising of 1745, it was largely [...] "a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving". [...] For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry. At some point, for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope. [...] Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day became Guy Fawkes Day. [...] In 1790 The Times reported instances of children [...] "...begging for money for Guy Faux", and a report of 4November 1802 described how [...] "a set of idle fellows... with some horrid figure dressed up as a Guy Faux" [...] were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as [...] "idle and disorderly persons". The Fifth became [...] "a polysemous occasion, replete with polyvalent cross-referencing, meaning all things to all men". [...] Lower class rioting continued, with reports in Lewes of annual rioting, intimidation of [...] "respectable householders" [...] and the <b>rolling</b> <b>through</b> the streets of lit tar barrels. [...] In Guildford, gangs of revellers who called themselves [...] "guys" [...] terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences. [...] Similar problems arose in Exeter, originally the scene of more traditional celebrations. [...] In 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new Bishop of Exeter Henry Phillpotts, a High Church Anglican and High Tory who opposed Parliamentary reform, and who was also suspected of being involved in [...] "creeping popery". [...] A local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored, and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables.|$|E
