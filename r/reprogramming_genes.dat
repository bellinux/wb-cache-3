40|$|Cellular {{reprogramming}} {{is a new}} {{and rapidly}} emerging field in which somatic cells {{can be turned into}} pluripotent stem cells or other somatic cell types simply by the expression of specific combinations of genes. By viral expression of neural fate determinants, it is possible to directly reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts into functional neurons, also known as induced neurons. The resulting cells are nonproliferating and present an alternative to induced pluripotent stem cells for obtaining patient- and disease-specific neurons to be used for disease modeling and for development of cell therapy. In addition, because the cells do not pass a stem cell intermediate, direct neural conversion {{has the potential to be}} performed in vivo. In this study, we show that transplanted human fibroblasts and human astrocytes, which are engineered to express inducible forms of neural <b>reprogramming</b> <b>genes,</b> convert into neurons when <b>reprogramming</b> <b>genes</b> are activated after transplantation.

After ascorbic acid treatment, <b>reprogramming</b> <b>genes</b> were analyzed by realtime reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, relative 5 -methylcytosine and 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine content in pronucleus were detected by realtime PCR.

After SCNT, transcript levels of <b>reprogramming</b> <b>genes,</b> Pou 5 f 1, Sox 2, and Klf were significantly increased in blastocysts.

40|$|Environmental {{exposures}} during sensitive {{windows of}} development can reprogram normal physiological responses and alter disease susceptibility {{later in life}} in {{a process known as}} developmental reprogramming. We have shown that neonatal exposure to the xenoestrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) can developmentally reprogram the reproductive tract in genetically susceptible Eker rats giving rise to complete penetrance of uterine leiomyoma. Based on this, we hypothesized that xenoestrogens, including genistein (GEN) and bisphenol A (BPA), <b>reprogram</b> estrogen-responsive <b>gene</b> expression in the myometrium and promote the development of uterine leiomyoma. We proposed the mechanism that is responsible for the developmental <b>reprogramming</b> of <b>gene</b> expression was through estrogen (E 2) / xenoestrogen inducedrapid ER signaling, which modifies the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH 2) via activation of the PI 3 K/AKT pathway. We further hypothesized that there is a xenostrogen-specific effect on this pathway altering patterns of histone modification, DNA methylation and gene expression. In addition to our novel finding that E 2 /DES-induced phosphorylation of EZH 2 by AKT reduces the levels of H 3 K 27 me 3 in vitro and in vivo, this work demonstrates in vivo that a brief neonatal exposure to GEN, in contrast to BPA, activates the PI 3 K/AKT pathway to regulate EZH 2 and decreases H 3 K 27 me 3 levels in the neonatal uterus. Given that H 3 K 27 me 3 is a repressive mark that has been shown to result in DNA methylation and gene silencing we investigated the methylation of developmentally <b>reprogrammed</b> <b>genes.</b> In support of this evidence, we show that neonatal DES exposure in comparison to VEH, leads to hypomethylation of the promoter of a developmentally <b>reprogrammed</b> <b>gene,</b> Gria 2, that become hyper-responsive to estrogen in the adult myometrium indicating vi that DES exposure alter gene expression via chromatin remodeling and loss of DNA methylation. In the adult uterus, GEN and BPA exposure developmentally reprogrammed expression of estrogen-responsive genes in a manner opposite of one another, correlating with our previous data. Furthermore, the ability of GEN and BPA to developmental <b>reprogram</b> <b>gene</b> expression correlated with tumor incidence and multiplicity. These data show that xenoestrogens have unique effects on the activation of non-genomic signaling in the developing uterus that promotes epigenetic and genetic alterations, which are predictive of developmental reprogramming and correlate with their ability to modulate hormone-dependent tumor development...|$|R

Methods for genetic engineering of iPSC that emphasize precision and minimize random integration would be beneficial. We demonstrate here an approach in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy that focuses on the use of site-specific recombinases to achieve genetic engineering. We employed non-viral, plasmid-mediated methods to reprogram mdx fibroblasts, using phiC 31 integrase to insert a single copy of the <b>reprogramming</b> <b>genes</b> at a safe location in the genome. We next used Bxb 1 integrase to add the therapeutic full-length dystrophin cDNA to the iPSC in a site-specific manner. Unwanted DNA sequences, including the <b>reprogramming</b> <b>genes,</b> were then precisely deleted with Cre resolvase. Pluripotency of the iPSC was analyzed before and after gene addition, and ability of the genetically corrected iPSC to differentiate into myogenic precursors was evaluated by morphology, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, FACS analysis, and intramuscular engraftment. These data demonstrate a non-viral, reprogramming-plus-gene addition genetic engineering strategy utilizing site-specific recombinases that can be applied easily to mouse cells.
