2500|$|Age is an {{important}} factor when considering TOT states. There are complaints that problems recalling information increases with age. The frequency of TOTs increases in adulthood and even more so during the elderly years. Compared with young adults, older adults generally report having more TOT states, fewer alternate words, and less phonological information about the target word. The underpinnings of TOT with regard to age have focused on neurological brain differences. Current research uses neuroimaging methods to access the presence of different brain patterns when a younger and older individual is experiencing a TOT state. It is found that older and younger individuals employ a similar network of brain regions during TOT states such as the prefrontal cortex, left insula, and sensorimotor cortex. However, older individuals show differences in activity in some areas compared to younger individuals. TOTs increase with age-related gray matter loss in the left insula for older individuals. [...] This is accompanied by less activity in the left insula and is <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of TOTs. Furthermore, it was found that older individuals have over-activation in their prefrontal cortex when experiencing TOT states. This may indicate a continued search when the retrieval process fails and a TOT state is experienced. More specifically, greater activation in the sensorimotor cortex in older individuals and less in younger adults may reflect differences in the knowledge that is used to retrieve the target information. Priming words during word retrieval tests generally reduces the frequency of TOTs and improves the retrieval of the target word and has been shown to have a larger benefit for older adults. This is consistent with the spreading activation model, where neural connections are strengthened when used more. [...] Although older people experience more tip of the tongue states more often than any other category, [...] recent studies have shown that frequent tip of the tongue states are not linked at all to dementia, which is common in the elderly. Despite the association of increased age with lower levels of episodic memory and more frequent TOT states, the two phenomena seem to be largely independent of one another.|$|E
40|$|Background: Few {{children}} eat sufficient {{fruits and}} vegetables despite their established health benefits. The feeding practices used by parents when introducing novel foods to their children, and their efficacy, require further investigation. Objective: We aimed to establish which feeding strategies parents commonly use when introducing a novel fruit to their preschool-aged children and assess {{the effectiveness of these}} feeding strategies on children???s willingness to try a novel fruit. Design Correlational design. Participants/setting Twenty-five parents and their children aged 2 to 4 years attended our laboratory and consumed a standardized lunch, including a novel fruit. Interactions between parent and child were recorded and coded. Statistical analyses performed Pearson???s correlations and multiple linear regression analyses. Results: The frequency with which children swallowed and enjoyed the novel fruit, and the frequency of taste exposures to the novel fruit during the meal, were positively correlated with parental use of physical prompting and rewarding/bargaining. Earlier introduction of solids was <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of child acceptance behaviors. The child???s age at introduction of solids and the number of physical prompts displayed by parents significantly predicted the frequency of swallowing and enjoying the novel fruit. Age of introduction to solids and parental use of rewards/bargaining significantly pre- dicted the frequency of taste exposures. Conclusions: Prompting a child to eat and using rewards or bargains during a positive mealtime interaction can help to overcome barriers to novel fruit consumption. Early introduction of solids is also associated with greater willingness to consume a novel fruit...|$|E

Method: Walking for transport and walking for recreation were assessed with a validated survey among 2650 adults recruited from neighborhoods in an Australian city between July 2003 and June 2004, with neighborhoods selected to have either high or low walkability, based on objective measures of connectedness and proximity derived from geographic information systems (GIS) databases. The study design was stratified by area-level socioeconomic status, while analyses controlled for participant age, gender, individual-level socioeconomic status, and reasons for neighborhood self-selection.

40|$|Expectancies about alcohol {{have been}} shown to be related to and {{predictive}} of alcohol consumption. Research to date, however, has often failed to make a clear distinction between expectations about the effects of alcohol (alcohol expectancies) and expectations about one 2 ̆ 7 s ability to resist drinking in certain situations (drinking refusal self-efficacy). There is some evidence that alcohol expectancies (AE) and drinking refusal self-efficacy (DRSE) can play differential roles in the prediction of consumption in terms of quantity and frequency of drinking. This study aimed to replicate and extend these findings to the community population. Subjects (N = 185) were recruited from the general community using a peer network system. They were given a booklet comprising six self-report measures, including the Drinking Expectancy Questionnaire (DEQ), the Drinking Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (DSEQ), and the Khavari Alcohol Test (KAT), which produces measures of usual and maximum quantity as well as frequency of the usual and maximum consumed. It was expected that AE would be related to frequency of consumption whereas DRSE would be related to both quantity and frequency. The findings confirmed the differential role of AE and DRSE in drinking, and the role of factors within the two concepts. Results indicated that low DRSE was <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of general consumption and a larger maximum quantity on any one occasion. AE was related to frequency, but not to quantity, as expected. The findings are presented with respect to the theoretical constructs; clinical and research implications are also discussed...|$|E

Experimental Design: We included 141 primary rectal cancer patients who participated in a Swedish clinical trial of preoperative RT. Tissue microarray samples from the excised rectal cancers and the adjacent or distant normal mucosa and lymph node metastases were stained with PPAR delta antibody. Survival probability was computed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. The proliferation of colon cancer cell lines KM 12 C, KM 12 SM, and KM 12 L 4 a was assayed after PPAR delta knockdown. Results: PPAR delta was increased from adjacent or distant normal mucosa to primary cancers, whereas it decreased from primary cancers to lymph node metastases. After RT, PPAR delta was increased in normal mucosa, whereas it decreased in primary cancers and lymph node metastases. In primary cancers, the high expression of PPAR delta was <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of stage I cases, lower lymph node metastasis rate, and low expression of Ki- 67 in the unirradiated cases, and related to favorable survival in the cases either with or without RT.

Additionally, research has not adequately addressed the effects among emerging adults who are of particular interest because they use technology at the greatest rates and are at a significant developmental phase for learning to navigate their relationships. The current study used data that was collected at East Carolina University, including 614 total participants. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the connections between patterns of technology use, jealousy, and relationship satisfaction among an emerging adult sample using attachment theory as the theoretical foundation. The research questions being addressed include: 1) Are patterns of technology use, and patterns of technology use with one's romantic partner predicted by one's attachment style? 2) What is the nature of the connection between technology and attachment, and experiences of jealousy in emerging adults' romantic relationships? 3) In what ways are attachment, technology use, technology use with one's romantic partner, and experiences of jealousy predictive of relationship satisfaction during emerging adulthood? Regarding the first research question, the results indicate that increased attachment insecurity was <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of technology use and technology use with romantic partner.

The signals underlying the imaging data arise from neural mass action and reflect the properties of populations of neurons. For example, the signal used for {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI-BOLD) was shown to correlate with the oscillatory activity quantified by local field potentials (LFP). This raises the questions of how the frequency selectivity in neuronal population signals compares to the tuning of spiking responses. To address this, we quantified tuning properties of auditory evoked potentials (AEP), different frequency bands of the LFP, analog multi-unit (AMUA) and spike-sorted single- and multi-unit activity in auditory cortex. The AMUA showed a close correspondence in frequency tuning to the spike-sorted activity. In contrast, for the LFP we found a clear dissociation of <b>high</b> and low <b>frequency</b> bands: there was a gradual increase of tuning-curve similarity, tuning specificity and information about the stimulus with increasing LFP frequency. While properties of the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> LFP matched those of spiking activity, the lower frequency bands differed considerably, as did the AEP. These results demonstrate that electrophysiological population responses exhibit varying degrees of frequency tuning and suggest that those functional imaging methods that are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> oscillatory activity should well reflect the neuronal processing of sound frequency...|$|R
40|$|Binder properties, {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> asphalt rutting, {{were investigated}} and compared with each other. Included are: parameters derived from oscillatory tests (e. g. the "zero" shear viscosity and the SHRP rutting parameter), parameters derived from static and repeated creep tests {{and the traditional}} R&B softening point. Various binders were tested, including low and high polymer modified bitumen, and bitumen modified with commercial waxes. This study shows that for unmodified bitumen all the investigated binder parameters correlate well {{with each other and}} would give similar classifications regarding the rutting susceptibility. For modified binders, the parameters <b>related</b> <b>to</b> low frequency or long loading times, give a different ranking than those <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies,</b> as for example the SHRP parameter. The storing and preparation conditions prior to the rheological measurement can have a large influence, especially in the range of long loading times or low frequencies. For elastomer modified binders, the homogenization temperature and the corresponding change in micro-structure can have a large impact. For binders with semicrystalline modifiers, the storage time and storage temperature before testing can introduce large changes in the polymer network building up. The thermal history effects in rheological tests can be <b>related</b> <b>to</b> variations in crystallinity, as shown by calorimetry, or to variations in morphology, as revealed by fluorescence microscopy. Some of the binders were also investigated in the presence of filler, to see if the thermal effects play a similar role in mastic (binder(+) filler) as in the neat binder...|$|R

Objectives. In the first randomized controlled trial of yoga on UK prisoners, we previously showed that yoga practice was associated with improved mental wellbeing and cognition. Here, we aimed to assess how class attendance, self-practice, and demographic factors were <b>related</b> <b>to</b> outcome amongst prisoners enrolled in the 10 -week yoga intervention. Methods. The data of 55 participants (52 male, 3 female) who completed a 10 -week yoga course were analysed. Changes in pre- and postyogameasures of affect, perceived stress, and psychological symptoms were entered into linear regression analyses with bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals. Class attendance, self-practice, demographic variables, and baseline psychometric variables were included as regressors. Results. Participants who attended more yoga classes and those who engaged in frequent (5 times or more) self-practice reported significantly greater decreases in perceived stress. Decreases in negative affect were also significantly <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> self-practice and greater class attendance at a near-significant level. Age {{was positively correlated with}} yoga class attendance, and higher levels of education were associated with greater decreases in negative affect. Conclusions. Our results suggest that there may be progressive beneficial effects of yoga within prison populations and point to subpopulations who may benefit the most from this practice. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{realization}} and validation of a detection, identification and recovery module for hardware failures on ESA GOCE satellite, merging two independently developed modules. The work is currently focused on its attitude control subsystem, following a previous {{work on the}} power subsystem. This application is more challenging than the former because of two reasons. Control system, sensors and actuators are highly interdependent; hence to correctly understand which is the faulty device is definitely a hard task. Secondly, the dynamical behaviour of some components is <b>related</b> <b>to</b> very <b>high</b> <b>frequencies,</b> asking for a finer attention to be paid in the neuro-fuzzy model identification phase...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, in many {{practical}} applications, {{images are}} distorted by noise during the acquisition or transmission process. But {{almost all the}} traditional MST-based image fusion algorithms are designed <b>to</b> transfer the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> information from the input images to the fused image. It {{is worth noting that}} much of the image noise is also <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the <b>high</b> <b>frequencies</b> and may cause miscalculation of sharpness value. As a result, the fused images obtained by these methods are more noisy than the source images, and the performances are degraded. To make up for the deficiencies of traditional MST-based image algorithms, in our proposed method, after decomposing the original images using LSWT, we design a new image fusion rule based on multiscale products.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Chronic {{drug abuse}} and sexual {{dysfunction}} specifically erectile dysfunction may lead drug abusers to seek over-the-counter or non-prescription medications, out of which Sildenafil citrate, sold as the trade name of Viagra® {{can be considered as}} a prime and important treatment. Therefore, the research purpose was to draw a comparison and review the role of methamphetamine abuse and sildenafil use in increasing the likelihood of high-risk sexual behaviors (both concomitant and non-concomitant use). Methods: Hence, a total of 40 patients diagnosed with methamphetamine abuse were recruited through the administration of structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th Edition), through purposive sampling and subsequent to being qualified in accordance with the selection criteria by psychologists and general practitioners. All the 40 drug abusers (20 methamphetamine abusers with concomitant use of Aphrodisiac drugs (sexual stimulant pills) and 20 methamphetamine abusers) described their sexual risk behaviors subsequent to the drug use. Findings: Supported the between-group difference that is to say that, the group with concomitant methamphetamine abuse differed significantly in all the items when compared with the control group. However, this group scored lower on the item of sexual intercourse with drug addicted prostitutes using condom and both groups demonstrated high pick on this item. Conclusion: Overall, the concomitant methamphetamine chronic abuse with sexual stimulant drugs generates Aphrodisiac drugs impulses and is found <b>to</b> be <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies</b> of sexual risk behaviors and sexual intercourse with addicted prostitutes.
