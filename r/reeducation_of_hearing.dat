40|$|International audienceAudiovisual {{perception}} of conflicting stimuli displays a large level of intersubject variability, generally larger than pure auditory or visual data. However, {{it is not}} clear whether this actually reflects differences in integration per se, or just the consequence of slight differences in unisensory perception. It is argued that the debate has been blurred by methodological problems in the analysis of experimental data, particularly when using the Fuzzy-Logical Model of Perception (Massaro, 1987) shown to display overfitting abilities with McGurk stimuli (Schwartz, 2006). A large corpus of McGurk data is reanalyzed, using a methodology based on (1) comparison of FLMP and a variant with subject-dependent weights of the auditory and visual inputs in the fusion process, WFLMP, (2) use of a Bayesian Selection Model criterion instead of a Root Mean Square Error fit in model assessment, (3) systematic exploration of the number of useful parameters in the models to compare, attempting to discard poorly explicative parameters. It is shown that WFLMP performs significantly better than FLMP, suggesting that audiovisual fusion is indeed subject-dependent, some subjects being more "auditory" and others more "visual". Inter-subject variability has important consequences for theoretical understanding of the fusion process, and <b>reeducation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> impaired people...|$|E

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} aimed at <b>reeducation</b> <b>of</b> {{mechanical}} knowledge {{in the area of}} fractions. Since every student has different needs and pace in his/her process of gaining knowledge, the reeducation is set into their private supplementary tutoring lessons. In the theoretical part, the basic concepts (how is the private supplementary tutoring understood in this thesis, which students are taken into consideration, and what is mechanical knowledge) are explained based on Czech and foreign literary sources, subsequently, the constructivist way of teaching, which is suitable for the <b>reeducation</b> <b>of</b> mechanical knowledge, is described. The second part of this thesis is constituted by the practical implementation of the theoretical findings into three case studies. Three students were diagnosed with mechanical knowledge in the area of fractions. Subsequently, their knowledge was being reeducated during their private supplementary tutoring lessons. The process <b>of</b> <b>reeducation</b> <b>of</b> each student is described in detail, moreover, a kind of manual describing what should not be avoided when dealing with this topic is included.

40|$|In NOD (nonobese diabetic) mice, a {{model of}} {{autoimmune}} diabetes, various immunomodulatory interventions prevent progression to diabetes. However, after hyperglycemia is established, such interventions rarely alter the course of disease or allow sustained engraftment of islet transplants. A proteasome defect in lymphoid cells of NOD mice impairs the presentation of self antigens and increases the susceptibility of these cells to TNF-α–induced apoptosis. Here, we examine the hypothesis that induction of TNF-α expression combined with <b>reeducation</b> <b>of</b> newly emerging T cells with self antigens can interrupt autoimmunity. Hyperglycemic NOD mice were treated with CFA to induce TNF-α expression and were exposed to functional complexes of MHC class I molecules and antigenic peptides either by repeated injection of MHC class I matched splenocytes or by transplantation of islets from nonautoimmune donors. Hyperglycemia was controlled in animals injected with splenocytes by administration of insulin or, more effectively, by implantation of encapsulated islets. These interventions reversed the established β cell–directed autoimmunity and restored endogenous pancreatic islet function {{to such an extent}} that normoglycemia was maintained in up to 75 % of animals after discontinuation of treatment and removal of islet transplants. A therapy aimed at the selective elimination of autoreactive cells and the <b>reeducation</b> <b>of</b> T cells, when combined with control of glycemia, is thus able to effect an apparent cure of established type 1 diabetes in the NOD mouse.

50|$|For {{orthopedic}} rehabilitation, aquatic {{therapy is}} considered to be synonymous with therapeutic aquatic exercise, aqua therapy, aquatic rehabilitation, water therapy, and pool therapy. Aquatic therapy can support restoration of function for many areas of orthopedics, including sports medicine, work conditioning, joint arthroplasty, and back rehabilitation programs. A strong aquatic component is especially beneficial for therapy programs where limited or non-weight bearing is desirable and where normal functioning is limited by inflammation, pain, guarding, muscle spasm, and limited range of motion (ROM). Water provides a controllable environment for <b>reeducation</b> <b>of</b> weak muscles and skill development for neurological and neuromuscular impairment, acute orthopedic or neuromuscular injury, rheumatological disease, or recovery from recent surgery.|$|R
