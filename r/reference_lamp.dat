Four hue/chroma/lightness indices are calculated {{for each of the four}} unique hues, red, yellow, green, and blue.

40|$|New Zealand’s {{clear skies}} and hence high solar {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation have prompted a {{public education and}} warning programme {{on the dangers of}} UV exposure. Part of this programme was the establishment since 1989 of a network consisting of six erythemal radiometers located mainly in centres of high population density and the use of measurement data in radio broadcasts of the UV index, derived from these measurements (Ryan et al 1996). The Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand (MSL) has been responsible for the annual calibration of these radiometers since the network’s inception and in this paper we will present the changes in spectral responsivity performance of four of these radiometers up until the pre-sent time (Bittar and Hamlin, 1991). The six radiometers in the set are manufactured by Interna-tional Light Inc. They consist of a vacuum photodiode (SED 240), a thin film filter (ACTS 270) and a ground fused silica cosine diffuser (type W). The output current is measured using a current to voltage converter circuit and a data collection system. The calibration is a two step process. Firstly, the relative spectral response shape of the radiometer is measured; this shape is then scaled to values of absolute spectral irradi-ance responsivity by measuring the radiometer’s response to a calibrated spectral irradiance standard. Prior to 1997 the reference detector used to determine the relative spec-tral response shape was a Rhodamine B fluorescence quan-tum counter (Melhiush, 1972), since then a calibrated sili-con photodiode has been used. A change in traceability also occurred in 2002 when our set of primary spectral irradiance <b>reference</b> <b>lamps</b> became traceable to the NIST detector based irradiance scale (Yoon et al, 2002).

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceFred HaslerThis paper {{discusses}} the color rendition capabilities of {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs) and {{their relationship with the}} current standard for color rendition quality. The current standard for judging light source color rendering properties, known as the color rendering index (CRI), has come under heavy scrutiny in recent years with the introduction of LED in commercial lighting applications. LEDs, depending on construction type, have highly structured spectral distributions which do not scale well under the color rendering index; moreover, CRI for LEDs has become disjointed with the subjective measurement of human color preference. Unfortunately, given the multidimensional nature of color, an all-encompassing scale with a single rated value for color rendition capabilities of a light source has proven difficult to establish. An analysis on the human visual system is first discussed, establishing how the visual system first detects color in the eye and subsequently encodes that color information through a color-opponent process, formulating conscious color appearance. The formation of color appearance leads into a discussion on human color vision and the creation of three dimensional color space, which is subsequently used for the measurement of color fidelity (CRI) of consumer light sources. An overview of how LED lamps create light and color is then discussed, showing that the highly structured spectral distribution of LED lamps is often the cause of discrepancy within the CRI system. Existing alternatives to the CRI system are then compared and contrasted to each other, and the existing CRI system. A final color preference study was conducted where four LED lamps where compared to a <b>reference</b> <b>lamp</b> of equal correlated color temperature. Observers were asked to rate the various test lamps against the <b>reference</b> <b>lamp</b> in terms of vividness, naturalness, overall preference, and individual color preference. It was found that no significant difference was found between the first three dimensions measured but significant trend lines existed for the preference of individual colors when illuminated by either LED lamps or the reference source.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the analysis of the spectral, global, and direct solar irradiance measurements in the visible range (400 700 nm) that were made in the framework of the first Iberian UV visible (VIS) instruments intercomparison. The instruments used in this spectral range were four spectroradiometers: three Licor 1800 s equipped with different receiver optics and one Optronic 754. For the direct solar irradiance measurements the spectroradiometers were equipped with collimators with different fields of view. Parallel studies have been carried out with the data given by the spectroradiometers with their original calibration file and with the same data that is corrected, following in situ calibration of the instruments using a laboratory <b>reference</b> <b>lamp.</b> To compare the series of spectral data the relative values of mean absolute deviation (MAD) and root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) have been used. The results obtained from the measurements of global irradiance show that the Licor 1800 s presented very significant differences at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the day due to the deviation from ideal cosine response of the collection optics (i. e., cosine errors). This forced the analysis to be limited to the measurements corresponding to solar elevations higher than 30 °. For this solar elevation range, the results of the intercomparison between the Licor instruments, before their in situ calibration, showed differences of about 5 % in the visible range. The results from the measurements of direct irradiance show that, if correction factors are considered, these deviations are reduced to 3 %, and when the Licors are compared with the Optronic, the deviations are less than 2 %...|$|E

Current malaria {{diagnostic}} tests, including microscopy and antigen-detecting rapid tests, cannot reliably detect low-density infections. Molecular {{methods such as}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are highly sensi-tive but remain too complex for field deployment. A new commercial molecular assay based on loop-mediated iso-thermal amplification (LAMP) was assessed for field use. Methods. Malaria LAMP (Eiken Chemical, Japan) was evaluated for samples from 272 outpatients at a rural Ugandan clinic and compared with expert microscopy, nested PCR, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Two technicians performed the assay after 3 days of training, using 2 alternative blood sample–preparation methods and visual inter-pretation of results by fluorescence assay. Results. Compared with 3 -well nested PCR, the sensitivity of both LAMP and single-well nested PCR was 90 %; the microscopy sensitivity was 51 %. For samples with a Plasmodium falciparum qPCR titer of ≥ 2 parasites/µL, LAMP sensitivity was 97. 8 % (95 % confidence interval, 93. 7 %– 99. 5 %).

Previous observatory EDI demonstrations used a single delay. The EDI (also called “TEDI”) boosted the 2, 700 resolution of the native TripleSpec NIR spectrograph (950 - 2450 nm) {{by as much as}} 10 x to 27, 000, using 7 overlapping delays up to 3 cm. We observed superb rejection of fixed pattern noises due to bad pixels, since the fringing signal responds only to changes in multiple exposures synchronous to the applied delay dithering. Remarkably, we observed a ~ 20 x reduction of reaction in the output spectrum to PSF shifts of the native spectrograph along the dispersion direction, using our standard processing. This allowed high resolution observations under conditions of severe and irregular PSF drift otherwise not possible without the interferometer. Furthermore, we recently discovered an improved method of weighting and mixing data between pairs of delays that can theoretically further reduce the net reaction to PSF drift to zero. We demonstrate a 350 x reduction in reaction to a native PSF shift using a simple simulation. This technique could similarly reduce radial velocity noise for future EDI’s that use two delays overlapped in delay space (or a single delay overlapping the native peak). Finally, we show an extremely high dynamic range EDI measurement of our ThAr lamp compared to a literature ThAr spectrum, observing weak features (~ 0. 001 x height of nearest strong line) that occur between the major lines.

40|$|The last CCPR intercomparison in 1985 showed {{variations}} of #+-# 1 % in the units of luminous intensity (candela) and luminous flux (lumen) maintained by 14 and 10 participating laboratories, respectively. Meanwhile, the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) {{and some of}} the participating laboratories changed their units, as reported by BIPM. Therefore, VNIIOFI and PTB have an interest in the cooperation on important scientific work in photometry, and this also provides the framework for this bilateral intercomparison. Measurements were carried out at both laboratories to compare the values of luminous intensity, photometric responsivity and luminous flux assigned to artifacts. At VNIIOFI the primary standard of luminous intensity is a high-temperature blackbody. Its temperature is determined by help of a non-selective cavity radiometer. A (primary) photometer with a liquid V(#lambda#) -correcting filter transfers the unit to a group of luminous intensity standard lamps, which are used for the maintenance of the unit. At present, luminous intensity and illuminance calibrations at VNIIOFI are carried out as substitution method with groups of standard lamps and V(#lambda#) -corrected (silicon) photometers. The luminous flux calibrations are carried out by means of a group of luminous flux <b>reference</b> standard <b>lamps</b> and a 2 -meter integrating sphere. The value of luminous flux was established during bilateral comparisons with the BIPM, 1990 and the CSIRO (Australia, 1991). At PTB, the photometric base unit of luminous intensity is realised annually based on radiometric power measurements with absolute radiometers. The unit is maintained by groups of incandescent lamps. In any case, the maintained unit was within the uncertainty range of the realisations and no adjustments were carried out within the last decade.

Infected persons may experience, if not treated, serious complications such as bile stone formation, pyogenic cholangitis, and even cholangiocarcinoma. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent serious complications and, therefore, the simple and reliable diagnostic method is necessary to control clonorchiasis in endemic areas, where resources for the diagnosis are limited. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has been applied {{for the detection of}} Clonorchis sinensis DNA. Six primers targeting eight locations on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene of C. sinensis were designed for species-specific amplification using the LAMP assay. The LAMP assay was sensitive enough to detect as little as 100 fg of C. sinensis genomic DNA and the detection limit in 100 mg of stool was as low as one egg. The assay was highly specific because no cross-reactivity was observed with the DNA of other helminths, protozoa or Escherichia coli.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{reliable}} and simple {{test for the}} detection of malaria parasite is crucial in providing effective treatment and therapeutic follow-up, especially in malaria elimination programmes. A comparison of four methods, including nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) were used for the malaria diagnosis and treatment follow-up in São Tomé and Príncipe, during a successful pre-elimination campaign. Method During the period September to November 2009, blood samples from 128 children (five to 14 years old) with temperature ≥ 38 °C (tympanic) in the District of Agua Grande were examined using four different methods, i. e., histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP- 2) based rapid diagnostic tests (HRP- 2 -RDTs), optical microscopy, nested PCR, and LAMP. First-line treatment with artesunate-amodiaquine was given for uncomplicated malaria and intravenous quinine was given for complicated malaria. Children with persistent positivity for malaria by microscopy, or either by nested PCR, or by LAMP on day 7 were given second-line treatment with artemether-lumefantrine. Treatment follow-up was made weekly, for up to four weeks. Results On day 0, positive results for HRP- 2 -RDTs, microscopy, nested PCR, and LAMP, were 68 (53 %), 47 (37 %), 64 (50 %), and 65 (51 %), respectively. When nested PCR was used as a <b>reference</b> standard, only <b>LAMP</b> was comparable; both HRP- 2 -RDTs and microscopy had moderate sensitivity; HRP- 2 -RDTs had poor positive predictive value (PPV) and a moderate negative predictive value (NPV) for the treatment follow-up. Seventy-one children with uncomplicated malaria and eight children with complicated falciparum malaria were diagnosed based on at least one positive result from the four tests as well as clinical criteria. Twelve of the 79 children receiving first-line treatment had positive results by nested PCR on day 7 (nested PCR-corrected day 7 cure rate was 85 %). After the second-line treatment, nested PCR/LAMP-corrected day 28 cure rate was 83 % for these 12 children. Conclusions HRP- 2 -RDTs have similar sensitivity as microscopy but less specificity. However, as compared to nested PCR, the poor sensitivity of HRP- 2 -RDTs indicates that low parasitaemia may not be detected after treatment, as well as the low specificity of HRP- 2 -RDTs indicates it cannot be applied for treatment follow-up. LAMP has similar sensitivity and specificity to nested PCR. With high PPV and NPV, LAMP is simpler and faster as compared to nested PCR with the advantage of detecting low parasitaemia becoming a potential point-of-care test for treatment follow-up. </p...|$|R
40|$|Wear and {{corrosion}} {{of structures}} cuts across industries {{and continues to}} challenge materials scientists and engineers to develop cost effective solutions. Industries typically seek mature technologies that can be implemented for production with rapid or minimal development and have little appetite for the longer-term materials research and development required to solve complex problems. The collaborative work performed in this project addressed the complexity of this problem in a multi-year program that industries would be reluctant to undertake without government partnership. This effort built upon the prior development of Advanced Abrasion Resistant Materials conduct by Caterpillar Inc. under DOE Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC 26 - 01 NT 41054. In this referenced work, coatings were developed that exhibited significant wear life improvements over standard carburized heat treated steel in abrasive wear applications. The technology used in this <b>referenced</b> work, arc <b>lamp</b> fusing of thermal spray coatings, {{was one of the}} primary technical paths in this work effort. In addition to extending the capability of the coating technology to address corrosion issues, additional competitive coating technologies were evaluated to insure that the best technology was developed to meet the goals of the program. From this, plasma transferred arc (PTA) welding was selected as the second primary technology that was investigated. Specifically, this project developed improved, cost effective surfacing materials and processes for wear and corrosion resistance in both sliding and abrasive wear applications. Materials with wear and corrosion performance improvements that are 4 to 5 times greater than heat treated steels were developed. The materials developed were based on low cost material systems utilizing ferrous substrates and stainless steel type matrix with hard particulates formed from borides and carbides. Affordability was assessed against other competing hard surfacing or coating techniques, balanced with overall materials performance. State-of-the-art design and simulation capabilities were used to guide materials and process refinement. Caterpillar was the lead of the multi-partner collaborative project. Specific tasks were performed by the partners base on their unique capabilities. The project team was selected to include leaders in the field of material development, processing, modeling, and material characterization. Specifically, industrial members include the suppliers Deloro Stellite and Powder Alloy Corporation., who provided the experimental alloys and who aided {{in the development of the}} costs for the alloys, the Missouri University of Science and Technology and Iowa State University, who provided help in the alloy development and material characterization, QuesTek Innovations, a small company specializing the microstructural modeling of materials, and the DOE laboratories, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and National Energy Technology Laboratory (Albany), who provided unique coating process capability and wear characterization testing. The technologies developed in this program are expected to yield energy savings of about 50 % over existing technologies, or 110 trillion BTUs per year by 2020 when fully implemented. Primary applications by Caterpillar are to replace the surface of machine components which are currently carburized and heat treated with new cladding materials with double the wear life. The new cladding technologies will consume less energy than carburizing. Thus, nearly 50 % energy savings can be expected as a result from elimination of the heat treat process and the reduce wear of the materials. Additionally, when technologies from this project are applied on titanium or other non-ferrous substrates to make lighter weight, more wear resistant, and more efficient structures, significant fuel savings can be realized. With the anticipated drastic reduction in cost for refining titanium-containing ores, the usage of titanium alloys in earthmoving and related machinery is expected to increase multiple folds in the next decade. A major technical hurdle associated with the implementation of titanium alloys for heavy machinery is that of overcoming poor wear resistance. Proof of concept of the technologies developed in this project has been demonstrated by both laboratory testing of coupons and field testing of selected components. Further development will be required in order to have fully validated materials and process for production introduction and several technical hurdles remain to be addressed particular for use of the arc lamp fusing technology. The current project has reduced the risk of failure and provided sufficient data to encourage further investment by industry...|$|R
