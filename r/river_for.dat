Aigle, in the centre, had her stern frame shattered when a shell fell through the deck and exploded, killing a marine and wounding four other members of the crew. She was the only ship to suffer any damage and her casualties amounted to almost half the total of two killed and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Allegan, M-89 runs roughly {{parallel}} with the Kalamazoo <b>River</b> <b>for</b> approximately , passing through mostly rural areas with residences and agricultural fields. The highway curves {{to the east and}} crosses the Kalamazoo River again just west of the city of Otsego. The trunkline curves to the south in the city then again runs east to junction with US131 at exit49 {{on the west side of}} Plainwell. East of US131, the highway passes through the city of Plainwell and crosses the Kalamazoo River again before continuing into rural areas again. The route heads the southeast on towards the village of Richland.|$|E

5|$|Construction of I-380 took 12 {{years to}} complete, ending in 1985. After the interstate opened, US218 was moved onto the new freeway.

I-380 has been affected by two major floods, the Great Flood of 1993 and the Iowa flood of 2008, both of which closed the road at the Iowa <b>River</b> <b>for</b> two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Cooley was {{appointed}} as an appraiser {{of property and}} slaves for Union Bank of Florida.

Subsequently, Fitzpatrick was elected as representative for Monroe County to the Territorial Legislative Council. The unanimous vote for Fitzpatrick in New River was questioned by the Key West Inquirer. Cooley's conduct was implicitly questioned as well, since as Justice of the Peace, Cooley conducted the non-secret balloting. In Key West, Fitzpatrick lost to William Hackley.|$|E

However, soon after the Jin dynasty overthrew the Liao dynasty, the Jurchens sacked the Song capital in 1127 during the Jin–Song wars, causing the Song court to flee south of the Yangtze <b>River.</b> <b>For</b> the next {{two and a half}} centuries, the Great Wall played no role in Han Chinese geopolitics.|$|E
5|$|Discussion of damming the White <b>River</b> <b>for</b> {{flood control}} {{began in the}} 1930s, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) held {{hearings}} on building a dam in January 1946. The new dam would create a lake 50miles (80km) long, and one arm would extend to Monte Ne. Work on Beaver Dam began in 1960 as the CoE impounded and bought land around the White River. In July 1962, Mary Powell sold Camp Joyzelle to the CoE, and W. T. McWhorten sold his land as well.|$|E
