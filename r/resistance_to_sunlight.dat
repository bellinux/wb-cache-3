The center is loosely woven from strips of polyethylene plastic, with sheets of the same material bonded to the surface.

Instead of considering a population of organisms, we can refer to a population of cells belonging to multicellular organisms. Many carcinogens are mutagens, and the observed geographic distribution of cancer is, at least in part, attributable to environmental mutagens. However, the rapid change in risk for some cancers after migration suggests that carcinogenesis involves—in addition to mutations—some late event that most probably consists of the selection of cells already carrying mutations. We review a few examples of such selective pressures: finasteride in prostate cancer, vitamin supplementation in smokers, acquired <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> chemotherapy, peripheral <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> insulin, and <b>sunlight</b> and mutations in melanoma.

They reduce the strength of composites with usage. Also failure mechanisms of composites are not well understood as compared to metals, which lead to increasing probability of accidents.

It is possible only if sensors are of good quality so that signal from sensor can be interpreted accurately to reflect the insitu conditions of the structures. One such sensor is PVDF sensor.

30|$|Although {{they are}} mainly {{composed}} of silicon, {{which is a}} widespread material in nature, the process and thus the final product is expensive. Many investigations have been done to raise the performance of PV cells and reduce the required cell area and its final cost. The proposed methods are mainly based on concentrating the sunrays on a small cell area. There are several concentrator technologies that include parabolic trough solar concentrator, linear refractive Fresnel lens, linear reflective Fresnel lens, dish-shaped reflectors, etc. [1, 2]. Compared to other concentrator technologies, Fresnel lens is characterized by some advantages such as small volume, low weight, short focus, high efficiency, and low cost that motivate researchers to design and commercialize Fresnel-based solar concentrators [3, 4]. With the improvements of lens material since the official invention of Fresnel lens in 1822, especially polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), which has a good transmissivity and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sunlight,</b> interest in Fresnel lenses for concentrated solar energy applications rose {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century. The recent developments of concentrated solar energy applications using Fresnel lens systems include imaging Fresnel lens solar concentration systems and non-imaging systems [5]. Researches have revealed that it is the refractive surface of a conventional lens which defines its focusing properties. Based on this fact the Fresnel lens was invented. Later, researchers found out that using Fresnel lens as a concentrator in PV systems can effectively increase the system’s efficiency. A concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) system with a steady electric output adopting an electrically tunable concentration ratio of the liquid crystals (LC) lens is demonstrated [6]. The module consists of a Fresnel lens array (including 16 Fresnel lenses, each 0.120  m ×  0.120  m), a solar cell array (including 16 solar cells connected in series, each 0.025  m ×  0.025  m) which was pasted onto an aluminum plate heat sink and below the Fresnel array. The authors pointed out that using a Fresnel lens array, instead of a large Fresnel lens, can reduce the thermal energy of the solar cells. Zhai et al. [1] experimentally investigated a concentrating solar collector using linear Fresnel lens. Test results revealed that the indication of lost energy was 0.578  W/m 2  K, which was much smaller than solar collectors without concentrator. In [1], authors used five small Fresnel lenses made of polymethyl, evacuated tube absorber, stepping motor, etc. as the main parts of the module. The module was equipped with a sun-tracking system that tracked the sunlight and a 20  mm light strip was produced. The advantages of this solar collector are: (1) low cost due to accessibility of polymethyl and evacuated glass tube, (2) the area of receiver solar cells is smaller than modules without concentrator, (3) the module is easy to deploy in large scale at high temperature [1]. Rai et al. [9] have investigated the Fresnel lens application for space photovoltaic. The authors proposed the optimum linear Fresnel lens concentrator in terms of concentration ratio. Shvartz and Soluyanov [8] presented space Fresnel concentrated modules with GaInp/GaAs/Ge triple-junction (TJ) solar cells. The module included 4 linear Fresnel lenses, 4 linear photo receivers containing 12 TJ solar cells, and a copper heat sink. Optical characteristics of the linear Fresnel lens were estimated accordingly [8]. Wagner et al. [9] have proposed a refractive system, which enhances solar system’s efficiency and reduces its cost. The proposed model works based on separating sunlight (white light) into different wavelengths. Then using a Fresnel lens and with the help of progresses in semiconductors, each wavelength can be concentrated on a different material to be absorbed effectively. This will increase the solar system’s efficiency. A switchable Fresnel zone plate lens is demonstrated using a polymer-stabilized liquid crystal. The fabrication process is relatively simple and the device can be operated below 10  V with fast response time [10]. In this paper, a novel refractive structure, named semi-Fresnel lens, is proposed. The proposed model works by calculating the groove angles of Fresnel lens based on the refraction and convergent angles of the orthogonal incident ray. To be clearer, we assume that the incoming ray is directly refracted and converged to a special point. Then using Snell’s law and simple trigonometry we find these refraction and convergent angles. Finally based on these two parameters, we calculate the groove angles. This method ensures that every incoming ray will refract directly with refraction angle calculated before. As a result all rays will be converged to a predetermined point with a special convergent angle. Therefore, the needed solar cell area can be significantly reduced. It should not be left unmentioned that, since all calculations are based on the incidence angle orthogonal to the lens surface, the most efficiency will be obtained when the Sun is exactly above the module. To provide this situation in practice, we suggest a sun-tracking method which tracks the sun and adjusts the module so that the incidence angle is always 90 degrees. This way, all incoming rays are concentrated to a line resulting in producing a 2 -cm light strip. This will reduce the needed solar cell area resulting in lower cost and lower loss of energy. Based on this assumption a solar panel containing four rows of 2  cm ×  90  cm solar cells is designed and implemented. A Fresnel lens panel including four 90  cm ×  20  cm semi-Fresnel arrays is placed on a the solar cell module at a distance equal to its focal length which is 5  cm. Test results show that the designed model effectively increases the efficiency of the PV system, reducing its cost and loss of energy [7].|$|E

Odds ratios for the highest occupational exposure <b>to</b> <b>sunlight</b> were 0. 74  (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 61  to 0. 89) for mortality from multiple sclerosis, compared with 1. 21  (1. 09  to 1. 34) for mortality from non-melanoma skin cancer.
