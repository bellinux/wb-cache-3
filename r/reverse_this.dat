5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, {{the rehabilitation of}} many of the victims of Stalin's purges, and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. But as soon as he became leader, Brezhnev began to <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> process, and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude.|$|E
5|$|The town of Chesham grew {{rapidly in}} the 19th century. After the parish was {{transferred}} to the Diocese of Oxford, reforms introduced by the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, led to the parish being partitioned, eventually becoming four independent parishes (Chesham, Latimer, Waterside and Ashley Green). In 1980 it was decided to <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> decision, and over the 1980s and 1990s three of these parishes (Chesham, Waterside and Ashley Green) were reunited under St.Mary's Church.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Samus awakens {{aboard a}} Galactic Federation starship, where she learns that Dark Samus's Phazon-based attacks have {{corrupted}} her. The Federation equips her {{suit with a}} Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that enables her to harness the Phazon energy within herself. She is informed that her fellow bounty hunters, also corrupted with Phazon and equipped with PEDs, have gone missing during their missions to investigate several planets embedded with Leviathan Seeds. Samus is first sent to the planet Bryyo and later Elysia to determine {{what happened to her}} missing comrades. She soon discovers that both planets and their inhabitants are slowly being corrupted by the Leviathan Seeds; and that she must destroy the seeds to <b>reverse</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the approval of the}} new five-cent coin, the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern coins in 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the <b>reverse.</b> <b>This</b> {{has come to be known}} as the Shield nickel.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{artist and}} critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) first {{used the term}} rinascita {{retrospectively}} in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define {{what he described as}} a break with the barbarities of gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay {{with the collapse of the}} Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began to <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> decline in the arts. Vasari saw antique art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.|$|E
5|$|Yaropolk {{is found}} aiding {{his father and}} his uncle Vsevolod in 1078, when Oleg Svyatoslavich (and his brother Boris) {{attempted}} to gain the throne of Chernigov from Vsevolod. Oleg had been allied to the Polovtsy, and with their help defeated Vsevolod in battle. Grand Prince Izyaslav and Yaropolk, as well as Vsevolod's son Vladimir Monomakh, were able to <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> result, and Oleg was forced to retreat to Tmutorokan. Grand Prince Izyaslav, Yaropolk's father, {{died as a result of}} the battle.|$|E

5|$|The Gliders {{returned}} to the Marshmallow the next day for a match against Canada, another team considered a strong chance for a medal, {{in front of a}} capacity crowd of 7,200. The Gliders squandered early opportunities, and Canada won the first quarter 20–12. Strong defensive play by Nott and Gauci helped the Gliders <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> in the second, and left Canada with only a one-point 33–32 lead at half time. The second half saw Canada slowly increase their lead, keeping tied with Australia 4–4 {{in the first half of}} third, 6–4 in the last half of the third, 6–4 in the first half of the fourth, and 8–6 in the last half of the fourth. Australia's top players were Crispin, who had 13 points and 15 rebounds; Merritt, who earned 16 points; and Chaplin, with eight points, five rebounds and seven assists. The loss raised the prospect that Australia might not make the finals at all, but Crispin remained confident that they could.|$|E
5|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{was selected}} for the battlecruisers despite the fact it needed more room than geared turbines to allow for better underwater protection that wartime experience showed was essential. First used in the s, it also had several other advantages. The turbines could run at their optimum speed, without regard to propeller speed, which was economical on fuel and the machinery could be easily sub-divided which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. The substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines meant that the motors could be mounted further {{to the rear of}} the ship, which reduced both vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Also, the ship could go astern at full power simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Despite these factors and the fact that American companies would have struggled to produce the very large geared steam turbines needed for such big ships, the Curtis Company tried unsuccessfully to convince the Navy to <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> decision. The Navy countered that doing so would mean a complete rearrangement of machinery spaces and a reduction in underwater protection.|$|E
