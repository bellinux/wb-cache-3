50|$|A subunit vaccine {{presents}} an antigen to {{the immune system}} without introducing viral particles, whole or otherwise. One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus and administering this by itself. A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins can be denatured and will then become associated with antibodies different from the desired antibodies. A second method of making a subunit vaccine involves putting an antigen's gene from the targeted virus or bacterium into another virus (virus vector), yeast (yeast vector) {{in the case of}} the hepatitis B vaccine or attenuated bacterium (bacterial vector) to make a recombinant virus or bacteria to serve as the important component of a recombinant vaccine (called a recombinant subunit vaccine). The <b>recombinant</b> <b>vector</b> that is genomically modified will express the antigen. The antigen (one or more subunits of protein) is extracted from the vector. Just like the highly successful subunit vaccines, the recombinant-vector-produced antigen will be of little to no risk to the patient. This is the type of vaccine currently in use for hepatitis B, and it is experimentally popular, being used to try to develop new vaccines for difficult-to-vaccinate-against viruses such as ebolavirus and HIV.|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{construct}} a <b>recombinant</b> <b>vector</b> of human sperm specific VDAC 3 gene for production of VDAC 3 antibody, which is potential as male contraception vaccine. Methods: Target fragment sequence of VDAC 3 gene was obtained through amplification of human sperm VDAC 3 cDNA with primers covering exon 5 to exon 8. Its PCR product in size of 435 bp was cloned to the pET 101 /D-TOPO expression vector (5753 bp). E. coli bacteria were transformed with this vector. Cloning of VDAC 3 fragment gene to the vector was confirmed by the using of XbaI restriction enzyme and PCR colony method with primers covering exons 5 - 8 of the human VDAC 3 gene. Results: Alignment analysis of amplified fragment covering exon 5 to exon 8 of VDAC 3 gene showed 94 % homology to human VDAC 3 gene from databank. After cloning to the expression vector and transformation to E. coli competent cells, twelve colonies could grow in culture media. Gel electrophoresis of sliced VDAC 3 <b>recombinant</b> <b>vector</b> showed a single band in the size of 6181 bp in 8 colonies. After application of PCR colony and amplicon sequencing, the result showed a single band in the size of 435 bp and fragment sequence with 94 % identity to human VDAC 3 gene. Conclusion: The construction of human sperm specific VDAC 3 gene <b>recombinant</b> <b>vector</b> was established in this study.

Its bioactivity and antitumor effects were investigated in the SGC 7901 human gastric cancer cell line. Interfering RNA (RNAi) targeting human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) was applied to construct the pYr 1. 1 -hTERT-shRNA vector.

All the plasmids were delivered into SGC 7901 cells using calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CPNPs). Expression of yCDglyTK and hTERT was detected by immunofluorescence, real-time PCR and western blot analysis.

The virus genome is a 153 kbp double-stranded DNA molecule encoding more than 80 genes. The interest of HSV- 1 as gene transfer vector stems from its ability to infect many different cell types, both quiescent and proliferating cells, the very high packaging capacity of the virus capsid, the outstanding neurotropic adaptations that this virus has evolved, {{and the fact that it}} never integrates into the cellular chromosomes, thus avoiding the risk of insertional mutagenesis.

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{is a human}} DNA {{tumor virus}} that {{efficiently}} immortalizes human primary B lymphocytes in vitro. Although viral genes that are expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes {{have been shown to}} function in cellular growth control, their detailed genetic analysis has been cumbersome for two reasons.
