He was Colonel George Rogers Clark,(1) Commander-in-chief of the backwoodsmen of Kentucky, whose power was <b>reenforced</b> by that strange thing called an education. It was this, no doubt, gave him command of words when he chose to use them.|$|E

This clouded Helen's judgment, but <b>reenforced</b> her pride. She had meant well when she tried to help Sadie with Bob, and could not give way to her husband's unreasonable prejudice. This was a matter of principle. She could help Bob and must not be daunted by vulgar gossip.|$|E

If he could hold out now, he need not be afraid again, because the odds against him would never be so heavy. The craving was <b>reenforced</b> by pain and bodily fatigue; his jangled nerves demanded a stimulant. Yet to win would make the next {{conflict}} easier, and he had resources that he tried to marshal against the enemy.|$|E

Frank stood still farther out on a cracked point that made me tremble, and his yell <b>reenforced</b> Jones's.

60|$|The {{details of}} the defense were quickly arranged, for James Morris had often speculated upon just {{what to do in}} such a {{situation}} as was now at hand. Everything left outside of the palisade was brought in and then the gates were closed, barred, and <b>reenforced</b> by large rocks which lay handy. This accomplished, every gun and pistol in the post was examined, cleaned, and put into perfect order for use, and powder and ball were dealt out liberally. The Indians also looked after their bows and arrows, and hunting knives and tomahawks were not forgotten.|$|E

He sat contemplating her as she lay back among the cushions, and suddenly he seemed to see in her the rebellious child of which her father had spoken. No wonder Eldon Parr had misunderstood her, had sought to crush her spirit! She was to be dealt with in no common way, nor was the consuming yearning he discerned in her to be lightly satisfied.|$|E

60|$|The {{week before}} Christmas {{the sky had}} {{smoothed}} away its every trace of rain. Light snows had sugared the feathery outlines of the distant peaks, and the delighted tourist had hung up his mackintosh and umbrella, deciding that the climates of Southern France and Italy {{were not to be}} considered with that of Southern California. Now the clouds had returned <b>reënforced.</b> The range had grown richer in color, almost black, except when the sun shot for a moment his presence in temporary triumph against a spur, that glistened responsively, while the cañons scowled in dark disapproval. Then, all at once, a gloom, like a half-dropped curtain, settled back of the foothills, defying the prophecies of the most ancient mariner of the Coast.|$|E
60|$|The Filipinos {{were now}} {{thoroughly}} frightened, for the Americans {{were making a}} great outcry down by the railroad bridge, and they imagined {{that they were to}} be attacked from several points at once. Some started to run, and as soon as Colonel Funston's men began to rain their bullets into the long trenches, more followed, until the enemy was in a panic. Then the Americans began to cross the bridge and stream in great numbers, and the Filipinos, although <b>reënforced</b> by a body of Macabebes just at this time, could not make an effective stand. Calumpit was left behind, and a running fight ensued which ended at Apalit, when a violent tropical thunderstorm {{put an end to the}} day's operations. It was thought that the rebels' headquarters would be found at Apalit; but this had, at the last moment, been removed to San Isidro, toward which General Lawton was now advancing.|$|E
60|$|As we {{all were}} packed into a tight coach, the rain still pouring, I began to wish mute Nature would not be quite so {{energetic}} in distilling her tears. A few sprinkling showers, or a graceful wreath of mist, might be all very well; but a steady, driving rain, that obliged us to shut up the carriage windows, and coated them with mist {{so that we could}} not look out, why, I say it is enough to put out the fire of sentiment in any heart. We {{might as well have been}} rolled up in a bundle and carried through the country, for all the seeing it was possible to do under such circumstances. It, therefore, should be stated, that we did keep bravely up in our poetic zeal, which kindly Mrs. W. also <b>reënforced,</b> by distributing certain very delicate sandwiches to support the outer man.|$|E
40|$|Ronald Creagh, Deference : Postmodernity and Anarchist Dissidence The anarchist {{critique}} is {{not primarily}} aimed at people or organizations, but rather {{at the social}} structure, the system and the elitist mentality and hierarchical relationships that it <b>reenforces.</b> This critique aims to, on the contrary, <b>reenforce</b> different loyalties, other life styles {{and other types of}} behavior. The anarchists are not opposed to the state because it is not perfect or because it is controlled by a particular social class, but because the structural conditions necessary for its existence are unacceptable. To accept the idea that the state is inevitable is to accept the idea that the people are to be inevitably alienated from the decision making process. This is an epistemological bias that raises ethical questions, misperceives the phenomenon of postmodernity and falsifies understanding of decision making. Creagh Ronald.

They were utterly worn out, and it was found necessary to <b>reënforce</b> them by men from the Marblehead and other vessels. Several field-guns had been brought ashore, and although the firing from the Spaniards was heavy, our gallant men held the ground they had first claimed.|$|R
40|$|Ursula K. Le Guin’s 1969 Novel The Left Hand of Darkness and “The Outcast,” a 1992 {{episode of}} Star Trek: The Next Generation, {{have both been}} criticized for their {{representations}} of gender and sexuality essentially because they fail to remove fully the “traditional straitjackets” of the male-female binary and the heteronormativity they seek to challenge. A selection of this criticism is discussed, along with a close reading of each work. Despite different media, {{a difference in the}} degree of focus on gender, and the years separating them, the two works share striking similarities, making them worthy of comparison. This paper will reveal two shared features of The Left Hand of Darkness and “The Outcast” that undermine their stated or presumed aims: first, both works serve to <b>reenforce</b> a male-female gender binary, and second, while the use of androgynous characters has the potential to challenge heterosexual norms, both works <b>reenforce</b> such norms by gendering — specifically, feminizing — otherwise androgynous characters and conflating biological sex or gender identity with sexual orientation through romantic relationships with male protagonists...|$|R
60|$|This {{train of}} thought {{led her to the}} unaccustomed task of {{analyzing}} his character. For the first time since her marriage comparisons crept into her mind, and she awoke {{to the fact that he}} was not a masterful man--even among men. For all his self-confidence-self-assurance, perhaps, would be the better word--he was in reality a follower, not a leader; a gleaner. He did not lack ideas. She tried to arrest the process in her brain when she got as far as asking herself whether it might not be that he lacked ideals. Since in business matters he never had taken her into his confidence, and since she would not at any rate have understood such things, she had no proof of such a failing. But one or two vague remarks of Trixton Brent's which she recalled, and Howard's own request that she should be friendly with Brent, <b>reenforced</b> her instinct on this point.|$|E

Conditions as they exist are the result of an {{evolution}} for which no one man is responsible. That does not alter the fact that the conditions are wrong. But the railroads, before they consolidated, found the political boss in power, and had to pay him for favours. The citizen was the culprit to start with, just as he is the culprit now, because he does not take sufficient interest in his government to make it honest.

60|$|The impudence of it left Cahusac speechless. But {{among the}} English buccaneers {{in the square}} there were many who savoured the audacious humour of the trapped dictating terms to the trappers. Laughter broke from them. It spread into a roar of acclamation; for bluff is a weapon dear to every adventurer. Presently, when they {{understood}} it, even Cahusac's French followers were carried off their feet by that wave of jocular enthusiasm, until in his truculent obstinacy Cahusac remained the only dissentient. He withdrew in mortification. Nor was he to be mollified until the following day brought him his revenge. This came {{in the shape of}} a messenger from Don Miguel with a letter in which the Spanish Admiral solemnly vowed to God that, since the pirates had refused his magnanimous offer to permit them to surrender with the honours of war, he would now await them at the mouth of the lake there to destroy them on their coming forth. He added that should they delay their departure, he would so soon as he was <b>reenforced</b> by a fifth ship, the Santo Nino, on its way to join him from La Guayra, himself come inside to seek them at Maracaybo.|$|E

30|$|The {{acceptance}} of misinformation or misleading information {{by the people}} depends on their prior beliefs and opinions [5]. People believe things which support their prior thoughts without questioning them. The same is also supported by research in cognitive psychology [6]. The authors have brought out that preexisting political, religious or social views make people accept information without verification if it conforms to their beliefs. Countering such ideological and personal beliefs is indeed very difficult. Another important finding was that countering the misinformation may lead to amplifying the beliefs and <b>reenforcing</b> them.|$|R
60|$|When L'Olonnois and his buccaneers {{entered the}} town of Gibraltar {{they found that the}} greater part of the {{inhabitants}} had fled, but there were many people left, and these were made prisoners as fast as they were discovered. They were all forced to go into the great church, and then the pirates, fearing that the Spaniards outside of the town might be <b>reënforced</b> and come back again to attack them, carried a number of cannon into the church and fortified the building. When this had been done, they felt safe and began to act {{as if they had been}} a menagerie of wild beasts let loose upon a body of defenceless men, women, and children. Not only did these wretched men rush into the houses, stealing everything valuable they could find and were able to carry away, but when they had gathered together all they could discover they tortured their poor prisoners by every cruel method they could think of, in order to make them tell where more treasures were concealed. Many of these unfortunates had had nothing to hide, and therefore could give no information to their brutal inquisitors, and others died without telling what they had done with their valuables. When the town had been thoroughly searched and sifted, the pirates sent men out into the little villages and plantations in the country, and even hunters and small farmers were captured and made to give up everything they possessed which was worth taking.|$|E

While there, she co-wrote and co-edited the groundbreaking book The Empire Strikes Back - Race and Racism in 1970s Britain (1982). That book, co-authored with Paul Gilroy and Valerie Amos among others, challenged the then-current academic paradigm of race and race relations as problems embedded in communities of colour rather than problems within society and its institutions creating, codifying and enforcing racism.

This youth was a fellow of decidedly quick parts, and in one forenoon made such a clearing in our garden that I was delighted.
