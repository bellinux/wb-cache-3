50|$|The {{design of}} client {{software}} {{was just a}} few kilobytes of code and was based on Andy Wightman's own tiny <b>ROMable</b> graphical windowing system called GROW (Graphical <b>ROMable</b> Object Windows) which he had developed whilst at Digital Research in the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|DR DOS {{offered some}} {{extended}} command line tools with command line help, verbose error messages, sophisticated command line history and editing (HISTORY directive) {{as well as}} support for file and directory passwords built right into the kernel. It was also cheaper to license than MS-DOS, and was <b>ROMable</b> right from the start. The ROMed version of DR DOS was also named ROS (ROM Operating System). DRI was approached {{by a number of}} PC manufacturers who were interested in a third-party DOS, which prompted several updates to the system.|$|E
50|$|LynxOS is the company's {{real-time}} operating system. It is UNIX-compatible and POSIX-compliant. It features predictable worst-case response time, preemptive scheduling, real-time priorities, <b>ROMable</b> kernel, {{and memory}} locking. With LynxOS 7.0 is marketed {{as a military}} grade Operating system, and is intended for developers to embed these security features as they design their system, rather than adding security as an afterthought. This security {{can be used to}} protect both user accessible and also machine to machine (M2M) based embedded devices utilizing access control lists, audit, quotas, local trusted path, account management, trusted menu manager and OpenPAM.|$|E
50|$|Volder {{teamed up}} with Malcolm MacMillan to build Athena, a fixed-point desktop {{calculator}} utilizing his binary CORDIC algorithm. The design was introduced to Hewlett-Packard in June 1965, but not accepted. Still, MacMillan introduced David S. Cochran (HP) to Volder's algorithm and when Cochran later met Volder he referred him to a similar approach John E. Meggitt (IBM) had proposed as pseudo-multiplication and pseudo-division in 1961. Meggitt's method was also suggesting the use of base 10 rather than base 2, as used by Volder's CORDIC so far. These efforts led to the <b>ROMable</b> logic implementation of a decimal CORDIC prototype machine inside of Hewlett-Packard in 1966, build by and conceptually derived from Thomas E. Osborne's prototypical Green Machine, a four-function, floating-point desktop calculator he had completed in DTL logic in December 1964. This project resulted in the public demonstration of Hewlett-Packard's first desktop calculator with scientific functions, the hp 9100A in March 1968, with series production starting later that year.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The uClinux port is a {{derivative}} of Linux kernel intended for microcontrollers without memory management units (MMU) [1]. It provides a single shared address space for all processes. Whereas, uC/OS-II is a portable, <b>ROMable,</b> scalable, preemptive, real-time deterministic multitasking kernel for mi-croprocessors, microcontrollers and DSPs [2]. In this paper, we implemented uCos and uClinux kernels {{on the same}} NIOS-II platform and compared the performance. Index Terms—Embedded OS, uClinux, uCos, benchmarks, performance...|$|E
40|$|Critical systems must be {{configured}} to meet changing functionality, time-criticality and fault-tolerance needs. Configurations may {{be performed}} statically at operating system build or boot -time. Dynamic configurations are also possible during run-time, when {{the operating system}} is loaded and running. For example, operating sytem kernel modules, operating system components, middleware and application programs may all be configured statically or dynamically. Operating systems may be configured to scale from <b>ROMable</b> versions to full-fledged multiprocessor clusters, which we term, the horizontal configurability feature. In addition, to address different types of applications, operating systems may be configured with enhanced or reduced functionality, which we term the vertical configurability feature. Finally, when such configurations are performed, higher level operating system components, middleware, and other Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software products expect to experience the gains derived from such configurations in terms of enhanced performance or predictability...|$|E
40|$|In this project, remote power {{management}} and meter reading system is implemented using ARM 7 based LPC 2148 microcontroller. The LPC 2148 {{is a very}} popular ARM 7 microcontroller with 512 KB flash, 64 KB of RAM and with several I/O peripherals. Power management system is realized using a {{power management}} module to acquire voltage, current and power. A GSM/GPRS module is used to send information {{on each of the}} above parameters wirelessly. All the tasks are managed using µC/OS-II based RTOS. µC/OS-II, the Real-Time Kernel is a highly portable, <b>ROMable,</b> very scalable, pre-emptive real-time, multitasking kernel (RTOS) for microprocessors and microcontrollers. GNU ARM/Keil compiler and assembler will be used for building the applications. LPC 2148 development board will be used to test the built application. Additional hardware modules will be used to demonstrate the complete setup...|$|E
