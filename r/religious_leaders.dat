5|$|A {{group of}} sixty-one <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> in Washington, D.C. {{sent a letter}} to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Redskin's owner Daniel Snyder stating their moral {{obligation}} to join the Change the Mascot movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} forty years the {{congregation}} {{had a series}} of generally short-tenured <b>religious</b> <b>leaders.</b> These included Delbanco (1862–63), Moses Bauer (1863–64), L.

5|$|On the Monday {{following}} the first sit-in, the Baptist Minister's Conference of Nashville, representing 79 congregations, unanimously voted {{to support the}} student movement, thus throwing the weight of Nashville's black religious community behind the students. Local <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> called on people of good will to boycott downtown merchants who practiced segregation. Nashville's black community strongly supported the boycott, causing economic hardship for the merchants.|$|E
5|$|Abortion activist Henry Morgentaler's {{appointment}} to the order on 1 July 2008 not only {{marked the first time}} the Advisory Council had not been unanimous in its decision, but also proved {{to be one of the}} most controversial appointments in the order's history, drawing both praise from abortion rights groups and the ire of Members of Parliament, groups opposing abortion, and <b>religious</b> <b>leaders.</b> The latter organized protests outside of Rideau Hall on 9 July, while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the official residence of that province's lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|Between 1880 and 1895 {{the city}} {{experienced}} a huge rise in corruption, as crime bosses, such as Soapy Smith, worked {{side by side}} with elected officials and the police to control elections, gambling, and bunco gangs. The city also experienced a depression in 1893 after the crash of silver prices. In 1887, the precursor to the international charity United Way was formed in Denver by local <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> who raised funds and coordinated various charities to help Denver's poor. By 1890, Denver had grown to be the second-largest city west of Omaha, Nebraska. In 1900, whites represented 96.8% of Denver's population.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before the valleys became a coal mining area. The earliest individuals {{to come to the}} fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found {{a way out of the}} Rhondda through sport; charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political and <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.|$|E
5|$|From 1962 until 1965 Fakih {{served as}} the First Deputy Chair of Muhammadiyah under Ahmad Badawi, {{providing}} guidance for young <b>religious</b> <b>leaders.</b> During the killings and power shift which followed the 30 September Movement coup attempt, Fakih and several Muhammadiyah members sent a letter requesting that Masyumi be allowed to reform; this permission was not granted. For Badawi's second term, Fakih served as an advisor to the chairman, often taking management responsibilities. He {{was selected as the}} organisation's chairman at the 37th Muhammadiyah Congress in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University hosts notable {{speakers}} each year, {{largely because}} {{of the success of the}} Georgetown Lecture Fund and the Office of Communications.

The Office of the President hosts numerous symposia on religious topics, such as Nostra aetate, Pacem in terris, and the Building Bridges Seminar.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, Kyrgyzstan saw an {{outbreak}} of ethnic violence in which as many as 2,000 people, primarily Uzbeks, were killed, {{and hundreds of thousands}} displaced. Following the violence, dozens of Uzbek community and <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> were arrested by the Kyrgyzstani government and accused of inciting ethnic violence, among them Azimzhan Askarov, who had been filming killings and arson attacks during the riots. Askarov then distributed the video to international media and accused the Kyrgyz military of complicity in the killings.|$|E
5|$|In late October 1813, Hurshid Pasha {{declared}} a general amnesty for the rebels that had survived, though Karađorđe and some senior Serbian <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> were specifically exempted. Many rebel leaders accepted Hurshid Pasha's offer of amnesty {{and agreed to}} lay down their arms, the most notable of these being Miloš Obrenović, the rebel commander in Užice. A large number of Serb refugees subsequently returned to their homes, as did many of the Muslims that had been displaced in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Neither the Jewish <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> in Poland nor the {{authorities}} allowed archaeological excavations {{at the camp}} {{out of respect for}} the dead. Approval for a limited archaeological study was issued {{for the first time in}} 2010 to a British team from Staffordshire University using non-invasive technology and Lidar remote sensing. The soil resistance was analysed at the site with ground-penetrating radar. Features that appeared to be structural were found, two of which were thought to be the remains of the gas chambers, and the study was allowed to continue.|$|E

5|$|Scout {{units are}} usually {{operated}} by adult volunteers, such as parents and carers, former Scouts, students, and community leaders, including teachers and <b>religious</b> <b>leaders.</b> Scout Leadership positions are often divided into 'uniform' and 'lay' positions. Uniformed leaders have received formal training, {{such as the}} Wood Badge, and have received a warrant for a rank within the organization. Lay members commonly hold part-time roles such as meeting helpers, committee members and advisors, though there are {{a small number of}} full-time lay professionals.|$|E
5|$|The Legion spurred {{several million}} Roman Catholics across the U.S. {{to sign up}} for the boycott, {{allowing}} local <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> to determine which films to protest. Conservative Protestants tended to support much of the crackdown, particularly in the South, where anything relating to the state of race relations or miscegenation could not be portrayed. Although the Central Conference of American Rabbis joined in the protest, it was an uneasy alliance given the heavy presence of Jewish studio executives and producers, which, it was felt had inspired {{at least some of the}} vitriol from the Catholic groups.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi Arabia women's {{national}} football {{team would be}} the national team representing the kingdom in inter{{national football}}. However, the team does not yet exist because of influence of <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> in Saudi Arabia, systematic discrimination against women's sport, and active opposition of political leaders and sport administrators. International pressure has come {{to bear on the}} country to field a women's team, and FIFA now allows the hijab to be worn in competition. A meeting at the College of Business Administration in Jeddah was seen as a possible first step in a team eventually being created.|$|E

5|$|Although {{absolute}} {{in theory}} and in principle, the sultan's powers were limited in practice. Political decisions had {{to take into account}} the opinions and attitudes of important members of the dynasty, the bureaucratic and military establishments, as well as <b>religious</b> <b>leaders.</b> Beginning in the last decades of the sixteenth century, the role of the Ottoman sultans in the government of the empire began to decrease, in a period known as the Transformation of the Ottoman Empire. Despite being barred from inheriting the throne, women of the Imperial Harem—especially the reigning sultan's mother, known as the Valide Sultan—also played an important behind-the-scenes political role, effectively ruling the empire during the period known as the Sultanate of Women.|$|E
5|$|Amin retaliated {{against the}} {{attempted}} invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972, by purging {{the army of}} Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups. In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara barracks. By early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and {{at least twice as}} many civilians, had disappeared. The victims soon came to include members of other ethnic groups, <b>religious</b> <b>leaders,</b> journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals. In this atmosphere of violence, many other people were killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the River Nile.|$|E
