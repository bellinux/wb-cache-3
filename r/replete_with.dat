5|$|In his foreword, Kwee {{wrote that}} Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang was {{intended}} to lead readers to consider how fate is often {{at odds with the}} wants of those involved. Critical readings have, however, been diverse. The sinologist Myra Sidharta notes that the book is <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> mysticism common at the time, as does another sinologist, John Kwee. The latter cites four examples: a dream of Marsiti's, later shown to be prophetic, in which she is forcibly separated from Aij Tjeng despite his previous promise that they would never part; a discussion of reuniting with loved ones after death; Marsiti's spirit attending her daughter's wedding; and a scene {{towards the end of the}} novel in which Marsiti's spirit guides Roosminah's daughter to pick flowers for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Nio Joe Lan, in his history of Chinese Malay literature, notes that Kwee was the only Chinese writer of romances to also write on Eastern (particularly Chinese) philosophy. He finds mysticism to be a common theme in Kwee's works, noting it as particularly well-developed in the later novel Soemangetnja Boenga Tjempaka (The Joy of the Cempaka Flowers).|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} shadow of Saltwell Towers {{there is a}} maze, built in 1877 by Wailes for his family's use. The maze was replanted with yew trees {{as part of the}} 2005 {{regeneration}} project to the original plans laid by Wailes. Also renovated was Saltwell Dene, a picturesque wooded area with a stream, bridges, cascades and a lily pond which inspired local artist Thomas Miles Richardson to paint a watercolour of it in the 19thcentury. Saltwell Dene was the final part of the 21stcentury restoration project to be completed, reopening to the public in March 2005. At either end of the Broadwalk there are two wooden shelters whilst the centre of the Broadwalk is marked by the Almond Pavilion. The pavilion was opened in 1881 and was a refreshment pavilion for decades before it fell into disrepair; by the 1980s it was derelict and it was then completely destroyed by fire. It has been fully reconstructed, including a replica of the original clock tower, and is once more a refreshment kiosk with new toilet facilities. It offers panoramic views into the northern fields and across the boating lake. An oriental garden was opened in 2011 to mark the twenty-year anniversary of the twinning arrangement between Gateshead and Komatsu. This includes a gravel pond, waterfalls and stone lanterns.

40|$|Iron (Fe) {{deficiency}} anemia is {{a global}} health concern and Fe fortification and supplementation are common corrective strategies. Fe is essential {{not only for the}} human host but also for nearly all gut bacteria. We studied the impact of Fe deficiency and Fe repletion on the gut microbiota in rats. Weanling rats were fed an Fe-deficient diet for 24 d and then repleted for 13 d with FeSO(4) (n = 15) or electrolytic Fe (n = 14) at 10 and 20 mg Fe. kg diet(- 1). In addition, one group of rats (n = 8) received the Fe-deficient diet and one group In = 3) received a Fe-sufficient control diet for all 37 d. Fecal samples were collected at baseline and after the depletion and repletion periods, and colonic tissues were examined histologically. Microbial metabolite composition in cecal water was measured and fecal samples were analyzed for microbial composition with temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and qPCR. Compared to Fe-sufficient rats, Fe-deficient rats had significantly lower concentrations of cecal butyrate (- 87 %) and propionate (- 72 %) and the abundance of dominant species was strongly modified, including greater numbers of lactobacilli and Enterobacteriaceae and a large significant decrease of the Roseburia spp. /E. rectale group, a major butyrate producer. Repletion with 20 mg FeSO(4). kg diet(- 1) significantly increased cecal butyrate concentrations and partially restored bacterial populations compared to Fe-deficient rats at endpoint. The effects on the gut microbiota were stronger in rats <b>repleted</b> <b>with</b> FeSO(4) than in rats <b>repleted</b> <b>with</b> electrolytic Fe, suggesting ferrous Fe may be more available for utilization by the gut microbiota than elemental Fe. Repletion with FeSO(4) significantly increased neutrophilic infiltration of the colonic mucosa compared to Fe-deficient rats. In conclusion, Fe depletion and repletion strongly affect the composition and metabolic activity of rat gut microbiota. J. Nutr. 142 : 271 - 277, 2012...|$|R

40|$|Three-month-old Corridale lambs, {{confined}} in metabolism crates, were <b>repleted</b> <b>with</b> calcium or phosphorus or both Ca and P for 6 weeks (repletion diets HL, LH, HH, respectively, Ca 5. 0 and P 3. 7 g/kg) after being offered a low Ca and P (Ca 1. 25 and P 0. 66 g/kg) roughage-based diet (LL) for 12 weeks. At {{the end of}} the experiment, the Ca and P kinetics of the lambs was studied using a combination of balance studies and isotope techniques. The depletion diet substantially reduced the plasma P concentrations, DM intake and digestibility, liveweight gain, and Ca and P content of the bones. During repletion, lambs fed on the HL, LH and HH diets consumed minus 16, 28 and 46 % more DM than the lambs on the LL diet. The liveweight gains were 15. 5, minus 17. 8, 41. 1 and 134. 5 g/day for lambs given diets LL, HL, LH and HH, respectively, during the repletion period. During the 6 -week repletion period, there was complete remineralization of the rib bones of lambs fed on diet HH, but only partial remineralization of the metatarsal bones. The results indicated the need to feed supplementary Ca as well as P during dietary mineral repletion. The DM digestibilities of the lambs fed on the LL depletion diet did not improve during repletion. There were strong correlations between DM intake and plasma inorganic P, muscle P or exchangeable P pool, but not DM digestibility, suggesting that the reductions in feed intake with P deficiency are due to some effect on intermediary metabolism of the animal rather than on the gastrointestinal tract. When the lambs were <b>repleted</b> <b>with</b> diet HL, they had the highest Ca absorption coefficient, level of exchangeable body Ca, bone accretion of Ca and bone resorption of Ca.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of vitamin A {{deficiency}} and repletion on rat insulin release and islet cellular retinol binding protein (CRBP) and cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP). Biphasic insulin release from vitamin A-deficient perifused islets was markedly impaired. Release remained impaired with retinoic acid (RA) repletion, 2 micrograms/g diet compared to release from islets of rats <b>repleted</b> <b>with</b> retinol {{in the form of}} retinyl palmitate, 4 micrograms/g diet. Release normalized with RA, 8 micrograms/g diet. Vitamin A deficiency did not affect islet insulin content, cell size, number or structure. In vivo, vitamin A-deficient rats had impaired glucose-induced acute insulin release and glucose intolerance, which improved with repletion. Normal islets had greater concentrations of CRBP than CRABP; vitamin A deficiency reduced CRBP but not CRABP levels. We conclude retinol is required for normal insulin secretion.

Because the neutrophil is the first cell to respond to infection, this study explores the effect of vitamin A deficiency on neutrophil proteinases.

The 28 kDa cathepsin G-like enzyme, which migrated with the same mobility as elastase on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, was quantified using Western blots. The 24 kDa cathepsin G-like enzyme was quantified using zymogram gels. This activity was inhibited by chymostatin. Other neutrophil proteinases, elastase, plasminogen activators and gelatinase, were not altered significantly by vitamin A deficiency.
