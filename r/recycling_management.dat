50|$|The Hub has {{a number}} of ESD {{features}} and incorporates strategies of water, waste and <b>recycling</b> <b>management</b> that contribute to its Greenstar rating. The outer skin of the Hub incorporates automated sunshading. The shade cells have been designed {{so that they can be}} easily replaced with solar cells as research into solar energy results in improved technology and the infrastructure for that evolution has been built into the façade and building management systems. This meets RMIT’s request for future proofing the ESD performance of the building while at the same time enabling the university’s solar research department to continue aspects of its research in situ - the entire building façade, in other words, has the capacity to be upgraded as solar technology evolves and may one day generate enough electricity to run the whole building.Perimeter air intakes incorporated into the double glazed inner skin provide fresh air to the working environment which lowers energy consumption and provides a more desirable thermal comfort alternative to a wholly conditioned work environment. Lighting is sensor controlled by the BMS to reduce the need for artificial lighting when not required.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to explore}} the state of {{environmental}} management accounting practice and the motivations for its use {{with a view to}} improving waste and <b>recycling</b> <b>management</b> by local government. The focus is on practice in local governments situated in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Prior studies suggest the need for environmental management accounting as a supporting tool for waste management. Design/methodology/approach – An exploratory case study method was applied in 12 NSW local government organisations. In each local government interviews were conducted with managers responsible for waste and recycling issues. Findings – Contrary to prior research this study found that, in the local governments investigated, an increasing amount of environmental management accounting information is being made available. The case studies found two main motivations encouraging the development of environmental management accounting in local government: first, social structural influences, such as regulatory pressures from different environmental regulatory bodies, environmental expectations from local communities, and pressures from peer councils; second, organisational contextual influences reflecting situational needs in the organisational contexts, such as complex waste operations and service designs, changes and uncertainties in waste and <b>recycling</b> <b>management,</b> and the council's strategic position for waste management. Research limitations/implications – The results imply that institutional theory and contingency theory provide different but complementary explanations for the development of environmental management accounting in waste management. Although previous environmental studies are overwhelmingly in favour of social system-based theories, such as institutional theory, to explain environmental changes in organisations, an organisation's contextual dynamics seem to be equally important. Originality/value – The findings about motivations provide useful information for environmental strategists and government regulators to make policies that improve accountability and the efficiency of waste and <b>recycling</b> <b>management</b> as well as promote future development of environmental management accounting to support sustainable waste management solutions.

40|$|AbstractSolid waste always produce {{negative}} impacts to the environment, thus effective solutions must be implemented. However, {{most people are}} not concerned {{of the importance of}} recycling. At the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) which has already launched the sustainable campus programme in 2007, the initiative to managing the solid waste and conducting the recycling programs were advocated through the Zero Waste Campus Initiative (ZWCI), where the team are committed to do the awareness, practices and enforcement regarding solid waste management in UKM. It would be undesirable if these initiatives to educate the majority of the community of UKM were not put into practice. To solve this problem, a study has been conducted to determine an effective method of <b>recycling</b> <b>management</b> at UKM in providing quality service that encouraged UKM's community to recycle.
