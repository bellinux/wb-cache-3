40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} a brief {{overview}} of Morgenthau's six tenets <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> and <b>of</b> his method, designed to provide the reader with a general familiarity with the realist school. The fundamental assumptions <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> as proposed by Niebuhr are discussed in some detail since assumptions about the nature of man provide the basis for ethical considerations. The next section of the study deals with actual realist policy prescriptions in order to demonstrate the consequences of the ethical position <b>of</b> <b>realism.</b> The final approach to a clarification of the realist ethic in this study is the examination of some representative criticisms <b>of</b> <b>realism.</b> Conclusions concerning the nature of the realist ethic suggested throughout this study are tested against critiques by two non-realists and one who is in sympathy with realism, and conclusions are drawn as to the validity of the ethical position <b>of</b> <b>realism...</b>|$|R

Most commentators praised the larger role of Rhys in the episode, the performance of actor Kai Owen and the <b>realism</b> <b>of</b> the acting and dialogue overall. However, {{a large proportion of}} reviewers criticised the special effects used to create the alien and it was subsequently compared by some to resembling a sock puppet or hand puppet. Whilst some reviewers identified with the plight of the alien, others felt that its poor realisation meant that it was hard to feel any sympathy for it.|$|E
5|$|From the {{unexpected}} <b>realism</b> <b>of</b> {{his first major}} figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company {{with a variety of}} high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, {{in the last year of}} both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} idea <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> in Western Marxism through the {{comparative}} approaches of Georg Lukacs, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno, Bertolt Brecht, Jean-Paul Sartre and Fredric Jameson in relation to non-Marxist theorists such as Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault. The issue <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> suffers from the controversial terminology <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> and reality. This is the reason why realism can be better viewed by Marxist perspectives that are firmly based on the category of the subject-object dialectic. This Marxian principle, thereby pertaining to the reality existing outside of subjectivity, substantiates the issue <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> as a continuing social and aesthetic project. By focusing on the category of reality in relation to the idea <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> in Western Marxist debates, this study explores {{the way in which the}} Marxist theorists understand the relationship between culture and society, and respond to the change of socio-economic conditions in each historical moment. These various discourses revolving around the issue <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> produce a similar agenda to explain the place of the artwork in the realm of culture. Such a similarity arises from their attempt to retain the idea <b>of</b> <b>realism,</b> even when they argue for an aesthetic of anti-realism. In this respect, my thesis questions the distinction between realism and modernism in Western Marxist discourses, and argues that such differentiation had been articulated by a political intention to sever Western Marxism from Stalinism. Their idea <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> is paradoxical in the sense that their formulations <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> aspire to a utopian project. This is the very way in which their idea <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> can be grasped as another facet of their political programme...|$|R
5|$|Simulating the geodynamo {{requires}} numerically {{solving a}} set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the <b>realism</b> <b>of</b> the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and {{the effect on the}} magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.|$|E
5|$|Synge's plays {{helped to}} set the {{dominant}} style of plays at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised <b>realism</b> <b>of</b> his writing {{was reflected in the}} training given at the theatre's school of acting, and plays of peasant life were the main staple of the repertoire {{until the end of the}} 1950s. Sean O'Casey, the next major dramatist to write for the Abbey, knew Synge's work well and attempted to do for the Dublin working classes what Synge had done for the rural poor. Brendan Behan, Brinsley MacNamara, and Lennox Robinson were all indebted to Synge.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Barton Fink is {{loosely based on}} Clifford Odets, a playwright from New York who in the 1930s joined the Group Theatre, a gathering of dramatists which included Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Their work emphasized social issues and employed Stanislavski's system of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of Odets' plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including Awake and Sing! and Waiting for Lefty (both in 1935). When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre and toward the familial <b>realism</b> <b>of</b> Eugene O'Neill, Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts.|$|E

5|$|The {{complications}} kept Ebert {{off the air}} for {{an extended}} period of time. Ebert made his first public appearance since mid-2006 at Ebertfest on April 25, 2007. He was unable to speak, instead communicating through his wife. He returned to reviewing on May 18, 2007, when three of his reviews were published in print. In July 2007, he revealed that he was still unable to speak. Ebert adopted a computerized voice system to communicate, eventually using a copy of his own voice created from his recordings by CereProc. In March 2010, his health trials and new computerized voice were featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Ebert later proposed a test to determine the <b>realism</b> <b>of</b> a synthesized voice.|$|E
5|$|The medieval setting {{has been}} the {{traditional}} background for epic fantasy. However, where historical fiction leaves versed readers knowing the historical outcome, original characters may increase suspense and empathy for the readers. Yet Martin felt historical fiction, particularly when set during the Middle Ages, had an excitement, grittiness, and a realness to it that was absent in fantasy with a similar backdrop. Thus, he wanted to combine the <b>realism</b> <b>of</b> historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies, subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue. He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in Homer's Iliad, where no one stands out as either a hero or a villain, {{as an example of}} what he wants to achieve with his books.|$|E

Further to the enhanced <b>realism</b> <b>of</b> the puppet design, voice roles for Captain Scarlet were, as opposed to Thunderbirds and other predecessors, also intended to be less caricatured. Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn note that, between Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet, a proliferation of English-accented voices altered the sound of the Supermarionation production and its impression on the viewer.|$|E

We have to bear the consequences of this in form of a more complicated concept of truth. The "internal " <b>of</b> "internal <b>realism</b> " points to the justification aspect of truth.

5|$|The tenth and {{eleventh}} {{books of}} the Bhagavata Purana are widely {{considered to be a}} poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the <b>realism</b> <b>of</b> pastoral life found in the Harivamsa.

Krishna's life is closer to that of a human being in Harivamsa, but is a symbolic universe in the Bhagavata Purana, where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The Bhagavata Purana manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.|$|E
