5|$|For safety, Canada's Wonderland uses a ride {{rating system}} that classifies the attractions {{based on the}} {{intensity}} of the ride. The ratings vary from 1, for rides that are calm and gentle, to 5, for rides that have high speeds, aggressive forces, and rapid elevation changes. A separate set of ride ratings criteria is used for attractions inside Splash Works, though the rides are still <b>rated</b> <b>on</b> a scale from 1 to 5.|$|E

40|$|The firm should pursue both maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> {{capital and}} maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> equity simultaneously. Maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> capital {{is the primary}} goal for firms because maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> capital {{guarantees}} efficiency. Therefore, maximum profit, maximum {{market value of the}} firm, maximum value of equity and maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> equity are inappropriate to be the primary goal. Since gross profit is independent of capital structure, capital structure just distributes return on capital into equity and debt (i. e., maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> equity determines capital structure). The maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> equity is the secondary goal that the firm pursues. Leverage makes the return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> equity be higher than interest rate. Leverage explains the puzzle of equity premium...|$|R

5|$|Upon {{completing}} a mission, the player is awarded a rank, {{starting with the}} lowest at C and going to B, A and S, which is the highest. The ranks are based on three categories: Power, Technique, and Speed, each determined by meeting certain conditions in a battle. All three categories are <b>rated</b> <b>on</b> a scale from 0-150, and added {{together to form a}} numerical ranking from 0-450 in addition to their letter ranking; for example, any score between 300-450 earns an S ranking. Unlike previous games, the numerical score is not converted into points that can be redeemed to purchase new maps and COs; instead, COs are unlocked after the completion of certain missions and all maps (with the exception of training missions) are available at the beginning of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The Fujita {{scale and}} the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by expert elicitation, using {{engineered}} wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado <b>rated</b> <b>on</b> the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.|$|E
