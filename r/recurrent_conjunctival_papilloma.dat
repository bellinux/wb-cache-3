40|$|AIM—To examine <b>conjunctival</b> <b>papillomas</b> for the {{presence}} of human papillomavirus (HPV) and koilocytosis.  METHODS—Archival paraffin embedded tissue from 55  conjunctival papillomas was analysed for {{the presence}} of HPV by polymerase chain reaction and subsequent filter hybridisation. Histological sections of the 55  papillomas were evaluated {{for the presence}} of koilocytosis.  RESULTS—HPV was present in 48  of 52  (92 %) β globin positive papillomas. HPV type 6 / 11 were found in 40  of 47  investigated papillomas and a double infection with HPV 6 / 11 and 16  was identified in a single papilloma. In six papillomas the HPV type could not be identified. Koilocytosis was present in 22  of 55  papillomas (40 %).  CONCLUSION—There is a strong association between HPV and <b>conjunctival</b> <b>papillomas.</b> HPV type 6 / 11 is the most common HPV type in <b>conjunctival</b> <b>papilloma.</b> The sensitivity of koilocytosis as an indicator of HPV in <b>conjunctival</b> <b>papilloma</b> is low. ...|$|R

The histopathological analysis evidenced a conjunctivalcovering epithelium with papillomatous changes and irregular acanthosis, at the expense of a proliferation of basaloid cells. In addition, the lesion exhibited multiple pseudohorn cysts containing keratin. With the above findings, a diagnosis of conjunctival seborrheic keratosis was established. The occurrence of seborrheic keratosis on the conjunctiva is rare. In this case, seborrheic keratosis was confirmed by pathologic report despite its similar appearance with papilloma.

40|$|Infectious agents {{contribute}} to around 18 % of human cancers worldwide. The role of infectious agents in ocular adnexal neoplasms {{is most likely}} as a cofactor to genetic and environmental risk factors. Several microorganisms have a pathogenic role in different ocular adnexal malignancies including human immunodeficiency virus in conjunctival squamous carcinoma; human herpes simplex virus- 8 in conjunctival Kaposi sarcoma; Helicobacter pylori, chlamydia and hepatitis C virus in ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas; and human papillomavirus (HPV) in <b>conjunctival</b> <b>papilloma</b> 1. <b>Conjunctival</b> <b>papilloma</b> is a benign tumor of the conjunctival mucosa.

Observations: A 79 -year-old Caucasian female {{with a history of}} a liver transplant twenty years ago, who was immunosuppressed with tacrolimus (2  mg daily) presented with a diffuse conjunctival and corneal squamous papilloma. Following treatment with four weekly subconjunctival interferon-α 2 b injections (3 million units/ 0. 5  mL) and 3 months of topical interferon-α 2 b therapy (1 million units/mL), four times daily, slow progression was documented.

40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} cell {{growth and}} the pattern of p 53 suppressor gene expression in atypical primary acquired melanosis (PAM) and in <b>recurrent</b> <b>conjunctival</b> melanoma. METHODS: Eighteen specimens of PAM with atypia and 24 specimens, comprising early and late lesions, from 12 patients with conjunctival melanoma were stained for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen using the PC 10 antibody, and for the p 53 gene product using the BP 53 - 12 - 1, 1801 and DO 7 clones. The immunoreactive cells were counted manually and the data evaluated statistically. RESULTS: Seven of nine PAM specimens progressing to melanoma expressed PC 10. None of these lesions expressed the p 53 gene product. The number of proliferating cells was higher in the late than in the early lesions of conjunctival melanoma. Four of the 12 recurrent melanomas displayed focal, but minimal, p 53 expression. The proliferating cell count in the p 53 positive tumours was {{very similar to that}} of the p 53 negative conjunctival melanomas. CONCLUSION: Examination of the expression of proliferating cells in atypical PAM may be used as an adjunct to predict which lesions will progress to melanoma. The increase in the number of proliferating cells over time in <b>recurrent</b> <b>conjunctival</b> melanomas probably reflects more aggressive behaviour and may be used to monitor recurrence. The absence of p 53 expression in PAM and minimal staining of conjunctival melanomas did not correlate with cell growth, suggesting that alterations in the p 53 tumour suppressor gene are uncommon and late events in conjunctival melanoma, and that p 53 expression is unlikely to be a useful prognostic indicator...|$|R

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} the prevalence {{and significance of}} human papillomaviral types in conjunctival pterygia.  METHODS—Polymerase chain reaction technology was used to identify the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in 10  formalin fixed paraffin embedded pterygia samples. 10  conjunctival papillomas were used as positive controls. 20  conjunctival samples, 10  with primary acquired melanosis and 10  with malignant melanoma, were used as negative controls. Sample subgroups were of equal sex, race, and age distribution to eliminate bias. All samples were further analysed (for 21  HPV types) using dot-blot hybridisation techniques.  RESULTS—HPV was identified in 90 % of the <b>conjunctival</b> <b>papillomas,</b> 50 % of the pterygia samples, but no HPV was detected in the negative control group. Two pterygia showed type 6, two type 11, and one type 16.  These three HPV types were also detected in papillomas.  CONCLUSION—These results suggest that HPV {{may be involved in}} the pathogenesis of pterygia and that broadly the same HPV types are found in pterygia and in <b>papillomas.</b> Persistent <b>conjunctival</b> HPV may possibly play a part in the recurrence of pterygia post excision but further larger studies are required to elucidate this hypothesis. ...|$|R

40|$|AIMS—To assess {{changes in}} {{incidence}} of conjunctival {{squamous cell carcinoma}} over a 22  year period in Tanzania and to analyse possible reasons for change.  METHODS—Retrospective analysis of records from a Tanzanian pathology department serving north and central Tanzania from 1976  to 1997; medical record analysis of cases of conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma presenting in the last 2  years of the study.  RESULTS—There was a sharp rise {{in the incidence of}} conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma in the last 3  years of the study (1995 - 7). The mean age of patients presenting with the condition over the full period was 44. 7  years (95 % confidence interval 42. 4 - 46. 9 years). In the final 2  years of the study the mean length of history on presentation was 3. 1  months (2. 1 - 4. 0 months). Several patients had a previous history of chronic conjunctival disease such as allergic conjunctivitis and trachoma; one had had a <b>conjunctival</b> <b>papilloma</b> excised previously. Only five patients had been tested for HIV status, but of these four were positive.  CONCLUSION—Tanzania is experiencing an epidemic of conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma similar to that seen in other African countries. Often the tumours are aggressive and occur in patients of relatively young age. The epidemic appears to be related to HIV infection, on a background of ultraviolet light exposure. Previous chronic conjunctival disease and exposure to human papillomavirus may also have a role.    Keywords: conjunctiva; squamous cell carcinoma; HI...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{extent of}} {{association}} of human papilloma virus (HPV) in human conjunctival neoplasias has been debated in studies originating from {{different parts of}} the world, but no substantial evidence has been generated on Indian subjects. This prompted us to carry out a retrospective study on conjunctival neoplasias diagnosed over the past 12 years. Materials and Methods: Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of 65 specimens of ocular neoplasias and 30 normal controls diagnosed between 1991 and 2002 at a tertiary eye care hospital, was undertaken. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were reviewed for confirming histopathological diagnosis, presence of koilocytosis and changes related to actinic keratosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was done using HPV-specific monoclonal antibodies. Clinicopathological correlation and the association of HPV antigen with the histopathological features were performed. Results: Out of the 65 cases analyzed, 35 were papillomas and 30 were ocular surface squamous neoplasias (OSSN). The mean age was 48 years with a male preponderance. Histologically, koilocytosis was observed in 17. 1 &#x 0025; of papillomas and 36. 6 &#x 0025; of OSSN. Actinic keratosis was present in 33 &#x 0025; of OSSN. Immunohistochemically 17. 1 &#x 0025; <b>conjunctival</b> <b>papillomas</b> stained positive for HPV antigen, all cases of OSSN were negative for HPV. There was no correlation between koilocytosis or actinic keratosis and the detection of HPV antigen. Conclusions: The association between HPV and conjunctival neoplasias is variable in different geographical areas and also depends on the methods of detection used. This study warrants the need for applying more advanced techniques at a molecular level to determine the possible etiology of HPV in conjunctival neoplasias among Asian-Indians...|$|R

Patients and methods: Two patients with conjunctival tumors were examined and {{treated in the}} University Eye Clinic and diagnosed in the University Pathology Department, University Hospital of Ioannina, Greece. The first patient was a 48 -year-old man presenting with an extended papillomatous lesion in bulbar conjunctiva covering part of the cornea of his right eye. The second patient was a 24 -year-old man presenting with a polypoidal papillomatous lesion on the caruncle of his right eye. The two lesions were removed surgically, cryotherapy {{was applied to the}} adjacent conjunctiva, and topical mitomycin-C was used. The amniotic membrane was used to restore the conjunctival defect in the first patient. The two removed lesions were sent to the Pathology Department for histopathological examination. Immunohistochemistry, DNA in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis were performed. Results: In the first patient, histopathology showed the presence of a benign squamous papilloma with koilocytosis. DNA in situ hybridization with broad-spectrum probes showed that this patient was positive for HPV DNA. In the second patient, histopathology showed the presence of a squamous papilloma with mild dysplasia and koilocytosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for HPV protein and p 16 protein.

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of human processed pericardium used as an onlay after pterygium excision. Methods. Twenty-five eyes of 25 patients (11 female, 14 male) with recurrent pterygium were included in this study. the median age was 50 years (range 22 - 89 years). Twenty-eight percent of the eyes previously had been operated on two or more times. the mean follow-up was 9. 4 months (+/- 2. 1 months, range 8 - 15 months). Following bare-sclera surgical removal of recurrent pterygium, a. patch of processed human pericardium was sutured to cover the area of excision. the pericardium was not covered with conjunctiva. nor were adjuvant radiation or antimetabolite administered. All patients were treated {{with a combination of}} dexamethasone 0. 1 % / chloramphenicol drops three times per day for 1 month. Ketorolac tromethamine 0. 5 % three times per day was added to this regimen after complete cortical reepithelialization. Results. Recurrence (any growth > 1 min onto the cornea) was detected in 12 patients (48 %). the mean time of recurrence was 4. 1 +/- 1. 7 months. Three patients (12. 0 %) presented a regrowth of fibrovascular tissue not reaching 1 mm of the cornea. Pyogenic granulomas occurred in three patients. and all of them required surgical excision. Corneal thinning was present in one patient and was treated with a therapeutic contact lens and artificial tears with complete resolution and vascularization of the thinned area. No decrease in visual acuity was observed in any patient. Conclusions. the use of processed pericardium in pterygium surgery is a safe procedure but is associated with a relatively high rate of recurrence. It should only be considered as an option in managing <b>recurrent</b> pterygium when <b>conjunctival</b> autografting is not an available alternative.
