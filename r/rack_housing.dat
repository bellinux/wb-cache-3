40|$|Interconnection {{networks}} arranged as k-ary n-trees or spines {{are widely}} used to build high-performance computing clusters. Current blade-based technology allows {{the integration of the}} first level of the network together with the compute elements. The remaining network stages require dedicated rack space. In most systems one or several <b>racks</b> <b>house</b> the upper network stages, separated from the compute elements. This incurs significant additional costs, especially if a rack containing only a few switches has to be added. In this paper we propose and evaluate the performance and power-consumption of an alternative arrangement that connects elements in a cube-like topology. Building an indirect cube topology requires only the use of the switches that are integrated within the compute elements and also simplifies deployment. We explore a wide variety of system scales, ranging from 120 to 7680 compute nodes, in order to find out to which size the proposed topology can scale while keeping adequate performance levels and low power demands. An additional advantage of our proposal is that the same equipment can be reused to form a tree-based topology if a performance boost is needed...|$|R
40|$|Heat shock is {{a common}} {{technique}} for inducible gene expression system {{in a variety of}} organisms. Heat shock treatment of adult zebrafish is more involved and generally consists of manually transferring fish between <b>housing</b> <b>rack</b> tanks and preheated water tanks or the use of timed heaters in stand-alone aquaria. To avoid excessive fish handling and {{to take advantage of the}} continuous flow of a standard <b>housing</b> <b>rack,</b> proposed modifications consisted of installing an aquarium heater inside each tank, manually setting the heater to reach heat shocking temperatures (> 37 °C) and, after that, testing that every tank responded equally. To address the limitations in the existing systems, we developed a novel modification of standard zebrafish <b>housing</b> <b>racks</b> to perform heat shock treatment in conditions of continuous water flow. By adding an extra manifold to the <b>housing</b> <b>rack</b> and connecting it to a recirculating bath to create a parallel water flow system, we can increase the temperature from standard conditions (28. 5 °C) to heat shock conditions with high precision (38. 0 ? 38. 3 °C, mean±SD= 38. 1 °C± 0. 14 °C) and minimal variation among experimental tanks (coefficient of variation [CV]= 0. 04 %). This means that there is virtually no need for laborious pretreatment calibrations or continuous adjustments to minimize intertank variation. To test the effectiveness of our design, we utilized this system to induce enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in hsp 70 -EGFP fish and performed a fin regeneration experiment with hsp 70 l:dnfgfr 1 -EGFP fish to confirm that heat-induced gene expression reached physiological levels. In summary, our newly described aquatic heat shock system minimizes effort during heat shock experiments, while ensuring the best water quality and fish welfare and facilitating large heat shock settings or the use of multiple transgenic lines for both research and teaching experiments...|$|R

5000|$|The {{smallest}} {{boats and}} kayaks {{may simply be}} carried by hand or by lashing them {{to the top of}} an automobile. Most smaller boats are stored at home and carried to the water on boat trailers, where they are floated from launch ramps leading down into the water. Some marinas will also offer electric hoists that can lift a boat from a trailer and swing it into the water (generally less than 3 tons). Larger boats are kept at marinas, which offer a mooring protected from the weather and a variety of support services, such as fuel, equipment and so forth. A more recent form of storage is rack storage where runabouts are stored in large steel racks, sometimes four or five boats high, and perhaps 25 boats across. These <b>racks</b> are <b>housed</b> in sheds, and large specialized fork trucks are used to lift the boats from the racks and place them in the water. This reduces the amount of space needed for boat storage, and also provides a clean environment in which the boats are housed.Some marinas will offer dry storage yards, where boats on trailers or dollies are stored on a hard surface. Many yacht clubs will offer a fenced area where boats are conveniently stored near the water, but without the maintenance associated with continual water storage (bottom growth, etc.) Boats in dry storage areas are either ramp-launched or hoisted into the water.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is thought}} that WSJM-FM {{was one of the}} world's first {{completely}} automated radio stations, built and designed by Brian Brown in 1963 when Brown was only 10 years old. The station broadcast in a classical format, called [...] "More Good Music (MGM)" [...] and five-minute bottom-of-the-hour news feeds from the Mutual Broadcasting System. The heart of the automation was an 8 x 24 telephone stepping relay which controlled two reel-to-reel tape decks, one twelve inch Ampex machine which provided the main program audio and a second RCA seven inch machine which provided [...] "fill" [...] music. The tapes that these machines played were originally produced in the MWF's Madison, Wisconsin production facility by WSJM Chief Engineer Richard E. McLemore (and later in-house at WSJM) with special sub-audible cue tones used to signal the end of a song. The stepping relay was [...] "programmed" [...] by slide switches {{in the front of the}} two relay <b>racks</b> which <b>housed</b> the equipment. The news feeds were triggered by a microswitch which was attached to a Western Union clock and tripped by the minute hand of the clock. and then reset the stepping relay. Originally, 20-minute station identification was accomplished by a simulcast switch in the control booth for sister station WSJM, whereupon the disc jockey in the booth would announce [...] "This is WSJM AM and... (then pressing the momentary contact button) ...WSJM-FM, St. Joseph, Michigan." [...] This only lasted about six months, however, and a standard tape cartridge player was wired in to announce the station identification and triggered by the Western Union clock.|$|R
5000|$|The Pell Office was {{situated}} {{on the eastern side}} of Westminster Hall until the beginning of the 19th century. Some early Treasury records were kept in the nearby Chapter House of Westminster Abbey. The office was damp and was liable to destruction by fire due to the many wooden partitions within it and the many hearths used for heating. In 1820 the records were reported to be dry and well-aired, but were piled up {{on the floor of a}} room too small to contain them properly. In 1822 they were transferred to attic storage in Somerset House and were [...] "heaped in some places up to the ceiling and in an exceedingly dirty state". In 1840 the records were taken to the Comptroller of the Exchequer's Office in Whitehall Yard, where they were thoroughly cleaned and re-bundled. They were then placed on <b>racks</b> in Rolls <b>House</b> in 1841 where they were catalogued and labelled. They were then transferred to the new Public Record Office in Chancery Lane, from where they have more recently been moved to the National Archives site at Kew.|$|R
5000|$|Rackmounted {{effects are}} {{typically}} {{built in a}} thin metal chassis with metal [...] "ears" [...] designed to be screwed into a 19-inch rack that is standard to the telecommunication, computing and music technology industries. Rackmounted effects may be one, two or three rack spaces high. When purchased from the store, rack-mounted equipment is not equipped with the rugged chassis features used on stompboxes and amps {{that are designed to}} be transported as standalone units, such as corner protectors. Rackmounted units are typically mounted in a <b>rack,</b> which is <b>housed</b> in a road case, a tough plastic case with removable front and rear covers that can be latched on during transportation to protect the knobs and switches and then removed during performances. A rackmount unit may contain electronic circuitry identical to a stompbox's, although its circuits are typically more complex. Unlike stompboxes, rackmounts usually have several different types of effects.Rackmounts are most commonly used in recording studios and [...] "front of house" [...] live sound mixing situations, though professional musicians who play electric bass, electric guitar, or synthesizers may use them in place of stompboxes, to create a rackmounted head unit for their speaker cabinet(s). Rackmounts are controlled by knobs, switches or buttons on their front panel, and often by a MIDI digital control interface. During live performances, a musician can operate rackmounted effects using a [...] "foot controller". By setting up effects in a rack-mounted road case, this speeds up set-up and tear-down, because all of the effects can be connected together with patch cords (which can be left connected permanently) and all of the units can be plugged into a power bar. This means that a musician only needs to plug in the main power bar into AC Mains power and plug their instrument into the rack, and the last effect unit's output into their instrument amplifier and/or the PA system.|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{system design}} can {{significantly}} affect the resulting product quality level. Therefore, the early prediction of product quality, as affected by manufacturing system configuration decisions, {{can enhance the}} manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness through achieving higher quality levels at lower costs in a responsive manner. In this research, a conceptual framework is proposed for the proactive assessment of product quality {{in terms of the}} manufacturing system configuration parameters. A new comprehensive model {{that can be used in}} comparing different system configurations based on quality is developed using Analytic Hierarchy Process. In addition, a hierarchical fuzzy inference system is developed to model the ill-defined relation between manufacturing system design parameters and the resulting product quality. This model is capable of mapping the considered manufacturing system configuration parameters into a Configuration Capability Indicator (CCI), expressed in terms of sigma capability level, which can be compared to the benchmark Six Sigma capability. The developed models have been applied to several case studies (Test Parts ANC- 90 and ANC- 101, Cylinder Head Part Family, Gearbox <b>Housing,</b> <b>Rack</b> Bar Machining, and Siemens Jeep Intake Manifold) with different configuration scenarios for illustration and verification. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the CCI in comparing different system configurations from quality point of view and in supporting the decision-making during the early stages of manufacturing system development. The included application of the developed models emphasized that high quality levels can be achieved by investigating all the improvement opportunities and it is recommended that efforts should be directed in the first place to design the system with high defect prevention capability. This can be achieved by using highly capable processes, implementation of mistake proofing techniques, as well as minimizing variability due to parallel processing and variation stack up. Considering the relationship between quality and complexity, it has been concluded that the CCI represents the time-independent real complexity of a system configuration. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the product complexity adversely affects the resulting product quality. Therefore, it is recommended that high product quality levels can be achieved not only by using highly capable system configurations, but also by minimizing the product complexity during the design stage.
