40|$|Fractional {{pitch is}} {{commonly}} used <b>to</b> significantly reduce <b>cogging</b> <b>torque</b> in PMSM, however, maximum benefit is dependent on accurate stator and rotor manufacturing. This paper presents a method of decoupling the stator and rotor contributions <b>to</b> total <b>cogging</b> <b>torque.</b> Rotor causes are further decoupled into magnet placement and strength variation. Decoupling is possible due to stator and rotor affected harmonics being independent of one another.

40|$|Fractional pitch slot / pole {{arrangements}} {{are commonly used}} in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) <b>to</b> significantly reduce <b>cogging</b> <b>torque,</b> however, maximum benefit depends on accurate stator and rotor manufacturing and alignment. This thesis presents a method of identifying the sources of manufacturing induced <b>cogging</b> <b>torque.</b> Decoupling of <b>cogging</b> caused by stator and rotor manufacturing variation is possible due to stator and rotor affected harmonics being independent of one another. A hybrid FEA / analytical method was developed <b>to</b> simulate <b>cogging</b> <b>torque</b> with multiple manufacturing faults induced which proved to be 6 orders of magnitude faster than FEA alone. The new method utilises a library of FEA derived pole transition over single stator slot waveforms which are then assembled in the correct order and phased corresponding to the slot / pole interactions for a given PMSM. Angular and eccentric misalignment can be identified by investigating the presence of first and second order sidebands about the pole and slot harmonics. Static angular misalignment induces first order sidebands around the slot harmonics while dynamic angular misalignment induces sidebands about the pole harmonics. Static eccentricity induces both first and second order sidebands around the slot harmonics, while dynamic eccentricity has {{the same effect on}} the pole harmonics. A ‘Fault Diagnosis Flow Chart’ is presented to identify the manufacturing sources of additional harmonics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, all combinations of 10 production stators and 10 rotors of 24 slots and 10 poles in an axial flux configuration were experimentally measured and analysed. The stator slot variation and pole misplacement were found to be the largest contributors <b>to</b> unexpected <b>cogging</b> <b>torque.</b> Pole strength variation and static angular misalignment had minor contributions while dynamic angular, static eccentricity and dynamic eccentricity were found to not {{have a significant impact on}} the motors tested...|$|R
