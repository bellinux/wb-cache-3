40|$|Analysis of the Determinants of Households'Fish Demand in Burkina Faso: the Case of a Rural Area (Vallée du Kou) and Urban Areas (Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou). A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2004 in Burkina Faso in order to analyze the determinants of households' fish demand in both rural (Vallée du Kou) and urban (Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou) areas. To achieve this objective, 535 households were surveyed, the data collected were analyzed and a double-log regression function was constructed. The results of this study showed that households' fish consumption varied considerably according to the area (rural or urban). Households' fish demand was influenced by the availability of the product in the market. In addition to that, when the fish supply frequency increased, the duration of the conservation of the product was reduced or was annulled. The study revealed that the determinants of fish demand in rural area in Vallée du Kou included the size of the household, the prize of the fish in the market, the level of education and the <b>revenue</b> of the <b>head</b> of the household. In urban areas, these determinants include mainly the <b>revenue</b> of the <b>head</b> of the household, fish supply frequency, and conservation methods of the product...|$|R

40|$|Although a {{considerable}} literature exists on determinants of managerial compensation, {{much of it}} focussing {{on the role of}} incentives, there is much less known about the im-pact of managerial remuneration and quality upon attainment of organizational goals. In this paper we use a novel panel data set from the German premier soccer league (Bundesliga) as a case to show how variations in managerial compensation impact posi-tively upon organizational (team) success. This positive impact is revealed using sto-chastic frontier production function estimation. Given a particular amount of spending on players relative {{to the rest of the}} Bundesliga, a team that hires a better quality coach can expect to achieve a higher points score by reducing technical inefficiency. However, our results also suggest that the market for head coaches may be allocatively inefficient in that coaches are paid below their marginal <b>revenue</b> products. <b>head</b> coaches, soccer, efficiency, stochastic frontier analysis...|$|R

Toward this end, al-Mu'tazz sent armies to secure the neighboring towns that controlled access to Baghdad, and Abu Ahmad attempted to halt and seize any <b>revenue</b> shipments <b>heading</b> toward the city. The way in which Abu Ahmad ran the siege was not unquestionably accepted by al-Mu'tazz, who reportedly wrote him a letter in the middle of the war complaining of his lack of progress in forcing al-Musta'in's capitulation, but he remained in command of the main besieging force throughout the entire conflict.|$|R
