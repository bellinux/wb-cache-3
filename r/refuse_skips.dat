40|$|Average {{levels of}} PM 10 {{pollutants}} in Khayelitsha, a poor informal settlement nears Cape Town, are unusually high. The contributory factors are {{the burning of}} household waste, wood and used tyres; vehicular emissions; and dust. This paper gives guidance towards selecting interventions for reducing these pollutants. The options include planting windbreak trees; paving roads and walkways; using cleaner sources of energy; and supplying additional <b>refuse</b> <b>skips.</b> Based on cos t data col lected from relevant municipal departments and service providers, over a 20 -year planning horizon, the following are cost equivalents: planting between 419 and 936 windbreak trees; paving 6 685 m 2 of exposed areas; replacing between 451 and 870 wood-fired meat traders’ braai (i. e. barbecue) sets with gas braais; and providing a 6 m 3 refuse skip. On the basis of cost-effectiveness in reducing PM 10 pollutants, this paper ranks the interventions as follows: (1) providing gas braai sets; (2) planting windbreak trees; (3) paving exposed areas; and (4) providing the refuse skip. Thus, providing gas braai sets to the meat traders in Khayelitsha will significantly reduce PM 10 levels, but will {{also contribute to the}} sustained livelihoods of some of the poor households. However, planting windbreak trees may nevertheless be undertaken because of this option’s linkage to climate change initiatives, which open up a wide range of potential funding opportunities.

5000|$|Emperor Wen's {{attention}} to imperial officials' abilities {{could be seen}} partly in 439, when, according to an edict that Emperor Wu had left that his sons were {{to serve as the}} governor of Jing Province in rotation by age, he was supposed to make his brother Liu Yixuan (劉義宣) the Prince of Nanqiao the governor of Jing Province. However, because he believed Liu Yixuan to be incompetent, he <b>refused,</b> <b>skipping</b> him and giving the post to the more capable brother Liu Yiji (劉義季) the Prince of Hengyang, the governor of Jing Province. (Several years later, after Liu Yiji's death, and with much urging from his older sister Liu Xingdi (劉興弟) the Princess Kuaiji, he finally did make Liu Yixuan the governor of Jing Province, but only after much advice on how to properly govern the province.) ...|$|R
5|$|An {{example of}} {{obedience}} and punishment driven morality {{would be a}} child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by <b>refusing</b> to <b>skip</b> school because he would get punished.|$|R

5000|$|LaserDisc {{players can}} provide a great degree {{of control over the}} {{playback}} process. Unlike many DVD players, the transport mechanism always obeys commands from the user: pause, fast-forward, and fast-reverse commands are always accepted (barring, of course, malfunctions). There were no [...] "User Prohibited Options" [...] where content protection code instructs the player to <b>refuse</b> commands to <b>skip</b> a specific part (such as fast forwarding through copyright warnings). (Some DVD players, particularly higher-end units, do have the ability to ignore the blocking code and play the video without restrictions, but this feature is not common in the usual consumer market.) ...|$|R

She turns to Moe for help, since Skip will not believe it if she tells him he is in danger. Moe tries, but fails, to convince Skip to give the film to the government. Moe goes home, and finds Joey waiting for her. Knowing that her strength is failing, and that she is dying, Moe <b>refuses</b> to reveal <b>Skip's</b> address for any amount of money, and taunts Joey with being a turncoat, and a rat until he shoots her dead.|$|R
5000|$|Jesus and Rory inform Harry and Skip of {{the truth}} behind the rodeo: it is a crooked {{operation}} run by Beatty and Warden Henry Sampson, who heads the neighboring prison. The money from the rodeo, {{which is supposed to}} go to the prisoners, ends up in the wardens' pockets. Knowing Skip will be selected as the prison's new champion, Jesus and Rory hatch a plan for escape involving <b>Skip</b> <b>refusing</b> to participate. This backfires as the warden orders Wilson to [...] "straighten Skip out", and the guards abuse Skip and Harry. However, this too fails; as Skip continues to enjoy himself and when the guards suspend Skip from the floor with manacles in one of the cells they only succeed in fixing his bad back injury that he got from riding the mechanical bull earlier.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{assistance}} of the Globetrotters' leader, Ethan [...] "Bubblegum" [...] Tate, Farnsworth builds a [...] "bad ass gravity pump". With the pump, they intend to reposition stars around the source of the problem, thus diverting the time skips to the empty side of the universe. Thankfully (and ironically), the time skips worked in their favor, with Richard Nixon's Head granting them [...] "all the money on Earth" [...] to build the [...] "bad ass gravity pump" [...] and attach it to the ship. Once they finish moving the required amount of stars, Fry begins buttering Leela up again, but just as she's <b>refusing</b> him, time <b>skips</b> yet again—to their wedding then, seconds later, their divorce. This leaves Fry wondering what he did to win her over. Meanwhile, the time skips are only getting worse with peoples' entire lives being lived out in only a few seconds.|$|R
