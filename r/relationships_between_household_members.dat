40|$|Background: Community {{health workers}} (CHWs) are a {{component}} of the health system in many countries, providing effective community-based services to mothers and infants. However, implementation of CHW programmes at scale has been challenging in many settings. Aim: To explore the acceptability of CHWs conducting household visits to mothers and infants during pregnancy and after delivery, from the perspective of community members, professional nurses and CHWs themselves. Setting: Primary health care clinics in five rural districts in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted where participants were purposively selected to participate in 19 focus group discussions based on their experience with CHWs or child rearing. Results: Poor confidentiality and trust emerged as key barriers to CHW acceptability in delivering maternal and child health services in the home. Most community members felt that CHWs could not be trusted because of their lack of professionalism and inability to maintain confidentiality. Familiarity and the complex <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>household</b> <b>members</b> and CHWs caused difficulties in developing and maintaining a relationship of trust, particularly in high HIV prevalence settings. Professional staff at the clinic were crucial in supporting the CHW’s role; if they appeared to question the CHW’s competency or trustworthiness, this seriously undermined CHW credibility {{in the eyes of the}} community. Conclusion: Understanding the complex contextual challenges faced by CHWs and community members can strengthen community-based interventions. CHWs require training, support and supervision to develop competencies navigating complex relationships within the community and the health system to provide effective care in communities...|$|E

40|$|Financial {{decisions}} are a frequent occurrence within households. Depending on {{characteristics of the}} <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>household</b> <b>members,</b> the situation, and the concrete decision object, decisions can either be made jointly by multiple <b>members</b> of the <b>household</b> or individually by one member. This chapter outlines the four types of financial decisions (spending, saving and credit use, investment, money management) and identifies key parameters that are specific to and guide each of these decisions. The parameters that matter for a decision vary depending on whether a decision is being made individually or jointly. To understand the theoretical and practical implications of a decision it is, thus,necessary to understand {{whether or not a}} decision is being made jointly. We delve into this question by empirically assessing observed parental as well as intended own financial decision profiles; thus capturing possible intergenerational and gender influences. Results show a trend towards joint decisions in a household that appears at odds with increased financial autonomy of the spouses, current marketing communication strategies, and research in the field of financial decision making...|$|R
30|$|Since the RLMS was {{originally}} designed to monitor the health impact of economic transition in Russia, it contains detailed information on alcohol consumption of the respondents, use of time and labour supply. The RLMS permits {{the identification of the}} <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> each <b>member</b> in the <b>household,</b> not only with respect {{to the head of the}} household. This allows us to select only households with no more than one nuclear family, avoiding problems due to the presence of more than one family with children in the same household 9. This could amount to a serious issue, since, as was found by Lokshin et al (2000) and Lokshin (2004), the share of extended families in Russia increased substantially during the transition period, and more than half of Russian children live in extended families. The availability of the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> all <b>household</b> <b>members</b> also permits the identification of the number of potential suppliers of non-parental informal child care in the family, such as grandparents. Therefore, even if multifamily households are excluded from the analysis, we have kept in the sample households with co-resident grandparents.|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{and policy}} makers agree that {{studying}} the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> school qualityand academic achievement will benefit public investment in education. An important turningpoint in educational delivery in Africa came during the 1990 World Conference on Educationfor All where renewed commitments to quality basic education were made. Against thisbackground, interest in how African education systems are progressing has increased. Thisthesis contributes to this understanding in three important ways. The first and broadestobjective is to assess the role of comparative studies in setting educational standards. Thesecond relates to how schools within three East African education systems can contribute tothe academic success of students whatever their background. The third is to investigate whichschools most effectively ensure a meaningful educational experience for children who faceeconomic and social hardships. Data are sourced from the second wave of a cross-nationalsurvey of schools in Southern and Eastern Africa. Hierarchical Linear Modelling is used toanalyse data on schools and students in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The results demonstrate that, although valuable for establishing general patterns of effects,comparative studies should be followed by further investigation of the salient issues at workwithin individual countries. Contrary to earlier studies in developing countries, anunambiguous positive <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> socioeconomic status and student performancewas evident across this region. Compositional, structural and organisational characteristics ofEast African primary schools {{were found to be}} related to academic achievement. Academicallysupportive <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> students and <b>household</b> <b>members</b> benefited studentperformance in Kenya and Tanzania. In line with the school effectiveness theory, resourceavailability proved to be consistently related to educational quality and its equitable distributionin Uganda. An important finding relating to gender was that characteristics of schools thatimproved quality did so more effectively for boys than for girls and therefore increased themale academic advantage. The implication is that the climate for learning in East Africanprimary schools is better suited to educating boys. The study recommends that future surveys pay closer attention to how student attitudes tolearning are shaped so that schools can play a more effective role in motivating students. Totease out exactly how the educational environment influences learning, it is also recommendedthat more longitudinal studies be pursued by the educational research community. That thepace of educational reform is often painfully slow makes the use of longitudinal data to track itscourse all the more necessary...|$|R
40|$|Book Review/Ulasan Buku “Malay houses {{always have}} more than one door. There are many ways to enter the house. ” Thus begins Chapter 1 of Janet Carsten’s book on a fishing {{community}} in Langkawi. The book basically addresses the dynamic function of the Malay house and how it is linked to the process of kinship. But it also has more surprises in store and opens a real door towards an understanding of how Malay kinship system works. The book, which has nine chapters excluding the introduction and the conclusion, is divided into two parts, one dealing with the house as seen from inside, the other as seen from outside, especially in its relation {{with the rest of the}} village and the wider community external to the village. The author, an anthropologist who did fieldwork in Langkawi in early 1980 ’s for her Ph. D. followed by more visits afterwards, demonstrates that kinship is necessarily an on-going process that is constantly being validated through various means. The most important of these, according to the author, is through living together, nurturing and sharing of cooked food. This is where the concept of the hearth or dapur is central to the study, because it is through the social organisation of the dapur that the sense of kinship relatedness becomes meaningful. The author insists that “relatedness is created through the sharing of substance, both as a result of acts of procreation and through living and eating together” (p. 289). Hence people who eat together from the same dapur actually constitutes the living family. Carsten’s analysis of the dapur is very interesting indeed. It is not the ordinary cooking dapur that she refers to, but the ‘living’ dapur, the larger area where daily interactions <b>between</b> <b>household</b> <b>members</b> take place, and where its social meanings and anthropological significance are constantly being realised. According to Carsten, the dapur is symbolically important to everything that concerns kinship and reproduction. It is the dapur which reproduces itself in terms of giving birth to new families. “The dapur produces blood and regulates its flow, thereby ensuring reproduction. The dapur is the transforming centre of the house; it produces life” (p. 128). This recurrent statement throughout the book encompasses the basis of kin <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>household</b> <b>members,</b> because commensality underscores and constitutes such relatedness; kin members eat from the same dapur. In fact, the norm is that one should not eat regular rice meals in other people’s house too often, because such behaviour challenges the integrity of the household. Carsten’s study shows that while kinship involves blood ties through birth and marriage, everyday perception of it tends to be quite different. In practice, kinship may not necessarily involve blood relatedness. Kinship is always a process of becoming, through eating, nurturing and living together in the same house, the same compound and in the same kampung. It is a constant process of adjustment between various factors, and not everything is necessarily tied to strict matrilineal or patrilineal rules. For instance, there is no standard rule regarding the choice of residence after marriage. Factors for setting up separate households after marriage vary, ranging from strained relations between spouses of married siblings, to availability of resources and lands in the compound of either parents. Carsten also discusses the notion of siblingship and its continued importance. Hence, even in marriage, spouses tend to relate to one another as siblings, at least symbolically in the term of address used by the wife for her husband. Now we know why a wife calls her husband abang, although some people would have argued that the word abang is used as a mark of respect by the wife because in most cases the husband is likely to be older. One wonders what would a wife call her husband if he happens to be the younger one. One also begins to realise that parts of the book read like a manual on how to become a good wife, a good husband and good parents-in-law. The last one, on what it takes to be a good mother-in-law, is very interesting. It involves “not being critical of one’s daughter-in-law. The ideal parent-in-law scolds her own child and not the child’s spouse,” observes Carsten (p. 230). “When parents-in-law do not side their own child …, their intervention is regarded as particularly good and likely to cement the marriage” (p. 232). From the discussion the reader can sympathetically detect the fate of men as they grow old. While women dominate in managing household internal affairs, men assume the external role, but only up to a certain age. To prove this, Carsten shows that as men grow old, they tend to lose control over other <b>household</b> <b>members,</b> being reduced to doing errands, while women continue to dominate even in the twilight years of their life. Old men who survive beyond their socially useful age tend to become the butt of jokes of these women; in fact, they were seldom taken seriously. In the second part of the book readers will find that a house is not necessarily an extremely private and exclusive domain. At certain times, the house has to open nearly all its doors and makes itself disposable to the entire village. The time for a kenduri is one of these, during which the symbolism of food sharing on a large scale becomes meaningful. But it is also the time when the house is literally free for everyone, strangers and relatives alike, to walk in and out, perhaps through all available doors. By reading Carsten’s work one realises that the working notions of kinship in Langkawi, and perhaps elsewhere too, is not that straight forward. Strangers may become closely related as if they are kins through sharing and nurturing. If we ever wonder why some of our cousins are very close to us while others are not, the answer may be found in what Carsten insists: blood ties alone may not be good enough in fostering practical and socially meaningful kinship. Truly worthy kinsmen are people whom we meet everyday, with whom we eat together and those who offer us unsolicited help and advice in time of crisis. They may not even be our very own blood relatives. The prevailing belief in Langkawi is that “those who live close by become kin, those who live far off become strangers” (p. 197) drives home this point. Thus the process of fostering can eventually transform people into real affines and kin. After all, kinship is a matter of giving social recognition to someone whom we know in order to facilitate interactions in a socially meaningful way. Carsten’s book is a most timely contribution to Malaysian studies. At the rate Langkawi is now undergoing rapid economic changes, the Malay society, with its intricacies of kinship network described by the author is not going to survive for long. The real value of Carsten’s work therefore lies in its detailed recording of everyday perception of kinship relatedness, and the process of incorporation and exclusion in the entire scheme of reckoning. All these are about to change and perhaps would be lost forever as the island gets itself more and more entangled in the development process. Carsten’s work definitely differs from those of others on Malay kinship system. By not engaging in a highly theoretical debate on kinship issues, the book makes an interesting and informative reading on how the system really operates. The author manages to bring out a good account of what kinship is all about, and what actually happens in the daily life of the community as she had herself partly experienced, in the true ethnographic tradition as a good anthropologist would. It is true that a Malay house has many doors. From the book it seems obvious that Carsten herself has entered the Malay house through all these doors...|$|R
40|$|Awokuse, Titus O. The <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> {{socioeconomic}} status (SES) and health {{is an important}} and policy relevant topic. Many studies have addressed this issue in recent decades, but not much {{attention has been paid}} to the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>household</b> income and health for children until the 2000 s. Even fewer studies have examined the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>household</b> income and child health in the developing countries. To help bridge the gap in the literature, this thesis provides an empirical analysis of the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> family {{socioeconomic status}} and child health in China. By using the China Health and Nutrition Survey data set, this thesis finds the positive <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>household</b> income and child health in China, and the relationship becomes more pronounced as children age for 0 - 14 year old children. This result is generally consistent with previous studies. However, this thesis also finds that the protective effects of household income drop dramatically for 14 - 18 year old children in China. In order to address the possible mechanisms underlying the positive and steepening <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>household</b> income and child health, this thesis investigates several potential factors. The results indicate that location factor, household registration factor ("hukou"), child health insurance, father's smoking behavior, parental exercise behavior and parental BMI and obesity are all important factors affecting child health. However, only parental health status, especially mother's health status, served as a mechanism underlying the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>household</b> income and child health. By exploiting the panel nature of the data, this thesis also analyzes the role of health shocks in explaining the positive <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>household</b> income and child health. The results suggest that the steepening positive <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>household</b> income and child health in China can be explained by the fact that low-SES children are subject to more health shocks. From a police perspective, the results suggest that addressing the causes of health shocks for low-SES children in China may be a good way to improve their health status.
