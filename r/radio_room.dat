5|$|Scully {{receives}} Doggett and Mulder's message, {{and tells}} them that Kersh has broken the quarantine. Mulder destroys the platform's radio {{so that the}} black oil-infected crew cannot communicate with the aliens. Suddenly, the platform workers stop their attack and begin to sabotage the rig. Doggett and Mulder leave the <b>radio</b> <b>room,</b> and jump off the rig when they realize that the crew are going to destroy it. They are rescued by the helicopters Kersh has sent to break the quarantine. Later, at the FBI, Mulder tells Doggett {{that he has been}} dismissed from the bureau.|$|E

Of the two rooms, one was the report room used for administrative work, record keeping and logbooks. It is currently used as a <b>radio</b> <b>room.</b> The second room housed a spare mantle holder. It currently houses the electrical controls, including the sensors responsible for starting the light. It also houses the backup batteries, backup diesel generator and fuel tank, {{as well as a}} small workshop.|$|E
5|$|Hansen locates Yusupov, {{who tells}} him that Anna Kamsky, Viktor's daughter, is onboard and must be saved. Yusupov had brought her to Sakhalin to {{blackmail}} Viktor into turning the exocels into biological weapons. Eventually, Viktor and his colleague, Dr. Pavel Bakharev, began to experiment on live human infection, and the Eastern Spirit {{was on its way}} from the Sakhalin to collect the next batch of human specimens supplied by the Mafia when the exocel outbreak occurred. An exocel then bursts out of Yusupov's chest, killing him. Hansen finds Anna, who tells them they must go to the <b>radio</b> <b>room</b> and contact her father. They contact the rig, but Bakharev tells Anna that Kamsky is missing and pleads with her not to return. She says no, telling Bakharev she will see him soon. They turn the ship back towards the Sakhalin but because the seas are so rough, they are unable to dock with the platform. As such, they head to the crow's nest and jump from the ship when it collides with the rig. Hansen makes the jump, but Anna falls into the sea.|$|E

25|$|A radio {{direction}} finder {{of the kind}} then used by large passenger ships employed a rotatable loop antenna to determine the airship's position from any two land radio stations or ship-based transmitters from ships with known positions. During the airship's transatlantic flight to the United States in October 1928, the <b>radio</b> <b>room</b> sent 484 private telegrams and 160 press telegrams.|$|E
25|$|The main {{generating}} plant {{was inside the}} hull and consisted of two fuel-burning generators. Two small ram air turbines attached to the main gondola on swinging arms supplemented electrical power for the <b>radio</b> <b>room,</b> internal lighting, the galley, and acted as a reserve. Batteries stored the electrical energy so that radio operation was independent of airspeed. The gondola also had a gasoline generator for emergency power.|$|E

25|$|The main antenna {{consisted}} of two lead weighted 120-meter-long wires deployed by electric motor or hand crank. The emergency antenna was a 40-meter wire stretched from a ring on the airship hull. Three high-quality, six-tube receivers served the wavelength ranges 120 to 1,200m (medium frequency), 400 to 4,000m (low frequency) and 3,000 to 25,000m (overlapping low frequency and very low frequency). The <b>radio</b> <b>room</b> also had a shortwave receiver for wavelengths 10 to 280m (high frequency).|$|E

25|$|I-175 {{initiated}} the engagement by opening fire on Dureenbee with her deck gun. The first shell missed, and {{exploded in the}} sea. After realising the trawler was under attack, Dureenbees radio operator sent a distress signal. The submarine's crew then opened fire with machine guns, which destroyed the trawler's <b>radio</b> <b>room</b> and badly wounded the radio operator. Two more shells were fired at Dureenbee, with both striking the vessel. The shells destroyed the trawler's wheel house and crippled her engine, leaving the vessel motionless.|$|E
25|$|Full-scale {{models of}} her {{pressure}} hull were constructed, and used during mid-1942 for underwater tests of experimental shaped charge anti-submarine bombs. In a highly secret British project, Graph {{was also used}} {{as a model for}} the construction of three, full-sized, mock-ups of the control compartment, wardroom and <b>radio</b> <b>room</b> of a Type VII U-boat. These were used to train specialist groups of sailors, who would form boarding parties whenever a damaged U-boat was blown to the surface. They were trained to operate a U-boat's ballast-tank valves, to reverse any scuttling attempts by the crew, and to search quickly for cryptographic equipment and documents.|$|E
25|$|A {{staircase}} {{near the}} main chamber, {{at the level}} of the <b>radio</b> <b>room</b> and toilet facility, led up to the east observation post. It was decided that the aerial would be hidden by withdrawing it into a pipe after use, with the pipe extending down the stairs which led to the main room. While it had initially been planned that the observation apertures would both be slits, the final choice was for the eastern aperture over the Mediterranean to be larger, overlooking a narrow ledge, yet still completely concealed. The opening and ledge were sufficiently large that a man could climb out onto the platform for fresh air. Part way up the main set of stairs was another set which led to the west observation post. The western slit over the bay was concealed with a concrete wedge. The entirety of the main chamber had been plastered and its floor covered in cork tiles, both methods to reduce sound transmission. The entrance passage had loose soil, to facilitate burials if needed. It also had loose bricks to further brick up the tunnel access once the six men had been sealed inside the cave.|$|E

Clem has a small one-person boat ready to sail, but needs Torque's help fighting creatures emerging from a wrecked slave ship before he can leave. Torque sets fire to the wreck, enabling Clem to escape. He enters Abbot's sewer system where he encounters Horace, who tells him Abbot wants his soul. He then heads to the electric chair, destroying it and releasing Horace's spirit. Returning to death row, he finds Killjoy's diagnosis, and then returns to the <b>radio</b> <b>room.</b> Successfully sending a signal, he learns a Coast Guard vessel is on the way. However, Carnate's lighthouse is not working, and must be reactivated before the vessel can approach the island. Torque heads to the lighthouse, passing through the old military barracks, Fort Maleson. In the fort, he encounters Hermes, who forces him to fight. Torque defeats him by using pressurized gas to push Hermes into a furnace. He continues to the lighthouse, outside of which he meets Ernesto Alverez, who is trying to find his family. They restore power, and reactivate the lighthouse, arranging to meet the ship at the dock.|$|E
