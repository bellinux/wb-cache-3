40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the normal sonographic features of <b>rabbit</b> <b>kidneys</b> {{with regard to}} their use in diagnostic imaging of renal lesions in this species. Materials: Twelve sexually mature clinically healthy New Zealand White rabbits weighing 2. 8 kg to 3. 2 kg were examined after anaesthesia. Methods: A diagnostic ultrasound system with microconvex multifrequency 6. 5 MHz probe was used. The animals were positioned in dorsal recumbency. The transabdominal paravertebral imaging approach was used. Longitudinal and transverse scans of the kidneys were obtained. Six rabbits were sacrificed, their kidneys removed and studied in isotonic liquid medium. Results: The shape of kidneys was elliptical. The fibrous capsule was visualized as a straight hyperechoic band. The fatty capsule was hyperechoic and with irregular borders. The cortex exhibited a heterogeneous echogenicity. The acoustic density of the cortex was lower than that of the liver. The echoicity of the medulla was lower as compared to the cortex and the structures of the kidney pelvis. The latter appeared as a centrally located hyperechoic structure. The post mortem examination showed that kidneys were oval and hyperechoic. The kidney pelvis was seen as a centrally located longitudinal finding, and the renal hilum – as a centrally located hyperechoic finding.

40|$|Free {{radicals}} are produced in various organs at ischaemia-reperfusion. The final stage in radical damage is lipid peroxidation. We have demonstrated previously that a lipid-soluble antioxidant improves restoration of bioenergetics in <b>rabbit</b> <b>kidneys</b> after ischaemia, {{as reflected in}} 31 P spectrometry. Radical production in the brain during surgery for carotid artery stenosis can be measured using an ex vivo spin trap method. Aims of the present study: 1. To examine whether pretreatment {{with a combination of}} a lipidsoluble and a water-soluble antioxidant causes improved restoration of bioenergetics in <b>rabbit</b> <b>kidneys</b> after ischaemia compared to single treatment with a lipid soluble antioxidant. 2. To examine whether pretreatment with allopurinol or acetylcysteine influences radical production in conjunction with surgery for carotid artery stenosis. 3. To study the relationship between various markers for arteriosclerosis and the production of free radicals in conjunction with surgery for carotid artery stenosis. Methods: New Zealand white rabbits were used for the NMR experiments. Volume-selective 31 P spectrometry was used to determine changes in bioenergetics during and after ischaemia following various pretreatments. An ex vivo spin trap method was used to measure radical production in the brain during carotid endarterectomy in control patients as well as patients pretreated with allopurinol or acetylcysteine. ICAM- 1, MCP- 9, MMP- 1 and oxLDL serum levels were determined in the control patients. Results: Pretreatment with a combination of a lipid-soluble and a water-soluble antioxidant resulted in improved restoration in cell bioenergetics after ischaemia compared to single treatment with a lipid-soluble antioxidant. Production of radicals can be measured reproducibly using the ex vivo spin trap method. Pretreatment with allopurinol eliminated the strong correlation between e. g. degree of stenosis and leucocyte counts and radical production, which might indicate a beneficial effect of pretreatment with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Pretreatment with acetylcysteine on the other hand appeared to increase radical production. High levels of MMP- 1 and low levels of ICAM- 1 were associated with high radical production. Conclusion: A combination of a lipid-soluble and a water-soluble antioxidant is most effective in improving cell bioenergetics after ischaemia in <b>rabbit</b> <b>kidneys.</b> Allopurinol appears to have a beneficial effect in conjunction with carotid endarterectomy while acetylcysteine appears to increase radical production.

40|$|The {{results of}} the present study {{revealed}} that mesonephric and metanephric kidneys of both the anamniotes (Bufo regularis) and the amniotes (Oryctolagus cuniculus) vertebrates respectively differ morphologically, anatomically and histologically.

In the toad, the kidneys are paired attenuate mesonephric organs and have mesonephric segmental construction. On the other hand, <b>rabbit</b> <b>kidneys</b> are paired bean-shaped structures. Each is composed of elemental units called renal lobules. These lobules are made up of nephrons, three main types of nephron populations were characterized according to the localization of their glomeruli within the cortex. Marked differences between the toad and the rabbit were observed in the number and diameter of renal corpusles and in their size. Also, marked variations were seen in the tubular organization of both species. من المعروف أن تركيب الكلى يختلف بين سائر الفقاريات تبعا لطبيعة البيئة التي لا يستوطنها الحيوان بما يحقق له المقدرة على مواجهة شتى المشاكل البيئية من حيث كمية الماء المتاحة. لذلك عنى هذا البحث بإجراء تجارب لعقد مقارنة تشريحية لكل من الكلية المتوسطة والبعدية اللتان تمثلان طرازى الكلي الفعالة للبرمائيات والثدييات على التوالي ، حيث تقطن تلك الحيوانات بيئات طبيعية مختلفة. وقد أختبر لهذا البحث ذكور وإناث كل من الضفادع المصرية الرقطاء والأرانب الأهلية حيث أسفرت النتائج على العديد من الاختلافات التشريحية بين كلى الضفادع والأرانب من حيث عدد النفرونات وطبيعتها وحجمها وتركيبها بما يتمشى وطبيعة البيئة لكل منهما...|$|R

50|$|Tigerstedt's work on renin was {{probably}} inspired by Brown-Sequard's work examining {{the effect of}} organ extracts on physiological function. In 1898 Tigerstedt and Bergman made extracts of <b>rabbit</b> <b>kidney</b> and injected them into rabbits.

They further showed that the pressor effect of renin did not require an intact nervous system {{and that it was}} not accompanied by a change in heart rate.
