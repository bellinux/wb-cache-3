5|$|López de Zúñiga, {{known as}} Stunica, {{one of the}} editors of Ximenes Complutensian Polyglot, reproached Erasmus that his text lacked part of the 1 John 5:7-8 (Comma Johanneum). Erasmus <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not found it in any Greek manuscript. Stunica {{answered}} that Latin manuscripts are more reliable than Greek. In 1520 Edward Lee accused Erasmus of encouraging Arianism. Erasmus <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not found any Greek manuscript that contained these words, he answered {{that this was a}} case not of omission, but simply of non-addition. He showed that even some Latin manuscripts did not contain these words.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{followed}} this {{up with an}} address to the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York the next year. Once again, his attack on McCarthyism won approval from many liberals. Asked to send a copy of his views to McCarthy, Hand <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had Richard Nixon in mind as well. Despite his concerns about Nixon as vice president, Hand voted for Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 election, later crediting Eisenhower with bringing about McCarthy's downfall in 1954.|$|E

When Bradley asked if a division could be sent to Europe, MacArthur <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could make one available in January. In fact, Chinese troops had already begun crossing the Yalu into North Korea, and by November 180,000 had done so.|$|E
5|$|Producer Nancy Tenenbaum {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the short film. After she sent a copy of the original film to several people of interest, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was interested and that he wanted to direct a remake. He brought it to the attention of Universal Studios who initially declined but subsequently optioned {{the rights to the}} film in 1995. Soderbergh took on the project but then dropped it when he got involved with Out of Sight.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} justifications, {{found in the}} Qur'an and sunnah, {{for the use of}} ijtihad. For example, during a {{conversation}} with Mu'ādh ibn Jabal, Muhammad asked the former how he would give judgments. Mu'ādh <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would refer first to the Qur'an, then to the Sunnah and finally commit to ijtihad to make his own judgment. Muhammad approved of this.|$|E

5|$|When Feynman {{was nearing}} death, he asked Danny Hillis {{why he was}} so sad. Hillis <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought Feynman was going to die soon. Feynman said that that {{sometimes}} bothered him, too, adding, when you get to be as old as he was, and have told so many stories to so many people, even when he was dead he would not be completely gone.|$|E
5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held {{a conference}} in Zagreb, just as German tanks were {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that {{he could no longer}} hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, Serbian king Peter I wanted Tatiana as a bride for {{his younger}} son, Prince Alexander. In January 1914, the Serbian prime {{minister}} Nikola Pašić delivered {{a letter to}} Tsar Nicholas in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the Grand Duchesses. Nicholas <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would allow his daughters to decide whom to marry, but {{he noticed that the}} Serbian prince Alexander often gazed upon Tatiana during a family dinner. Marriage negotiations ended due to the outbreak of World War I. Tatiana exchanged letters with Alexander during World War I and Alexander was distraught when he learned of her death.|$|E

5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not want him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|At 17:00 on 24 September, as Puller's men {{hiked up}} the {{northeast}} slope of Mount Austen, they surprised {{and killed a}} bivouac of 16 Japanese soldiers. The noise from the skirmish alerted several companies of Oka's Maizuru Battalion, who were emplaced nearby. The Maizuru troops quickly attacked Puller's Marines, who took cover and returned fire. Acting on Oka's orders, the Japanese slowly disengaged while withdrawing towards the Matanikau River, and the engagement was over by nightfall. The Marines counted 30 dead Japanese and had suffered 13 dead and 25 wounded. Puller radioed headquarters and requested help to evacuate the wounded. Vandegrift <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would send the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (2/5) as reinforcements the next day.|$|E
5|$|Chas. H. Ross and Mr. Haybeck then {{testified to}} the {{articles}} he recovered from the Spray. The prosecutor, William H. Jelliffe, asked for another adjournment to await the arrival of Willis to testify to the collision. Voorhees opposed the adjournment and moved for Jackalow's immediate release {{on the ground that}} there was no jurisdiction because no crime had been proved to have been committed. Jeliffe <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E

5|$|During the Confederate {{incursion}} {{into the}} North in mid-1863 {{that culminated in}} the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederates twice sent parties to Stevens's Caledonia Forge. Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers against his will. General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North {{had done the same}} to southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South. Asked if he would have taken the congressman to Libby Prison in Richmond, Early <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states.|$|E
5|$|Elvis Presley as Vince Everett, a {{prisoner}} who, after being released, becomes a star for his singing talent. Producer Pandro S. Berman's wife {{convinced him to}} make a film with Presley starring in the leading role. Berman contacted Presley's manager, Colonel Thomas Parker, and asked if he could send Presley or Parker the script to read it. Parker was uninterested and denied the request. Berman asked Parker under which conditions would he take the project, to which Parker <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was only interested in the music score of the movie and owning the rights for record sales and publishing royalties. Presley's payment was settled at 250,000 and 50% of the royalties from the distribution of the movie.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1857, FitzGerald {{resigned}} from Parliament {{on the advice}} of his doctors, and also decided not to seek re-election as provincial Superintendent. Robert Heaton Rhodes offered a requisition to Brittan to make himself available for the by-election that would result from FitzGerald's resignation from Parliament in the Lyttelton electorate, but Brittan <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not absent himself from his private affairs as yet; Parliament at that time met in Auckland, and the 1858 session lasted from 10 April to 21 August, which required an absence from home for several months. Instead, Crosbie Ward, the editor and proprietor of the Lyttelton Times, was the only person nominated on 28 May 1858 and was thus declared elected.|$|E

5|$|On 13 December 1562, Mary {{sent for}} Knox again after {{he gave a}} sermon denouncing certain {{celebrations}} which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing {{at the expense of}} the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard anything about her that he disliked. Despite her friendly gesture, Knox <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1809, {{about three}} months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, {{offering}} him a new manuscript of Susan if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E
