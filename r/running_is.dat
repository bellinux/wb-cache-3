5|$|Old Gisborough Hall was {{demolished}} around 1825 and the Chaloners built {{a mansion}} house, Gisborough Hall, {{about half a}} mile to the east in 1857. In 1932, Thomas Chaloner, 2nd Baron Gisborough transferred control of the priory to the Office of Works. which became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works, then the Department of the Environment and from 1984, English Heritage. It remains the property of Lord Gisborough; English Heritage is responsible for maintaining the ruins, while day-to-day <b>running</b> <b>is</b> managed by Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{will use}} {{different}} gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, {{then there are}} three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking {{is the most common}} gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. <b>Running</b> <b>is</b> considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension.|$|E

25|$|Porpoising, {{also known}} as <b>running,</b> <b>is</b> a high speed surface {{behaviour}} of small cetaceans where long jumps are alternated with swimming close to the surface. Despite the name, porpoising behaviour is seen in dolphins and porpoises, {{as well as other}} marine species such as penguins and pinnipeds. When marine mammals are travelling at speed they are forced to stay close to the surface in order to maintain respiration for the energetic exercise. At leisurely cruising speeds below 4.6m/s, dolphins swim below the water's surface and only briefly expose their blowholes along with up to one third of their body at any one time. This results in little splashing as they have a very streamlined shape. Porpoising occurs mainly when dolphins and porpoises are swimming at speeds greater than 4.6m/s. Here, jump length is roughly equal to distance traveled when the cetaceans are submerged. This exposes the blowhole for longer which is needed to get enough oxygen to maintain metabolism and therefore high speeds over long periods of time. Studies have also shown that leaping is more energetically efficient than swimming above a certain threshold speed. This is due to the reduction in friction when travelling in air compared to water which saves more energy than is needed to produce the leap. These benefits also outweigh the energy wasted due to the large amount of splashing often seen when groups are porpoising. Porpoising is therefore a result of high speed swimming which cetaceans use for important pursuit and escape activities. For example, dolphins may be seen porpoising away from their main predator, sharks or the direction of incoming boats to avoid collision.|$|E

500|$|Somalia was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics â€“ Mohamed Daud Mohamed, a 5000 metres runner. It marked his first appearance at an international athletics competition, following a transition into athletics from football. He said prior to the Olympics, [...] "I am improving by the day and I hope to improve on my finish time. <b>Running</b> <b>is</b> hard and all athletes aim to win. My objective is to win; but there are different ways of winning. It is not about being first, second or third. If I set a new personal record, it is a win for me". Mohamed competed on 17 August in the first heat of the 5000 metres, finishing in 24th position out of the 25 runners, only ahead of Rosefelo Siosi of the Solomon Islands, thus eliminating him from the competition.|$|E
500|$|The Lion King {{inspired}} two attractions retelling {{the story}} of the film at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The first, [...] "The Legend of the Lion King", featured a recreation of the film through life-size puppets of its characters, and ran from 1994 to 2002 at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World. Another that is still <b>running</b> <b>is</b> the live-action 30-minute musical revue of the movie, [...] "Festival of the Lion King", which incorporates the musical numbers into gymnastic routines with live actors, along with animatronic puppets of Simba and Pumba and a costumed actor as Timon. The attraction opened in April 1998 at Disney World's Animal Kingdom, and in September 2005 in Hong Kong Disneyland's Adventureland.

500|$|Manchester City's officially {{recognised}} supporters club is the Manchester City FC Supporters Club (1949), {{formed from}} a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).

The City fans' song of choice is a rendition of [...] "Blue Moon", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto {{as though it were a}} heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results [...] "typical City". Events that fans regard as [...] "typical City" [...] include City's being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957â€“58), or the more recent example that City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the 2004â€“05 Premier League, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower.|$|E
