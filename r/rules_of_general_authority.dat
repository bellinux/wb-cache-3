40|$|This article {{responds}} to Jocelyn Stacey 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 The Environmental Emergency and the Legality of Discretion in Environmental Law 2 ̆ 2. In her article, Stacey attempts {{to establish the}} legitimacy of unfettered executive discretion to deal with environmental issues, but the justification that she provides {{is not up to}} the task. She asserts that all environmental issues are emergencies but she does not explain why they are so. She proposes to resolve the problem of executive discretion by redefining the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, thereby rendering it an empty shell. Environmental protection and the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law do not push in opposite directions. Instead, it is the loss <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law that allows governments to pick and choose the environmental conditions that they wish to alternatively save and sacrifice. The solution to environmental issues that the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law demands is not unfettered discretion but better abstraction in <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> application. Boundless <b>authority</b> to respond to 2 ̆ 2 environmental emergency 2 ̆ 2 is an unbearable license to make things up on the go...|$|R
