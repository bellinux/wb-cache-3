40|$|Based on bed {{occupancy}} ratio (BOR) in 2010, it {{was known}} {{that the number of}} inpatient visit atPermata Bunda hospital was relatively high. As a consequence, the need of linen increased. Basedon preliminary study, {{it was known}} that planning, implementation, and controlling of linen werenot adequate. The objective {{of this study was to}} know how linen in Permata Bunda hospital Purwodadi was managed. This was a descriptive explorative study with cross sectional approach. Study population was workersof Permata Bunda hospital Purwodadi who were involved in linen management. Main informantswere chief of nurse in the general ward, chief and assistance chief of linen logistic unit, chief andassistant chief of laundry unit. Triangulation informants were general manager, logistic unit chiefand patients. Results of the study showed that planning for linen requirement estimation was not good because it wasdone based on lost or damaged linen assumptions. Ordering process was still insufficient due to nospecial staff who ordered the linen. Supply linen was inadequate due to no standard for linen supply. Maintenance of linen was good; it was performed according to the right phases and procedures. Distribution of linen was not good due to separation of the rooms by the street. Linen service to patientwas inadequate; not all patients 2 ̆ 7 linen was changed once a day. Linen management organization wasnot good; it was still done together. Linen stock control was not good; calculation for linen requirementwas still lacking, and it had not used the standard of 3 times of the number of bed. Implementation oflinen inventory was still inadequate; no specific recording was done according to the dirtiness level ofthe linen. Linen coding or identification was still inadequate; coding was not in detail. Based on the results of the study, it is suggested that calculation of linen requirement should bedone based on the number of bed with availability of 3 par stock linen in each bed. Written standardoperating procedure in linen management should be produced; it will be used as guideline orstandard by linen staffs or management. Identification or coding of linen should be improved; itincludes hospital name, <b>room</b> <b>name,</b> type of linen and type of material...|$|E
