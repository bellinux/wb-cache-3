50|$|If a ship is {{equipped}} with an AIS system and a <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> indicator, then the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> indicator must {{be connected to the}} AIS to send the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> to other vessels.

50|$|IMO say's that {{a maximum}} allowed {{deviation}} from the real situation shown by the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> indicator is 0.5 degrees. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> indicator has to keep this accuracy until a speed of 30 knots is reached.|$|R

50|$|<b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> {{indicator}} or ROTI {{on board}} vessels indicates the rate a ship is turning. It indicates the rate a ship is turning in degrees per minute.

50|$|There are {{two types}} <b>of</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> indicators: a digital type and an analog type.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give a {{complete}} {{proof of a}} theorem, which states that `for a weak shock, the shock ray velocity {{is equal to the}} mean of the ray velocities of nonlinear wavefronts just ahead and just behind the shock, provided we take the wavefronts ahead and behind to be instantaneously coincident with the shock front. Similarly, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> the shock front is also equal to the mean <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> such wavefronts just ahead and just behind the shock'. A particular case of this theorem for shock propagation in gasdynamics has been used extensively in applications. Since it is useful also in other physical systems, we present here the theorem in its most general form...|$|R

50|$|The {{requirements}} for the display <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> indicator are that the zero {{has to be on}} top, the indicator has to go to the left when ship is turning to port side, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>turn</b> indicator {{is based}} on a gyroscope with an availability <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> in just one direction. When the ship is steering a straight course, the gyroscope will point in a straight direction and the pointer will point to the zero on the display. When the vessel makes a turn to port, the gyroscope will turn to port side due to inertia and this will be pointed on the display <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> indicator. The same can be said for the starboard side.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a low cost resonant gyroscope, or <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> sensor, which is capable of being mass produced. The history and theory of the resonant gyroscope is reviewed, and then a survey of resonant gyroscope technology is presented. Two novel designs of resonant gyroscopes are described. These designs are developed using the finite element analysis method. The fabrication procedure required to manufacture these devices is also developed and presented. The fabrication procedures are based upon silicon micromachining technology developed from the semiconductor industry. Prototype structures are fabricated. The first of these devices has been demonstrated to operate successfully as a gyroscopic <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> sensor. A third design is also presented and developed using finite element analysis. This design demonstrates {{for the first time that}} it is possible to sense <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> about all three orthogonal axes independently, using just a single structure. A successful implementation of a structure of this type would eliminate the traditional requirement of one gyroscope per axis of rotation. The finite element simulations of the structure indicate that the design is suitable for mass production using silicon micromachining techniques...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the value in}} previously disregarded parameters in AIS data, and present a novel way of quickly identifying and characterizing potentially safety critical situations for vessels with a properly configured AIS transponder. The traditional approach of studying (near) collision situations, is through vessel conflict zones, based on vessel location and speed from low resolution AIS data. Our approach utilizes the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> parameter in the AIS signal, at maximum time resolution. From collision investigation reports it is often seen that prior to or at collision navigators perform frenetic rudder actions in the hope to avoid collision in the last second. These hard maneuverings are easily spotted as non-normal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> signals. An identified potential critical situation may then be further characterized by the occurring centripetal acceleration a vessel is exposed to. We {{demonstrate the}} novelty of our methodology in {{a case study of}} a real ship collision. As the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> parameter is directly linkable to the navigator behavior it provides information about when and to what degree actions were taken. We believe our work will therefore inspire new research on safety and human factors as a risk profiles could be derived based on AIS data...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of forklift operation is {{that it must have}} rear-wheel steering.
