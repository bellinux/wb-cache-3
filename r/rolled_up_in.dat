5|$|On 8 November 2000, Smith met 21-year-old Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict from Alum Rock, Birmingham, at the Rainbow public house, {{and they were}} seen leaving together. He {{took her to a}} hospital appointment and later killed her. Prosecutors believed that he strangled her at his flat and dumped her body near a recreation ground near Golden Hillock Road in Sparkbrook, where he set it alight. The still-smouldering remains were discovered at 6:15am next morning (9 November) by two patrolling police officers. The body was barely recognisable and had to be identified using fingerprints. A subsequent post mortem concluded that she had been strangled before being <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a carpet and set on fire.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, {{typically}} {{occurring in}} evergreen forests. It prefers rainforests with continuous dense canopies {{and has an}} extremely low metabolic rate compared to other mammals of its size. Its diet consists of sap, floral nectar, fruit and arthropods. It will feed on exudates such as gum and sap by licking wounds in trees. The species is generally solitary; one study showed only 8% of its active time was spent near other individuals. Social behavior makes up a very {{small part of the}} activity budget, though it has monogamous mating system with the offspring living with the parents. It sleeps during the day, <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a ball in hidden parts of trees above the ground, often on branches, twigs, palm fronds, or lianas. The species is polyoestrous, usually giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of 192 days. The young disperses between 16 and 27 months, generally when it is sexually mature.|$|E
25|$|Keeping birds {{inside a}} house protects them from predators such as hawks and foxes.

25|$|The Hercules was {{a monumental}} undertaking. It {{is the largest}} {{aircraft}} ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field. That's more than a city block. Now, I put the sweat of my life into this thing.

500|$|The {{scientist}} Michael Faraday {{described the}} situation {{in a letter to}} The Times in July 1855: shocked at the state of the Thames, he dropped pieces of white paper into the river to [...] "test the degree of opacity". His conclusion was that [...] "Near the bridges the feculence <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> clouds so dense that they were visible at the surface, even in water of this kind.... The smell was very bad, and common to the whole of the water; it was the same as that which now comes up from the gully-holes in the streets; the whole river was for the time a real sewer." [...] The smell from the river was so bad that in 1857 the government poured chalk lime, chloride of lime and carbolic acid into the waterway to ease the stench.|$|E

Tightly folding the keyboard may damage the internal membrane circuits. When {{they are completely}} sealed in rubber they are water resistant.

Unlike the carpet-like AstroTurf, the infilled synthetic turf is not easily <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a continuous reel, and must be removed in sections. The turf sections are [...] in width, running from sideline to sideline, attached to each other with velcro.
