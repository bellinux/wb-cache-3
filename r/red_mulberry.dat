2500|$|Sanguine or Murrey, from Latin sanguineus, [...] "blood red", and Greek morum, [...] "mulberry", {{one of the}} two {{so-called}} [...] "stains" [...] in British armory, is a dark <b>red</b> or <b>mulberry</b> colour, between gules and purpure in hue. [...] It probably originated as a mere {{variation of}} one of those two colours, and may in fact represent the original hue of purpure, which is now treated as a much bluer colour than when it first appeared in heraldry. [...] Although long shunned in the belief that it represented some dishonour {{on the part of the}} bearer, it has found some use in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.|$|R

The breed appears {{in more than a}} dozen colour variations. The most common being black red, birchen, brown red, duckwing and pile. The colours can be broadly divided into two groups; those with willow-coloured legs and red eyes, and those with black legs and dark eyes. The colour of the skin, comb, and wattles varies from <b>red</b> to <b>mulberry</b> depending on variety, but all have a small single comb.

2500|$|Five colours {{have been}} {{recognized}} since {{the earliest days of}} heraldry. [...] These are: gules, or red; sable, or black; azure, or blue; vert, or green; and purpure, or purple. [...] Two more were eventually acknowledged by most heraldic authorities: sanguine or murrey, a dark <b>red</b> or <b>mulberry</b> colour, and tenn√©, an orange or dark yellow to brownish colour. [...] These were termed [...] "stains" [...] by some of the more influential heraldic writers, and supposed to represent some sort of dishonour {{on the part of the}} bearer; but in fact there is no evidence that they were ever so employed, and they probably originated as mere variations of existing colours. [...] Nevertheless, the belief that they represented stains upon the honour of an armiger served to prevent them receiving widespread use, and it is only in recent times that they have begun to appear on a regular basis.|$|R

60|$|The fall of {{cochineal}} {{throughout the}} Canaries brought many successors into the field, but none can boast of great success. Silk, woven and spun, was tried; unfortunately, the worms were fed on tartago (a ricinus), {{instead of the}} plentiful <b>red</b> and white <b>mulberries.</b> The harvest was abundant, but not admired by manufacturers. In fact, the moderns have failed where their predecessors treated the stuff so well that Levantines imported silks to resell them in Italy. Formerly Tenerife contained a manufactory whose lasting and brilliant produce was highly appreciated in Spain as in Havana. At Palma crimson waist-sashes used to sell for an ounce of gold.|$|R
5000|$|Black, <b>red,</b> {{and white}} <b>mulberry</b> are {{widespread}} in southern Europe, the Middle East, northern Africa and Indian subcontinent, where {{the tree and}} the fruit have names under regional dialects. Jams and sherbets are often made from the fruit in this region. Black mulberry was imported to Britain in the 17th century {{in the hope that}} it would be useful in the cultivation of silkworms. It was much used in folk medicine, especially in the treatment of ringworm. Mulberries are also widespread in Greece, particularly in the Peloponnese, which in the Middle Ages was known as Morea, deriving from the Greek word for the tree ( [...] , [...] ).|$|R
5000|$|In {{accordance}} {{with the intentions of}} their creator, the Sebright is an ornamental bantam, and is commonly seen in competitive poultry shows. As a true bantam, all Sebrights are very small in stature; males weigh an average of 22 ounces (625 grams) and females 20 oz (570 g). Their short backs, proportionally large breasts, and downward - pointing wings combine to create an angular, jaunty look. All Sebrights have plumage that is laced around the edges evenly with black, on a base of either dark gold or whitish silver. Sebrights have unfeathered legs with slate - blue skin, and their beaks are ideally a dark horn color. Sebright roosters carry a rose comb covered with fine points, and a small spike that sweeps back from the head (called a leader).

They {{produced}} paper from the bark of the Fusang plants for writing and produced cloth from the fibers of the bark, which they used for robes or wadding. Their houses or cabins were constructed with <b>red</b> <b>mulberry</b> wood. The fruits and young shoots of the plants were one of their food sources. They raised deer for meat and milk, just as the Chinese raised cattle at home, and produced cheese with deer milk. They traveled on horseback and transported their goods with carts or sledges pulled by horses, buffalo, or deer." ...|$|E

5000|$|The metals are or and argent, {{representing}} {{gold and}} silver, respectively, although in practice {{they are usually}} depicted as yellow and white. Five colours are universally recognized: gules, or red; sable, or black; azure, or blue; vert, or green; and purpure, or purple; and most heraldic authorities also admit two additional colours, known as sanguine or murrey, a dark <b>red</b> or <b>mulberry</b> colour between gules and purpure, and tenn√©, an orange or dark yellow to brown colour. These last two are quite rare, and are {{often referred to as}} stains, from the belief that they were used to represent some dishonourable act, although in fact {{there is no evidence that}} this use existed outside the imagination of the more fanciful heraldic writers. [...] Perhaps owing to the realization that there is really no such thing as a stain in genuine heraldry, as well as the desire to create new and unique designs, the use of these colours for general purposes has become accepted in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. [...] Occasionally one meets with other colours, particularly in continental heraldry, although they are not generally regarded among the standard heraldic colours. Among these are cendr√©e, or ash-colour; brun√¢tre, or brown; bleu-c√©leste or bleu de ciel, sky blue; amaranth or columbine, a bright violet-red or pink colour; and carnation, commonly used to represent flesh in French heraldry. [...] A more recent addition is the use of copper as a metal in one or two Canadian coats of arms.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Red</b> <b>mulberry</b> is a {{deciduous}} tree, {{growing to}} 10 - 15 m tall, rarely 20 m, with a trunk up to 50 cm in diameter.
