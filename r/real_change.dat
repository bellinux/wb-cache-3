5|$|Christopher Landsea {{noted that}} the efforts to reanalyze the Atlantic {{hurricane}} database {{will not be able}} to recover observations of open ocean tropical cyclones that were just never taken. Researchers cannot assume that the Atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction of frequency of events before the advent of satellite imagery in the mid-1960s. Moreover, newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional Atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002. Thus large, long-term 'trends' in tropical cyclone frequency are primarily manifestations of increased monitoring capabilities and likely not related to any <b>real</b> <b>change</b> in the climate in which they develop.|$|E

5|$|The loss of Scott and {{his party}} overshadowed all else in the British public's mind, {{including}} Amundsen's feat in being first at the Pole. For many years the image of Scott as a tragic hero, beyond reproach, remained virtually unchallenged, for although there were rifts among some who were close to the expedition, including relatives of those who died, this disharmony was not public. There was no <b>real</b> <b>change</b> in public perceptions until the 1970s, by which time nearly all those directly concerned with the expedition were dead.|$|E
5|$|Another legacy was {{the manner}} in which it led to the emergence—albeit only fleetingly—of an {{independence}} in Australian foreign affairs. Although previously Australian foreign interests had been largely handled by Britain, as a combatant Australia sent its own delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, while it also began to take a more assertive role in regional affairs in the Pacific. At the peace conference Prime Minister Hughes pushed aggressively for reparations and an Australian mandate over German New Guinea; a stance which conflicted with the liberal internationalist inspired Fourteen Points put forward by American President Woodrow Wilson. Regardless, following the war there was little <b>real</b> <b>change</b> in Imperial relations and Dominion affairs, and as a result the war arguably did not lead to any significant change in Australia's perception of its role in the world. Indeed, profound change would only occur following the Japanese crisis of 1942, which ultimately saw Australia pursue a foreign policy more independent of Britain, and an alliance with the United States.|$|E

5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} have dared to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was steeped in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about <b>real</b> <b>change,</b> regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.|$|E

Findings suggest that through collaboratively developing a teacher evaluation model in a safe and supportive environment, teachers can enjoy the process and note <b>real</b> <b>changes</b> in behaviors as well as growth in student achievement. Key themes emerged, suggesting benefits associated with peer collaboration, goal-setting, evidence collection (portfolios), and ongoing and iterative process...|$|R

25|$|Political {{activism}} by youth can {{go unnoticed}} because youth activism often occurs on school grounds {{and away from}} the adult society, but youth often face resistance when forming youth activist groups in schools. As the central beneficiaries of public schools, youth are also advocating for student-led school change and education reform through student activism and meaningful student involvement. There are structural inequalities that keep youth from engaging in political talk and action on school grounds or the public domain. School clubs require an adult adviser to make the club official, further adding to school hierarchies of adult power. While some youth participate in student government, others prefer student unions because they provide a real voice to the students and present it to the administration while student governments do not have the power to effect <b>real</b> <b>change</b> in a school system.|$|E
40|$|Land {{cover and}} land use are {{important}} information sources for environmental issues. One {{of the most important}} changes at the Earth's surface concerns land cover {{and land use}}. Knowledge about the location and type of these changes is essential for environmental modeling and management. Remote sensing data in combination with additional spatial data are recognized as an important source of information to detect these land cover and land use changes. In this paper, we introduce the Dutch multi-date land use database (LGN). Today there are six versions of the LGN database (LGN 1 –LGN 6) based on satellite imagery of respectively 1986, 1992 / 1994, 1995 / 1997, 1999 / 2000, 2003 / 2004 and 2007 / 2008. With the completion of LGN 6 a time-series of land use databases covering 20 years became available. The different databases were produced according to different methodologies. The resulting inconsistencies for monitoring land use changes and possible solutions are the main themes of this paper. Emerging user requirements, increased data availability and technical improvements lead to methodological differences between the LGN 5 and LGN 6 Dutch land use database. Monitoring of land use changes by integrating independent spatial datasets results in a mixture of <b>real</b> and methodological <b>changes.</b> A methodology is applied to detect <b>real</b> land use <b>changes</b> for a limited number of land use monitoring classes. The detected <b>real</b> <b>changes</b> have a high probability (almost 95 %) that they are <b>real</b> <b>changes.</b> Next to these <b>real</b> <b>changes,</b> differences exist between LGN 5 and LGN 6, i. e. so-called methodological land use changes, being the result of methodological adaptations over time...|$|R
