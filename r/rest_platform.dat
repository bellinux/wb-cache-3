50|$|A {{distinct}} {{feature of}} the Panzer III, influenced by British Vickers tanks (1924), was the three-man turret. This meant that the commander was not distracted with another role in the tank (e.g. as gunner or loader) and could fully concentrate on maintaining awareness {{of the situation and}} directing the tank. Most tanks of the time did not have this capability, providing the Panzer III with a combat advantage versus such tanks. For example, the French Somua S-35's turret was manned only by the commander, and the Soviet T-34 originally had a two-man turret crew. The Panzer III, as opposed to the Panzer IV, had no turret basket, merely a foot <b>rest</b> <b>platform</b> for the gunner.|$|E
50|$|The report, {{written with}} the {{assistance}} of a regional historical architect from the NPS, was an attempt to identify and address the apparent problems associated with the statue. In the report, the consultants took note of what they saw to be the most serious problem affecting the statue: that two predominant sections, the torch-bearing arm and the <b>rest</b> <b>platform</b> at the head level, had corroded significantly. The report also alluded to the corroded girders toward the top of the pedestal and the bottom of the central pylon. The report also discussed the serious structural problems associated with the long-ago deteriorated insulating layer between the copper sheet of the statue and the iron bands of the structural armature, as it had caused the iron bands to corrode. Alterations over the intervening years (1887-1916) to the torch had created such irreversible damage to the integral stability of that segment, that it was advised in the report that the torch be replaced. In order to more thoroughly assess possible damage that may be hidden beneath the layers of paint on the central pylon, the French consultants also suggested that the layers of paint covering it be removed. Two alternative proposals for modernizing the stairway within the statue were also proposed. From these preliminary observations, a number of preservation and replacement priorities were made. The white paper was further assessed and scrutinized by the NPS and other officials at the Department of the Interior in the nation's capital on March 5, 1982. The director of the NPS was impressed by the report, but also concerned about the future prospects of the Committee’s fund raising efforts.|$|E
40|$|Keywords—parallel mechanism; worm pipe robot; virtual prototype; {{simulation}} analysis Abstract — The new type worm pipe robot was put forward based on Stewart parallel mechanism by the method which move or <b>rest</b> <b>platform</b> is alternated. The kinematical model {{was set up}} by the method of coordinate transform for the robot in this paper, and the walking principle was analyzed when the robot moved in straight pipe and elbow. Further more the virtual prototype was made and kinematical {{simulation analysis}} had been accomplished. By the walking simulation when the robot moved in straight pipe and elbow it is validated that the walking principle established for the robot is correct. The robot can has bigger tensile draw. The worm pipe robot is evolvement from the classic Stewart parallel mechanism, but it is different from the classic Stewart parallel mechanism[1 - 3], refer to Fig 1. The robot composes upper platform, lower platform, support foot, auxiliary wheel, sphere hinge joint, linear driver and drive cam.

50|$|Laboratory rats {{have been}} taught to enter one arm of a maze {{in the morning and}} another in the afternoon, though only 63% of the animals could attain the {{criterion}} of nine correct choices over ten consecutive trials. In a protocol not based on food acquisition, rats swimming in a tank could learn the location of one <b>resting</b> <b>platform</b> in the morning, and another in the afternoon. However, other studies have failed to find evidence of time-place learning in rats. Outcomes of time-place tests with rats seem to depend on what behaviors are measured to assess learning, and on the (sometimes too low) costs of not performing well.|$|R

40|$|Reports of astronauts visual changes raised {{concern about}} ocular health during long-duration spaceflight. Some of these {{findings}} included hyperopic shifts, choroidal folds, optic disc edema, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickening, and cotton wool spots. While the etiology remains unknown, hypotheses speculate that hypertension in the brain caused by cephalad fluid shifts during spaceflight is a possible mechanism for these ocular changes. Head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest is a spaceflight analog that induces cephalad fluid shifts. In addition, previous studies of the HDT position demonstrated body fluid shifts associated with changes in intraocular pressure (IOP). For these reasons, vision monitoring of HDT bed rest subjects was implemented for NASA bed rest studies. Subjects selected for these studies were healthy adults (14 males and 5 females). Average age was 37. 5 plus or minus 9. 1 years, weight was 77. 4 plus or minus 11. 3 Kg, and height was 173. 4 plus or minus 7. 2 14 cm. Controlled conditions followed for all NASA bed rest studies were implemented. These conditions included factors such as eating a standardized diet, maintaining a strict sleep wake cycle, and remaining in bed for 24 hours each day. In one study, subjects maintained a horizontal (0 degree) position while in bed and were exercised six days per week with an integrated resistance and aerobic training (iRAT) program. In the other study, subjects were placed at 6 degrees HDT while in bed and did not engage in exercise. All subjects underwent pre- and post bed rest vision testing. While the battery of vision tests for each study was not identical, measures common to both studies will be presented. These measures included IOP and measures that provided an indication of optic disc swelling as derived from optical coherence tomography (OCT) testing: average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (millimeters), disc area (square millimeters), rim area (square millimters), and average cup to disc (C/D) ratio. For all measures, {{there was no significant}} difference between subject groups for pre-bed rest testing. Post bed rest values also remained similar between groups. Comparison of pre- to post bed rest testing within each group did not demonstrate any statistical differences. These preliminary results from 14 -day bed rest studies suggest that the combination of exercise and horizontal bed rest as compared to 6 degrees HDT bed rest did not produce differences in the ocular response with regard to IOP and optic disc parameters. The ocular measures reported here only included pre- and post bed rest time points. Further investigation is needed to examine both the acute response and long term adaptation of structural and functional ocular parameters in the bed <b>rest</b> <b>platform</b> and determine its usefulness for studying spaceflight phenomena. From a clinical perspective, the ability to study ocular responses in the controlled environment of the bed <b>rest</b> <b>platform</b> can provide valuable information for the care of patients restricted to bed rest...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Temporary {{abdominal}} closure methods {{allow for}} management of open abdomens where immediate primary closure {{is not possible}} and/or where repeat abdominal entries are necessary. We assessed pressure mapping and fluid extraction efficiency of three open abdomen dressing systems: ABThera™ Active Abdominal Therapy System, V. A. C. ® Abdominal Dressing System, and Barker’s vacuum packing technique. Methods: An in vitro test model was designed to simulate physical conditions present in an open abdomen. The model consisted of a rigid <b>rest</b> <b>platform</b> with elevated central region and a flexible outer layer with centrally located incision. Constant − 125 [*]mmHg negative pressure was applied according {{to the type of}} system, under simulated dynamic conditions, using albumin-based solution with a viscosity of 14 [*]cP. Data were collected by pressure sensors located circumferentially into three concentric zones: Zone 1 (closest to negative pressure source), Zone 2 (immediately outside of manifolding material edge), and Zone 3 (area most distal from negative pressure source). Each value was the result of approximately 100 pressure readings/zone/experiment with a total of three experiments for each system. Results: Pressure distribution of ABThera Therapy was significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) superior to Barker’s vacuum packing technique in all three evaluated zones. Similarly, V. A. C. Abdominal Dressing System pressure distribution was significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) improved compared to Barker’s vacuum packing technique in all zones. There were no pressure distribution differences in Zone 1 between ABThera Therapy and V. A. C. Abdominal Dressing System; however, in Zones 2 and 3, ABThera Therapy was significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) superior to V. A. C. Abdominal Dressing System. Conclusions: These data suggest that all approaches to negative pressure therapy for open abdomen treatment are not equal. Additional research should be conducted to elucidate clinical implications of data demonstrated here...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- We {{evaluated}} the possible predation on eggs and the disturbance to water-bird nests by coypus by monitoring the breeding success of four bird species and {{a sample of}} dummy and natural nests by photo-cameras. The monitoring of waterbirds activity showed that 14. 8 % of Fulica atra and 9. 5 % of Gallinula chloropus nests failed, possibly {{as a consequence of}} disturbance by coypus. In 2009, 7. 4 % of ground dummy nests and 10. 8 % of water dummy nests showed signs of coypu activity with eggs either preyed or removed. Camera surveys confirmed that coypus used the nests as <b>resting</b> <b>platforms,</b> thus destroying or sinking the eggs.

40|$|Background: Animal {{welfare and}} {{accurate}} data collection are equally important in rodent research. Housing influences study outcomes and can challenge studies that monitor feeding, so housing choice {{needs to be}} evidence-based. The goal of these studies was to 1) compare established measures of well-being between rodents housed in wire grid-bottom floors with a <b>resting</b> <b>platform</b> compared to solid-bottom floors with bedding and 2) determine whether presence of a chewable device (Nylabone) affects orexin-A-induced hyperphagia. Methods: Rodents were crossed over to the alternate housing twice after two-week periods. Time required to complete food intake measurements was recorded {{as an indicator of}} feasibility. Food intake stimulated by orexin-A was compared with and without the Nylabone. Blood corticosterone and hypothalamic BDNF were assessed. Results: Housing had no effect on growth, energy expenditure, corticosterone, hypothalamic BDNF, behavior and anxiety measures. Food intake was disrupted after housing cross-over. Time required to complete food intake measurements was significantly higher for solid-bottom bedded cages. The Nylabone had no effect on orexin-A-stimulated feeding. Conclusion: Well-being is not significantly different between rodents housed on grid-bottom floors and those in solid-bottom bedded cages based on overall growth and feeding, but alternating between housing confounds measures of feeding...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} cage size and an {{obstructed}} {{view from the}} cage {{on the use of}} wooden nonwalled <b>resting</b> <b>platforms</b> by juvenile male (n= 10) and female (n= 15) silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were assessed in a 10 week experiment. The degree of the view and the free floor area of the cage varied between the five types of cage used. Each animal spent 2 weeks in each type of cage and their behaviour was videorecorded for a 24 -h period in each 2 -week period. The foxes spent 59 ± 13 % of their daily time on the platforms. Use declined from 72 ± 13 % in September to 35 ± 21 % in November. Males used the platforms more than did females. In late October and early November, the foxes in cages with an obstructed view from the floor made more use of the platforms for both active behaviour and resting than did those in cages with an unobstructed view from the floor. The larger the free floor area of the cage, the less the silver foxes used the platforms during activity in mid-August and mid-September. One probable function of the platform is to offer the foxes an observation and resting place with an open view in all directions. ...|$|R

Thus, the types of locomotion typical for goats (e. g. climbing, jumping) have not to take in consideration in stables designed for goat keeping. Some farmers offer their animals elevated <b>resting</b> <b>platforms</b> (niches), but data concerning the preferences of the goats and the labour management of such areas are not available. A herd of non-lactating goats (breed: Bunte Deutsche Edelziege) was parted in six experimental groups with ten animals in each group.

The cleanliness of the niches was documented by photography. Pictures were evaluated by means of an image processing system. Animal behaviour was registered by video-observation. The results showed a relationship between the labour time needed for cleaning of the niches and the preference of niches by the goats.
