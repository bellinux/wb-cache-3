5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low {{concentrations in the}} plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection. <b>Ruminants</b> are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in <b>ruminants</b> than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain. <b>Ruminants</b> grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate <b>ruminants</b> at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E

5|$|The chewing of cud by {{animals such as}} cows, goats, and giraffes is {{considered}} normal behavior. These animals are known as <b>ruminants.</b> Such behavior, though termed rumination, {{is not related to}} human rumination syndrome, but is ordinary. Involuntary rumination, similar to what is seen in humans, has been described in gorillas and other primates.

5|$|A {{wide array}} of {{bacterial}} and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits <b>ruminants)</b> is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats.|$|E
50|$|As {{bacteria}} conduct fermentation in the rumen, {{they consume}} about 10% of the carbon, 60% of the phosphorus, and 80% of the nitrogen that the <b>ruminant</b> ingests. To reclaim these nutrients, the <b>ruminant</b> then digests the {{bacteria in the}} abomasum. The enzyme lysozyme has adapted to facilitate digestion of bacteria in the <b>ruminant</b> abomasum. Pancreatic ribonuclease also degrades bacterial RNA in the <b>ruminant</b> small intestine {{as a source of}} nitrogen.|$|R
30|$|<b>Ruminant</b> {{production}} {{is associated with}} Nitrogen loss especially {{in the form of}} ammonia from urine and manure management during composting. These contribute to greenhouse emission and environmental pollution in general. The most effective way to control and or minimise Nitrogen losses from <b>ruminant</b> production and their manure management is efficient strategic feeding that will provide the required nutrients without short or waste, in other words it should be through precision feeding. Pre-composting followed by vermicomposting provides an effective way of <b>ruminant</b> manure management. Vermicast a product of vermicomposting is a good soil fertiliser which has the potential of being feed supplement to <b>ruminant.</b> This can be achieved by pre composting of cattle manure and then vermicompost with forages. The inclusion of pre-composted cattle manure can be varied from 0 to 40  % in order to ascertain the best level of inclusion for optimal performance. Fibrous crop residues are <b>ruminant</b> feed available in developing countries in some month of the year. Therefore this potentiality should be explored with the aim of reducing environmental pollution from <b>ruminant</b> production and providing nutritional benefit to <b>ruminant</b> from their manure management. Pre-composting of <b>ruminant</b> manure and its subsequent vermicomposting provide a potential of feed supplement and probiotics to <b>ruminant.</b>|$|R
40|$|Due to {{a growing}} {{aquaculture}} industry, demand for high-quality proteins for aquatic feeds is increasing. Non-ruminant processed animal proteins (PAPs) have shown great potential for this purpose. Safe reintroduction of non-ruminant PAPs in aqua feed requires methods that can discriminate <b>ruminant</b> and non-ruminant PAPs at contamination levels at or below 2 %. Because the official European Union method lacks species specificity, the performance of MELISA-TEK™ <b>Ruminant,</b> a commercial immunoassay, combined with the MELISA-TEK High Sensitivity Sample Extraction kit was evaluated. Various non-ruminant PAPs spiked with <b>ruminant</b> PAPs (processed at 133, 137, 141, and 145 °C) were analyzed. Results showed an overall specificity of 99 %, indicating no cross-reaction with non-ruminant PAPs. The sensitivity of the assay strongly depended on both processing temperature and proportion of muscle fibers of the <b>ruminant</b> PAPs. Overall sensitivity of samples with 1 and 2 % <b>ruminant</b> PAPs was 92 and 100 %, respectively. For <b>ruminant</b> PAPs processed at 133 and 137 °C, the sensitivity was 100 % for both 1 and 2 % <b>ruminant</b> spikes. Overall accuracies were 96 and 99 % for 1 and 2 % <b>ruminant</b> spikes, respectively.

5|$|High {{levels of}} {{molybdenum}} {{can interfere with}} the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. <b>Ruminants</b> that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E
5|$|One well-understood {{example of}} {{mutualism}} is {{the interaction between}} protozoa and methanogenic archaea in the digestive tracts of animals that digest cellulose, such as <b>ruminants</b> and termites. In these anaerobic environments, protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, protozoa benefit from more energy.|$|E

40|$|Part I of this {{working paper}} classifies small <b>ruminant</b> sub-systems in the mixed crop {{livestock}} system in Ethiopia. In Part II, important determinants of small <b>ruminant</b> productivity and producers’ input use and marketing strategies were analysed across the six small <b>ruminant</b> sub-systems identified in Part I. Classification of livestock production systems forms a useful {{framework for the}} spatial targeting of development interventions. Household and community level data collected from 497 communities and 2621 households were used to classify small <b>ruminant</b> sub-systems using principal components and cluster analyses. Exploratory analysis indicated variation and a clear structuring in livestock species and small <b>ruminant</b> flock composition and flock size in the mixed crop-livestock system. The variations were related to agro-ecologies and cropping patterns. Cluster analysis identified six clusters which were designated as sub-systems in the mixed crop-livestock system. The sub-systems were named following the dominant small <b>ruminant</b> species (sheep versus goat) {{and the degree of}} intensity/extensiveness of small <b>ruminant</b> production.

5|$|The horse {{adapted to}} survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, {{surviving}} in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially <b>ruminants,</b> could not. Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only <b>ruminants</b> have a rumen). After the plant {{material}} is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the <b>ruminants,</b> store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E
5|$|A single fungal serpin {{has been}} {{characterized}} to date: celpin from Piromyces spp. strain E2. Piromyces is a genus of anaerobic fungi found in the gut of <b>ruminants</b> and is important for digesting plant material. Celpin is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N-terminal dockerin domains {{in addition to its}} serpin domain. Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose. It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases. Certain bacterial serpins similarly localize to the cellulosome.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In <b>ruminants,</b> which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} <b>ruminants,</b> the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E

A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E

5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than <b>ruminants</b> but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{observes that}} there are many spirals in nature, from the horns of <b>ruminants</b> to the shells of molluscs; other spirals are found among the florets of the sunflower. He notes that the {{mathematics}} of these are similar but the biology differs. He describes the spiral of Archimedes before moving on to the logarithmic spiral, which has the property of never changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually self-similar. Shells as diverse as Haliotis, Triton, Terebra and Nautilus (illustrated with a halved shell and a radiograph) have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and if desired also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites.|$|E
5|$|Equines are {{monogastric}} hindgut fermenters. They {{prefer to}} eat grasses and sedges, {{but may also}} consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits and roots if their favored foods are scarce, particularly asses. Compared to <b>ruminants,</b> equines have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like cecum. where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants; 30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for a cow. Equines may spend 60-80 {{percent of their time}} feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.|$|E
