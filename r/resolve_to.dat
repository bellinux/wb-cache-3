5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Concorde was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given but that it became apparent during the grounding of Concorde that the airlines could make more profit carrying first-class passengers subsonically. A lack of commitment to Concorde from Director of Engineering Alan MacDonald was cited as having undermined BA's <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> continue operating Concorde.|$|E

5|$|After the indecisive {{results of}} the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, Fidel Castro claimed that the {{increased}} cost of continuing to fight for South Africa had placed Cuba in its most aggressive combat position of the war, arguing that he was preparing to leave Angola with his opponents on the defensive. According to Cuba, the political, economical and technical cost to South Africa of maintaining its presence in Angola proved too much. Conversely, the South Africans believe that they indicated their <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> the superpowers by preparing a nuclear test that ultimately forced the Cubans into a settlement.|$|E

5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> achieve re-nomination, {{as he was}} convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, one of the last links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.|$|E
5|$|At Tymshare, Engelbart {{soon found}} himself marginalized and relegated to obscurity. Operational {{concerns}} at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's {{desire to do}} further research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at McDonnell Douglas, which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas {{was focused on the}} enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system. Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.|$|E

5|$|CANBAT 1 was {{expected}} to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively. The forces would attempt to deter the HV from advancing, demonstrate its <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> defend Sector West, engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars, protect the Jordanian and Nepalese withdrawal and withdraw {{under the protection of}} CANBAT 1. The two companies required eight hours notice of the HV advance to reach their designated positions in time. Presumably, the ARSK would retrieve its heavy weapons from the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} played them {{against each other}} in a divide and conquer strategy to weaken any chance of a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E

50|$|An {{extended}} dominant is a non-diatonic secondary-dominant seventh chord that <b>resolves</b> downwards <b>to</b> another dominant chord. A {{series of}} extended dominant chords continues <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> downwards by perfect fifths {{until they reach}} the tonic chord. Most common is the tertiary dominant, which <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> a secondary dominant. For example V/V/V (in C major, A(7)) <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> V/V (D(7)), which <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> V (G(7)), which <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> I (note that V/V/V is the same chord as V/ii, but differs in its resolution to a major dominant rather than a minor chord). Quaternary dominants are rarer, but {{an example is the}} bridge section of the Rhythm changes which starts from V/V/V/V (in C major, E(7)). Though typically used in jazz, extended dominants have been used in other contexts as well.|$|R

After Souseiseki's Rosa Mystica is taken by Suigintou, Jun's Rozen Maidens <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> revive her and to end the Alice Game peacefully; they later befriend Kanaria who shares their sentiments. However, the group is attacked by Kirakisho who absorbs Hinaichigo and traps Shinku and Suiseiseki in the N-field, a plane of consciousness which connects the universe. Rozen Maiden concludes with Jun preparing to enter the N-field to save the dolls.|$|E
5|$|Sora, Donald and Goofy battle Ansem {{outside the}} door to Kingdom Hearts, which Ansem {{believes}} {{to be the ultimate}} reservoir of darkness. Upon opening the door, however, it reveals its light, overwhelming and destroying Ansem. Beyond the door are King Mickey and Riku, and they help Sora and the others close the door, as there are many Heartless beyond it. Mickey and Sora use their Keyblades to lock the door. The worlds lost to the Heartless reconstruct themselves; as the Destiny Islands reform, Kairi returns there while Sora is forced to part with her. The game concludes as Sora, Donald, and Goofy <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> find Riku and Mickey.|$|E

Thirty high-ranking officers headed by General Lê Văn Tỵ declared their <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> carry out all missions entrusted to the army {{for the defense of}} the constitution and the Republic. The declaration was a veneer which masked a developing plot to oust Diệm. Some of the signatories were to become personally involved in Diệm's overthrow and death in November. Generals Dương Văn Minh and Trần Văn Đôn, the presidential military advisor and the chief of the army who were to lead the coup, were overseas.|$|E
5|$|The NULL literal is untyped in SQL, {{meaning that}} it is not {{designated}} as an integer, character, or any other specific data type. Because of this, it is sometimes mandatory (or desirable) to explicitly convert Nulls to a specific data type.
