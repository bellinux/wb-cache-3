5|$|Barbara and Adam Maitland {{decide to}} spend their {{vacation}} decorating their idyllic Connecticut country home. As the two are driving home {{from a trip to}} town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river. After they return home, Adam decides to retrace their steps as they can't <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> they got home. Upon stepping outside he's taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before being pulled back in by Barbara. Even though he had been gone for less than a minute Barbara claims he had been gone for over an hour. She and Adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and realize they did not survive the crash.|$|E
25|$|He told detectives in December 2003 that {{he lived}} {{most of his life}} in a fog and that he had blacked out {{memories}} of murdering most of his victims. He said he could not <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> many of them there were or why he had chosen them. In some cases, Cullen adamantly denied committing any murders at a given facility. But after reviewing medical records, he admitted that he was involved in patient deaths.|$|E
25|$|Many {{researchers}} use self-report {{measures of}} felt emotion as a manipulation check. This raises {{an interesting question}} and a possible methodological weakness: are people always accurate when they <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> they felt in the past? Several findings suggest {{this is not the}} case. For instance, in a study of memory for emotions in supporters of former U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot, supporters were asked to describe their initial emotional reactions after Perot's unexpected withdrawal in July 1992 and again after the presidential election that November.|$|E
50|$|Later that evening, Christine De Chagny's maid, Meg Giry, <b>recalls</b> <b>how</b> {{agitated}} her mistress {{was after}} hearing {{the sound of the}} music box. She later <b>recalls</b> <b>how</b> many years ago she had seen first hand Christine's encounter with the mysterious Phantom. She attempts to comfort Christine.|$|R

25|$|During {{the first}} year of the investigation, seven coins were seized or voluntarily turned in to the Secret Service and were {{subsequently}} destroyed at the Mint; an eighth coin was recovered the following year and met the same fate. In 1945, the investigation identified the alleged thief and his accomplice, Switt, who admitted to selling the nine (located) coins, but could not <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> he obtained them. The Justice Department tried to prosecute them, but the statute of limitations had passed. A tenth coin was recovered and destroyed in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Guybrush Threepwood is {{adrift in}} the sea in a {{floating}} bumper car, unable to <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> he escaped from the Big Whoop amusement park. He approaches Plunder Island, which is governed by his love Elaine Marley and under siege by the zombie pirate LeChuck. LeChuck captures him and locks him in the ship's hold. Seeking a way out, Guybrush fires an unrestrained cannon (causing LeChuck to drop a magical voodoo cannonball and explode), finds a diamond ring in the treasure hold, and escapes the ship as it sinks. He reunites with Elaine and proposes to her with the diamond ring. However, the ring is revealed to be cursed, and when Elaine puts it on she {{is transformed into a}} gold statue and stolen by marauders.|$|E
500|$|At that time, no {{one else}} in the world of physics had noticed what Curie {{recorded}} in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: [...] "The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium." [...] She later would <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> she felt [...] "a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible." [...] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tons of the ore.|$|E

2500|$|The {{young men}} {{who lived in the}} downstairs flat at Via della Pergola7 were unable to <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> Guede had met them, but they did <b>recall</b> <b>how,</b> after his first visit to their home, they had found him later in the bathroom, sitting asleep on the unflushed toilet, which was full of feces. Guede {{allegedly}} committed break-ins, including one of a lawyer's office through a second floor window, and another during which he burgled a flat and brandished a jackknife when confronted. On 27October 2007, days before Kercher's murder, Guede was arrested in Milan after breaking into a nursery school; he was reportedly found by police with an 11-inch knife [...] that had been taken from the school kitchen.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the castle}} Walter and Wurm <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> the Count rose to power by killing his own cousin and Wurm reminds the Count how Rodolfo also knows of this.

2500|$|However, in his [...] {{claims that}} Although Dyer later {{claimed to have}} {{undertaken}} the massacre to ‘save’ British India, he had had no such idea in his mind that fateful afternoon. As well as being ‘dazed and shaken up’ – hardly the response of a soldier who had had murder in his mind – all the witnesses <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> Dyer ‘was unnerved and deeply upset about what had happened’.|$|E
2500|$|Hells Angels members Raymond Joseph [...] "Ray" [...] Hamment, Jr. and Paul Peterson, {{and club}} {{associate}} Andrew Hinton, each {{pleaded guilty to}} charges of conduct endangering life, intentionally causing serious injury, false imprisonment and rioting after abducting Brendan Schievella from outside a bar and holding him captive for five hours in Ivanhoe, Melbourne on June 25, 2005. Schievella was found with a toe amputated but told police he could not <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> it happened and no motive has been established for the incident.|$|E
2500|$|... … we somehow {{got around}} to taking about Wilamowitz … [...] said that Wilamowitz would pepper his lectures with remarks about the {{political}} situation in Germany and that his students would applaud by loudly stamping their feet on the floor. The remarks were of such a nature that they caused Cherniss to develop an intense dislike for the man. I don’t <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> he characterized the remarks, but Solmsen’s description of the antidemocratic, anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic Prussian lens through which Wilamowitz viewed Weimar Germany would explain Cherniss’s antipathy.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{the first}} time I had heard this great artist play. [...] He was most amiable at the rehearsal.... To this day I can <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> Rubinstein sat down at the piano, his leonine head thrown back slightly, and began the five opening {{measures}} of the principal theme.... It seemed to me I had never before heard the piano really played. [...] The grandeur of style with which Rubinstein presented those five measures, the beauty of tone his softness of touch secured, the art with which he manipulated the pedal, are indescribable ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyons also {{received}} backing from Ronald W. Reagan, former host of CBS's General Electric Theater. At the time, Reagan did not fly {{and came to}} Louisiana by train, a trip that required several days. He was accompanied by his wife, Nancy. The stops for Lyons occurred ten months before Reagan delivered his address, [...] "A Time for Choosing", on national television on October 27, 1964, to promote Barry Goldwater's presidential bid against President Lyndon B. Johnson. The speech was credited with catapulting Reagan into the vanguard of national politics. Like Lyons, Reagan was a former Democrat who had switched party allegiance in 1962. Charlton Lyons, Jr., said he cannot <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> his father met Reagan but believes the two had been friends for several years before the 1964 campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Connolly {{formed a}} folk-pop duo called The Humblebums with Tam Harvey. They were joined, in 1969, by Gerry Rafferty, who had {{approached}} Connolly after a gig in Paisley. The band signed for independent label Transatlantic Records, and after recording one album (1969's First Collection of Merry Melodies), Harvey left the trio, and Connolly and Rafferty {{went on to}} release two more albums: The New Humblebums (1969) and Open up the Door (1970). Connolly's time with Rafferty possibly influenced his future comedy, because years later he would <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> Rafferty's expert prank telephone calls, made while waiting to go on stage, used to make him [...] "scream" [...] with laughter. The albums were not big commercial successes but enjoyed cult status and critical acclaim. [...] Connolly's contributions were primarily straightforward pop-folk with quirky and whimsical lyrics, {{but he had not}} especially focused on comedy at this point.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is barely}} any {{recalled}} memory {{in cases of}} fear and trauma exposure, brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, pain, or anxiety. Recall memory is very limited, since the only memory people have that suffer from these problems is the flash backs of what happened when the event took place. People can only recall the memory that happened on that day when they hear or see something that brings the memory into existence. They cannot <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> they felt or what they saw, but through images or audio people can recall that tragic event. For example, the day of September 11, 2001, first responders remember the day {{and what it was}} like; but the feelings they could not recall. The only way to recall the feelings they had were when sirens of police vehicles, fire trucks, and ambulances drove by their house they feel the exact feelings that were in effect on that day.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{newspaper}} article La Penitenciaría de Guatemala (English: The Guatemalan Penitentiary), the British-Guatemalan writer Guillermo F. Hall [...] described {{one of the}} prisoners {{who was in charge}} of punishing his fellow captives in the Penitentiary during Justo Rufino Barrios regime: [...] "Tata Juan" [...] was the oldest prisoner in the prison, being inside since it had opened its door. [...] He had been a minion of Rufino Barrios and Barrundia. It was his favorite topic to talk to his admirers about the crimes he had committed, either on his own or by orders of the president and the Secretary of War [...] [...] He would brag about killing twenty six men on his own; he did not <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> many others had died from his punishment in the cells by orders from Barrundia and Barrios- there were so many! He would tell [...] how he would fulfill his masters requests; how after hitting someone 200 or 300 times would take a nap lulled with the groaning of his victim [...] the task with renewed vigor, destroying their eyes so they would not [...] "complain as much".|$|E
2500|$|After Pius XII's {{death on}} 9 October 1958 many Jewish organisations and {{newspapers}} {{around the world}} paid tribute to his legacy. At the United Nations, Golda Meir, Israel's Foreign Minister, said, [...] "When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, {{the voice of the}} Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict." [...] The Jewish Chronicle (London) stated on 10 October that [...] "Adherents of all creeds and parties will <b>recall</b> <b>how</b> Pius XII faced the responsibilities of his exalted office with courage and devotion. Before, during, and after the Second World War, he constantly preached the message of peace. Confronted by the monstrous cruelties of Nazism, Fascism and Communism, he repeatedly proclaimed the virtues of humanity and compassion". In the Canadian Jewish Chronicle (17 October), Rabbi J. Stern stated that Pius XII [...] "made it possible for thousands of Jewish victims of Nazism and Fascism to be hidden away..." [...] In the 6 November edition of the Jewish Post in Winnipeg, William Zukerman, the former American Hebrew columnist, wrote that no other leader [...] "did more to help the Jews in their hour of greatest tragedy, during the Nazi occupation of Europe, than the late Pope". Other prominent Jewish figures, such as Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett and Chief Rabbi Isaac Herzog expressed their public gratitude to Pius XII.|$|E
