50|$|The Soviet {{economic}} year (October 1 to September 30) 1925/26 had generated state grain procurement of 8.4 million tons. This was {{far exceeded}} in 1926/27, when a post-revolutionary <b>record</b> <b>harvest</b> of 76.8 million tons {{resulted in a}} state procurement of 10.6 million tons at stable prices. No upward price adjustment had been necessary owing to the massive size of the harvest, {{which resulted in a}} supply glut. Expectations for the coming year were raised accordingly, with planned procurement for the coming economic year 1927/28 exceeding quantities obtained during the previous year of <b>record</b> <b>harvest.</b>|$|E

50|$|Between 1976 and 1978, {{the economy}} quickly {{recovered}} from the stagnation of the Cultural Revolution. Agricultural production was sluggish in 1977 because of a third consecutive year of adverse weather conditions but rebounded with a <b>record</b> <b>harvest</b> in 1978. Industrial output jumped by 14 percent in 1977 and by 13 percent in 1978.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture was {{organized}} {{into a system}} of collective farms (kolkhozes) and state farms (sovkhozes). Organized {{on a large scale}} and highly mechanized, the Soviet Union was one of the world's leading producers of cereals, although bad harvests (as in 1972 and 1975) necessitated imports and slowed the economy. The 1976-1980 five-year plan shifted resources to agriculture, and 1978 saw a <b>record</b> <b>harvest</b> followed by another drop in overall production in 1979 and 1980 back to levels attained in 1975. Cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, and flax were also major crops.|$|E
50|$|New {{records were}} set in the 2016/2017 season when the company {{received}} 16.6 million tonnes of grain.

The highest monthly shipping record was also broken in January with 1.88 million tonnes shipped out. The previous monthly shipping record of 1.66 million tonnes had been set in February 2014.|$|E
50|$|The roster later {{included}} British {{jazz and}} folk. Some {{of the more}} progressive jazz musicians of the late 1960s were released under the Deram imprint, including Mike Gibbs, John Surman, and Mike Westbrook. Deram albums bore a DML prefix for mono and an SML prefix for stereo releases. As with other UK Decca subsidiary labels, Deram's U.S. counterpart was distributed under London Records. Decca positioned it against Island <b>Records,</b> <b>Harvest</b> <b>Records</b> (started by EMI), and Vertigo Records (started by Philips Records), but it failed to compete. An 'extra' progressive series with SDL prefixes did not improve the situation.|$|R

50|$|Productivity of the Virgin Lands {{underwent}} a steady decrease following {{the harvest of}} 1958. In 1963 Khrushchev began an initiative to widely expand fertilizer production and availability throughout the Soviet Union {{in order to increase}} the productivity of the Virgin Lands. The USSR only possessed 20 million tons of fertilizers for every 218 million hectares (2,180,000 km) as opposed to the United States, which possessed 35 million tons of fertilizer for every 118 million hectares (1,180,000 km) of land. Khrushchev ordered 60 new fertilizer factories to be built. Even so, the productivity of the Virgin Lands continued to decline and never got close to replicating the <b>record</b> <b>harvest</b> of 1956.|$|E
50|$|Following {{electrification}} of the Main Western line to Lithgow in 1957, some 36 class locomotives {{were based}} at Lithgow, Bathurst and Parkes, {{and with the}} introduction of diesel locomotives, were relegated to freight trains although they did continue to haul the Central West Express west of Lithgow until at least 1963. As well as providing a faster service, useful for more perishable goods, the rostering of the 36 class on freight workings allowed the withdrawal of numbers of Standard Goods locomotives. Withdrawal of the 36 class commenced in January 1959 as more diesels became available, but a number were temporarily returned to traffic in late 1966, to work wheat trains after a <b>record</b> <b>harvest.</b> The last was withdrawn in September 1969.|$|E

5000|$|The longest {{recorded}} period {{anyone ever}} {{spent on the}} island was about nine months. Three men and eight boys from Hirta were marooned here from about 15 August 1727 until 13 May 1728. As luck would have it, Hirta suffered a smallpox outbreak while the eleven were on the stack, and thus the islanders were unable to man a boat and retrieve them until the next year. Such temporary accidental occupation of the island {{may have been a}} regular event, since Martin Martin also relates, in an anecdote in A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland, how a group of some twenty men were stranded on the island {{for a couple of days}} after the rope that held their boat broke. They survived by fishing, and communicated to their wives that they were alive and well by lighting [...] "as many fires on the top of an eminence as there were men in number." [...] Martin adds, curiously, that the wives were so overjoyed that they managed to produce a <b>record</b> <b>harvest</b> of corn that year.|$|E
50|$|Despite immense land resources, {{extensive}} {{farm machinery}} and agrochemical industries, {{and a large}} rural workforce, Soviet agriculture was relatively unproductive. Output was hampered in many areas by the climate (only 10% of the Soviet Union's land was arable) and poor worker productivity. However, Soviet farm performance was not uniformly bad. Organized {{on a large scale}} and relatively highly mechanized, its state and collective agriculture made the Soviet Union one of the world's leading producers of cereals, although bad harvests (as in 1972 and 1975) necessitated imports and slowed the economy. The 1976-1980 five-year plan shifted resources to agriculture, and 1978 saw a <b>record</b> <b>harvest.</b> Conditions were best in the temperate chernozem (black earth) belt stretching from Ukraine through southern Russia into the east, spanning the extreme southern portions of Siberia. In addition to cereals, cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, and flax were also major crops. Such performance showed that underlying potential was not lacking, which was not surprising as the agriculture in the Russian Empire was traditionally amongst the highest producing in the world, although rural social conditions since the October Revolution were hardly improved. Grains were mostly produced by the sovkhozes and kolkhozes, but vegetables and herbs often came from private plots.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the members}} of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young went their {{separate}} ways in 1970, Young recruited a group of country session musicians (which he christened The Stray Gators) and recorded a country rock <b>record,</b> <b>Harvest.</b> The record was a massive hit, producing a US number one single in [...] "Heart of Gold". Other songs returned to some usual Young themes: [...] "Alabama" [...] was [...] "an unblushing rehash of 'Southern Man'"; and [...] "The Needle and the Damage Done" [...] was a lament for great artists who had died of heroin addiction. The former song was also at least partially responsible (along with the aforementioned [...] "Southern Man") {{for the creation of}} Lynyrd Skynyrd's 1973 hit [...] "Sweet Home Alabama" [...] which mentions Neil by name. Young later wrote of [...] "Alabama" [...] in his autobiography Waging Heavy Peace, saying it [...] "richly deserved the shot Lynyrd Skynyrd gave me with their great record. I don't like my words when I listen to it. They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue." [...] "Words (Between the Lines of Age)", the last song on the album, featured a lengthy guitar workout with the band. It has a typical Neil Young structure consisting of four chords during the multiple improvised solos. The song is also notable for alternating between a standard 4/4 time signature for verses and choruses and an unusual 11/8 (6/8+5/8) for interludes.|$|E

50|$|Thailand {{ranks as}} the world's largest rubber {{producer}} and exporter, producing around 4.3 million tonnes per year, while consuming only 519,000 tons. It provides about 40 percent of the world's natural rubber, mostly used in aircraft and automobile tires. But the rubber industry has faced a series of challenges. Alongside drought in 2015-2016, Thailand was hit hard by an oversupply in international rubber markets. Following a <b>record</b> <b>harvest</b> in 2011, Thailand increased rubber acreage by 45 percent. Other top producers in the region followed suit. Concomitantly, China's demand for rubber decreased by 10 percent. China is the world's largest natural rubber consumer, using 4,150,000 tons in 2013. At one point {{the price of the}} world's benchmark smoked rubber sheet dropped as low as US$1.27 per kilogram, or 80 percent below the record high of US$6.40 per kg in February 2011. Similarly, rubber futures in Shanghai have dropped by 22 percent and the export price of Thai rubber by 23 percent. Then, as prices began to rebound, the southern provinces of Thailand, where two-thirds of the Thai rubber plantations are located, were hit by torrential rains and flooding {{at the peak of the}} rubber-tapping season. The Rubber Authority of Thailand forecasts that output will drop 7.6 percent in 2017. Farmers, unable to harvest rubber sap due to high water, are unable to take advantage of the highest rubber prices in four years. Largely due to the flooding, prices for unsmoked USS3 rubber sheets in Nakhon Si Thammarat have increased steadily and reached 84.32 baht (US$2.38) per kilogram in January 2017 and will likely go higher. Rubber growers face an even greater danger: rubber trees die after 20 days when inundated by flood waters.|$|E

25|$|Although actual harvests were reduced, local officials, under {{tremendous}} pressure from central authorities to report <b>record</b> <b>harvests</b> {{in response to}} the innovations, competed with each other to announce increasingly exaggerated results.
