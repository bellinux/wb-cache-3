50|$|The film {{ends with}} a fantastic {{expression}} of horror on Stuart's face and the final punch-line of Matthew <b>returning</b> to the <b>elevator</b> and making a horse noise to Stuart.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the drop}} sequence, the <b>elevator</b> <b>returns</b> to its loading level, where the idol's green eyes glare from a star field, which then disappear, {{replaced}} by the service doors through which guests entered.|$|R
50|$|A home {{version of}} <b>Elevator</b> Action <b>Returns</b> was {{released}} for the Sega Saturn in 1997 {{under the title}} of <b>Elevator</b> Action² <b>Returns</b> (pronounced <b>Elevator</b> Action/Elevator Action <b>Returns),</b> which included the original Elevator Action as well. <b>Elevator</b> Action <b>Returns</b> was later included as part of Taito Legends 2 for the PlayStation 2, PC and Xbox in 2006, but both the PS2 and Xbox versions run in upscanned 640x448 resolution, which results in slight flickering, no scanlines and slightly blurrier image compared to the arcade and Sega Saturn versions.|$|R
5|$|The {{elevator}} to the commuter rail platform was also {{temporarily out of service}} for maintenance during the same period; a shuttle bus ran between Harvard, Porter and Waltham. The Red Line <b>elevator</b> was <b>returned</b> to service on June 22, 2012, and the commuter rail <b>elevator</b> <b>returned</b> to service on July 30, 2012.|$|R
2500|$|After {{a series}} of these drops have been made, the <b>elevator</b> <b>returns</b> to the {{basement}} of the decrepit Hollywood Tower Hotel, past a curious array of abandoned items. A short clip plays, showing elements from the Season 5 opening sequence, along with the 1939 elevator passengers and Rod Serling falling into the [...] "vortex" [...] seen in the Season 3 opening sequence. Serling's voice says: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{walked quickly}} to the back part of the hotel and ascended in another {{elevator}} to the wing in which the servants' quarters were situated. Here {{she made her way}} along a corridor until she reached Macdougal's room. She knocked, and knocked again. There was no answer. She tried the door and found it was locked. Then she <b>returned</b> to the <b>elevator</b> and descended once more to the floor upon which her mistress's apartments were situated. She opened the door of the suite without knocking and turned at once to the sitting-room.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevator}} is a moveable part of {{the horizontal}} stabilizer, hinged {{to the back of}} the fixed {{part of the}} horizontal tail. The elevators move up and down together. When the pilot pulls the stick backward, the elevators go up. Pushing the stick forward causes the elevators to go down. Raised elevators push down on the tail and cause the nose to pitch up. This makes the wings fly at a higher angle of attack, which generates more lift and more drag. Centering the stick <b>returns</b> the <b>elevators</b> to neutral and stops the change of pitch. Some aircraft, such as an MD-80, use a servo tab within the elevator surface to aerodynamically move the main surface into position. The direction of travel of the control tab will thus be in a direction opposite to the main control surface. It is for this reason that an MD-80 tail looks like it has a 'split' elevator system.|$|R
40|$|Farmers use forward {{contracts}} to eliminate adverse price and basis movements prior to harvest. Since late 2007, the local basis for Kansas wheat {{has changed dramatically}} relative to historic levels, causing greater risk exposure for elevators o ffering forward contracts. The result {{has been an increase}} in the cost of forward contracting paid by farmers from $ 0. 086 per bushel to $ 0. 327 per bushel. The factors driving this increase in costs are basis volatility, wheat futures harvest price, the information available in the market as harvest approaches, and realized <b>returns</b> to the <b>elevator</b> from forward contracting in previous years...|$|R
50|$|Phase one mode is {{activated}} by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building. Once an alarm has been activated, the elevator will automatically go into phase one. The elevator will wait {{an amount of}} time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor. Once the elevator has left the floor, depending on where the alarm was set off, the elevator {{will go to the}} fire-recall floor. However, if the alarm was activated on the fire-recall floor, the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to. When the elevator is recalled, it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open. The elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction. Located on the fire-recall floor is a fire-service key switch. The fire-service key switch has the ability to turn fire service off, turn fire service on or to bypass fire service. The only way to <b>return</b> the <b>elevator</b> to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset.|$|R
500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{focused on}} Frank's alleged sexual behavior. They alleged that Frank, with Conley's assistance, regularly met {{with women in}} his office for sexual relations. On {{the day of the}} murder, Conley said he saw Phagan go upstairs, from where he heard a scream coming shortly after. He then said he dozed off; when he woke up, Frank called him upstairs and showed him Phagan's body, admitting that he had hurt her. Conley repeated statements from his affidavits that he and Frank took Phagan's body to the basement via the <b>elevator,</b> before <b>returning</b> in the <b>elevator</b> to the office [...] where Frank dictated the murder notes.|$|R
50|$|Once Tinker leaves, Alex {{tells his}} {{children}} {{that he and}} their mother were not born on what they perceived as their home world. Tinker <b>returns</b> from the <b>elevator,</b> yelling to them not to trust Alex, and Alex shoots and kills Tinker. Alex leaves the building after telling Ronan and Beatrix that they must find their mother, who they insist is dead, in order {{to return to the}} core world. After the building transports them once again, three different versions of Polly convene in secret and two of them play rock-paper-scissors to presumably determine who will accompany {{the rest of the group}} into the next world.|$|R

2500|$|Upon the Elevator's departure, {{the staff}} and astronauts go aboard, and the Knids consume twenty-four of the staff, while the others escape. The Knids dive-bomb the shuttle, {{destroying}} the rockets, cameras, and radio antenna, apparently stranding the occupants in space. Seeing all this from the [...] "Knidproof" [...] Great Glass Elevator, Charlie suggests {{that he and his}} companions tow the shuttle back to Earth. [...] Wonka pilots the Elevator into range, whereupon Grandpa Joe connects the two vessels by means of a steel cord. The Knids change into living segments of a towing line, with which to capture the two spacecraft, while a single Knid wraps his body around the Elevator to provide an anchor for this operation; whereupon Willy Wonka <b>returns</b> the <b>Elevator</b> to Earth, and the Knids are incinerated in the atmosphere. At the right moment, Mr. Wonka releases the shuttle, which floats safely home. The Elevator then crashes back down through the roof of the chocolate factory, but thanks to Mr. Wonka's expert piloting, the hurtling Elevator perfectly engages inside another of the same shafts that it had exited from in the first book, and rolls smoothly downward to a normal stop inside the factory.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevators}} and escalators {{installed in}} 2000, which {{are necessary for}} many passengers to reach the Boston-bound platform, have proved unreliable. In early 2013, the escalator serving the outbound platform failed and was not repaired {{due to lack of}} funding for replacement. The inbound platform escalator and one elevator failed in early 2015, prompting Amtrak to initiate replacement of both escalators and both elevators. The replacement process was originally expected to require both elevators to be out of service until the project is complete in early 2016. The elevators were taken out of service on July 20, 2015; Amtrak provided an accessible shuttle service between both platforms and the station building. The <b>elevators</b> <b>returned</b> to service on September 1, 2015, though the escalators remained out of service for several months longer.|$|R
500|$|There {{have been}} {{persistent}} rumors of clashes among the musicians during the session. Douglas' version is that Mingus complained about Roach's playing, {{then left the}} studio mid-session, taking his bass with him. Ellington caught up with Mingus on the street outside and persuaded him to return. Ellington's account was slightly different – the reason for Mingus leaving was the same, but he was persuaded to <b>return</b> at the <b>elevator.</b> Another version is that Mingus was upset because Ellington did not use any of Mingus' compositions for the recording. Duke's son, Mercer Ellington, stated that the trio had a contract with United Artists for two albums, {{but they could not}} be persuaded to record together again. Critic Thomas Cunniffe suggests that, listening to the tracks in the order in which they were recorded, [...] "one can easily hear the tension building during the uptempo numbers", and that Mingus' temporary departure probably occurred after playing [...] "Money Jungle", which [...] "represents the apex of the group's inner tension, with Mingus plucking the strings with his fingernails, Roach firing up the music with polyrhythms and Ellington laying down highly dissonant chords".|$|R
5000|$|The Miracle reverts almost immediately, {{accompanied}} by an effect which Gwen calls [...] "a breath": all of the world's Category 1 patients regain consciousness for a few seconds, then pass away in the next breath. This includes Gwen's father, who awakes in time to hear his wife wishing him goodbye over the phone. At the same time both of the Blessing sites begin to shake, making the structure around them unstable. Oswald grabs The Mother and urges Gwen to leave; she does, but as the exit elevator rises, Jack comes back to life. A brief struggle ensues between Jilly and Gwen before Gwen incapacitates Jilly, <b>returns</b> in the <b>elevator</b> and rescues Jack. The Mother begs Oswald to let her go, but Oswald proclaims he is happy to die and go to hell; as that is where [...] "all the bad little girls" [...] go. Jack and Gwen escape of the facility just seconds before Oswald detonates his explosives, destroying the Shanghai facility. Jilly follows close behind but falls to the ground, Jack and Gwen are unable {{to go back for}} her and she is engulfed in the explosion. The Buenos Aires team moves to leave as well, but before The Cousin can make it out, Rex regains consciousness long enough to grab him and throw him {{over the edge of the}} chasm around The Blessing. Rex falls to the ground next to Esther, the two watching each other die, but are rescued by Captain Santos and members of the Argentinian Army. Paramedics immediately start working to revive both Rex and Esther.|$|R
