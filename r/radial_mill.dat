40|$|Abstract. Aluminum alloy, {{as a kind}} of large-scaled structures, {{have been}} widely used in modern {{aerospace}} industry. In order to reduce its machining deformation, cutting parameter optimization is absolutely necessarily. By fuzzy synthetic evaluation, cutting parameters are optimized based on factors: surface roughness, residual stress, <b>radial</b> <b>milling</b> force and milling temperature. By maximal grade of membership rule, optimized values are obtained by different two methods. And by BP network with Bayesian regularization method the corresponding milling parameters are obtained too...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanistic}} {{model of the}} milling process based on an adaptive and local depth buffer is presented. This {{mechanistic model}} is needed for speedy computations of the cutting forces when machining surfaces on multi-axis milling machines. By adaptively orienting the depth buffer to match the current tool axis, {{the need for an}} extended Z-buffer is eliminated. This allows the mechanistic model to be implemented using standard graphics libraries, and gains the substantial benefit of hardware acceleration. Secondly, this method allows the depth buffer to be sized to the tool as opposed to the workpiece, and thus improves the depth buffer size to accuracy ratio drastically. The method calculates tangential and <b>radial</b> <b>milling</b> forces dependent on the in-process volume of material removed as determined by the rendering engine depth buffer. The method incorporates the effects of both cutting and edge forces and accounts for cutter runout. The simulated forces were verified with experimental data and found to agree closely. The error bounds of this process are also determined...|$|R

Her machinery shop's equipment included lathes, <b>radial</b> drills, <b>milling</b> machines, slotting machines, boring machines, optical repair equipment, armature bake ovens, and coil winding machines. To meet additional demands from the fleet, she had a motion picture shop, large laundry and bakery facilities, and large refrigeration units.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{that the}} high speed milling experiments on NAK 80 die steel was carried out on the DMU 60 mono BLOCK five axis linkage high speed CNC machining center tool by the TiAlN coated tools, in order to research the effect of milling parameters on surface roughness Ra. The {{results showed that the}} Ra value increased with the decrease of milling speed vc, increased with the axial depth of milling ap, and feed per tooth fz and <b>radial</b> depth of <b>milling</b> ae. On the basis of the single factor experiment results, the mathematics model for between surface roughness and milling parameters were established by linear regression analysis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we give a unified proof to the soliton {{resolution}} conjecture along {{a sequence of}} times, for the semilinear focusing energy critical wave equations in the radial case and two dimensional equivariant wave map equations, including the four dimensional <b>radial</b> Yang <b>Mills</b> equation, without using outer energy type inequalities. Such inequalities have {{played a crucial role}} in previous works with similar results. Roughly speaking, we prove that along a sequence of times approaching the maximal time of existence, the solution decouples to a sum of rescaled solitons and a term vanishing in the energy space, plus a free radiation term in the global case or a regular part in the finite time blow up case. The main difficulty is that in general (for instance for the radial four dimensional Yang Mills case and the radial six dimensional semilinear wave case) we do not have a favorable outer energy inequality for the associated linear wave equations. Our main new input is the simultaneous use of two virial identities. Comment: Updated to fill a gap in the proof, in accordance with the correction in arXiv: 1201. 4986 v 2 and arXiv: 1209. 3682 v...|$|R
50|$|City Mill Lock, which connects Bow Back River and {{the bottom}} of the City Mill River to the Waterworks River, was built as part of the 1930s {{improvement}} programme. Unlike Carpenter's Lock, which was built {{at the same time and}} was fitted with vertical <b>radial</b> gates, City <b>Mill</b> Lock was built with conventional mitre gates. Two pairs of gates pointing to the west, allowing the lock to be used when the level of the water in the Waterworks River was lower than that in the City Mill River, and a third pair pointing to the east, which prevented high tide levels in the Waterworks River forcing the gates open, and the City Mill River draining as the tide fell. The lock was 20 ft wide, and could handle boats up to 87 ft long. The original gates lasted for almost seventy years, but by 2000 were deemed to be unsafe, and were replaced by stop planks.|$|R
40|$|The {{upper bound}} element {{technique}} (UBET) {{is used to}} determine the optimum intermediate shape for profile ring rolling using backward simulation. The lowest energy rate is the key issue in achieving the optimal intermediate shape as well as the backward simulation of the process. The plastic flow of material in ring rolling is assumed to be a sequence of successive closed-die forging processes. The ring is divided into features, which provide an approximated profile consisting of a number of rectangular elements. The simulation of the profile ring rolling was tested with different profiles of rolls, and two such cases are presented here. The present method was validated using an experimental <b>radial</b> ring rolling <b>mill</b> designed and fabricated in the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering at Ohio University for the investigation of both cold and hot ring rolling processes. As the results show, this technique is capable of solving the backward simulation of profile ring rolling problems in a much shorter time compared to the finite element method (FEM). This approach can be applied effectively to the profile ring rolling process and can serve as a useful tool in industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Climate and {{longleaf}} pine (Pinus palustris P. <b>Mill.)</b> <b>radial</b> growth {{relationships have}} been documented within its southern and western distribution. However, knowledge of this relationship is lacking along its northern latitudinal range margin (NLRM). Based {{on the principles of}} ecological amplitude, limiting factors, and studies of coniferous species in eastern temperate forests of the U. S., we hypothesized that the radial growth of longleaf pine in mixed pine-hardwood forests is responding to winter temperatures in southeastern Virginia. Two longleaf pine chronologies were developed to determine the relationship between radial growth and monthly temperature, precipitation, and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) via response function analysis (RFA). Results at the 0. 05 level yielded significant response function coefficients with a positive response to current winter temperature and precipitation and a negative response to prior August PDSI. In studies of climate and longleaf pine radial growth in other parts of its range, winter temperature and precipitation have not shared a significant positive association with radial growth. Instead current spring and summer precipitation usually share this positive association. These findings add more evidence to an emerging pattern suggesting that winter temperatures contribute to limiting the radial growth of temperate conifers at northern range margins in the Northern Hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Improvements in {{modeling}} and simulation of metal cutting processes are required in advanced manufacturing technologies. A three dimensional fully thermal-mechanical coupled finite element model had been applied to simulate and analyze the cutting temperature for high speed milling of TiAl 6 V 4 titanium alloy. The temperature distribution induced in the tool and the workpiece was predicted. The effects of the <b>milling</b> speed and <b>radial</b> depth of cut on the maximum cutting temperature in the tool was investigated. The results show that only a rising of temperature in the lamella of the machined surface {{is influenced by the}} milling heat. The maximum temperature in the tool increases with increasing radial depth of cut and milling speed which value is 310 °C at a speed of 60 m/min and increases to 740 °C at 400 m/min. The maximum temperature is only effective on a concentrated area at the cutting edge and the location of the maximum temperature moves away from the tool tip for higher <b>radial</b> depths of <b>milling.</b> The predicted temperature distribution during the cutting process is consistent with the experimental results given in the literature. The results obtained from this study provide a fundamental understanding the process mechanics of HSM of TiAl 6 V 4 titanium alloys...|$|R
