6000|$|I {{seem to see}} him yet--his <b>raised</b> <b>face</b> with a {{friendly}} smile under the thick moustaches, and his kind, fatigued eyes. As the train began to move, he addressed me in two languages: first in French, saying, [...] "Bon voyage"; then, in his very good, somewhat emphatic English, encouragingly, because he could see my concern: [...] "All will--be--well--yet!" ...|$|E

50|$|Slaves {{were buried}} {{oriented}} East to West, with {{feet at the}} Eastern end (head at the Western end, thus <b>raising</b> <b>facing</b> East). According to Christian doctrine, this orientation permitted rising to face the return of Christ without having to turn around upon the call of Gabriel’s trumpet. Gabriel’s trumpet would be blown near the Eastern sunrise.|$|R

I believe my daughter expects--" [...] He appeared to notice something in the visitor's <b>raised</b> <b>face</b> (on his steps he stood higher) which led him to interrupt himself, and the interruption gave him a momentary sense of awkwardness, from which he sought a quick issue. [...] "Perhaps then you haven't heard she's to be married." ...|$|E

40|$|There is {{currently}} a need for large diameter flanges for the supply of water in South Africa. These large diameter pipe flanges are required to accommodate pipes with nominal bores of up to 4 m and should successfully withstand internal pressures of up to 8 MPa. No current relevant standard / code contains prescribed design values for flanges which either operate at such high pressures or have such large diameters. Due to this an alternative method of design, by means of non-linear finite element modelling, is proposed. Three types of integral flange designs are considered, namely: flat face, <b>raised</b> <b>face,</b> and a modified <b>raised</b> <b>face</b> with an O-ring groove. The effects of creep-relaxation, flange rotation, and the bolting sequence are considered. For each of these designs a finite element model was created and compared to a small scale experiment which included strain and contact pressure measurements. The proposed non-linear finite element models were capable of accurately predicting the strains in the flanges {{as well as the}} contact pressures between the faces of the flange and the surfaces of the packing material. Finally, a comparison between the ASME design method and the proposed non-linear finite element modelling design method was done for the large diameter flanges. It was found that the ASME design code did not have the ability to accurately predict the stresses in the flanges. It was also found that by using the maximum equivalent Von Mises stress as failure criteria for the flanges and fasteners, and contact pressure for the sealing ability, circular bolted flange connections which are lighter, safer, and leak tight could be designed by means of the proposed non-linear finite element models.

40|$|The {{assembly}} of flanges, seals, and pipes {{are used to}} carry cryogenic fluid from a storage tank to the vehicle at launch sites. However, after {{a certain amount of}} cycles these <b>raised</b> <b>face</b> flanges with glass-filled Teflon gaskets have been found to have torque relaxation and are as a result susceptible to cryogenic fluid leakage if not re-torqued. The intent of this project is to identify alternate combinations of flanges and seals which may improve thermal cycle performance and decrease re-torque requirements. The general approach is to design a test fixture to evaluate leak characteristics between spiral and concentric serrations and to test alternate flange and seal combinations. Due to insufficient time, {{it was not possible to}} evaluate these different types of combinations for the combination that improved thermal cycle performance the most. However, the necessary drawings for the test fixture were designed and assembled along with the collection of the necessary parts...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{resonance}} can quickly lead to failure in vibrating bolted flanged pipe joints. Condition monitoring is performed {{time to time}} in some industries for smooth operation of a system, whereas mostly trial-and-error tests are performed to control vibration. During all this process, the inherent design problems are not considered. A bolted flange joint in piping system is not a simple problem, being the combination of flange, gasket, bolts, and washers. The success of a bolted flanged pipe joint is defined by the “static mode of load” in the joint. However, it has been recognized that a “dynamic mode of load” governs in a gasketed bolted flanged pipe joint, which leads to its failure due to flange rotation, providing flange yielding, fatigue of bolts, and gasket crushing. This paper presents results of detailed 3 D finite element and mathematical modal analysis under bolt up to determine natural frequencies and mode shapes of gasketed flanged joints with and without <b>raised</b> <b>face</b> in comparison to the nongasketed flange joint...|$|E
