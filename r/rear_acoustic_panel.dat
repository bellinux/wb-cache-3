50|$|Another {{important}} aspect, when {{building a}} home studio is acoustic treatment. The way the room sounds or reverberates, can change dramatically the way music is mixed, written and recorded.

To {{be able to use}} scale model treatment as a full-scale design tool, it is necessary that the designer be able to reliably translate the scale model design and performance to an equivalent full-scale design. The primary objective of the study presented in this volume of the final report was to conduct laboratory tests to evaluate liner acoustic properties and validate advanced treatment impedance models. These laboratory tests include DC flow resistance measurements, normal incidence impedance measurements, DC flow and impedance measurements in the presence of grazing flow, and in-duct liner attenuation as well as modal measurements. Test panels were fabricated at three different scale factors (i. e., full-scale, half-scale, and one-fifth scale) to support laboratory <b>acoustic</b> testing.

40|$|Grooved <b>acoustic</b> <b>panels</b> are rigid plates {{consisting}} of an interconnected network of periodically arranged slits and circular holes. These devices are traditionally used as resonant absorbers in building acoustics. This paper presents {{a model to}} predict the acoustic properties of such absorbers. For this purpose, the classical Johnson-Champoux-Allard (JCA) model and the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) are used together to describe the acoustic wave propagation through these systems. The proposed model was validated against Finite Element (FE) simulations in terms of sound absorption coefficient under normal incidence, for different configurations with good agreement. Additionally, a parametric study was found very useful to investigate {{the influence of the}} geometrical characteristics of the panel on the absorption performance of the absorber and in understanding its acoustic behaviour. As expected, the performance of the absorber varies with the size of the pores and thickness of the panel. The limits of the proposed approach are also discussed. The model is proven to be a useful tool to estimate the acoustic properties of grooved <b>acoustic</b> <b>panel</b> absorbers in a simple manner.

40|$|The AiResearch Quiet Clean General Aviation Turbofan {{engine was}} tested on a {{vertical}} lift fan facility {{to measure the}} acoustic performance of two inflow control devices (ICD) of similar design, and three inlet lips of different external shape. Far-field directivity patterns calculated by existing analyses were compared with the measured fan fundamental blade passing frequency (BPF/F/) and broadband data. Installing an ICD on an engine with hardwall ducts reduced the BPF(F) tone everywhere in the far-field. When the ICD was installed on an engine with active <b>acoustic</b> <b>panels,</b> tone reduction in the forward quadrant was comparable {{to that in the}} hardwall tests; in the aft quadrant, however, tone noise was attenuated by the large <b>acoustic</b> <b>panels</b> in the bypass duct {{to such a degree that}} the ICD had little effect. Tests to compare performance of ICDs with hardwall inlet ducts showed only minor differences in the BPF(F) directivity patterns, while broadband noise was the same for both. Forward-quadrant BPF(F) and broadband directivity patterns were found to be similar for the inlet lips tested with a hardwall inlet duct. At high fan speeds, however, the shape of the analytical multimodal tone pattern from the exhaust nozzle was flatter than the measured patterns. The sources of lobes from several propagating single modes found in the forward-quadrant BPF(F) data were attributed to rotor/strut interaction and the rotor-alone pressure field...|$|R
