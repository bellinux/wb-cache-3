40|$|In {{order to}} provide service {{reliability}} with reasonable quality, {{it is essential for}} the network operator to manage the traffic flows in the core network. Managing traffic in the network is performed as routing function. In the traditional traffic management, network operator can tune routing parameters to simply manage the traffic. But traditional routing methods are not designed to handle the sudden fluctuations in the traffic. As a result, this may apparently lead to the traffic congestions {{in some parts of the}} core network, leaving other part underutilized. In this thesis we explore issues related to the routing robustness in the face of traffic demand variations. We investigate different routing methods for efficient routing using maximum link utilization (MLU) as a performance metric. The primary advantage of using link utilization is its ease to compute the network performance on real network data and synthetic data. Overloaded links might result in Quality of Service degradation (e. g. larger packet delay, packet losses etc.), so MLU might be a useful measure of network performance. For the experimentation, we have used unique data from the real operational network available in the public domain and the random data for large network topology instances. Furthermore, we propose a simple routing algorithm called <b>Robust</b> <b>Routing</b> Technique (RRT) to implement a <b>robust</b> <b>routing</b> mechanism. This mechanism allows network operator to satisfy the networking goals such as load balancing, routing robustness to the range of traffic demand matrices, link failures or to the traffic changes caused by uncertain traffic demands. Simulation experiments with real network topologies and random topologies demonstrate that our routing solution is simple (for routing) and flexible (for forwarding). K-Shortest path implementation in RRT can be extended for Multi Protocol Label Switching. Finally, we evaluate the performance of <b>robust</b> <b>routing</b> under dynamic traffic demands. We formulate the problem as a multi commodity flow problem using linear programming. We use congestion ratio to define the <b>robust</b> <b>routing</b> performance.

40|$|Designing routing schemes is {{a multidimensional}} and complex task {{that depends on}} the {{objective}} function, the computational model (centralized vs. distributed), and the amount of uncertainty (online vs. offline). Nevertheless, {{there are quite a few}} well-studied general techniques, for a large variety of network problems. In contrast, in our view, practical techniques for designing <b>robust</b> <b>routing</b> schemes are scarce; while fault-tolerance has been studied from a number of angles, existing approaches are concerned with dealing with faults after the fact by rerouting, self-healing, or similar techniques. We argue that this comes at a high burden for the designer, as in such a system any algorithm must account for the effects of faults on communication. With the goal of initiating efforts towards addressing this issue, we showcase simple and generic transformations that can be used as a blackbox to increase resilience against (independently distributed) faults. Given a network and a routing scheme, we determine a reinforced network and corresponding routing scheme that faithfully preserves the specification and behavior of the original scheme.
