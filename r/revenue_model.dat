25|$|Book {{publishers}} are {{companies that have}} two components to consider: profit-orientation and a cultural dimension. They usually publish titles which are produced by external authors. The sales of books in the receiver markets are {{the main part of}} the <b>revenue</b> <b>model</b> of a book publisher. Other revenues can be generated in the rights and licensing markets. Further sources for revenues are utilization rights generating revenue outside of the printing sector. For example, successful manuscripts are used for film, television, magazines and merchandising.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of {{standard}} operating systems for mobile devices such as iOS and Android and devices with greater hardware performance, mobile gaming has become a significant platform. While many mobile games share similar concepts with browser games, these games may utilize features of smart devices that are not necessary present on other platforms such as global positing information and camera devices to support augmented reality gameplay. Mobile games also led into the development of microtransactions as a valid <b>revenue</b> <b>model</b> for casual games.|$|E

Mr. Accessories can be equipped to give stat boosts or spent in the [...] "Mr. Store" [...] to buy powerful items (including special monthly items). [...] Mr. Accessories and Mr. Store items may be traded freely between players. [...] According to an interview with Zack Johnson from 2010, Johnson originally established the Mr. Accessory <b>revenue</b> <b>model</b> as [...] "kind of an afterthought", but it became lucrative enough to allow him to work on the game full-time and eventually to hire several permanent employees.|$|E

40|$|Undisputedly, {{the amount}} of data is growing {{exponentially}} and huge opportunities exist to exploit them. New service business models are being built around value propositions based on data and analytics. Suitable <b>revenue</b> <b>models</b> need {{to reap the benefits}} of these value propositions. However, {{the question of how to}} best turn a value proposition into revenue for data-driven services is not systematically addressed in literature. We provide an overview of possible <b>revenue</b> <b>models</b> for data-driven services. Based on a sample of 100 start-ups, we apply qualitative analysis to identify different <b>revenue</b> <b>models</b> for newly established data-driven services such as subscription, gain sharing and multi-sided <b>revenue</b> <b>models.</b> This paper will contribute to the fundamental understanding of how companies can capture value from data-driven services. It should give guidance on the design and selection of appropriate <b>revenue</b> <b>models</b> and, thus, inspire new forms of revenue generation from the use of data. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{release of}} QuickTime 3.0 for Mac OS on March 30, 1998 {{introduced}} the now-standard <b>revenue</b> <b>model</b> of releasing the software for free, but with additional {{features of the}} Apple-provided MoviePlayer application that end-users could only unlock by buying a QuickTime Pro license code. Since the [...] "Pro" [...] features {{were the same as}} the existing features in QuickTime 2.5, any previous user of QuickTime could continue to use an older version of the central MoviePlayer application for the remaining lifespan of Mac OS to 2002; indeed, since these additional features were limited to MoviePlayer, any other QuickTime-compatible application remained unaffected.|$|E
2500|$|AutoHop is an {{extension}} of the DVR's prime time recording capability. [...] When enabled, the feature records but hides commercials, giving viewers the option of viewing prime time programming on the four major networks commercial-free. Commercials cannot be skipped until 1 am Eastern Time, and the viewer must choose to do this. [...] Recorded programs are available for eight days after they have aired. News of AutoHop met with an immediate, polarized response. [...] The feature was deemed a [...] "dream come true" [...] for consumers, but for networks, a nightmare undercutting the <b>revenue</b> <b>model.</b> Dish asserted that AutoHop would encourage its customers to sample new programming. Leslie Moonves, CBS chief executive, asked rhetorically how he is to produce CSI without the revenue stream of commercials. News Corporation refused to accept Dish advertising for the device. A Forrester Research analyst said the move demonstrated Dish's desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the {{business}} model is not used uniformly in the literature. Compared to the {{concept of the}} value chain, it is not limited to a physical production process. It also includes service processes. According to Timmers, [...] "a business model is defined as the organization (or architecture) of product, service and information flows, and the sources of revenues and benefits for suppliers and customers." [...] According to Wirtz, [...] "a business model is a simplified and aggregated representation of the relevant activities of a company. It describes how marketable information, products and/or services are generated by means of a company's value-added component. In addition to the architecture of value creation, strategic as well as customer and market components are considered in order to realize the overriding objective of generating and preserving a competitive advantage." [...] The business model as an integrated management tool consists of further partial models: the <b>revenue</b> <b>model,</b> the consumer model, the procurement model, the production of goods and services model, the service offer model and the distribution model. Because a business model can strongly vary {{depending on the type of}} business, it can best be described using a sample. In the following the business model of a book publishing house is presented.|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} brings new possibilities, allowing software {{firms to}} sell their software products using the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. SaaS provides opportunities for flexible pricing but creates challenges on how to achieve a profitable revenue stream. In this multi-case study, the <b>revenue</b> <b>models</b> of five SaaS providers were examined. The main interest {{of the study was}} to investigate the different <b>revenue</b> <b>models</b> and the reasons for using particular <b>revenue</b> <b>models.</b> The <b>revenue</b> <b>models</b> were found to be mainly based on software renting, with a variety of pricing strategies. For SaaS providers, software renting generates a steady and predictable stream of revenue. The software renting model is also attractive to customers because (i) it facilitates prediction of the actual costs of the software, (ii) it decreases initial investments costs, and (iii) it makes it possible to purchase the software without special budgeting or the approval of top management. Interestingly, none of the firms used the commonly cited pay-per-use model...|$|R

50|$|Living Stories does pose {{a problem}} for the <b>revenue</b> <b>model</b> of newspapers.
