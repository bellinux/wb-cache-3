Justificatory liberalism takes seriously the moral requirement to justify all claims of authority over others, {{as well as all}} coercive interferences with their Uves. If we do so, although we are by no means committed to libertarianism, we find that that many of our cherished values, moral intuitions, and political aspirations no longer ground the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> over others many of us would claim.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundUntil recently, purchasers' options {{regarding}} {{whether to}} pay for the use of medical technologies have been binary in nature: a treatment is either covered or not. Policies, however, have emerged that expand the decision options, for example, linking coverage to evidence development, an option increasingly used for treatments with limited/uncertain evidence. There has been little effort to reconcile the features of technologies with the available decision options. MethodsWe described a framework within which different decision options can be evaluated. We distinguished two sources of value in terms of health: the value of the technology per se and the value of reducing decision uncertainty. The costs of reversing decisions were also considered. FindingsPurchasers should weigh the expected benefits of coverage against the possibility that the decision may need to be reversed and the chance that adoption will hinder evidence generation. Based on the purchaser's <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> over access, research, and price and on the characteristics of the technology with regard to reversibility and evidence, different decisions may be appropriate. The framework clarified the assessments needed to establish the appropriateness of different decisions. A taxonomy of coverage decisions was suggested. ConclusionsA range of decision options may facilitate paying for the use of promising medical technologies despite their uncertain evidence. It is important that the option be chosen on the basis of not only the expected value of a technology but also the value of further research, the anticipated effect of coverage on further research, and the costs associated with reversing the decision...|$|E
40|$|It is {{the aim of}} the {{following}} study {{to call attention to the}} question of the extent to which categories and discourses surrounding the classification and categorization of children with special needs, particularly the category ‘emotional and behavioural disorders’, reflect the significance, influence and presence of wider socio-political and socio-economic conditions. Although designations change with time, it seems that even existing classifications and designations have not been subjected to contextualization or reflection, expressing rather the remnants of past discourses (e. g. medical) and reflecting the inertia of institution and paradigms in safeguarding their <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> regardless of the social climate. This opens up the possibility that the children, juveniles and their parents, in particular those who belong to disadvantaged social groups, fail to receive comprehensive support, help or treatment, which would adequately respond to the problems they are faced with, instead of only partially. In addition, these underprivileged subjects are in danger of being objectivised, pathologized or perceived through the current lens of individual responsibility, rather than being treated in accordance with contemporary doctrines urging inclusion into the systems of education and social care, thereby gaining a voice and more power and opportunity to actively participate in discussions about their needs and finding consensual solutions to common challenges of today. In light of this, the study seeks to provide such a reflection and to encourage reflection in the professional community, the political arena and the general public, as well as to propose viable paradigms aimed at replacing the shortcomings and focus on individual responsibility with a focus on empowerment and concepts based on relations...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{government}} has introduced youth justice policy which claims {{to draw on the}} philosophy of restorative justice as an alternative to punitive sanctions. Referral orders were implemented nationally in 2002 and purportedly represent a significant policy commitment to restorative justice. Rather than incarcerating offenders or deterring them through punishment, referral orders aim to encourage them to understand the consequences of their behaviour, make amends and re-join the law abiding community. This is purportedly achieved through a youth offender panel (panel meeting) run by lay members of the local community along with a member of staff from the youth offending team (YOT). The panel meeting aims to provide a forum away from formal court proceedings to discuss the offence and to agree and construct a contract that the offender must follow. Referral orders therefore present a useful arena in which to explore young offenders’ experiences of restorative justice and to compare this with their experience of the more formal court process. Research has revealed that fair procedures are important in securing people’s compliance with the law and that offenders view restorative processes as fairer than court. However, the majority of research in this area has been done with adults and there is comparatively little research that focuses on young offenders’ perceptions of criminal justice processes. For children, procedural safeguards largely relate to the manner in which adults interact with them. My research therefore explores young people’s experiences with a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> figures including: teachers, police officers, magistrates, lay panel members and staff at the YOT. In doing this I aim to consider both how young people perceive the restorative elements of referral orders and more broadly, {{the way in which they}} form judgements of different criminal justice processes and sources of authority...|$|E
40|$|This paper navigates {{through the}} civil {{liability}} legal theory in studying its economic effects. It aims at giving an insight of the Islamic system of liability. To do so, {{it begins with}} a brief introduction of what a liability system is through a glance at the experience of the United States in this regard. The American system of liability gives the courts a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> to assess the injury, which includes material, emotional, and loss of future income opportunity, and compensation that aims at not only granting the injured a recuperating sum, but also at deterring the injurer from such a behavior. The most serious economic outcome of the A system are: the grandiose uncertainty and unpredictability, and the huge amount of grants that represents high cost, and sometimes prohibitive, of liability. This led to long and cumbersome litigation, consumer profiteering, forsake of innovative ideas, and shortage of certain products and services. The Islamic system of liability centers on the materiality of the injury, both in its causality and in its outcome, and it provides a list of compensations. Accordingly, recognizable emotional harm is only the one that can actually be materially checked, and recognizable loss of income covers only that actually forgone income during the off work period caused by the injury. As life and parts of the human body are sacred and priceless, the I system leaves it only to revelation to define the amount of compensation for loss of life and bodily parts. The main economic outcome of the I system is its predictability and conservative amounts of compensation. The system also assigns a role for the society both in payment of the grant and in benefiting from the compensation. Civil liability, Tort, Islamic tort and Islamic liability...|$|E
40|$|The {{changing}} roles {{borne by}} the economic technocrats of Malaysia from independence {{to the present day}} can be broadly divided into six periods based on the characteristics of the development policies of each administration (of the five administrations, only the administration of Mahathir Mohamad is divided into two periods). The most conspicuous changes may be said to have occurred during (1) period 2 - implementation of the New Economic Policy (NEP) beginning from 1971; (2) period 3 - earlier Mahathir administration (1981 - 1990); and (3) period 4 - latter Mahathir administration (1991 - 2003). During (1) the direct conduct of business by the government, beginning with the establishment of government enterprises, and the full-scale implementation of development projects were carried out as policies for achieving the two main goals of the NEP. These resulted in 1) a centralization of power in the Prime Minister's Department and 2) a great expansion in the roles of the technocrats. During (2) with the worsening of government finances and the poor performance of state enterprises under the Mahathir administration, launched in 1981, a series of government downsizing programs were introduced, as typified by privatization policies, and the government gradually narrowed its realm of activities while still seeking selective functions. When we review the changing roles of Malaysia's economic technocrats, we see that the technocrats did suffer a massive shift from an expansion of their power and <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> accompanying the introduction of the NEP to downsizing under the Mahathir administration. Regardless, it can be said regarding the entire period since the introduction of the NEP that: (a) the raison d'�tre of the economic technocrats was the drafting of the required development projects and overall development plans to achieve the NEP, and (b) the economic technocrats served throughout as "contributors and implementers" of development policy because of the existence of the large-scale development policy of the NEP, and because of the powerful leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir since the 1980 s. ...|$|E
