40|$|Summary Response of Antarctic ice {{sheets to}} {{projected}} greenhouse warming {{of up to}} 5. 8 °C {{by the end of}} the century is unknown. Models on which predictions are based need to be constrained by geological proxy data from the ancient ice sheets during times when Earth is known to have been warmer than today. The marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and its fringing ice shelves are hypothesized (Clark et al., 2002; Weaver et al., 2003; Stocker, 2003) and documented (Scherer et al., 1998) to have collapsed during past “super-interglacial” warm extremes when global sea-level was more than 5 m higher than today. Recent collapse of small ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula (Doake and Vaughn, 1991; Skvarca, 1993; Rott et al., 1996; Vaughn and Doake, 1996; Doake et al., 1998; Rott et al., 1998; Skvarca et al., 1999; Rott et al., 2002) highlights the vulnerability of these glacial components to global warming. The Ross Ice Shelf appears to represent one of the most vulnerable elements of the WAIS system. Future demise, on timescales of decades to centuries, may well provide an important precursor to eventual WAIS collapse. The key aim of this research project is to determine past ice shelf responses to climate forcing, including variability at a range of timescales. To achieve this aim the ANtarctic Geological DRILLing Program (ANDRILL) will drill a stratigraphic core from a platform located on the northwest corner of the Ross Ice Shelf - the McMurdo Ice Shelf (MIS) sector, east of Hut Point Peninsula, Ross Island. Drilling will be undertaken in the austral summer of 2006 - 2007 from the 24 th of October to the 27 th of December. The primary target for the MIS site is a 1200 m-thick body of Plio-Pleistocene glacimarine, terrigenous, volcanic, and biogenic sediment that has accumulated in the Windless Bight region of a flexural moat basin surrounding Ross Island (Horgan et al., 2005). A single 1200 m-deep drill core will be recovered from the bathymetric and depocentral axis of the moat in approximately 900 m of water. Drilling technology will utilize a sea-riser system in a similar fashion to the Cape Roberts Project (CRP), but will employ a combination of hydraulic piston coring (in upper soft sediments) and continuous wireline diamond-bit coring. Innovative new technology, in the form of a hotwater drill and over-reamer, will be used to make an access hole through 200 m of the ice shelf and to keep the riser free during drilling operations. The purpose of this SLIP is to provide a scientific overview of the project, its goals and objectives, as well as outlining management systems and scientific procedures to be implemented during both On-Ice (drilling) and post-drilling phases. It also includes information on scientific practice by participating scientists and discipline teams, and plans and policy for publications, education and public outreach activities. The plan provides a “roadmap” for research participants on the MIS Project to ensure the scientific objectives are met and delivered. Other key documents for the MIS project are: ANDRILL Conribution 1 (Harwood et al., 2002), a report on the ANDRILL international planning workshop held at Oxford University in April 2001.

Among new materials described herein are remains of nanhsiungchelyids (Hanbogdemys sp. 1 and 2 and Nanhsiungchelyidae indet. 1 – 10) from 12 Early and Late Cretaceous localities of Mongolia and Uzbekistan. Nanhsiungchelyidae from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian–Albian) of Mongolia are reported for the first time. Reassessment of the published data on Asian nanhsiungchelyids allows us to change taxonomic status of many previous findings from Basilemys sp. or Zangerlia sp. to Nanhsiungchelyidae indet.
