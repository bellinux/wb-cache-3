40|$|Accurate drag {{estimation}} {{is critical}} in making computational design studies. Drag may be estimated thousands of times during a multidisciplinary design optimization, and computational fluid dynamics is not yet possible in these studies. The current model has been developed {{as part of an}} air-vehicle conceptual-design multidisciplinary design optimization framework. Its use for subsonic and transonic aircraft configurations is presented and validated. We present our parametric geometry definition, followed by the drag model description. The drag model includes induced, friction, wave, and interference drag. The model is compared with subsonic and transonic isolated wings, and a wing/body configuration used previously in drag prediction workshops. The agreement between the predictions of the drag model and test data is good, but lessens at high lift coefficients and high transonic Mach numbers. In some cases the accuracy of this drag estimation method exceeds much more elaborate analyses.

40|$|Pure bending of {{nanowires}} Aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>a</b> <b>b</b> s t r a c t In {{the absence}} of external loading, surface tension will induce a residual stress field in the bulk of nano structures. However, in the prediction of mechanical properties of nano struc-tures, the elastic response of the bulk is usually described by classical Hooke’s law, in which the aforementioned residual stress was neglected in the existing literatures. The present paper investigates the influences of surface tension and the residual stress in the bulk induced by the surface tension on the elastic properties of nano structures. We firstly present the surface elasticity in the Lagrangian and the Eulerian descriptions and point out {{that even in the}} case of infinitesimal deformations the reference and the current configu-rations should be discriminated; otherwise the out-plane terms of surface displacement gradient, associated with the surface tension, may sometimes be overlooked in the Eulerian descriptions, particularly for curved and rotated surfaces. Then, the residual stress in the bulk is studied through the non-classical boundary conditions and used to construct the linear elastic constitutive relations for the bulk material. Finally, these relations are adopted to analyze the size-dependent properties of pure bending of Al nanowires. The present results show that surface tension will considerably affect the effective Young’s modulus of Al nanowires, which decrease with either the decrease of nanowires thickness or the increase of the aspect ratio. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effects of different numbers of rings and boundary conditions on the vibratory response of the plates. The first order shear deformation theory proposed by Mindlin is employed in the theoretical formulation. Through the process the resulting energy functional is minimized using the Rayleigh-Ritz method with sets of admissible mathematically complete two-dimensional polynomials in the displacement (transverse deflection) and rotation functions. This leads to a governing eigenvalue equation which can be solved to determine the vibration frequencies. Rectangular plates resting on multiple eccentric ring supports with different combinations of boundary conditions have been solved to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the method. In this paper, sets of reasonably accurate vibration frequencies are presented for various plate aspect <b>ratios</b> <b>a</b> <b>b</b> and relative thickness ratios t b.

Furthermore, while the V� 10 C promoter was efficient in B cells, it was shown to work inefficiently in pre-B cell lines.

The PSR chromosome is transmitted via sperm but causes destruction of the paternal chromosomes (except itself) shortly after egg fertilization. Owing to haplodiploidy, this results in the conversion of diploid (female) eggs into haploid (male) eggs. Paternal Sex <b>Ratio</b> is <b>an</b> extreme example of a selfish genetic element. Theoretical analysis shows that subdivided population structures reduce PSR frequency. Paternal Sex Ratio cannot exist in subdivided populations (with temporary mating demes lasting one generation) when foundress number is less than three. The equilibrium frequency of PSR depends strongly on fertilization proportion (x). In populations producing the Hamiltonian evolutionarily stable strategy (x = [(N - 1) (2 N - 1) /N(4 N - 1) ]), PSR never achieves frequencies over 3 % for any deme size. In contrast, if the population produces a high fertilization proportion (i. e., greater than 90 %, as produced by MSR), then PSR can achieve frequencies over 90 % when deme size is three or larger. Results also show that PSR selects against the MSR cytoplasmic element in populations with small deme size, which results in polymorphic equilibria for both elements. ...|$|R
