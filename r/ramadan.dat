5|$|In some Muslim countries, DST is {{temporarily}} abandoned during <b>Ramadan</b> (the {{month when}} no food should be eaten between sunrise and sunset), since the DST would delay the evening dinner. <b>Ramadan</b> {{took place in}} July and August in 2012. This concerns at least Morocco, although Iran keeps DST during <b>Ramadan.</b> Most Muslim countries do not use DST, partially for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Ali {{ordered that}} if he died from the wound, Ibn Muljam had to be {{executed}} in retaliation. Otherwise, if he survived, he would decide on how to treat him. Ali died two days later on 21 <b>Ramadan</b> 40/30 January 661 (or 19 <b>Ramadan</b> 40/28 January 661) {{at the age of}} 62 or 63, and Ibn Muljam was killed in retaliation (Qisas) by Hasan ibn Ali, in accordance to Ali's instruction.|$|E
5|$|Eid al-Fitr is {{the most}} {{important}} festival of Muslims in Bengal. Muslims celebrate the end of <b>Ramadan</b> with prayers, alms-giving, shopping, gift-giving, and feasting.|$|E
5|$|The desserts of Marrakesh include chebakia (sesame spice cookies usually {{prepared}} and served during <b>Ramadan),</b> tartlets of filo dough with dried fruit, or cheesecake with dates.|$|E
5|$|Five Egyptian men, Ahmed Saad, Mohamed Abdelbaki, Ibrahim <b>Ramadan,</b> Ragab Abdelhay, and Tarek Yehia, {{qualified}} for the Olympic weightlifting tournament by ranking seventh overall after the 2010 and 2011 World Weightlifting Championships, and three women, Esmat Mansour, Abeer Abdelrahman, and Nahla <b>Ramadan,</b> by ranking fourteenth. For the women, <b>Ramadan,</b> a gold medalist at the 2003 World Weightlifting Championships and the 2011 Pan Arab Games, bronze medalist at the 2002 World Championships, and veteran of the 75 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics, finished fourth in the +75 kg class. Abdelrahman, another gold medalist from the 2011 Pan Arab Games and veteran of the 69 kg class at the 2008 Summer Olympics, was fifth in the 75 kg division, although she received a silver medal retroactively after the event’s three medalists were dis{{qualified for}} doping. Mansour, contesting the 69 kg class, was seventh in her event.|$|E
5|$|Gawhar {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of a congregational mosque for the new city and work commenced on April 4, 970. The mosque was completed in 972 and the first Friday prayers were held there on June 22, 972 during <b>Ramadan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Homemade {{fruit juices}} {{are also a}} common {{household}} drink during warm days and during <b>Ramadan,</b> the holy month for fasting by Muslims. In the Palestinian culture, coffee and tea is traditionally served to adults during a visit or gathering, while juice is served to everyone. Drinks such as tamar hind or qamar deen are served during special occasions to everyone. Tamar hind, originally from Africa is a liquorice drink made by soaking or infusing liquorice sticks, and adding lemon juice. Qamar deen is traditionally served to break the <b>Ramadan</b> fast (as is water), and is an iced drink made from a dry sheet of apricots soaked in water, and mixed with lemon juice or syrup.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabadi haleem is {{regarded}} as an international delicacy. In Hyderabad, the dish is often consumed at celebratory events such as weddings. It is consumed especially during Iftaar, the evening meal following the day-long fast, observed by Muslims {{during the month of}} <b>Ramadan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ka'ak bi 'awja is a {{semolina}} shortbread pastry {{filled with}} ground dates called ajwa or walnuts. The dessert {{is a traditional}} meal for Christians during Easter, however, ka'ak bi awja is also prepared {{towards the end of}} <b>Ramadan,</b> to be eaten during Eid al-Fitr—a Muslim festival immediately following <b>Ramadan,</b> as well as during Eid al-Adha. During Mawlid—the holiday honoring the birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad—Zalabieh which consists of small, crunchy deep fried dough balls in dipped in syrup, is served. The dough is made from flour, yeast and water.|$|E
5|$|Loham was {{initially}} {{scheduled to be}} released in July 2015 during <b>Ramadan,</b> but it had to be postponed until 20 August because of delays in post-production. The film was then scheduled to open in India on 20 August 2015 as a festival release during the Onam season.|$|E
5|$|The {{preparation}} of haleem {{has been compared}} to that of Hyderabadi biryani. Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, it is particularly consumed in the Islamic month of <b>Ramadan</b> during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it provides instant energy and is high in calories. This has made the dish synonymous with <b>Ramadan.</b> In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010, it was granted Geographical Indication status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office, making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India to get this status.|$|E
5|$|Asad was {{dismissed}} {{from his office}} in <b>Ramadan</b> 109 AH (December 727 or January 728 AD), when in an outburst of anger he had the chief representatives of the four greatest Arab tribes in Khurasan, the Ahl al-'Aliyah, Azd, Tamim, and Bakr, publicly flogged. Caliph Hisham demanded his dismissal, and after naming al-Hakam ibn 'Awana al-Kalbi as his deputy, Asad returned to his brother in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{music is}} {{prohibited}} from being played inside mosques and during Islamic rites/observances/holidays, {{such as the}} fasting month of <b>Ramadan,</b> where playing is only allowed at night when people are allowed to eat after Iftar. It is also prohibited during the mourning period {{of the death of}} important person, during funerals, and during the peak times of the planting and harvest season.|$|E
5|$|Spending 11 {{years in}} Iraq, al-Jamri {{returned}} to Bahrain in 1973. Between 1973 and 1981, al-Jamri {{was a frequent}} host on Bahrain TV, giving religious talks on Islamic occasions such as <b>Ramadan</b> and Ashura. In 1985, he founded a small hawza in the mosque next to his house.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1925, {{relations}} grew tense between al-Kharrat {{and other}} rebel leaders, particularly Sa'id al-'As and <b>Ramadan</b> al-Shallash, as they traded accusations of plundering villages or extorting local inhabitants. Al-Kharrat continued to lead operations in the Ghouta, where he was ultimately killed in a French ambush. The revolt dissipated by 1927, but he gained a lasting reputation as a martyr of the Syrian resistance to French rule.|$|E
5|$|A small hill {{known as}} Bukit Puteri {{can be found}} nearby to Pasar Payang. The hill is about 200 metres high, located near the banks of Terengganu River. Because of its {{strategic}} location, it {{was used as a}} fortification by the sultans of the state. Old artefacts, a graveyard, and monuments can be found on top of the hill. During the Islamic holy month of <b>Ramadan,</b> a century-old brass bell known as genta will be rung to signify that it is time for iftar, or the end of the fasting on that day.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} November, {{the rebels}} gained control of the towns of Harim and Jisr al-Shughur and the villages of their districts. They then {{prepared}} for offensives to capture the towns and districts of Idlib and Maarrat al-Nu'man. Other major scenes of fighting occurred at Isqat, Jisr al-Hadid, Kafr Takharim, Darkush, Talkalakh and the areas of al-Qusayr and Antioch. At around the same time, Kurdish tribal forces countered the French at Viranşehir, east of Aleppo, and Bedouin forces commanded by ex-Ottoman officer <b>Ramadan</b> al-Shallash, who declared his support for Hananu, began guerrilla actions against French forces in the general vicinity of Raqqa.|$|E
5|$|Few {{months after}} his birth, al-Jamri family {{traveled}} to Najaf, Iraq where his father continued his religious studies. At the time, al-Jamri's family was composed of his parents and his 2-year-old brother Mohammed Jameel. He studied for five years at the Talibiya primary school which was also attended by some Bahrainis such as Sami, the elder son of Isa Qassim. Having no TV at home, al-Jamri and his siblings {{spent most of their}} time listening to stories told by their mother or playing with kites outside. At the age of 9, he began practicing Islamic prayers and fasting in <b>Ramadan.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{during the}} fasting month of <b>Ramadan,</b> the Musaher {{of a town}} would yell and beat his drum to wake up the town's {{residents}} for suhoor (lit. 'of dawn')—usually {{very early in the}} morning, ranging from 4-6 am. The meals eaten during this time are light and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers signaled the beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{law is the}} law {{governing}} a person's family matters. In Shafeeg bin Salim Talib v. Fatimah binte Abud bin Talib (2009), the High Court {{identified a}} number of personal laws, including the Intestate Succession Act which does not apply to Muslims; and regulations 103(2) and (3) of the Prisons Regulations, which respectively state that Jewish prisoners can claim an exemption against working on Saturdays and may observe certain festival days as may be allowed by the Government, and that Muslim prisoners may fast during <b>Ramadan</b> and have their work reduced during this period.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{also home}} to many desserts, ranging from those made {{regularly}} and those that are commonly reserved for the holidays. Most Palestinian sweets are pastries filled with either sweetened cheeses, dates or various nuts such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios. Beverages could also depend on holidays such as during <b>Ramadan,</b> where carob, tamarind and apricot juices are consumed at sunset. Coffee is consumed throughout the day and liquor is not very prevalent among the population, however, some alcoholic beverages such as arak or beer are consumed by Christians and less conservative Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The first {{commemorative}} {{postage stamps}} of the country, released in July 1948, also gave 15 August 1947 as the independence day, however {{in subsequent years}} 14 August was adopted as the independence day. This is because Mountbatten administered the independence oath to Jinnah on the 14th, before leaving for India where the oath was scheduled on the midnight of the 15th. The night of 14–15 August 1947 coincided with 27 <b>Ramadan</b> 1366 of the Islamic calendar, which Muslims regard as a sacred night.|$|E
5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} <b>Ramadan</b> is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households. Qatayef is the general name of the dessert as a whole, but more specifically, the name of the batter that acts as a base. The result of the batter being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except only one side is cooked, then folded. The pastry is filled with either unsalted goat cheese or ground walnuts and cinnamon. It is then baked and served with a hot sugar-water syrup or sometimes honey.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakr {{was born}} around 1321 to his sultan father an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310–1341) and his {{concubine}} mother, Narjis. Narjis also {{gave birth to}} Abu Bakr's younger full brothers <b>Ramadan</b> (died 1343) and Yusuf (died 1346). Information about Abu Bakr's early childhood is unavailable in the Mamluk sources. The first mention of Abu Bakr came in 1332. At that time, Abu Bakr {{had been sent to}} the desert fortress of al-Karak to join his half-brothers Ahmad and Ibrahim in their military training. Also during that year, Abu Bakr left al-Karak to accompany his father and half-brothers Anuk and Ahmad at al-Aqaba and from there to Mecca to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. However, an-Nasir Muhammad had them return to al-Karak before the trek to Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Abu Hurairah {{said that}} the Prophet said: There will be an Ayah (sign) in (the month of) <b>Ramadan.</b> Then, there will 'isabah (splitting into groups) in Shawwal. Then, there will be {{fighting}} in (the month of) Dhu al-Qi'dah. Then, the pilgrim will be robbed in (the month of) Dhu al-Hijjah. Then, the prohibitions will be violated in (the month of) al-Muharram. Then, there will be sound in (the month of) Safar, then the tribes will conflict {{with each other in}} the two months of Rabi' al-awwal & Rabi' al-thani. Then, the most amazing thing will happen between (the months of) Jumada and Rajab. Then, a well-fed she-camel will be better than a fortress (castle) sheltering a thousand (people).|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar {{soon became}} a center of {{learning}} in the Islamic world, and official pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there. Under Fatimid rule, the previously secretive teachings of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab (school of law) were {{made available to the}} general public. Al-Nu‘man ibn Muhammad was appointed qadi (judge) under al-Mu’izz and placed in charge of the teaching of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab. Classes were taught at the palace of the Caliph, as well as at al-Azhar, with separate sessions available to women. During Eid ul-Fitr in 973, the mosque was rededicated by the caliph as the official congregational mosque in Cairo. Al-Mu’izz, and his son—when he in turn became caliph—would preach at least one Friday khutbah (sermon) during <b>Ramadan</b> at al-Azhar.|$|E
5|$|Islam El Shehaby {{had participated}} in the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics and had {{international}} judo titles in the +100kg division {{as far back as the}} 1999 Pan Arab Games. He was most recentely African Champion in the +100kg and open classes at the 2011 African Championships, and was runner-up in the former category at the 2012 edition. Coming into the 2012 Olympics he was ranked fourth in the world, but lost in the opening round against Ihar Makarau of Belarus. The final judoka, <b>Ramadan</b> Darwish, had won every African championship in the 100kg class since 2009, was the 2009 Mediterranean champion and 2011 All-Africa Games runner-up, and had earned a bronze medal at the 2009 World Judo Championships. He qualified for the 100 kg event at the Olympic Games by being ranked ninth worldwide, but was defeated in his first match by France's Thierry Fabre.|$|E
5|$|Locusts are {{eaten in}} the Arabian Peninsula, {{including}} Saudi Arabia, where consumption of locusts spiked around <b>Ramadan</b> {{especially in the}} Al-Qassim Region in 2014, since many Saudis believe they are healthy to eat; however, the Saudi Ministry of Health warned that pesticides they used against the locusts made them unsafe; and Kuwait. Yemenis also consume locusts, and expressed discontent over governmental plans to use pesticides to control them. ʻAbd al-Salâm Shabînî described a locust recipe from Morocco. 19th century European travellers observed Arabs in Arabia, Egypt, and Morocco selling, cooking, and eating locusts. They reported that in Egypt and Palestine locusts were consumed. They reported that in Palestine, around the River Jordan, in Egypt, in Arabia, and in Morocco that Arabs ate locusts, while Syrian peasants did not eat locusts.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League {{officials}} in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland {{about a possible}} threat involving the simultaneous use of dirty bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month of <b>Ramadan.</b> Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} souks is Souk Semmarine, which sells {{everything}} from brightly coloured bejewelled sandals and slippers and leather pouffes to jewellery and kaftans. Souk Ableuh contains stalls which specialize in lemons, chilis, capers, pickles, green, red, and black olives, and mint, a common ingredient of Moroccan cuisine and tea. Similarly, Souk Kchacha specializes in dried fruit and nuts, including dates, figs, walnuts, cashews and apricots. Rahba Qedima contains stalls selling hand-woven baskets, natural perfumes, knitted hats, scarves, tee shirts, <b>Ramadan</b> tea, ginseng, and alligator and iguana skins. Criee Berbiere, to the northeast of this market, is noted for its dark Berber carpets and rugs. Souk Siyyaghin {{is known for its}} jewellery, and Souk Smata nearby is noted for its extensive collection of babouches and belts. Souk Cherratine specializes in leatherware, and Souk Belaarif sells modern consumer goods. Souk Haddadine specializes in ironware and lanterns.|$|E
5|$|Rising {{property}} prices in Surrey in the 1940s and 1950s made the LNC increasingly valuable, but {{also made it}} a target for property speculators. In 1959 a hostile takeover succeeded, and LNC's independence came to an end. From 1959 to 1985 a succession of owners stripped the profitable parts of the business from the company, leaving a rump residual company operating the increasingly derelict cemetery. In 1985 {{what remained of the}} company came into the ownership of <b>Ramadan</b> Güney, who set about reviving what remained. Links were formed with London's Muslim communities in an effort to encourage new burials, and a slow programme of clearing and restoring the derelict sections of the cemetery commenced. Although it was never as successful as planned, the LNC was very influential on both the funeral industry and the development of the area around Woking, and Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The Brookwood Cemetery Act 1975 {{authorised}} the cemetery's owners (at {{that time}} Maximilian Investments) to sell surplus land within the cemetery's boundaries, {{leading to the}} construction of a major office development {{on the site of the}} former Superintendent's office, near the former level crossing between the northern and southern cemeteries. The masonry works remained operational until the early 1980s, and were then converted into office buildings and named Stonemason's Court. In March 1985 the cemetery was bought by <b>Ramadan</b> Güney, whose family still owns the cemetery as of 2011. The Guney family embarked on a programme of encouraging new burials in the cemetery, and of slowly clearing the overgrown sections of the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{sought to}} maintain an impression of normality. Just before <b>Ramadan</b> was to begin on 26 September, the Ministry of War publicly announced that military personnel could register to take leave to perform a Umrah (pilgrimage) in Mecca. Egyptian newspapers announced that sailboat races would be held, participants of which included several high-ranking officers of the Egyptian Navy. In addition, a visit planned for October 8 (two days after the scheduled attack) by the Romanian Minister of Defense to Egypt was also publicized by the Ministry of War, and a program for his visit was announced. This coincidental visit would be promptly canceled once war broke out on 6 October, but it proved useful {{as part of the}} deception plan.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} Jordanian dish is mansaf, the national dish of Jordan. The dish {{is a symbol}} for Jordanian hospitality and {{is influenced by the}} Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a plate of rice with meat that was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with nuts and sometimes herbs. As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used. Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef, a dish made specially for <b>Ramadan.</b> In Jordanian cuisine, drinking coffee and tea flavoured with na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.|$|E
5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in <b>Ramadan</b> where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or trays) of a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner table are bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food to provide for their neighbors and the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|E
5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of <b>Ramadan</b> in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in <b>Ramadan</b> that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E
