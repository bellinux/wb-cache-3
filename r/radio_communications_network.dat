30|$|However, {{despite these}} works, the major issue of {{practical}} use consisting in detecting a known signal with unknown parameters {{in the presence}} of an arbitrary unknown SO noncircular total noise has been scarcely investigated up to now. To the best of our knowledge, it has only been analyzed recently in [20] and [21] for synchronization and time acquisition purposes in <b>radio</b> <b>communications</b> <b>networks,</b> assuming a BPSK, MSK or GMSK useful signal and both unknown total noise and unknown useful propagation channel. For this reason, to fill the gap previously mentioned and following a GLRT approach, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to introduce and to analyze the performance of different array receivers, associated with different sets of unknown signal parameters, for the detection of a known signal corrupted by an unknown SO noncircular total noise. To simplify the analysis, only rectilinear known useful signals are considered, i.e. useful signals whose complex envelope is real such as AM, PPM, ASK or BPSK signals, also called one dimensional signals. This assumption is not so restrictive since rectilinear signals, and BPSK signals in particular, are currently used in a large number of practical applications such as DS-CDMA <b>radio</b> <b>communications</b> <b>networks,</b> GNSS system [22], some IFF systems or some specific radar systems which use binary coding signal [23]. For such known waveforms, the new detectors introduced in this paper implement optimal widely linear (WL) [24] filters contrary to the detectors proposed in [1, 3, 4, 6 – 9] and [25] which are deduced from optimal linear filters.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Link- 11 is a {{tactical}} digital communication network standard deployed in military platforms now for several decades. The standard employs the digital modulation technique Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (DQPSK) to encode formatted binary messages (M-series messages) onto an audio channel, {{which are then}} modulated and transmitted over a <b>radio</b> <b>communications</b> <b>network.</b> Testing of the various systems that use this communications network requires either a fully operational RF network or exchange of the audio-encoded data over a voice channel. An alternative is to send and receive over an IP network, by encoding and decoding the audio from a Data Terminal Set (DTS) {{that is part of}} the normal operational equipment. This allows the test community to interconnect distant test sites over IP networks using this robust connectivity for message exchanges. This facilitates interoperability testing at the data and applications level where RF and audio connectivity is not available or is unreliable. We explore this approach to interoperability testing of Link- 11 by implementing a gateway between the Link- 11 network and a TCP/IP network. Such a gateway has been built and tested at the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) by a team of contractors and government. A review of the engineering and implementation is provided, along with a proposed future expansion of the prototype within a given experimental frame in the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) framework...|$|E

Includes supplementary material provided from {{the contents of}} a CD-Rom issued containing the work of all three Working Group members and all supplementary material, in compressed format. The military is heavily reliant on the transfer of information among various networks in day-to-day operations. Radio-based communications networks that support this volume of information are complex, difficult to manage, and change frequently. Communications network planners need a way to clearly visualize and communicate mobile operational network capabilities, particularly to network users. By using the DJS-Java-VRML simulation and modeling toolkit, visualizations of radio-frequency energy and radio path- profiling data can be quickly generated as 3 D models. These animated 3 D visualizations can be loaded into a networked virtual environment, so that communications planners can detect a variety of problems such as radio frequency interference and gaps in coverage. Planners can also brief senior staff, plan within their own staff, and collaborate with communications staff planners in distant locations using such virtual environments. DIS-Java-VRML visualization tools can provide a clear picture of the battle space with respect to the deployed communications architecture. The prototypes presented in this thesis demonstrate the ability to generate a shared visualization that can show a <b>radio</b> <b>communications</b> <b>network</b> in 3 D. Such dynamic visualizations increase communications planning information bandwidth and yield more intuitive ways of presenting information to users. Higher information density in a more intuitive format enables better understanding with quicker reaction times.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. In military operations, <b>radio</b> frequency <b>communications</b> {{play an important}} role in command and control. Since the breadth of control may be limited by frequency and channel constraints, research continues to search for better ways to optimize the frequency allocation. In this thesis, graphs are used to model <b>radio</b> <b>communications</b> <b>networks.</b> The problem considered is the detection of maximal cliques, representing subnets, from the graph model. However, detection of cliques is an NP-complete problem. Since NP-complete problems are not likely to be solvable in a reasonable time if the input is large, this paper limits the network input to six stations and fifteen transmissions. An algorithm is implemented in Pascal to detect all maximal cliques of a network and is known as the program CLIQUE. The program is designed to accept arbitrary connected graphs without being affected by isomorphisms and without generating duplicates. This thesis describes a limited solution to the clique problem and solves a subproblem of the communications frequency problem in real time. Captain, U. S. ArmyU. S. Army (USA) autho...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWidely Linear (WL) Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) {{estimation}} {{have received}} a great interest these last twenty years for second order (SO) noncircular signals. In the context of <b>radio</b> <b>communications</b> <b>networks,</b> {{it has been shown}} in particular that WL MMSE receivers allow to implement Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC) of one rectilinear interference, such as Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) or Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) interference, or of quasi-rectilinear interference, such as Minimum Shift keying (MSK), Gaussian MSK (GMSK) or Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OQAM) interference, hence their great interest for Global System for Mobile <b>Communications</b> (GSM) cellular <b>networks</b> in particular. However, one may wonder whether WL MMSE receivers remain attractive for SO noncircular nonrectilinear interferences, not so scarce in practice. The {{purpose of this paper is}} mainly to answer to this important question by giving, in a self-contained and unified way, some new insights into the behaviour, properties and performance of the WL MMSE beamformer in the presence of arbitrary noncircular signals and interference which are not necessarily rectilinear. It is shown in particular that, surprisingly, WL MMSE receivers lose their practical interest for strong interferences which are not rectilinear. This breakthrough thus generates a new open problem for the choice between linear and WL MMSE receiver corresponding to the detection of rectilinearity (and/or quasi-rectilinearity), instead of noncircularity, in a given noisy observation.

30|$|Among the {{detectors}} currently available, a spatio-temporal adaptive detector {{which uses}} the sample covariance matrix estimate from secondary (signal free) data vectors is proposed in [1] and [2] by Brennan, Reed and Mallett. This detector is modified in [3] by Robey et al to derive a constant false-alarm rate test called the adaptive matched filter (AMF) detector, {{well suited for}} radar applications. In [4] the previous problem is reconsidered by Kelly as a binary hypothesis test: total noise only versus signal plus total noise. The Kelly's detector uses the maximum likelihood (ML) approach to estimate the unknown parameters of the likelihood ratio test, namely the total noise covariance matrix and the complex amplitude of the useful signal. This detection scheme is {{commonly referred to as}} the GLRT [5]. Extensions of the Kelly's GLRT approach assuming that no signal free data vectors are available are presented in [6] and [7] for radar and GPS applications respectively. In [8], Brennan and Reed propose a minimum mean square error detector for time acquisition purposes in the context of multiusers DS-CDMA <b>radio</b> <b>communications</b> <b>networks.</b> This problem is then reconsidered in [9] by Duglos and Scholtz from a GLRT approach under a Gaussian noise assumption and assuming the total noise covariance matrix and the useful propagation channel are two unknown parameters.
