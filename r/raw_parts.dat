5000|$|Each guitar {{came with}} a serial number {{certificate}} signed by Maher and LaVere, and another signed by the woodcrafter, painter, assembler, quality controller and manager. Samick, a Korean instrument manufacturer, bought half of Valley Arts in 1992. Assembly and finishing of these guitars was done in Southern California, but manufacture of the <b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> (body, neck, fingerboards, bridges) may {{have been done in}} Korea. The Samick label says [...] "Made in U.S.A.", a claim which can only be made if at least 50% of the manufacture work was actually done in the U.S.A. A properly constructed acoustic guitar has the bridge glued to the top before the glossy finish is applied, so there is a strong wood to wood bond. Workers at Samick finished the tops and then glued on the bridges resulting in a weak bond. These new instruments were shipped to distributors where bridges started to pull up or pop off. Orders were canceled, and the project died. The few guitars that were produced can be repaired by removing the bridge, scraping away the finish where the bridge is located, then re-gluing the bridge in a correct wood to wood bond.|$|E
40|$|A {{production}} node {{within a}} network of interconnected production centers (as in supply chains) is considered in this paper, {{with the aim of}} optimizing inventory levels and production effort. The proposed Hybrid Inventory-Production model consists of two inventories (the input one for <b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> and the output one for processed parts) and a production resource which transforms parts and moves them from the input to the output inventory, at a certain rate. The production node interacts with other nodes in the network by the arrival process (<b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> entering the node) and the departure process (processed parts leaving the node). In HIP systems, arrival and departure processes, as well as the production process, are supposed to be piece-wise constant functions that change their values at asynchronous time instants. Based on this model and considering different cost terms, a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem has been defined. Then, some assumptions have been considered and the optimization problem has been simplified until obtaining a linear statement...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new adaptive kanban-type pull control mechanism which determines when to release or reorder <b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> based on customer demands, inventory and backorders. This system {{differs from the}} traditional kanban system in {{that the number of}} kanban cards is allowed to change with respect to the inventory and backorder levels. However, the number of cards in the system remains limited, thereby restricting the amount of work-in-process in the system. In this paper, we show how to evaluate the performance of this system for the case where the demands arrive according to a Poisson process and processing times are exponential random variables. We show that our adaptive system under such conditions can outperform the traditional kanban pull control mechanism while remaining easy to implement. In addition, we present simulation results and show the benefits of this system under variable demand means...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an inventory-production {{system in which}} <b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> are {{transformed}} into processed parts, {{in order to satisfy}} a time-varying positive demand over a given time horizon. The production resource is capacitated whereas the inventory is unbounded; the external demand is known and is expressed as a piecewise constant function changing at asynchronous time instants. The objective is to find the optimal service speed pattern, assumed to be a piecewise constant function, which minimizes setup, production, and holding costs; hence, the decisions concern both the values of the service speed and the (asynchronous) time instants at which it changes. The optimization problem defined for this class of systems has a parametric structure and includes both nonlinear and combinatorial aspects. In the paper, some structural properties of any optimal solution are firstly proven, and then a solution procedure that allows finding an optimal solution in polynomial times is provided...|$|E
40|$|Precision glass molding is a {{compression}} molding technology {{which has become}} a widely used manufacturing process for complex shaped plies. In comparison to conventional machining technologies such as grinding and polishing the glass parts are formed in one process step. After heating up the <b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> and moulds, the glass is pressed in isothermal conditions under a specified load into its final shape. This technology permits the rapid and economical production of micro structured optical components, for example cylindrical lens arrays for usage as slow axis coilimator or micro lens arrays for beam homogenizing applications. Despite the wide distribution of this technology, there is little understanding of the fundamental influencing parameters on the molding result. In this paper, the influence of the molding parameters on the accuracy of complex shaped optical components will be presented. Furthermore the technological limitations of precision glass molding processes in terms of shape complexity will be discussed based on molding experiments with v-shaped and rectangular grooved mold inserts...|$|E

40|$|The {{tribological}} {{conditions of}} hot forming processes are {{much different from}} those at room temperature. Thus classical wear-resistant coating like CrN, CrAlN, TiAlN in most cases are not sufficient for hot forming tools in industrial applications. Additionally the use of lubricants is limited, thermal shock conditions and the increase of sticking work piece material are leading to severe wear. This paper presents examples for ternary boron based Ti-B-N gradient coatings in specific multilayer designs obtained through plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. After a thorough characterization of the chemical composition by Auger electron spectroscopy, the microstructure by X-ray diffraction and the mechanical properties by microindentation and small-angle cross section nanoindentation, the coatings were applied onto hot forming tools made from DIN 1. 2367 tool steel. The coated tools were tested in hot forging of AISI 1043 <b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> in an automatic press and have been comp ared in terms of adhesion and wear resistance.

40|$|Reduction {{of energy}} {{consumed}} by a manufacturing system to turn <b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> to finished products {{is a big}} step towards the green and lean production. In this study the energy efficiency of a one-loop pallet system, a main tool to handle and locate various part types in a cyclic production line, is investigated. The main goal is to obtain the minimal energy consumption in the pallet system drive unit through an optimally controlled and coordinated motion of pallets. To achieve the mentioned goal, first the mean value of the pallet system energy consumption is mathematically modeled. Later, this energy model is utilized as an objective function within an optimization model including constraints on system crucial properties such as cyclic and dynamic behavior, queueing policy, and buffer size. The solution of the optimization problem gives the optimal values of the system control variables, namely, number of pallets and conveyor velocity. To demonstrate the application of this optimization model in practice, three case studies are introduced. The results of these studies show that {{a significant amount of}} the energy consumption may be saved by applying the suggested green control...|$|E
