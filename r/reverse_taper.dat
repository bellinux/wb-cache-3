40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified <b>reverse</b> <b>tapering</b> method {{to generate a}} polarized soft x ray in x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) with a higher photon power and a shorter undulator length than the simple linear <b>reverse</b> <b>tapering</b> method. In the proposed method, a few untapered planar undulators are added before the simple linear <b>reverse</b> <b>tapering</b> section of the undulator line. This simple modification prevents the frequency shift of the radiation that occurs when the simple linear <b>reverse</b> <b>tapering</b> method is applied to planar undulators. In the proposed method, the total length of planar undulators decreased {{in spite of the}} additional untapered undulators. When the modified <b>reverse</b> <b>tapering</b> method is used with four untapered planar undulators, the total length of the planar undulators is 64. 6  m. On the other hand, the required length of the planar undulators is 94. 6  m when the simple linear <b>reverse</b> <b>tapering</b> method is used. The proposed method gives us a way to generate a soft x-ray pulse (1. 24  keV) {{with a high degree of}} polarization (> 0. 99) and radiation power (> 30 [*][*]GW) at the new undulator line with a 10 -GeV electron beam in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-ray Free-Electron Laser.

40|$|One {{major problem}} when using bonded fiber-reinforced plastic {{laminates}} to strengthen and upgrade existing structures {{is the high}} stresses in the adhesive layer, in the area {{close to the end}} of the laminate, which might govern the failure of the joint. One method that has been put forward as a means of reducing the stress concentration in this area, is to taper the end of the laminate. Although this method has been suggested by some design guidelines, no specific information is usually provided about the tapering type, required tapering length, and limitations associated with this method. A parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effect of tapering length and the material properties of joint constituents, i. e., stiffness of the laminate and adhesive, on stress distribution in adhesive joints using the finite element method. Two different configurations, including normal and <b>reverse</b> <b>tapering,</b> were considered. The results indicated that the effect of tapering on stress distribution is highly dependent on the stiffness of the laminate and the adhesive used in the joint.

40|$|Clinical {{experience}} {{shows that}} {{removal of the}} Exeter long-stem femoral component (220 mm, 240 mm, 260 mm) of total hip arthroplasty is extremely difficult, often requiring splitting of the femur. To identify the reason for this, measurements of stem geometry and force required to pull the stems out of the cement mantle were conducted on three original Exeter long-stem and one standard femoral components. All implants required an initial force of approximately 4 kN for release from the cement. The long-stem components then required much larger forces and hence much higher expenditure of energy to pull them clear of the cement. This was attributed to the <b>reverse</b> <b>taper</b> seen on the nominally cylindrical distal section of the long-stem components. Following re-design of the manufacturing process to ensure the taper continued to the implant's distal tip, four further implants were tested. These demonstrated the requirement for initial cement release but then required no further energy expenditure similar to the standard stem. This study clearly demonstrated that the original difficulty in removing these long stems was owing to the manufacturing process resulting in a <b>reverse</b> <b>taper</b> on the distal stem. The adoption of recommended manufacturing changes to ensure the taper continues to the distal tip removed this difficulty...|$|E

This study analyzed the clinical implications of various clinical features of proximal aortic neck anatomy. MethodsProspectively collected data from 258 EVAR patients using modular devices were analyzed. Patients were classified as having favorable neck anatomy (FNA) or hostile neck anatomy (HNA). HNA was defined as {{any or all of}} length of 60 °, diameter of > 28 mm, ≥ 50 % circumferential thrombus, ≥ 50 % calcified neck, and <b>reverse</b> <b>taper.</b> Univariate, multivariate, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to compare early and late clinical outcomes. ResultsFNA was present in 37 % and HNA was present in 63 %. Clinical and demographic characteristics were comparable. Technical success was 99 %. Mean follow-up was 22 months (range, 1 - 78 months). Perioperative complication rates were 3 % for FNA vs 16 % for HNA (P =. 0027). Perioperative deaths were 0 % for FNA and 3 % for HNA (P =. 2997). Proximal type I early endoleaks (intraoperative) occurred in 9 % of FNA vs 22 % for HNA (P =. 0202). Intraoperative proximal aortic cuffs were used to seal endoleaks in 9 % of FNA vs 22 % of HNA (P =. 0093). At late follow-up, abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion was noted in 6 % of FNA vs 7 % of HNA (P =. 8509). Rates of freedom from late type I endoleaks at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 97 %, 97 %, 97 %, and 90 % for FNA vs 89 %, 89 %, 89 %, and 89 % for HNA (P =. 1224); rates for late interventions were 95 %, 90 %, 90 %, and 90 % for FNA vs 95 %, 93 %, 91 %, and 85 % for HNA (P =. 6902). Graft patency at 1, 2, and 3 years was 99 %, 99 %, and 99 % for FNA vs 97 %, 92 %, and 90 % for HNA (P =. 0925). The survival rates were 93 %, 84 %, 76 %, and 76 % for FNA vs 88 %, 82 %, 74 %, and 66 % for HNA (P =. 2631). <b>Reverse</b> <b>taper</b> was a significant predictor for early type I endoleak (odds ratio [OR], 5. 25, P <. 0001), <b>reverse</b> <b>taper</b> (OR, 5. 95; P <. 0001) and neck length (OR, 4. 15; P =. 0146) were for aortic cuff use; circumferential thrombus (OR, 2. 44; P =. 0448), and neck angle (OR, 3. 38; P =. 009) were for perioperative complications.

40|$|Since 2016, the two free-electron laser (FEL) lines FLASH 1 and FLASH 2 {{have been}} run {{simultaneously}} for users at DESY in Hamburg. With {{the installation of}} variable gap undulators in the new FLASH 2 FEL line, many new possibilities have opened up in terms of photon parameters for experiments. What has been tested so far is post-saturation <b>tapering,</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>tapering,</b> harmonic lasing, harmonic lasing self-seeding and two-color lasing. At the moment, {{we are working on}} concepts to enhance the capabilities of the FLASH facility even further. A major part of the upgrade plans, known as FLASH 2020, will involve the exchange of the fixed gap undulators in FLASH 1 and the implementation of a new flexible undulator scheme aimed at providing coherent radiation for multi-color experiments over a broad wavelength range. The recent achievements in FLASH 2 and the current status of plans for the further development of the facility are presented...|$|R
40|$|Simulation of {{physical}} phenomena {{has been over}} the time, a constant concern in attempts to engineer the right track as the actual behavior of different situations. Physical reality is the logical starting point in modeling all the process. The complexity of real physical process, however, raises many problems. Most of these problems find their solution using numerical methods. One of these methods is the FEM, the method allows to using accurately geometry of the structure would be considered no matter how complex, and then analyzes its conduct of loads action that require. This paper presented a FEM analysis of stress and strain state of a worm facegear with <b>reverse</b> <b>tapered</b> pinion. Considering the geometric complexity of the structure analyzed, proceed to a simplification of the phenomenon of contact between the worm-worm wheels. Thus, the corresponding geometric data of a plane section is an analysis of instantaneous action contact between the worm-worm wheels, succeeding the correct {{an interpretation of the}} case study...|$|R
