40|$|Alien crayfishes {{represent}} a common threat to aquatic ecosystems. Their spread in Europe {{is leading to}} more frequent contacts between different invasive species populations. Shelter {{can be an important}} factor in the resulting interactions. A laboratory experiment was designed to analyse the competition for shelter in similarly sized males of two species that show an invasive behaviour in Spain, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. We carried out 24 heterospecific, six-hour trials, with 30 min behavioural observations per hour. Most often, <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish were both the first (70. 8 %) and the long-term winner (62. 5 %). Usually, the long-term winner was the first winner. Whenever shelter was occupied, a passive behaviour by unsheltered individuals was more frequent in signal crayfish than in <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish. When both were unsheltered, signal crayfish displayed more often a passive behaviour. Although the observed behaviour might be explained as the result of dominance by the <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish over the signal crayfish, shelter availability and class, as well as different growth patterns and population size structures, could change the intensity and the outcome of the encounters in the wild, where signal crayfish usually reach larger sizes than <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Biological invasions are {{the second}} largest threat to {{biodiversity}} following habitat loss, and studying invasions has been a focus of ecological the past two decades. Despite the intense research, many basic questions remain empirically unanswered, particularly {{in the realm of}} behavior. The purpose of this research was to explore the interaction between native and invasive competitors at multiple scales in experimental and field settings. Using the native signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and invasive <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in Oregon's Southern Willamette Valley, we experimentally explored one-on-one aggression and dominance relationships and group shelter occupancy in mesocosms, while we performed a survey to determine field microhabitat associations. In our one-on-one aggression and dominance experiment, we tested agonistic relationships based on differences in species, size and sex. We found that aggression is affected more by similarity or dissimilarity in sex between opponents than by any other factor, and that while species or size difference did not affect aggression, they did affect the degree of dominance between opponents. In our mesocosm experiment, we observed patterns of shelter occupancy and microhabitat use based on species composition and shelter density. When alone, invasive <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish used shelter infrequently, regardless of shelter density, while native signal crayfish used shelter in a density-dependent pattern. In mixed species treatments, signal crayfish did not alter their shelter use patterns compared to single species treatments, while <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish patterns of shelter use were identical to those of the signal crayfish: they changed shelter occupancy from a density-independent response when alone to a density-dependent response in the presence of signal crayfish. Furthermore, patterns of microhabitat use paralleled the shelter occupancy patterns, yielding a narrow suite of microhabitats for native signal crayfish and a broad suite of microhabitats for invasive <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish. In our field survey, we employed an epicenter-based design at two regional field sites and performed visual snorkel surveys to detect crayfish. Both field sites were in systems impacted by urban development and agriculture. Red swamp crayfish were more abundant, found at more field sites, and used a broader range of microhabitats than signal crayfish. Cohesively, our results indicate that <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish and signal crayfish do not differ in aggression or dominance, that behavior mediates changes in microhabitat use across environmental and community contexts, that factors other than behavior are important in determining the composition of crayfish assemblages, and that changes in habitat are likely to synergistically aid the spread of invasive <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish at the expense of native signal crayfish...|$|R

The use of reference genes for normalization of the expression levels is crucial for accuracy. Several {{studies have shown that}} there is no perfect reference gene that is appropriate for use in all experimental conditions, and research on suitable reference genes in <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crawfish</b> (Procambarus clarkii) is particularly scarce. In this study, eight commonly used crustacean reference genes were chosen from P. clarkii transcriptome data and investigated as potential candidates for normalization of qRT-PCR data. Expression of these genes under different experimental conditions was examined by qRT-PCR, and the stability of their expression was evaluated using three commonly used statistical algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper.

40|$|Abstract: 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic {{acid and}} monosodium methanearsonate are often sold in {{commercial}} herbicide mixtures. Toxicity {{studies have been}} performed for each herbicide individually, {{but there is a}} dearth of information concerning the toxicity of these herbicides in a mixture. The following study examined the toxicity of a mixture of these two herbicides in the <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crawfish,</b> Procambarus clarkii. 96 -hour acute toxicity assays were performed to determine whether surfactant significantly altered the toxicity of these herbicides individually or in combination. Marking’s additive index was calculated to identify the interactions of the herbicide mixture. Surfactant was observed to significantly increase the toxicity of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the toxicity of the herbicide mixture. The herbicide mixture alone displayed half the toxicity of the individual herbicides, but the mixture with surfactant was twice as toxic as the individual herbicides. The synergistic action of surfactant may be attributed to increased pesticide absorption across biological membranes. 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and surfactant may also compromise gill function, increasing the sensitivity of the crawfish to herbicide toxicity. The antagonistic effects of the herbicide mixture in the absence of surfactant may be caused by competition of both herbicides for the same sites of activity...|$|E
40|$|The <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crawfish,</b> Procambarus clarkii, {{has become}} one of the most {{economically}} important cultured species in China. Currently, little is known about the gonadal development of this species. Isolation and characterization of genes are an initial step towards understanding gonadal development of P. clarkii. Using the 454 pyrosequencing technology, we obtained a total of 1, 134, 993 high quality sequence reads from the crawfish testis and ovary libraries. We aimed to identify different genes with a potential role in gonad development. The assembly formed into 22, 652 isotigs, distributed by GO analysis across 55 categories in the three ontologies, 'molecular function', 'cellular component', and 'biological processes'. Comparative transcript analysis showed that 1, 720 isotigs in the ovary were up-regulated and 2138 isotigs were down-regulated. Several gonad development related genes, such as vitellogenin, cyclin B, cyclin-dependent kinases 2, Dmc 1 and ubiquitin were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR verified the expression profiles of 14 differentially expressed genes, and confirmed the reliability of the 454 pyrosequencing. Our findings provide an archive for future research on gonadal development at a molecular level in P. clarkii and other crustacean. This data will be helpful to develop new ideas for artificial regulation of the reproductive process in crawfish aquaculture...|$|E

50|$|It has {{not always}} been {{possible}} to replicate these findings in crustaceans. In one study, three decapod crustacean species, Louisiana <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish, white shrimp and grass shrimp, were tested for nociceptive behaviour by applying sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, or benzocaine to the antennae. This caused no change in behaviour in these three species compared to controls. Animals did not groom the treated antenna, and {{there was no difference in}} movement of treated individuals and controls. Extracellular recordings of antennal nerves in the Louisiana <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish revealed continual spontaneous activity, but no neurons that were reliably excited by the application of sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. The authors concluded there was no behavioural or physiological evidence that the antennae contained specialized nociceptors that responded to pH. It could be argued that differences in the findings between studies may be due to responses to extreme pH being inconsistently evoked across species.|$|R

However, we also caught individual crayfish that had occupied the footprints of hippopotamus and effectively extended their range beyond the lake up to 40 m into the riparian zone. Isotopic analysis confirmed limited nocturnal observations that these individuals were consuming living terrestrial plants in the vicinity of the footprints.

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the possibility of limiting the expansion of crayfish by the use of these compounds and the implications of their use on fish. Red swamp crayfish experienced high sensitivity to pyrethroids as expressed by the LC 50 - 24 h: 0. 14 mu g/l for Cypermethrin, 0. 17 mu g/l for Cyfluthrin and 0. 22 mu g/l for Deltamethrin. No mortality was observed in common carp during the long term (24 days) exposure test at initial concentration of 22. 0 mu g/ 1 of Deltamethrin. The concentrations of Deltamethrin in muscle of crayfish and common carp were under the limit of quantification of the gas-chromatographic method in all the tests.

40|$|The {{invasive}} <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish Procambarus clarkii is a human-mediated in- troduced {{species in}} the Iberian Peninsula.

40|$|The <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> {{crayfish}} (Procambarus clarkii) {{has been}} widely introduced into aquatic systems all around the world, triggering multiple impacts. In Doñana Natural Area, Abalario and the Biological Reserve of Doñana, Spain (one {{of the most important}} biodiversity reserves in Europe), the <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish was first introduced in 1974 and expanded its range quickly through marsh habitat, but distributed more slowly throughout scrubland ponds. Water persistence, salinity, and substrate can condition the presence of the species in the wild. Before the creation of the Natural Area and the Biological Reserve of Doñana, farmers dug artificial water points in some scrubland ponds to provide water throughout the year for livestock. Once declared a protected area, managers assumed control of the maintenance of the park and opened new water points as a wildlife management tool. The aim of the study presented here was to determine the environmental conditions that favor the spread of crayfish in the temporal ponds of Doñana and whether the occurrence of water points increases the spread of crayfish. For this purpose, we sampled crayfish using a sweep net in 60 randomly selected ponds in two different areas of Doñana. Crayfish occurrence was significantly related to the presence of seasonal streams connecting the ponds with refuge areas and to the presence of artificial water points within the pond. The probability of occurrence of <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crayfish in a pond without seasonal streams was more than 5 times lower than that in a pond with seasonal streams.
