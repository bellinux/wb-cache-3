5|$|Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 {{before he}} could draw up his last will. Since his son <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, claimed the inheritance. The Dudleys {{maintained}} that Guildford's daughter Jane was the natural heir. They finally won the resulting court case {{with the assistance of}} Thomas Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|After leaving high school, Richard was {{selected}} by the Astros as the second pick {{in the first round}} of the 1969 amateur draft. From the time he made his major league debut with the Astros in 1971 until 1975, <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> a limited role as an Astros pitcher, throwing no more than 72 innings in a season. In 1975, Richard played his first full season in the majors as a starting pitcher.|$|E
5|$|After the Astros drafted Richard, {{they sent}} him {{to play for the}} Covington Astros, a rookie-level minor league {{baseball}} team in the Appalachian League. Richard started 12games for Covington, finishing with five wins and four losses. Despite accumulating an average of 11.41strikeouts per nine innings, <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> trouble throughout the season with his pitching mechanics and control. In 56innings, Richard struck out 71batters but walked 52 and gave up 41earned runs, resulting in a 6.59 earned run average.|$|E
50|$|To date {{they have}} {{released}} two EPs and four LPs, while <b>Richards</b> <b>has</b> released one solo EP. <b>Richards</b> <b>has</b> released one additional solo EP as G.A. Richards and the Dark Satanic Mills Bros.|$|R
2500|$|In his solo career, <b>Richards</b> <b>has</b> often shared co-writing credits with drummer and co-producer Steve Jordan. <b>Richards</b> <b>has</b> said, [...] "I've {{always thought}} songs written by {{two people are}} better than those written by one. You get another angle on it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Richard was {{the coach}} of former world {{champion}} Ann Marie Burns. [...] Richard is currently famous for being the judo coach of 2008 Olympic Bronze medalists Ronda Rousey. [...] <b>Richard</b> <b>has</b> coached over 15 international champions. <b>Richard</b> <b>has</b> additionally coached and trained over 50 US Junior and Senior National Champions.

Richard is currently the head judo instructor at UCLA.|$|R
5|$|By 1445 <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> {{become a}} knight, {{probably}} at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 22April that year. He {{is visible in}} the historical record of service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father, and might have taken part {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI.|$|E
5|$|Henry III's younger brother, Richard of Cornwall, {{was granted}} the earldom in 1227. Backed by the {{revenues}} from the lucrative Cornish tin mining industry, he reconstructed the defences at the castle. Richard only visited Cornwall occasionally during his life, probably using Berkhampsted and Wallingford castles as his primary residences in England, and the work may {{have been designed to}} impress the Cornish nobility, with whom <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> a difficult relationship.|$|E
5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E

5|$|Monarchs {{and other}} dignitaries were often in {{attendance}} at the cathedral, and the court occasionally held session there. The building was also the scene of several incidents of mediaeval intrigue. In 1191, whilst King Richard I was in Palestine, his brother John summoned a council of bishops to St Paul's to denounce William de Longchamp, Bishop of Ely—to whom <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> entrusted the affairs of government—for treason.|$|E
5|$|Walter was {{a younger}} son of Richard de Clare, a Norman lord and landholder who also held Clare and Tonbridge in England. Walter's mother was Rohese, the {{daughter}} of Walter Giffard. Rohese and <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> at least six sons and two daughters. Besides Walter, they were Roger, Gilbert, Richard, Robert and Godfrey. The daughters were Alice and Rohese. Walter's family of de Clare was a powerful one, with members of it having participated in rebellions and conspiracies against Henry's older brother King William II of England (d. 1100) in 1088 and 1095.|$|E
5|$|During Richard's {{first years}} as king, {{government}} {{was in the}} hands of a series of councils. Most of the aristocracy preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, yet Gaunt remained highly influential. The first major challenge of the reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The young king played a major part in the successful suppression of this crisis. In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant. By 1389 <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Richards</b> <b>has</b> {{appeared}} in feature films Why Do Fools Fall in Love and Good Burger.

5|$|Dynastic infighting and misfortune quickly {{brought about}} {{the demise of the}} House of York. George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, plotted against his brother and was executed. Following Edward's {{premature}} death in 1483, his brother <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> Parliament declare Edward's two sons illegitimate on the pretext of an alleged prior pre-contract to Lady Eleanor Talbot, leaving Edward's marriage invalid. Richard seized the throne, and the Princes in the Tower were never seen again. Richard's son predeceased him and Richard was killed in 1485 after an invasion of foreign mercenaries led by Henry Tudor, who claimed the throne through his mother Margaret Beaufort. Tudor assumed the throne as Henry VII, founding the Tudor dynasty and bringing the Plantagenet line of kings to an end.|$|E
5|$|Edmund FitzAlan {{was born}} in the Castle of Marlborough, in Wiltshire, on 1 May 1285. He was the son of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel, and his wife, Alice of Saluzzo, {{daughter}} of Thomas I of Saluzzo in Italy. <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> been in opposition to the king during the political crisis of 1295, and as a result he had incurred great debts and had parts of his land confiscated. When Richard died in 09/03/1301, Edmund's wardship was given to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Warenne's only son, William, had died in 1286, so his daughter Alice was now heir apparent to the Warenne earldom. Alice was offered in marriage to Edmund, who for unknown reasons initially refused her. By 1305 he had changed his mind, however, and the two were married.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} defector to Henry in this early stage of the campaign was probably Rhys ap Thomas, who was the leading figure in West Wales. <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> appointed Rhys Lieutenant in West Wales for his refusal to join Buckingham's rebellion, asking that he surrender his son Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas as surety, although by some accounts Rhys had managed to evade this condition. However, Henry successfully courted Rhys, offering the lieutenancy of all Wales {{in exchange for his}} fealty. Henry marched via Aberystwyth while Rhys followed a more southerly route, recruiting a force of Welshmen en route, variously estimated at 500 or 2,000 men, to swell Henry's army when they reunited at Cefn Digoll, Welshpool,. By 15 or 16 August, Henry and his men had crossed the English border, making for the town of Shrewsbury.|$|E
50|$|<b>Richards</b> <b>has</b> since refocused {{his energy}} into writing and {{illustrating}} full-time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Richard</b> <b>has</b> also {{released}} solo records, as Richard Amp and Amp Studio.|$|R

5|$|In {{dividing}} his lands, William {{appears to}} have followed the Norman tradition, distinguishing between Normandy, which he had inherited, and England, which he had acquired through war. William's second son, <b>Richard,</b> <b>had</b> died in a hunting accident, leaving Henry and his two brothers to inherit William's estate. Robert, the eldest, despite being in armed rebellion against his father {{at the time of}} his death, received Normandy. England was given to William Rufus, who was in favour with the dying king. Henry was given a large sum of money, usually reported as £5,000, with the expectation that he would also be given his mother's modest set of lands in Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire. William's funeral at Caen was marred by angry complaints from a local man, and Henry may have been responsible for resolving the dispute by buying off the protester with silver.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{began the}} 1977 season {{on a high}} note with a nine-inning, seven-strikeout {{performance}} on April 8 against the Braves. He pitched seven complete game victories {{in the first half}} of the season. By the All-Star break, <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> nine wins and six losses in over 160innings of work, accompanied by 119strikeouts and a 2.69ERA. Although Richard struggled through July and early August, he did manage to pitch three complete games (including two shutouts) in five starts from August 27 to September 17. He had 11 and 10strikeouts respectively in the final two starts of that roughly 20-day span.|$|E
5|$|Some of Henry Tudor's ships {{ran into}} a storm and were forced to return to Brittany or Normandy, while Henry himself {{anchored}} off Plymouth for a week before learning of Buckingham's failure. Buckingham's army was troubled by the same storm and deserted when Richard's forces came against them. Buckingham tried to escape in disguise, but was either turned in by a retainer for the bounty <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> put on his head, or was discovered in hiding with him. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn, on 2 November. His widow, Catherine Woodville, later married Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor, {{who was in the}} process of organising another rebellion.|$|E

2500|$|Fender Twin– Since the 1990s, <b>Richards</b> <b>has</b> {{tended to}} {{use a variety of}} Fender [...] "tweed" [...] Twins on stage. Containing a pair of 12" [...] speakers, the Fender Twin was, by 1958, an 80-watt all-tube guitar amplifier. <b>Richards</b> <b>has</b> {{utilised}} a pair of Fender Twins [...] "to achieve his signature clean/dirty rhythm and lead sound." ...|$|R
5000|$|For over 40 years <b>Richard</b> <b>has</b> been a {{supporter}} of Tearfund, a Christian charity that aims to tackle poverty in many countries across the world. He has made overseas visits to see their work in Uganda, Bangladesh and Brazil. <b>Richard</b> <b>has</b> said: [...] "Playing a part in relieving poverty is, as I see it, the responsibility of us all." ...|$|R
5|$|The king soon revoked the {{charters}} {{of freedom}} and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued {{in other parts of}} the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{requisite}} Papal dispensation {{was obtained}} dated 22 April 1472. Michael Hicks {{has suggested that}} the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel. First degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon. In their case the papal dispensation was obtained after Catherine declared the first marriage had not been consummated. In Richard's case, there would have been first degree consanguinity if <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> sought to marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard's marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{only his}} second NHL season, Kennedy {{finished}} the 1944–45 regular season leading {{the team in}} goals and points with 29 goals and 25 assists. In the last {{game of the season}} against the New York Rangers, Kennedy's line-mates fed him pass after pass attempting to get him to 30 goals. The Maple Leafs finished in third place and faceed the Montreal Canadiens in the opening round of the playoffs. The Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45 were a record-breaking, powerhouse hockey team. Going into the playoffs the coach of Montreal, Dick Irvin, declared them as the greatest team to have ever played in the NHL. The Montreal club had the top three point leaders in the league, placed 5 of the 6 positions on the First All-Star team, Maurice <b>Richard</b> <b>had</b> scored his famous 50 goals in 50 games, Montreal had finished 28 points ahead of Toronto and scored almost a goal-per-game more. As of 2009, Montreal's regular season winning percentage for 1944–45 is the fifth highest in NHL history and the year previously they had achieved the second highest in history and won the Stanley Cup. The Leafs were given little chance of winning the series.|$|E
