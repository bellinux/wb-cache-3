60|$|When a Dutchman or a Namaqua {{wants to}} carry a load of ostrich eggs to or from the watering-place, or when he robs a nest, {{he takes off his}} trousers, ties up the ankles, puts the eggs in the legs, and carries off his load slung round his neck. Nay, I have seen a half-civilised Hottentot carry water in his leather breeches, ties up and slung in the way I have just described, but without the {{intervention}} of ostrich eggs; the water squired through the seams, but plenty remained after he had carried it to its destination, which was a couple of miles from the watering-place. In an emergency, water-flasks can be improvised from the raw or dry skins of animals, which should be greased down the back; or from the paunch, the heart-bag (pericardium), the intestines, or the bladder. These should have a wooden skewer <b>runing</b> and out along one side of their mouths, by which they can be carried, and a lashing under the skewer to make all tight (fig. below).|$|E

By 1548, he rose to the post of Regional Military Commander (都指揮僉事) of Fujian, where he gained {{the confidence of the}} Zhejiang grand coordinator Zhu Wan. On 15 April 1548, Zhu Wan ordered Lu Tang and Ke Qiao (柯喬) to lead a fleet from Wenzhou to attack the pirate haven Shuangyu, which was being used as a trading post by Chinese pirates and merchants from Japan and Portugal. The fleet descended onto Shuangyu one night in June, under the cover of thick weather. Fifty-five to a few hundred smugglers perished, but the lieutenants such as Li Guangtou (李光頭) and Wang Zhi were able to escape. Lu Tang then razed the town and rendered the harbour permanently unusable by filling it in with stones under Zhu Wan's orders. Zhu Wan and his generals were greatly rewarded in silver for the victory, but they also drew the ire of his political enemies among the gentry, whose profits were directly affected by the destruction of Shuangyu.|$|E

50|$|By 1500 the loch {{drainage}} {{had begun}} with the Gruipe Gutter cut {{to drain the}} loch waters into the River Irvine, the natural outflow being a burn that ran into the Annick Water at Lockwards. Patrick Warner of Ardeer, the parish minister of Irvine, had been exiled to Holland following the Battle of Bothwell Brig and had learned the techniques of drainage from the Dutch. He first dug ditches or 'gotts' that ran into the drain known as the 'Minister's Cast' that ran from the northern end through the old Williamfield area {{and then into the}} Irvine as Jenny's Burn. This worked well and the existing drain or stank (a stretch of slow-moving water), known as the 'Grip or Gruipe Gutter' running through the town along what is now Chapel Lane, dried up. Others drained {{the south end of the}} loch via the outflow that ran into the Annick Water. The newly drained areas became valuable farm lands.In August 1682 the Baillie of Irvine, Hugh Montgomery, was reimbursed for a payment of two shillings made to Robert Miller for casting the goat leading to the loch <b>runing</b> betwixt the taelling rigs and the town lands.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{mechanisms}} of <b>Runing</b> RecipeⅡ (a recipe composed of traditional Chinese herbs) in inhibiting the growth of breast cancer by observing its effects on the expressions of p 53 and ras oncogene proteins and cell cycle of the transplanted Ca 761 breast cancer in mice. Methods: We established the breast cancer model by transplanting Ca 761 cells in mice. The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal saline control group, CTX-treated group, <b>Runing</b> RecipeⅡ-treated group, and <b>Runing</b> RecipeⅡand CTX-treated group, with 12 mice in each group. We detected the cell cycle of the cancer cells in the mice’s transplanted tumor with flow cytometry and measured the expressions of p 53 and ras oncogene proteins in the transplanted tumor with immunohistochemical methods. Results: The percentages of tumor cells in S-phase of the <b>Runing</b> RecipeⅡ-treated group, CTX-treated group and <b>Runing</b> RecipeⅡand CTX-treated group were significantly {{lower than that of}} the normal saline control group respectively (P＜ 0. 05). The percentage of tumor cells in G 0 -G 1 phase of the <b>Runing</b> RecipeⅡ-treated group was lower than that of the CTX-treated group (P＜ 0. 05), while the percentage of tumor cells in G 2 -M phase was higher than that of the CTX-treated group. The immunoreactive scores (IRSs) of p 53 in the <b>Runing</b> RecipeⅡ-treated group and <b>Runing</b> RecipeⅡand CTX-treated group were significantly lower than that in the normal saline control group respectively (P＜ 0. 05). The effect of CTX on the expression of p 53 was not significant. The IRSs of ras oncogene protein in the RecipeⅡ-treated group, CTX-treated group and <b>Runing</b> RecipeⅡand CTX-treated group were lower than that in the normal saline control group respectively (P＜ 0. 05). Conclusion: <b>Runing</b> RecipeⅡ can inhibit the growth of Ca 761 breast cancer in mice by controlling the cell cycle of the transplanted tumor. This may be related to its effect on the gene expressions of p 53 and ras in the tumor tissue...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effect of Ruyiping, a {{traditional}} Chinese compound herbal medicine composed of 5 Chinese herbs for removing toxic materials and dissipating nodules from RuningⅡ, another traditional Chinese compound herbal medicine for treating breast cancer, in preventing recidivation and metastasis in breast cancer patients after operation. Methods: Eighty patients with breast cancer after operation were randomly divided into Ruyiping group and <b>Runing</b> Ⅱ group, and prescribed Ruyiping and <b>Runing</b> Ⅱ {{on the basis of}} chemotherapy, radiotherapy and endocrine therapy respectively for two years. Results: There were two patients with metastasis and three patients lost to follow-up in Ruyiping group and three and two in <b>Runing</b> Ⅱ group. The recidivation and metastasis rates were 5. 41 % and 7. 89 % respectively. The {{difference between the two groups}} was not statistically significant (P＞ 0. 05). The difference of disease-free survival time between the two groups was also not statistically significant. Conclusions: The effect of Ruyiping in preventing recidivation and metastasis is similar to that of <b>Runing</b> Ⅱ. Ruyiping is the essential component of <b>Runing</b> Ⅱ for preventing recidivation and metastasis. The result provides some clinical evidences for the theory that ''Yudu Pangcuan'' (vestigial poison invasion elsewhere) is the essential pathogenesis of breast cancer's recidivation and metastasis and the utilization of ''Sanjie Jiedu'' (dispersing accumulation and detoxification) is the therapeutic principle in preventing recidivation and metastasis after operation...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{mechanisms}} {{of the effects of}} <b>Runing</b> Recipe in anti-invasion and anti-recurrence of breast cancer by experimental research in vitro. Methods: SD female rats were randomly divided into <b>Runing</b> Recipe-treated group and its decomposed formulas Kidney-Warming Recipe and Liver-Soothing Recipe-treated groups, tamoxifen (TAM) -treated group, cyclophosphamide (CTX) -treated group, and normal control group to make medicated serums. Methods of matrigel basement membrane and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were employed to investigate the gene expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 1 (TIMP- 1) after MDA-MB- 435 cells were treated with the medicated serums. Results: The gene expression of VEGF was dropped in CTX-treated, TAM-treated and Liver-Smoothing Recipe-treated groups. The gene expression of TIMP- 1 was up-regulated in CTX-treated, <b>Runing</b> Recipe-treated and Kidney-Warming Recipe-treated groups; while MMP- 9 was down-regulated in these groups. Conclusion: The mechanisms of <b>Runing</b> Recipe in inhibiting the cancer cell invasion may be related to down-regulating the gene expressions of VEGF and MMP- 9, and up-regulating the gene expression of TIMP- 1...|$|E
