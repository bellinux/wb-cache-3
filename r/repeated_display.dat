40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{efficiency}} of visual search does not improve when participants search through the same unchanging display for hundreds of trials (repeated search), even though the participants have a clear memory of the search display. In this article, we ask two important questions. First, why do participants not use memory to help search the <b>repeated</b> <b>display?</b> Second, can context be introduced so that participants are able to guide their attention to the relevant repeated items? Experiments 1 – 4 show that participants choose not to use a memory strategy because, under these conditions, repeated memory search is actually less efficient than repeated visual search, even though the latter task is in itself relatively inefficient. However, when the visual search task is given context, so that only a subset of the items are ever pertinent, participants can learn to restrict their attention to the relevant stimuli (Experiments 5 and 6) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRepeat proteins, such as ankyrin or leucine-rich repeat proteins, are {{ubiquitous}} binding molecules, which occur, unlike antibodies, intra- and extracellularly. Their unique {{modular architecture}} features repeating structural units (repeats), which stack {{together to form}} elongated <b>repeat</b> domains <b>displaying</b> variable and modular target-binding surfaces. Based on this modularity, we developed a novel strategy to generate combinatorial libraries of polypeptides with highly diversified binding specificities. This strategy includes the consensus design of self-compatible <b>repeats</b> <b>displaying</b> variable surface residues and their random assembly into repeat domains. We envision that such repeat protein libraries will be highly valuable sources for novel binding molecules especially suitable for intracellular applications...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{cognitive}} {{research has}} been devoted to the sensitivity of the visual system to invariant statistical information. For example, many studies have shown that performance improves when a visual display is presented repeatedly. But what allows humans to connect the current visual input to previous memory? Is the connection made only when the entire incoming display matches with a previous memory, or can retrieval rely on an incomplete match between the input and a learned display? Using a visual search task, we show that (1) once a <b>repeated</b> <b>display</b> is learned, subjects can retrieve it even when an incoming display only matches it in 3 - 4 locations; (2) however, early during learning, repetition of a small proportion of a display is not enough to establish a strong memory trace for the repeated locations. We suggest that the retrieval of a well-established visual memory can proceed even if an incoming display partly matches the previous memory...|$|E
40|$|Contextual cueing {{experiments}} show that, when displays are repeated, reaction times (RTs) to find {{a target}} decrease over time even when the observers {{are not aware of}} the repetition. Recent evidence suggests that this benefit in standard contextual cueing tasks {{is not likely to be}} due to an improvement in attentional guidance (Kunar, Flusberg, Horowitz & Wolfe, 2007). Nevertheless, we ask whether guidance can help participants find the target in a <b>repeated</b> <b>display,</b> if they are given sufficient time to encode the display. In Experiment 1 we increased the display complexity so that it took participants longer to find the target. Here we found a larger effect of guidance than in a condition with shorter RTs. Experiment 2 gave participants prior exposure to the display context. The data again showed that with more time participants could implement guidance to help find the target, provided that there was something in the search stimuli locations to guide attention to. The data suggest that although the benefit in a standard contextual cueing task is unlikely to be a result of guidance, guidance can play a role if it is given time to develop...|$|E
40|$|In visual search, context {{information}} {{can serve as}} a cue to guide attention to the target location. When observers repeatedly encounter displays with identical target-distractor arrangements, reaction times (RTs) are faster for repeated relative to nonrepeated displays, the latter containing novel configurations. This effect has been termed “contextual cueing. ” The present study asked whether information about the target location in repeated displays is “explicit” (or “conscious”) in nature. To examine this issue, observers performed a test session (after an initial training phase in which RTs to repeated and nonrepeated displays were measured) in which the search stimuli were presented briefly and terminated by visual masks; following this, observers had to make a target localization response (with accuracy as the dependent measure) and indicate their visual experience and confidence associated with the localization response. The data were examined at the level of individual displays, i. e., in terms of whether or not a <b>repeated</b> <b>display</b> actually produced contextual cueing. The results were that (a) contextual cueing was driven by only {{a very small number of}} about four actually learned configurations; (b) localization accuracy was increased for learned relative to nonrepeated displays; and (c) both consciousness measures were enhanced for learned compared to nonrepeated displays. It is concluded that contextual cueing is driven by only a few repeated displays and the ability to locate the target in these displays is associated with increased visual experience...|$|E
40|$|Using visual search, {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) and patient studies have demonstrated that medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures differentiate <b>repeated</b> from novel <b>displays</b> – even when observers are unaware of display repetitions. This suggests a role for MTL in both explicit and, importantly, implicit learning of repeated sensory information (Greene et al., 2007). However, recent behavioral studies suggest, by examining visual search and recognition performance concurrently, that observers have explicit knowledge of {{at least some of the}} <b>repeated</b> <b>displays</b> (Geyer et al., 2010). The aim of the present fMRI study was thus to contribute new evidence regarding the contribution of MTL structures to explicit versus implicit learning in visual search. It was found that MTL activation was increased for explicit and, respectively, decreased for implicit relative to baseline displays. These activation differences were most pronounced in left anterior parahippocampal cortex, especially when observers were highly trained on the <b>repeated</b> <b>displays.</b> The data are taken to suggest that explicit and implicit memory processes are linked within MTL structures, but expressed via functionally separable mechanisms (repetition enhancement vs. -suppression). They further show that repetition effects in visual search would have to be investigated at the display level...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that visual short-term memory (VSTM) can substantially be improved when the to-be-remembered objects are split in 2 half-arrays (i. e., sequenced) or the entire array is shown twice (i. e., repeated), rather than presented simultaneously. Here we investigate the hypothesis that sequencing and <b>repeating</b> <b>displays</b> overcomes attentional “bottlenecks ” during simultaneous encoding. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that se-quencing and <b>repeating</b> <b>displays</b> increased brain activation in extra-striate and primary visual areas, relative to simultaneous displays (Study 1). Passively viewing identical stimuli did not increase visual activation (Study 2), ruling out a physical confound. Importantly, areas of the frontoparietal attention network showed increased acti-vation in repetition but not in sequential trials. This dissociation suggests that <b>repeating</b> a <b>display</b> increases attentional control by allowing attention to be reallocated in a second encoding episode. In contrast, sequencing the array poses fewer demands on control, with competition from nonattended objects being reduced by the half-arrays. This idea was corroborated by a third study in which we found optimal VSTM for sequential displays minimizing attentional demands. Importantly these results provide support within the same experimental paradigm for the role of stimulus-driven and top-down attentional control aspects of biased competition theory in setting constraints on VSTM...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analysed}} the CAG repeat in the Huntington disease (HD) gene in {{sperm and}} blood from 20 unrelated HD patients. Although the CAG <b>repeat</b> <b>displayed</b> significant mosaicism in sperm from all individuals, there were marked {{differences in the}} degree of repeat instability. Individuals who had either inherited or transmitted an expanded CAG <b>repeat</b> <b>displayed</b> the highest levels of repeat mosaicism, whereas individuals who had inherited or transmitted a contracted repeat had very limited CAG mosaicism in sperm. A strong association between intergenerational change in CAG allele size and the level of sperm repeat mosaicism was determined (P = 0. 019). In contrast, neither blood CAG size nor repeat mosaicism in blood, were significantly associated with intergenerational CAG changes. These data suggest the presence of a cis-acting factor, separate from CAG size, that strongly influences the intergenerational behaviour of the CAG repeat. Additional studies are needed to determine whether analysis of CAG mosaicism in sperm is useful for assessing an individual's risk for transmitting large expansions or contractions to his offspring...|$|R
40|$|<b>Repeated</b> <b>display</b> {{configurations}} improve visual search. Recently, {{the question}} has arisen whether this contextual cueing effect (Chun & Jiang, 1998) is itself mediated by attention, {{both in terms of}} selectivity and processing resources deployed. While it is accepted that selective attention modulates contextual cueing (Jiang & Leung, 2005), there is an ongoing debate whether the cueing effect is affected by a secondary working memory (WM) task, specifically at which stage WM influences the cueing effect: the acquisition of configural associations (e. g., Travis, Mattingley, & Dux, 2013) versus the expression of learned associations (e. g., Manginelli, Langer, Klose, & Pollmann, 2013). The present study re-investigated this issue. Observers performed a visual search in combination with a spatial WM task. The latter was applied on either early or late search trials—so as to examine whether WM load hampers the acquisition of or retrieval from contextual memory. Additionally, the WM and search tasks were performed either temporally in parallel or in succession—so as to permit the effects of spatial WM load to be dissociated from those of executive load. The secondary WM task was found to affect cueing in late, but not early, experimental trials—though only when the search and WM tasks were performed in parallel. This pattern suggests that contextual cueing involves a spatial WM resource, with spatial WM providing a workspace linking the current search array with configural long-term memory; as a result, occupying this workspace by a secondary WM task hampers the expression of learned configural associations...|$|E

" 1 Among art historians the tableau {{has been the subject of}} debate as to its 'meaning,' especially since the life-size image does not include narrative paraphernalia that would allow mythological interpretations. But as one scholar wrote, "most are relieved that the work was never meant to be sold. " 2 This dissertation's trajectory is different. It points to Rubens' late style tableaux, of which Het Pelsken is one, as items painted in an exquisite technique effecting (bodily) presence, and conceived as commodities destined for circulation. Thus the works are heavily invested by producer(s) and buyer(s). Painted in a sophisticated allegorical language that simultaneously defies easy (narrative) access and yet keeps viewers continuously spellbound, Het Pelsken is being reframed together with some of Rubens' other paintings to establish a dialogue with today's audience. This study analyzes the allegorical paradigm by way of Walter Benjamin's dialectics in order to locate levels of truth [...] -which are of relevance to current viewers [...] -and also probes the forces that generate such an overt and <b>repeated</b> <b>display</b> of the feminine body.
