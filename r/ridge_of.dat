5|$|A <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> low Jurassic hills {{runs through}} the county, {{separating}} the basins of the Welland and Nene rivers. The county has good communications as it is crossed by two main railway lines and the M1 motorway, and it has many small industrial centres rather than large conurbations. The main architectural feature is its country houses and mansions.|$|E
5|$|A strong <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> high {{pressure}} continued {{to push the}} system west, towards the Caribbean Sea. That afternoon, convective banding and increasing upper-level outflow strengthened the storm to a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The eye disappeared briefly overnight, possibly {{as part of a}} diurnal fluctuation, but returned by the morning of August17.|$|E

5|$|Cosme was {{initially}} forecast to pass over Hawaii at tropical storm strength. Instead, a strong <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> high pressure kept the system well {{south of the}} island. Outer rainbands produced several inches of rainfall, leading to minor flooding while simultaneously alleviating drought conditions. Winds gusts briefly reached tropical storm strength, though no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|During period P, Nagar was densely {{populated}} {{in the northern}} <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> the tell. The city came {{under the rule of}} Mari, and was the site of a decisive victory won by Yahdun-Lim of Mari over Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria. Nagar lost its importance and came under the rule of Kahat in the 18th century BC.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{conditions}} ended suddenly, 11,550 years BP, {{when the}} Gulf Stream current was re-established. Periglacial processes in seasonal freeze-thaw conditions, both present and past, have produced sorted stone stripes and solifluction lobes and sheets {{on the summit}} <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> Helvellyn. These are {{one reason why the}} area was included in the Helvellyn & Fairfield SSSI.|$|E

5|$|Realignment of the River Glaven {{means the}} ruins are {{now to the}} north of the river embankment, and {{essentially}} unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E
5|$|The Yorkists {{appeared}} as the Lancastrians finished deployment. Line after line of soldiers crested the southern <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> the dale and formed up in ranks opposite their enemies as snow began to fall.

5|$|The {{broad and}} disorganized remnant low {{remained}} nearly stationary {{due to a}} <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> high pressure to its north. Residual convection within the remnants of Henri remained disorganized, but forecasters kept watch for the potential for redevelopment. However, it moved inland near Cape Hatteras on September 12 without reorganizing. The remnants continued {{to the north and}} dissipated on September 17 over New England.|$|E
5|$|The north ridge, {{the main}} <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> the range, also descends from Lower Man, passing over White Side and Raise to Sticks Pass, then over Stybarrow Dodd and Great Dodd to {{terminate}} at Clough Head.|$|E
5|$|The two {{remaining}} brigades dug in along a <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> high ground that, if lost, offered the Germans {{a position to}} {{look down on the}} British landing zone. The 1st Special Service Brigade was in the north on a line from Hameau Oger to Le Plain. In between the commandos and the airlanding brigade was the 3rd Parachute Brigade.|$|E

5|$|With the Prussian {{retreat from}} Ligny, Wellington's {{position}} at Quatre Bras was untenable.

5|$|With {{the second}} {{objective}} only partially captured, {{the remnants of}} the 9thBrigade, battered by artillery and machine gun fire, were forced to relinquish their position and retreat back to their own lines. All that remained on the Passchendaele <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> the 9thBrigade was the dead and wounded, among whom was Clarence Jeffries, who was later counted among those with no known grave.|$|E
5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E
