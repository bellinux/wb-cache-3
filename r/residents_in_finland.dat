40|$|This study {{examines}} the identi? cation by Finns of foreign <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> by analyzing {{data from a}} representative sample survey carried out in 2002. When people were asked to name a group of foreigners residing in Finland, the majority ?rst mentioned Somalis, {{despite the fact that}} only 4 percent of foreign residents are Somali and 6 percent of foreign-language speakers speak Somali. The general tendency when identifying resident foreigners is to refer primarily to ethnic or national groups; references to status (e. g. refugee, return migrant, guest worker) or religion (e. g. Muslim) are rare in the survey. In terms of ethnicity, identifying foreign <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> is inconsistent, particularly as Russians and Estonians, the two largest groups, are not readily seen as foreign residents. The prevalence of answering Somalis could be considered an outcome of the maximally visible difference between Finns and Somalis. A logistic regression analysis is used to examine whether identifying resident foreigners differs according to socio-economic and educational characteristics, age, gender, region, and attitude towards the number of resident foreigners in Finland. The variables that signi? cantly in? uence the probability of answering Somalis and Russians are the respondents region, age, attitude towards the number of foreign <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Finland,</b> and to some extent, gender and higher education. Respondents occupational status, vocational education or income does not have a signi? cant impact on the answers. Regional differences appear to be a major factor affecting how foreigners are identi? ed, which shows that although the need to consider resident foreigners as visibly, culturally and linguistically maximally different may be a nearly universal base line for creating difference and identity, identifying foreign <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> is not entirely independent of demographic realities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Salmonella enterica is an {{important}} emerging cause of invasive infections worldwide. However, population-based data are limited. The objective {{of this study was}} to define the occurrence of S. enterica bacteremia in a large international population and to evaluate temporal and regional differences. Methods We conducted population-based laboratory surveillance for all salmonella bacteremias in six regions (annual population at risk 7. 7 million <b>residents)</b> <b>in</b> <b>Finland,</b> Australia, Denmark, and Canada during 2000 - 2007. Results A total of 622 cases were identified for an annual incidence of 1. 02 per 100, 000 population. The incidence of typhoidal (serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi) and non-typhoidal (other serotypes) disease was 0. 21 and 0. 81 per 100, 000 /year. There was major regional and moderate seasonal and year to year variability with an increased incidence observed in the latter years of the study related principally to increasing rates of non-typhoidal salmonella bacteremias. Advancing age and male gender were significant risk factors for acquiring non-typhoidal salmonella bacteremia. In contrast, typhoidal salmonella bacteremia showed a decreasing incidence with advancing age and no gender-related excess risk. Conclusions Salmonella enterica is {{an important}} emerging pathogen and regional determinants of risk merits further investigation. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Equity in {{physical}} health {{of patients with}} severe mental disorders is a major public health concern. The aim of this cohort {{study was to examine}} equity in access to coronary care among persons with a history of severe mental disorder in 1998 - 2009. DESIGN: Nationwide register linkage cohort study. SETTING: Hospital care in the Finnish healthcare system. POPULATION: The study population consisted of all <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> aged 40 years or older. All hospital discharges in 1998 - 2009 with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease or severe mental disorder were obtained from the Care Register. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on deaths, hospitalisations and coronary revascularisations were linked to the data set using unique personal identifiers. RESULTS: Patients with severe mental disorders had increased likelihood of hospital care due to coronary heart disease (RR between 1. 22, 95 % CI 1. 18 to 1. 25 and 1. 93, 1. 84 to 2. 03 in different age groups) and in 40 - 49 -year-olds also increased likelihood of revascularisation (1. 26, 1. 16 to 1. 38) compared with persons without mental disorders. Access to revascularisation was poorer among older persons with severe mental disorders in relation to need suggested by increased coronary mortality. In spite of excess coronary mortality (ranging from 0. 95, 0. 89 to 1. 01 to 3. 16, 2. 82 to 3. 54), worst off were people with a history of psychosis, who did not have increased use of hospital care and had lower likelihood of receiving revascularisations (ranging from 0. 44, 0. 37 to 0. 51 to 0. 74, 0. 59 to 0. 93) compared with persons without mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Selective mechanisms seem to be at work in access to care and revascularisations among people with severe mental disorders. Healthcare professionals {{need to be aware of}} the need for targeted measures to address challenges in provision of somatic care among people with severe mental health problems, especially among people with psychoses and old people...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} has been the political debate in Finland on immigration and foreign residents during the period 1988 - 1999. The main question to be studied was: What does this debate tell us about perceptions of Finland and the Finnish identity in more general terms, and {{of the relationship between}} the State and different cultures? This thesis documents the main legislative changes which have affected the position of immigrants and foreigners in Finland during the period 1988 - 1999, together with the related parliamentary debates. This material consists of the deliberations of governmental committees, government bills, the minutes of plenary sessions in parliament, and other parliamentary documents. The research method used was debate analysis, influenced by discourse analysis and new rhetoric. An attempt to shed more light on the material has been made by comparing the political debate with more theoretical debates about multiculturalism, the political community, and the Finnish identity. During the period of this research the number of immigrants and foreign <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> increased dramatically. The changes in immigration policy and policies regarding foreign residents were partly a consequence of this trend, and partly connected with Finland's accession to various European organisations, particularly the European Union and the European Council. Although the legislation on foreign residents has changed drastically over this period, there has been hardly any change in the content of the arguments used during the formation of this legislation. For example, the main debate in asylum policy has continued to be between the sovereignty of the State and the effectiveness of administration on the one hand, and the legal protection and security of refugees on the other. During the 1990 s multiculturalism became the buzzword in policy regarding foreign residents. The ideal of multiculturalism is linked to a wider principle of equality. In practice multiculturalism has however been considered to be an issue directly related to immigrants: firstly as being a consequence of their presence, and secondly as giving them the responsibility to learn Finnish customs and the Finnish language while preserving their own culture. The way the nature of the political community is perceived influences the range of people considered to be entitled to participate in political decision-making. This research material covers both attitudes defending the differentiated rights of full citizens with regard to other residents, which emphasise the value of cultural homogeneity, and views according to which all residents should have extensive political rights so that everyone can influence the decisions which affect them. The term Finn can be used to refer either to any Finnish citizen, or to someone who can be ethnically and culturally defined as Finnish. The conceptual boundary between a Finn and a foreigner appears on the basis of this research to be virtually insurmountable. Whether foreigners resident in Finland can ever actually become Finns will depend on whether Finnish identity stresses ethnic origin or Finnish citizenship, residence in Finland and participation in Finnish society.

Components of variance in liability were estimated by structural equation modelling. There was an elevated risk of basal cell carcinoma for the co-twin of a diseased twin, but no difference in risk by zygosity. During the prospective follow-up in 1976 - 96, the probandwise concordance was 7. 7 % in monozygotic and 7. 0 % in dizygotic pairs.

25|$|Patronymics {{were used}} in {{official}} documents until the late 19th century. Finns did not address each other by patronymics in colloquial speech. The natural Finnish way of referring to someone's parentage is the genitive: Matin Olli ("Matthew's Olaf") instead of the solemn Olli Matinpoika ("Olaf Matthew's son"). When patronymics were no longer required in documents, they quickly fell out of use. They are still perfectly legal, but very rare, often representing a deliberate archaism. Unlike in Swedish, Finnish patronymics were not transferred into hereditary family names. Thus, the Finnish situation differs considerably from, for instance, Sweden, which has {{hundreds of thousands of}} Johanssons and Anderssons. The Swedish patronymics-like surnames are treated as any other surname. Real patronymics are handled like additional first names, i.e., one must still have a surname.

40|$|Objectives : To {{examine the}} interplay between {{childhood}} growth and living conditions {{in the development of}} hypertension. Design : A longitudinal study of people whose growth between birth and 12 years, and social circumstances during childhood and adult life, were recorded. Setting : Helsinki, Finland. Participants : Eight thousand seven hundred and sixty men and women born in Helsinki University Central Hospital during 1934 - 44, who attended child welfare clinics in the city and were still <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> <b>in</b> 1971. Main outcome measures : Incidence of hypertension defined by prescription of medication. Results : The 1404 children who later developed hypertension grew differently to other children. Low birthweight and shortness or thinness at birth were followed by rapid compensatory growth in weight and height, and an above-average body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2) from the age of 8 years onwards. Some 25 % of children with low birthweight but high BMI at 12 years subsequently developed hypertension, compared to 9 % of those with high birthweight but low BMI. Growth had large effects on the risk of later hypertension in children living in poor social conditions, but only small effects in children in good living conditions. Living conditions in adult life did not affect the risk of hypertension. Conclusions : Hypertension originates in slow fetal growth followed by rapid compensatory growth in childhood. This path of growth has a greater effect on the risk of disease among children who live in poor social conditions. Living conditions in adult life {{do not seem to be}} important. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the path of}} growth of girls who later develop coronary heart disease. Design: Follow up study of girls whose body size at birth, during infancy, and childhood up to age 12 years was recorded. Setting: Helsinki, Finland. Participants: 4130 girls who were born between 1934 and 1944, attended child welfare clinics in Helsinki, and were still <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> <b>in</b> 1971. Main outcome measure: Hospital admission or death from coronary heart disease. Results: In comparison with boys in the same cohort who later developed coronary heart disease the 87 girls were short at birth, rather than thin, had compensatory growth in height during infancy, became thin, and thereafter had a rapid increase in weight and body mass index. In a combined analysis the hazard ratios for coronary heart disease were 1. 17 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 03 to 1. 32, p = 0. 02) for each 1 cm decrease in length at birth, 1. 52 (95 % CI 1. 23 to 1. 89, p < 0. 001) for each standard deviation score increase in body mass index after age 3 years, and 1. 63 (95 % CI 1. 09 to 2. 42, p = 0. 02) for each decrease in level of education. Conclusions: Though broadly similar, the paths of growth associated with the later development of coronary heart disease differ in girls and boys.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity {{is known}} to track from early life into adult life. OBJECTIVE: To examine the {{relation}} of obesity in adult life to growth and living conditions during childhood. DESIGN: Birth cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4515 people (2135 men and 2380 women) who were born at Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1934 and 1944, who attended child welfare clinics and were still <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> <b>in</b> the year 2000. MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of obesity based upon lifetime maximum body mass index (BMI) ascertained from a postal questionnaire and defined as a BMI 30 kg/m 2. The main explanatory measurements were size at birth, childhood growth, and socioeconomic status in childhood and in adult life. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of obesity was 33. 8 % in men and 32. 4 % in women. The incidence rose with increasing body size at birth. From birth the mean weight and BMI of people who later became obese exceeded the average and remained above average at a statistically significant level at all ages from 6 months to 12 y. Childhood BMI was a stronger predictor of adult obesity than body size at birth. A higher maternal BMI in pregnancy {{was associated with a}} more rapid childhood growth and an increased risk of becoming obese in adult life. Higher socioeconomic status and better educational attainment were associated with a lower prevalence of obesity. There was no association between the duration of breastfeeding and later obesity.

Child allowances dated from the 1930s, and they were one of the oldest parts of the welfare system.

Child-care allowances had been paid since the 1970s to those parents who stayed at home to care for small children or who had engaged someone else to do so. A child maintenance allowance is paid when a court-ordered maintenance payment for a child of divorced parents was not being paid. A maternity benefit, based on legislation of the 1930s, was paid for each pregnancy. It came either as a grant or as a much more valuable set of materials, the maternity package, needed to tend a child. It was withheld if the mother did not visit a clinic by the fifth month of pregnancy.|$|R
