50|$|While rye {{and wheat}} are genetically similar enough to interbreed (resulting in hybrids known as triticale), their biochemistries differ {{enough that they}} affect the {{breadmaking}} process. The key issue is differing amylases, the enzyme which breaks starch down into sugar. While wheat amylases are generally not heat-stable and thus do not affect stronger wheat gluten that gives wheat bread its structure, rye amylase remains active at substantially higher temperatures. Since rye gluten (secalin) is not particularly strong, rye dough structure is based on complex polysaccharides, including <b>rye</b> <b>starch</b> and pentosans. As a result, amylases in rye flour can break down dough structure, inhibiting it from rising.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} three non-starch hydrocolloids (guar, carob and arabic gums) on some {{rheological}} properties of <b>rye</b> <b>starch</b> pastes/gels {{at a constant}} 6. 5 % concentration of polysaccharides was determined throughout: (i) pasting characteristics, (ii) flow curves and apparent viscosity–shear time curves at 50 C and (iii) mechanical spectra at 25 C. The presence of gums in the system modified the rheological properties of <b>rye</b> <b>starch</b> pastes/gels and these alterations depended on the type and concentration of the gum. The systems with guar and carob gums exhibited higher apparent viscosities during pasting and higher shear stresses during flow than the paste of native starch. The viscosity of the system with carob was bigger than the one with guar gum. The presence of arabic gum decreased the apparent viscosity of the system both during pasting and during flow. Replacing part of starch with a gum modified the viscoelastic properties of gels, the changes depended on the kind and concentration of the gum.

40|$|Starch was {{isolated}} from rye flour by alkaline extraction or Pronase treatments. Both procedures led to starches of comparable purity. The present first {{report on the}} use of proteolytic enzymes in <b>rye</b> <b>starch</b> isolation showed that such treatment resulted in the highest starch yields. The rye starches had A-type granules with average particle size of 31 mum. The Pronase isolated starch had lower differential scanning calorimetry gelatinisation temperatures than the alkaline extracted starch. Defatted rye flour resulted in a Pronase isolated starch with lower peak and higher end viscosities. Wheat and rye starches isolated by the Pronase procedure were of comparable purity, but a higher yield of the former was obtained. The wheat starch had lower levels of A-type granules with an average particle size of 26 mum. When compared pairwise to the rye starches, the wheat starches had higher gelatinisation temperatures, a higher pasting temperature, a higher peak viscosity and a lower end viscosity.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the concentration of starch in plant materials from the intensity of the blue iodine complex, it is necessary to know the Blue Value (B. V.), which is defined in this paper as the absorbancy of 100 mg of a starch-iodine complex in 100 ml of aqueous solution. An adequate amount of plant material is treated with a hot CaCl 2 solution for 1 / 2 hour and the solute is diluted to 25 ml with CaCl 2. This basic solution serves to measure absorbancy, as well as for starch determination. The first measurement is done by the dilution of a proper amount of basic solution with water and after adding a diluted iodine-iodide solution the reading of B. V. is taken off. The second measurement is done by the precipitation of a starch iodine complex from a proper amount of the basic solution, which is then purified, destroyed by Na 2 SO 3 solution, and starch is determined by the anthrone method. These two readings serve for the establishing of B. V. for the starch. Once established, B. V. can be used for starch determination in the proper plant material. A high degree of variation of the B. V. was found. The highest B. V. was obtained for wrinkled pea seeds (17. 4); walnut, potato, smooth pea and pear gave values from 12. 6 to 11. 0, common bean and broad bean - 10. 3 and 9. 7, Triticale, carrot, rye, wheat and garden parsley from 8. 7 to 8. 0 and maize, oat, normal rice from 7. 6 to 6. 2.

40|$|Aspergillus phoenicis is an {{interesting}} heat tolerant fungus that can synthesize enzymes with several applications in the food industry due to its great hydrolytic potential. In this work, the fungus produced high enzymatic levels when cultivated on inexpensive culture media consisting of flakes from different origins such as cassava flour, wheat fibre, crushed soybean, agro-industrial wastes, starch, glucose or maltose. Several enzymatic systems were produced from these carbon sources, but amylase was the most evident, followed by pectinase and xylanase. Traces of CMCases, avicelase, lipase, &# 946;-xylosidase, &# 946;-glucosidase and &# 945;-glucosidase activities were also detected. Amylases were produced on <b>rye</b> flakes, <b>starch,</b> oat flakes, corn flakes, cassava flour and wheat fibre. Significant amylolytic levels were produced in the culture medium with glucose or when this sugar was exhausted, suggesting an enzyme in the constitutive form. Cassava flour, rye, oats, barley and corn flakes were also used as substrates in the hydrolytic reactions, aiming to verify the liberation potential of reducing sugars. Corn flakes induced greater liberation of reducing sugars {{as compared to the}} others. Thin layer chromatography of the reaction end products showed that the hydrolysis of cassava flour liberated maltooligosaccharides, but cassava flour and corn, rye, oats and barley flakes were hydrolyzed to glucose.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the efficiency of <b>rye</b> and barley <b>starch</b> hydrolysis in mashing processes using cereal malts as a source of amylolytic enzymes and starch, and to establish the volatile profile of the obtained agricultural distillates. In addition, the effects of the pretreatment method of unmalted cereal grains on the physicochemical composition of the prepared mashes, fermentation results, and the composition of the obtained distillates were investigated. The raw materials used were unmalted rye and barley grains, as well as the corresponding malts. All experiments were first performed on a semi-technical scale, and then verified under industrial conditions in a Polish distillery. The fermentable sugars present in sweet mashes mostly consisted of maltose, followed by glucose and maltotriose. Pressure-thermal treatment of unmalted cereals, and especially rye grains, resulted in higher ethanol content in mashes in comparison with samples subjected to pressureless liberation of starch. All agricultural distillates originating from mashes containing rye and barley grains and the corresponding malts were characterized by low concentrations of undesirable compounds, such as acetaldehyde and methanol. The distillates obtained under industrial conditions contained lower concentrations of higher alcohols (apart from 1 -propanol) than those obtained on a semi-technical scale...|$|R
40|$|The {{swelling}} parameters (swelling dynamics – Vd {{and degree}} of swelling – V) of rye in a composition with buckwheat were investigated by an acoustic echolocation method. The new provisions production experiment was performed with single and twin screw extruders. The obtained experimental results are presented. The determined swelling parameters (Vd and V) of extrudates have a good correlation with parameters, analyzed by the instrumental method (expansion index, specific density, mechanical strength of the product and a mean diameter of pores). The experiment performed with both extruders proved that varied buckwheat percentage in rye composition (0 till 40 %) allows us to obtain products with various quality of texture – from snacks to breakfast cereals. Analysis of solubility and water absorption of non – pores structures of extrudates was done using traditional methods additionally. It proved results obtained by acoustic echolocation method, that during extrusion <b>rye</b> <b>starch</b> granules tend be more degraded and depolymerized in comparison with buckwheat. Rye extrudates like snacks differed by intensive swelling dynamic and their structure in time of 60 seconds was collapsed, taking volume of water about 2, 9 ml. Extrudates with buckwheat flour differently from pure rye have swelling property and make more equal structure. Analyzed extrudates with the highest amount of buckwheat flour like breakfast cereals were observed as having a long unbroken not interrupted swelling process, keeping structure during measurement time. This sort of products had a highest degree of swelling (V – 5, 4 mlh 2 o) and the structure looked most uniform...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to record and analyse mass (m) changes of {{population}} of micro-granules of <b>rye</b> <b>starch,</b> effective alternative current (AC), (electric) complex impedance (EACI) of this system taking place during humidification as well as insight into microstructure evolution by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Design/methodology/approach: Mass changes of biopolymeric micro-granular sample occurring during its exposition to saturated water vapour at room temperature, was recorded in time by means of precise torsional balance equipped with special chamber. The same was done in case of microstructure by XRD method. Monitoring of EACI was performed by means of interdigit comb capacitor and precise RLC meter equipped with PC software. Specially designed and constructed measuring chamber was applied to control temperature and relative humidity (RH %) in ambient sample atmosphere. Electric measurements were carried out for 5 selected frequencies. Findings: Interdigit dielectric spectroscopy method {{turned out to be more}} sensitive technique to follow details of long lasting humidification than only mass changes recording. Correlation of changes of EACI with simultaneously occurring mass increase can be a way to describe the humidification stages processes involving water molecules adsorption and absorption by micro-granular biopolymeric sample. Frequency dependence of EACI gives insight into mechanism of water molecules inclusion, binding and immobilization on the starch granules surface as well as inside of its internal physical structure. Research limitations/implications: The recording duration of m(t) was limited to ~ 104 s in case of humidification by balance resolution and character of the process. The whole range of measurements was limited to max ~ 23 RH % of water uptake in order to prevent over molecular structure irreversible changes. The above limitations enable us to collect data for modelling reversible water uptake and connected EACI micro-granular biopolymeric population sample. Practical implications: EACI monitoring of humidification turned out to be much more selective than only gravitational measurement of mass change. Modelling purpose correlation of both can give new possibilities to modelling approach. Achieved data can contribute to better understanding of active adsorption and absorption centres in starch granules. Originality/value: For the first time practically important humidification process was monitored in statu nascendi, without disturbing geometry of starch granules population by means of EACI evolution record. It was enabled by application of interdigit comb capacitor as a sensing unit. This is the first report of four stages for EACI evolution as well as the first XRD direct record of granular starch reversal swelling...|$|E
40|$|Mature wheat {{endosperm}} contain A- (diameter > 10 [mu]m) and B-type (diameter < 10 [mu]m) starch granules, {{showing a}} bimodal granule size-distribution. Because the two starch granule types differ significantly in chemical composition and functional properties, wheat cultivars containing predominantly A- or B-type granules {{would be very}} useful for industry. Breeding such cultivars may be accelerated by molecular and biochemical characterization of A- and B-type granules. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to analyze proteins and genes that may be related to the biosynthesis of the two granule types. Microsieving and centrifugal sedimentation through aqueous solutions of sucrose, maltose or Percoll were used to separate A- and B-type granules. Homogeneous A- and B-type granule populations were obtained by centrifugation through two Percoll solutions (70 % and 100 %). Starch granule-bound proteins, SGP- 140 and SGP- 145 were found to be preferentially associated with A-type granules in developing and mature wheat endosperm. Both SGP- 140 and SGP- 145 were different variants of SBEIc, a 152 kD isoform of wheat starch branching enzyme, and localized to the endosperm starch granules. The preferential association of SGP- 140 and SGP- 145 with A-type granules was related to the growth of wheat A-type granules, and the occurrence of the bimodal starch granule size-distribution in barley, <b>rye</b> and triticale. <b>Starch</b> synthase (SS) I has been implicated in the size determination of A-type granules in barley. Biochemical and molecular characterization of wheat A- and B-type granules makes it necessary to clone and characterize wheat SSI (wSSI). In developing wheat endosperm wSSI was present at similar levels in starch granules throughout development, while in soluble fractions, wSSI was not detected at five DPA, and had highest concentrations from 10 to 15 DPA. Based on single kernels, wSSI had similar concentrations in soluble fractions from 15 to 25 DPA, and more wSSI was distributed in starch granules than in soluble fractions. wSSI contributed approximately 65 % of the total soluble SS activity in wheat endosperm. Two full-length cDNA clones encoding wSSI were isolated from a wheat cDNA library, and confirmed to produce active SS. wSsI transcript was detected in developing wheat endosperm and other tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{functionality}} of the rye (Secale cereale L.) flour constituents starch, {{protein and}} arabinoxylan during {{the manufacture of}} food products largely differs from that of the corresponding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour constituents. While the fate of starch and arabinoxylan during rye bread making and their importance for the quality of the baked product have well been demonstrated, {{only a limited number of}} literature reports deal with the functionality of rye proteins during processing. This is surprising as an understanding of the transformation of these constituents is a prerequisite to obtain good quality products. Gingerbread is a cereal based product that contains high levels of sugar, rye flour and low levels of water. In contrast to what is the case for the functionality of the different dough ingredients during the production of sugar-rich wheat based food systems such as sugar-snap cookies, Belgian waffles, pound or high ratio cakes, there is little if any literature on the functionality of rye constituents in dough systems containing high sugar levels. However, the levels of water, flour and sugar are important when considering flour functionality in the above mentioned wheat based systems. Compared to wheat based recipes for sugar-snap cookies and Belgian waffles, the gingerbread recipe has a relatively higher level of sugar and a relatively lower level of flour. High ratio cake recipes have a higher sugar level than the gingerbread recipe, but relatively lower flour and water levels. Gingerbread and pound cake recipes have similar flour levels, but the former have a slightly higher relative sugar level, whereas pound cake recipes contain slightly more water than those for gingerbread. The general aim of this doctoral dissertation was to determine the role of <b>rye</b> proteins, <b>starch</b> and arabinoxylan during the production of gingerbread and to study their impact on product quality. As part of the effort, a chromatographic method to characterise rye proteins was developed and then used to study the role of the proteins during gingerbread making. The first part of this study focused on rye proteins. Since a rapid and accurate method for quantifying, separating and characterising rye flour proteins and fractions thereof in a single chromatographic run was lacking, such a chromatographic method was developed in the first experimental Chapter. In contrast to the available methods, this protocol requires no time consuming extraction step prior to analysis. All proteins were extracted in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing buffer in the presence and absence of a reducing agent, followed by separation and quantification of the extracted proteins by high performance liquid chromatography. The method allowed studying both the extractability and the apparent molecular weight distribution of rye flour protein fractions. In addition, the presence of covalent disulfide bonds within and between the different proteins in native rye flour was examined. The results showed that rye flour contains disulfide cross-linked protein aggregates made up by high molecular weight- and 75 k γ-secalins, in which some albumins, globulins and/or ω-secalins are enclosed. Next, the developed chromatographic method was used to determine the impact of heating on the changes in rye flour proteins and fractions thereof. To that end, a rye dough model system was heated for varying times at different temperatures relevant for the gingerbread making process. Dough samples heated at higher temperatures showed both a higher rate and extent of protein aggregation than samples heated at lower temperatures. Moreover, the decrease in the level of extractable proteins during heating followed first-order kinetics. Rye proteins formed cross-links mainly through covalent disulfide bonds. However, longer heating times resulted also in the formation of other non-disulfide cross-links, some of which as a result of Maillard reactions. In addition, part of the proteins, more in particular monomeric albumins, globulins and/or secalins, became enclosed in the aggregated protein fraction. It was hypothesised that in rye dough and baked product, proteins appear as separate, dense aggregates, consisting of a shell from aggregated proteins and a core of monomeric albumins, globulins and/or secalin proteins. To study the impact of sugar on the cross-linking of rye proteins, a laboratory scale procedure for preparing gingerbread was designed in the next Chapter. It was shown that, even in the presence of high levels of sugar and lower levels of water, proteins cross-linked both by disulfide and non-disulfide bonds, while another part became enclosed in the aggregated protein fraction during mixing, resting at 62 °C and baking. The mechanism of protein cross-linking during gingerbread making was further investigated by adding the oxidant potassium iodate or the reducing agent L-cysteine prior to mixing or remixing of gingerbread dough. Dough rise during baking as well as texture parameters during storage of gingerbread were evaluated. The results demonstrated that redox agents impact on protein aggregation during gingerbread making and thus on dough properties and the quality of the baked product. It was shown that free sulfhydryl groups are involved in protein cross-linking during mixing, resting at 62 °C and baking. Addition of high levels of the reducing or oxidizing agents prior to mixing resulted in more pronounced protein cross-linking by disulfide bond formation prior to baking. It was suggested that the more cross-linked protein aggregates negatively affect the gas cell stabilising effect exerted by arabinoxylan, and thus lead to a less pronounced dough rise and, consequently, less soft gingerbread with a lower specific volume. In contrast, the postponed cross-linking during the initial stages of baking as a result of reduction of disulfide bonds by L-cysteine allowed the dough to rise more than did control dough. Additionally, the collapse was lower, resulting in softer gingerbread of higher specific volume. It was clear from these results that proteins are subjected to changes during gingerbread making and that they are present as fillers rather than forming a continuous network. In addition, it was suggested that starch and arabinoxylan are more important for dough structure and gingerbread quality than proteins. The last part of this study focused on the role of constituents other than proteins during gingerbread making. More in particular, the changes in starch and arabinoxylan during the different steps of gingerbread making were determined. It was examined whether and to what extent they influence the quality of the baked product. In a first part, the role of starch during gingerbread making was investigated. It was found that starch is partly degraded by endogenous amylases during dough resting at 62 °C and it was assumed that the enzyme action decreased dough viscosity, whereas during baking dough viscosity increased due to starch gelatinisation. When different amylases were added prior to mixing, a more pronounced dough rise during baking was consistently obtained, probably due to the decrease in dough viscosity. The collapse of the structure during the final baking stages was much more pronounced when amylases were added and a lower gingerbread height was obtained. It was hypothesised that amylases weakened starch network formation during baking. In addition, the action of amylases on the outer starch chains decreased crumb firming during storage, which was ascribed to a reduced retrogradation of starch. It was clear from these results that starch is the main structural component in gingerbread. Finally, the role of arabinoxylan during gingerbread making was studied. Water-unextractable arabinoxylan is solubilised during resting at 62 °C by endogenous xylanases. Baking increased the level of water-unextractable arabinoxylan. This was ascribed to physical entrapment of arabinoxylan components and/or cross-linking of water-extractable arabinoxylan among each other or with other dough constituents. Addition of xylanases with a selectivity for water-unextractable arabinoxylan prior to mixing negatively impacted dough properties and gingerbread quality, indicating that arabinoxylan is important for dough rise, probably because it exerts gas cell stabilising properties. In addition, xylanases resulted in a product of lower softness which changed less over time. In conclusion, this doctoral work contributed to a better understanding of the transformations of rye flour constituents during gingerbread making and their impact on dough properties and product quality. It was shown that, although proteins are generally considered to be less important for dough properties and product quality, they aggregate during the different steps of gingerbread making. Starch has a huge impact on dough structure. During baking, it gelatinises and as such highly increases viscosity and, hence, dough structure setting during baking. As a result, extensive degradation of starch during baking should be avoided. However, slight degradation of the outer starch chains reduced the rate of firming during storage. Arabinoxylan is also considered to play an important role for dough structure and gingerbread quality, more in particular because during baking it stabilises gas cells. Extensive degradation of water-unextractable arabinoxylan lowers the leavening properties of dough and, evidently, decreases the height of the baked product. All in all, proteins, starch as well as arabinoxylan impact dough structure and influence the structure of the baked product of rye dough systems containing high levels of sugar. Consequently, careful selection of the raw material and optimal process conditions is needed to obtain gingerbread of good quality. Last but not least, the present results may provide a basis for reducing sugar in these systems. nrpages: 171 status: publishe...|$|R
