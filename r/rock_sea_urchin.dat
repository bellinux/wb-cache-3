40|$|Amongst {{the many}} {{ecological}} processes {{that can have}} an influence on community structure within marine ecosystems, herbivory is recognised as having an important role. Algae are not only living components of the community, they often provide a physical structure, food and protection indispensable for many other species. Therefore, understanding herbivore behaviour and their effects on the surrounding habitat is vital to further comprehend benthic marine ecosystem dynamics. Strength of herbivory is often determined by simple numbers of individual herbivores. There are however, other factors that may influence herbivore feeding behaviour such as food quantity and quality. Changes in food availability can have a strong influence on the dynamics of consumers that rely on allochthonous sources as their main supply of energy. I tested the hypothesis that a decrease in per capita food supply to a sedentary herbivore has {{a negative effect on}} herbivore condition and also affects the surrounding habitat through changes herbivore feeding behaviour. The reduction in food supply had a negative influence on herbivore gonad condition, whilst concomitant increases in consumer density caused greater foraging of the surrounding habitat. Poor consumer condition can be the result of food limitation and in some cases can lead to stronger herbivory. This process could help explain barrens creation across many subtidal rocky coasts. Ecological traits may have a stronger influence on population and community dynamics than currently acknowledged; particularly sedentary herbivores that may be incapable of migrating to alternate environments. I assessed the effects of origin of food and its frequency of delivery on sea urchin behaviour and condition. Higher consumption rates and poorer condition were associated with food originating from sheltered coasts; coinciding with observations of urchin over-grazing in this type of Environment. Whilst algae derived from exposed coasts caused lower consumption rates and better condition; coinciding with no urchin over-grazing on exposed reefs. Understanding such trait-mediated responses to allochthonous food may assist the development of more comprehensive models that account for variation in strength of herbivory. Many studies have focussed on foraging of canopy-forming algae by sea urchins associated with barrens, however, foraging effects of urchins not associated with barrens is less clear. I tested the hypothesis that the sedentary (largely site attached) sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma has detectable effects on the canopy-forming and understory algae. In a location where densities were at the upper limits of their range of a region that lacks sea urchin barrens, algal cover was estimated beneath and immediately around sea urchins. The area under the urchins was consistently bare <b>rock.</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>urchin</b> removal experiments showed that canopy-forming algae were able to develop in greater covers after 16 months and approached those in areas that naturally lacked urchins. In the area immediately surrounding the sea urchins, turf-forming algae dominated the first 5 - 6 cm, whilst at 8 cm canopy-forming algal cover matched areas without urchins. Cover of canopy-forming algal can be reduced in the presence of non-barren forming urchins, albeit only within a few centimetres of individual urchins. This suggests that such organismal-scale effects may have an influence on the ecology of rocky coasts with dense populations of these urchins (e. g. sheltered coasts). In conclusion, strength of herbivory can depend on many factors that vary across a broad range of scales. In this thesis, I provide knowledge on some of the factors associated with herbivory by the purple sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma. I show that herbivore abundance and condition which can directly affect strength of herbivory vary at regional (i. e. Eastern Australian Current v. Leeuwin Current) and local scales (ie. sheltered v. exposed coasts). I also demonstrate that drift-algal quantity and origin can have a strong influence on sea urchin condition and feeding behaviour. Finally, the organismal scale effect (i. e. centimetres) may not only be detectable but also influential at some places and scales. Together, these results suggest that populations of herbivores, their condition and impact, may have predictable effects from local through regional scales. The integration of such dependencies to general models may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of rocky subtidal ecosystems. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Here we present field data on P. lividus attachment force, burrow shape and test diameter measured in different rocky habitats (intertidal pools, low shore intertidal channels and shallow subtidal shores) and in two study sites with different wave-exposure conditions. These data were then analyzed {{to look for a}} possible relationship between the size of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> and their attachment force and burrow shape as well as the influence of wave-exposure and habitat in the measured variables. P. lividus test diameter varied among habitats: urchins were smaller in mid-shore intertidal pools and bigger in shallow subtidal shores. We observed in all studied habitats that attachment force was not correlated with test size, while burrow shape index (BSI) was negatively correlated with test size. Results suggest that the attachment force of large and small urchins was similar, but smaller animals occurred in relatively deeper burrows (higher BSI values). Attachment force was positively correlated with BSI, which indicates that burrows may enhance attachment force of P. lividus living in rocky shores by allowing the use of spines as anchorage points and reducing the urchin area exposed to drag forces. Our results partially support the hypothesis that attachment force and BSI might be influenced by local variation in wave-exposure. Higher values for both attachment strength and BSI were measured in intertidal rock pools, the most wave-exposed habitat considered in this study, suggesting that urchins living in such habitat are more able to resist dislodgment by wave-induced forces since they occupy relatively deeper burrows and thus attach more firmly to the substrate. However, neither attachment force nor BSI were higher in the more exposed shore...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> 'barrens' on shallow temperate rocky reefs is well documented. However {{there has been}} much conjecture about the underlying mechanisms leading to <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens, and relatively little experimentation to test these ideas critically. We conducted a series of manipulative experiments to determine whether predation mortality is an important mechanism structuring populations of the <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Heliocidaris erythrogramma in Tasmania.

40|$|Worldwide, {{ecosystems}} {{have demonstrated}} the potential for dramatic shifts to an alternative persistent state under gradual long-term environmental changes or following sudden short-term perturbations. Such shifts are documented for numerous marine examples from coral reef to pelagic communities and may become more common as ecological dynamics adjust to climate-driven changes. These shifts are often sudden, challenging to predict and can have disastrous and unpredictable consequences on both ecosystem functioning and the human activities that rely on the associated natural resources. They often result in irreversible dramatic changes in community structure and productivity and represent {{a growing concern for}} managers of natural systems. In ecosystems where the presence of an alternative persistent state is well documented, the drivers of these shifts (e. g. anthropogenic stressors or changes in environmental conditions) can be analysed retrospectively so as to address key management questions, as has occurred in several applications on coral reefs. However, phase shifts are often swift and observed a posteriori, i. e. after the ecosystem has shifted to the alternative state. Thus, thresholds in ecosystem dynamics are difficult to identify empirically despite that this is crucial for sound management of marine resources. Additionally, controlled experimental assessment of the effects of alternative management scenarios on community state is hardly ever achievable in marine ecosystems. When they occur, phase shifts are unique to each ecosystem, hence case-specific simulation models present a valuable tool to explore ecological dynamics with alternative persistent community states, test the effects of management scenarios and inform decision-making. On the east coast of Tasmania, shallow rocky reef communities on the exposed coast mainly occur in two alternative persistent states: (1) the seaweed bed state characterised by a dense productive canopy of macroalgae; or, (2) the <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> ‘barren’ state characterised by a poorly productive rocky habitat largely bare of seaweeds as a result of destructive grazing by the long-spined <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> (Centrostephanus rodgersii). The establishment of these widespread <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens result from a combination of both: (1) the climatedriven range extension of the long-spined <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> C. rodgersii from Australia’s mainland to Tasmania; and (2) depletion of key reef predators by fishing. Large southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) individuals constitute the main predator of the long-spined <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> in Tasmania. Relative to the seaweed bed state, C. rodgersii barrens represent dramatic losses of habitat, species diversity and productivity, including commercial species such as blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) and southern rock lobster, the two most valuable fisheries in Tasmania. Thus, the spread of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens presents a major and pressing threat for the lobster and abalone fishing industries. This thesis presents a suite of models specifically developed to better understand the dynamics of Tasmanian rocky reef communities and inform management interventions to mitigate destructive grazing of seaweed beds by the invasive long-spined <b>sea</b> <b>urchin.</b> Chapter 2 investigates the causal relationships between positive feedback and the occurrence of alternative states in community dynamics. Modelling of community feedback informed by available qualitative knowledge about ecosystem structure constitutes a valuable framework to detect the potential for alternative states in ecological dynamics as illustrated with some examples from Tasmanian rocky reef communities. Qualitative modelling assists to understand the essential features of temperate reef dynamics around Tasmania, and provides a useful first step towards quantitative modelling of rocky reef dynamics. The approach provides an ideal framework to (i) collate all available information about rocky reef ecology, (ii) test model structure uncertainty, and (iii) identify key drivers of alternative states in ecosystem dynamics. The quantitative model presented in the subsequent chapters captures the dynamics of the three key groups or species (i. e. the <b>rock</b> lobster, <b>sea</b> <b>urchin,</b> and seaweed assemblage) directly involved in the positive feedback that drives the shift between alternative states on Tasmanian rocky reef. Chapter 3 describes the development, parameterisation and calibration of a mean field model of the local dynamics (reef area of 100 m 2 - 10 ha) of a reef community. The model’s ability to capture the potential for phase shifts, from dense seaweed bed to <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens habitat and back, is validated against largescale patterns observed on rocky reefs where C. rodgersii occurs. In the simulations, the time for extensive <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens to form is of the order of two decades, while restoration of seaweed cover from the <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens habitat takes about three decades if relying on management interventions that cannot effectively reduce urchin density to zero. Thus, restoration of seaweed beds seems unrealistic to implement within the current timeframe of management plans. Comprehensive model-independent sensitivity analysis of model behaviour to parameter estimates also suggests that, in addition to lobster fishing mortality, recruitment rates of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> and <b>rock</b> lobsters, which are strongly influenced by large scale oceanographic features and highly variable in eastern Tasmania, are key factors in determining the potential for <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barren formation in the model. In Chapter 4, sets of Monte-Carlo simulations with this model are used to address three sets of questions related to management for mitigation of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> destructive grazing of Tasmanian seaweed beds. Model behaviour suggests that thresholds in shifting from seaweed bed to <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barren and restoration of seaweed cover reveal the existence of a hysteresis in model dynamics. The hysteresis implies that the establishment of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens cannot be reversed easily. These thresholds provide valuable ecological reference points to prevent the establishment of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens. The model indicates that culling of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> appears as the most effective management strategy to minimise the ecological impact of C. rodgersii on Tasmanian reef communities. Indirect interventions relying solely on the rebuilding of rock lobster population (through reduction in fishing or implementation of a maximum legal catch size) perform poorly but, when combined with direct control of the <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> population, they can provide optimal outcomes both in terms of minimising barren formation and fishery performance. Finally, the model shows that to allow lobsters to play their critical ecological ‘service’ role in preventing <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens formation, a reduction in lobster fishing mortality from current levels is required. A maximum sustainable yield as estimated from the single species stock assessment model does not account for the ecosystem service delivered by larger lobsters, and the models emphasise the need for an ecosystem-based fishery management approach. This suite of models contributes to the general understanding of mechanisms and drivers that can facilitate shift between alternative states in ecological dynamics. The quantitative simulation model provides specific information to managers about the drivers of shifts between the seaweed bed and the <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barren state in the dynamics of Tasmanian rocky reefs. In particular, the presence of a hysteresis in reef community dynamics means that effort to prevent barrens formation constitutes a more viable and cost effective management strategy than the restoration of seaweed beds once extensive barrens habitat has developed. The commercially-fished rock lobster is an essential reef predator delivering key ecosystem services to Tasmanian rocky reefs and model simulations highlight the necessity for fisheries management to move away from a single species focus and account for the ecological role of targeted commercial species. The tools implemented here to inform an ecosystem-based management of Tasmanian rocky reefs are generic and ‘transportable’ to other ecosystems with alternative states. While C. rodgersii barrens currently constitute a pressing concern for managers of reef communities and fisheries in Tasmania, the longspined <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> is only one example of a species that is dramatically restructuring Tasmanian reef communities. There are many other ‘natural’ invaders, whose ecosystem roles and impacts are unknown, currently extending their distribution from Australia’s mainland to the warming Tasmanian waters. In the coming decades, climate-driven changes are likely to bring more surprises to Tasmanian rocky reefs, and just as many challenges for the associated fisheries and their managers...|$|R
