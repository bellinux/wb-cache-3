25|$|A {{higher than}} average {{concentration}} of hagwon in the Gangnam-gu (강남구) area, specifically Daechi-dong (대치동), has been cited as {{the primary reason for}} an increase in <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>costs</b> in the area. In the 1970s the Seoul government made some top schools relocate to the area; however, the schools there have become associated with entry into elite high schools and then elite universities. Many residents feel their children need to be associated with these schools in order to reach the upper levels of business and success. As more parents try to move to the area to allow their children to attend these schools, the prices of real estate in the area have risen to 300percent of similar areas in Seoul. In 2003 the government had planned to develop a hagwon center in Pangyo to relieve some of the pressure on Gangnam, yet after heavy criticism for only shifting the problem around and not solving it, the government canceled the plan only a couple weeks later.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDie {{separation}} {{processes for}} compound semiconductor devices are typically based on either diamond {{scribe and break}} techniques or on ganged sawing of the substrate using water-cooled saws. These mechanically dependent processes can suffer from several limitations, including overall throughput of the process (and throughput scalability as wafer sizes increase), physical damage to the dies incurred during the sawing or scribing operation, and the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>cost</b> of needing large scribe lines or streets for relatively small devices like LEDs.

40|$|For an {{accurate}} <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>cost</b> evaluation, {{it is important}} to break down and analyze its various technical and socio-economic cost components. Carefully examining the factors coming to bear on the final cost of a property enables a more effective project management and a greater control over the feasibility of the project concerned. In the present study, we analyze a sample of 70 new residential properties built in Italy with the aid of an interpretative model. The approach takes the strictly technical characteristics of the building sector into account, but also identifies the close correlation (little studied in the sector’s scientific literature) between the trend of construction costs and socio-economic conditions of the reference setting such as the workforce’s mean years of schooling, the housing market trends, and the average per capita income...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} a previous research project, which examined the area of decision support {{as it relates to the}} generation of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> conceptual <b>cost</b> estimates (Nobe, 1996). The purpose of this research was to evaluate a prototype development cost estimating decision support system for use in the pre-development planning stage of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> development. The system evaluated was the <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> Development Decision Support System (REDDS?), which is currently in the prototype stage of development. The system was tested on a group of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> development and construction management students at Texas A&M University. It was hypothesized that an interdisciplinary methodology, which utilizes a decision support framework, would facilitate generation of consistent and timely analysis of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> development <b>cost</b> and associated risk, and elevate the confidence of the user in the estimating decision making process. Test results indicate that the REDDS? system does significantly reduce conceptual cost estimating preparation time. However, it was also determined that the REDDS? system does not significantly change the confidence of the user in the decision making process. Finally, this research shows that the use of the REDDS? system provides a consistent and sophisticated framework for evaluating development cost and risk, which leads to less variation and more accurate estimates...|$|R

40|$|Although {{building}} {{operating charges}} {{have turned out}} to be a major determinant of profitability for <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investments, there is a noticeable lack of reports or studies that analyze these costs with state-of-the-art statistical techniques. Specifically, past studies usually assume linear relationships between costs and building attributes, they do not control for cluster-specific or longitudinal effects and do not account for the simultaneous structure of cost categories. Therefore, in this study we provide a novel approach to <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>cost</b> benchmarking: We analyze the effects of building attributes on electricity, heating and maintenance costs for office buildings in Germany in a multivariate structured additive regression (STAR) model simultaneously, modeling potentially nonlinear effects as P(enalized) -Splines and controlling for cluster-specific and individual heterogeneity in a three-way random effects structure. This way, we gain insights into how building attributes influence costs, and how cost levels vary across cities, companies and buildings. We furthermore derive quality-adjusted time indices for the two major German submarkets, the former German Democratic Republic and the old West German states. The results obtained can be used to derive portfolio allocation strategies and for planning, constructing, operating and redeveloping <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> Benchmarking, operating charges, P-Splines, random effects, seemingly unrelated regression, structured additive regression...|$|R
