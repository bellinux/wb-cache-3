However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E

Victoria's Secret released a statement of apology shortly after, saying that they will <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> from future advertisements and the broadcast. Kloss apologized on her Twitter account for the outfit and expressed her support for the outfit's removal in the broadcast.|$|E

Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.|$|E

5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of oxygen gas on Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E

Sales increased in January 2006 when it was chosen for Oprah's Book Club. Republished with a new translation by Marion Wiesel, Wiesel's wife, and a new preface by Wiesel, it sat at no. 1 in The New York Times bestseller list for paperback non-fiction for 18 months from 13 February 2006, until the newspaper decided to <b>remove</b> <b>it.</b> It became the club's third bestseller to date, with over two million sales of the Book Club edition by May 2011.|$|E
5|$|During {{its history}} {{spanning}} seven centuries, the castle {{was owned by}} a succession of seven families. One of the owners, the count Lafaurie of Monbadon, peer of France, was a catalyst {{to the construction of}} the Eiffel bridge. In March 1891, the Quancard brothers Jean and Eugène bought the property for 110 000 francs, and the Quancard family remains the last owners. The purchase came after a severe phylloxera outbreak, causing the death of over half of French vineyards, devalued the property. The land area was covered mostly with rock until the Quancard brothers used explosives to <b>remove</b> <b>it,</b> and large amounts of clay-limestone soil, known to be beneficial for the wine produce, was brought to replace it.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, in 1798, a M.Tessier of Versailles {{hospital}} contacted Percy {{to notify}} {{him that a}} patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could {{find some way to}} <b>remove</b> <b>it.</b> Percy, however, recognised him as suffering from advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to suffer from continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying shortly afterwards.|$|E

Meredith self-destructive behavior increases when she saves a patient with a bomb in their chest by impulsively inserting her hand to hold it until the bomb squad can <b>remove</b> <b>it.</b> Mereidth has a series of one-night stands, including one with George, who {{is in love with}} her.

Meredith swears off her behavior, agrees to be friends only with Shepherd, and embarks on a relationship with veterinarian Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{immediately}} {{sued the}} British Government for false imprisonment, {{and to avoid}} any liability the government prepared the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923 which would indemnify them against any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers. The Labour Party whittled it down when it was being prepared {{so that it would}} only limit compensation rather than <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> entirely. A tribunal was set up under Lord Atkin to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid £43,000. Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of sedition. He was released in 1924.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{method of}} prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.|$|E

5|$|Planet Terror makes {{heavy use}} of digital effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> during post-production.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} technique employed was fresco, {{in which}} the paint is applied to damp plaster. Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{one of the most}} competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, {{at the time that the}} latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, the plaster, , began to grow mold because it was too wet. Michelangelo had to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> and start again. He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E
5|$|Weyland is {{the billionaire}} founder and CEO of Weyland Corp. Lindelof {{described}} him as having a massive ego and suffering from a god complex. Applying the necessary prosthetics and make-up to transform Pearce into the aging Weyland took five hours, and an hour to <b>remove</b> <b>it.</b> Pearce observed elderly individuals to gain insight into the movement for his character, as he found replicating the impeded physical movement {{the most difficult part}} of the role. Max von Sydow was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it possible for him to portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and a younger man who appeared in an earlier script draft.|$|E

He broke three ribs and an iron bar attached to the post became so lodged in his backbone that it took two men to <b>remove</b> <b>it.</b> Wizard sired three winners of eleven races.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, {{computer}} store owner, {{was killed}} in 1985 by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed {{in the parking lot}} of his store. A similar attack against a computer store occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 20, 1987. The bomb, which was disguised as a piece of lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> from the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body. Kaczynski's brother, David—who would play a vital role in Kaczynski's capture by alerting federal authorities to the prospect of his brother's involvement in the Unabomber cases—sought out and became friends with Wright after Kaczynski was detained in 1996. David Kaczynski and Wright have remained friends and occasionally speak together publicly about their relationship.|$|E
