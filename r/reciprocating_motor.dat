INTRODUCTIOB The present paper describes part of a research pro-gram which was requested by the National Advisory Commit-tee for Aeronautics to obtain infornation on the fatigue strength of fabricated structural elements of aircraft. The need for such information has bpcome increasingly ap-parent with the increased importance of vibration in nod-em high-speed and hfgh-performance airplanes. The strength of an airplane under steady flight loads can be computed weth considerable accuracy from the flight loads and the strongth of the airplane as detornined by stattc loading on the ground.

50|$|In {{order to}} combat {{negative}} publicity {{related to the}} environmental impacts of fossil fuels, including fracking, the industry is embracing solar powered pumping systems. Many oil and gas wells require the accurate injection (metering) of various chemicals under pressure to sustain their operation and to improve extraction rates. Historically, these chemical injection pumps (CIP) have been driven by gas <b>reciprocating</b> <b>motors</b> utilizing the pressure of the well's gas and exhausting the raw gas into the atmosphere. Solar powered electrical pumps (solar CIP) can reduce these greenhouse gas emissions. Solar arrays (photovoltaic cells) not only provide a sustainable power source for the CIPs but can also provide an electric source to run remote SCADA type diagnostics with remote control and satellite/cell communications from very remote locations to a desktop or notebook monitoring computer.|$|R
50|$|A <b>reciprocating</b> {{electric}} <b>motor</b> uses an alternating {{magnetic field}} {{to move its}} armature back and forth, rather than circularly as in a conventional electric motor. A single field coil may be placed {{at one end of}} the armature's possible movement, or a field coil may be used at each end.|$|R
50|$|This is an {{extremely}} simple motor, such that demonstration models may be easily constructed for teaching purposes. As a practical motor it has several disadvantages. Magnetic field strength drops off rapidly with increasing distance. In the <b>reciprocating</b> electric <b>motor</b> the distance between armature and field coil must necessarily increase considerably over its minimum value; this reduces the motor's output power and starting force. Vibration is also an issue.|$|R

A pair of annularly wound coils having axial lengths which differ from the axial lengths of the permanent magnets are serially coupled together in mutual opposition and positioned with an outer cylindrical core in axial symmetry about the armature assembly. One embodiment includes a second pair of annularly wound coils serially coupled together in mutual opposition and an inner cylindrical core positioned in axial symmetry inside the armature radially opposite to the first pair of coils. Application of a potential difference across a serial connection of the two pairs of coils creates a current flow perpendicular to the magnetic field created by the armature magnets, thereby causing limited linear displacement of the magnets relative to the coils...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The water {{hydraulic}} reciprocating {{plunger pump}} driven by linear motor is suitable to deep sea application with high efficiency and variable control. Aiming {{to study the}} principle structure and working characteristics of the pump, two patterns of valve and piston distribution were designed. And the control method and the performance were analyzed by simulation based on the AMESim model. The {{results show that the}} pressure and flow pulsation of piston type pump are much smaller than the valve type, even though the piston type is large in scale and works at low flow rate. Compared with a valve distribution tri-linear-motor reciprocating plunger pump(VDTLMP), as the flow rate of the piston distribution double linear <b>motor</b> <b>reciprocating</b> plunger pump(PDDLMP) is decreased from 36. 7 L/min to 21. 2 L/min theoretically, the pressure pulsation amplitude is decreased from 46 % to 2 %, and the flow pulsation rate is also decreased from 0. 266 to 0. 007. These results contribute to the research on deep-sea water hydraulic power pack and direct drive pump with high efficiency and energy conservation...|$|R
40|$|It {{is clear}} that percussive drills are very {{promising}} since they can increase the rate of penetration in hard rock formations. Any small improvements on the percussive drills {{can make a big}} contribution to lowering the drilling costs since drilling a well for the oil & gas industry is very costly. This thesis presents a percussive drilling system mainly driven by a tubular reciprocating translational motion permanent magnet synchronous motor (RTPMSM), which efficiently converts electric energy to kinetic energy for crushing the hard rock since there is no mechanical media. The thesis starts from state-of-the-art of percussive drilling techniques, <b>reciprocating</b> translational motion <b>motors,</b> and self-sensing control of electric motors and its implementation issues. The following chapters present modeling the hard rock, modeling the drill, the design issues of the drill, the RTPMSM and its control. A single-phase RTPMSM prototype is tested for the hard rock drilling. The presented variable voltage variable frequency control is also validated on it. The space vector control and self-sensing control are also explored on a three-phase RTPMSM prototype. The results show that the percussive drill can be implemented to the hard rock drilling applications.

40|$|Machinery {{condition}} monitoring techniques {{are carried out}} based on {{the knowledge of the}} characteristics of signals obtained from a machine or plant. These signals are often non stationary signals whose frequency changes over time due to the time-varying natures of machine operations and fault effects. Conventional signal processing techniques are developed based on stationary signals and cannot reveal the time information of the frequency changes. The work undertaken in this research presents a generic study of non-stationary signal processing for machinery {{condition monitoring}}. Starting with examining the concept of non-stationary signals, it can be identified that most condition monitoring signals fall into two main categories: weak non-stationary signals, such as motor electrical current signal and strong non-stationary signal such as machinery vibration and acoustic signals. For developing techniques to process these two typical non-stationary signals, two experiments were carried out to obtain these them. Firstly, an induction motor drive system was set up based on a two-stage <b>reciprocating</b> compressor; the <b>motor</b> current signals were then acquired for compressor fault detection and diagnosis. Secondly, a set of vibration and acoustic measurement instrumentation was set up based on a diesel engine test system. The engine vibration and acoustic signals were collected for further analysis for engine combustion condition monitoring. The engine was fuelled by different biofuels during data collection allowing a new and efficient method of verifying different sustainable fuels to be developed based non intrusive vibro-acoustic measurements in conjunction with non-stationary signal analysis methods. A time domain based method, dynamic time warping, was validated and improved for analysing the motor current signal to detect and classify the common faults of reciprocating compressors. Based on the limitations of classical dynamic time warping, a phase estimation and compensation approach is developed to reduce the singularity effect of classical dynamic time warping in order to obtain accurate diagnostic results. A sliding window was also designed to improve computing efficiency. The diagnostic results show that the accuracy and reliability of detection and classification by the proposed dynamic time warping method is higher than that from Fourier transform spectrum and envelope analysis. In addition, the fault detection and classification is based on a root mean square (RMS) linear classifier processes combined with the proposed dynamic time warping method, and is based entirely on time domain analysis which is easier to apply to a real-time condition monitoring system. It was proved that the proposed dynamic time warping is a novel and efficient method for cyclostationary/weak non-stationary analysis. Various non-stationary signal processing techniques based on time-frequency domain analysis, including Wigner-Ville distribution, fractional Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform, are investigated to process the engine vibration and the acoustic signals for the condition monitoring of engine combustion. A sound pressure level (SPL) indicator is designed based on the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) analysis and the fractional Fourier transform filtering of the engine vibro-acoustic signals. The processing results demonstrate that the combustion induced acoustics can be extracted for the diagnostics of engine combustion process and for condition monitoring. A root mean square (RMS) linear classifier is developed based on the engine acoustic analysis by time synchronous average and continuous wavelet transform, the classification demonstrates that the root mean square (RMS) values of the continuous wavelet transform coefficients can be used to evaluate the fuel for engine combustion and indicate the engine operating conditions. The analysis results verify that the engine vibro-acoustics have the potential to be used to diagnose the engine combustion process and to monitor the engine operating conditions with the application of suitable non-stationary signal processing techniques. This can be used instead of the cylinder pressure data which is both intrusive and costly to obtain. Finally, the conclusions and achievements are given based on the entirety of this research work, and suggestions are presented for further research...|$|R
