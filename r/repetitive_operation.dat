40|$|In {{iterative}} {{learning control}} (ILC), a common {{assumption is that}} the initial states in each <b>repetitive</b> <b>operation</b> should be inside a given ball centered at the desired initial states which may be unknown. This assumption {{is critical to the}} stability analysis, {{and the size of the}} ball will directly affect the final output trajectory tracking errors. In this paper, this assumption is removed by using an initial state learning scheme together with the traditional D-type ILC updating law. Both linear and nonlinear time-varying uncertain systems are investigated. Uniform bounds for the final tracking errors are obtained and these bounds are only dependent on the system uncertainties and disturbances, yet independent of the initial errors. Furthermore, the desired initial states can be identified through learning iterations.

We parallelize part of the algorithm to speed up processing. Several downscaled pyramid images of the eye candidate region are generated in parallel using the input face image. We can detect {{the left and the right}} eye simultaneously using these downscaled images.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a data-driven approach to diagnostics of systems that {{operate in a}} repetitive manner. Considering that data batches collected from a <b>repetitive</b> <b>operation</b> will be similar unless {{in the presence of}} an abnormality, a condition change is inferred by comparing the monitored data against an available nominal batch. The method proposed considers the comparison of data in the distribution domain, which reveals information of the data amplitude. This is achieved with the use of kernel density estimates and the Kullback–Leibler distance. To decrease sensitivity to disturbances while increasing sensitivity to faults, the use of a weighting vector is suggested which is chosen based on a labeled dataset. The framework is simple to implement and can be used without process interruption, in a batch manner. The approach is demonstrated with successful experimental and simulation applications to wear diagnostics in an industrial robot gearbox and for diagnostics of gear faults in a rotating machine...|$|E
