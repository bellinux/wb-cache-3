40|$|A {{socio-economic}} {{study was}} carried out in northern Ghana to verify the importance of rice parboiling to poverty alleviation. Consumer acceptability and sensory evaluation carried out showed that there was a high correlation between consumer acceptability and sensory attributes developed by a trained panel for both raw and cooked rice. An improved prototype rice parboiling vessel was designed and constructed and this vessel more than doubled the quantity of paddy usually parboiled per batch in northern Ghana. It also reduced fuel and water usage by 50 % and 30 % respectively. Ghanaian consumers preferred imported rice to locally produced parboiled rice. They also preferred parboiled rice that had a clean, translucent and uniform appearance. Percent starch damage, an important quality indicator increased with parboiling intensity. On intense laboratory parboiling, milling yield increased by 7 % over the <b>raw</b> <b>milled</b> sample. Broken grains increased on mild parboiling and only began to decrease when paddy was soaked at 90 °C and steamed for at least 8 minutes. The most intensely parboiled sample had a broken level of 5. 06 %. Water absorption index increased with parboiling intensity. Thiamine content increased linearly with parboiling. Riboflavin however peaked with paddy soaked at 70 °C and steamed for 12 minutes and decreased with further intensification of parboiling. X-ray diffraction pattern of the <b>raw</b> <b>milled</b> sample was the A-type. While the severest laboratory parboiled sample had an A-type pattern, the commercially parboiled sample had a typical V-pattern. The characteristic aroma of Ghanaian parboiled rice is influenced mainly by 2 -decena, 2 -heptenal and acetic acid. Raman and solid-state 13 C CP-MAS NMR spectra were used in investigating changes in conformation of the protein and starch components due to parboiling. Artisanal parboiling was just as effective as commercial parboiling in the denaturisation of rice protein. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

TiB 2 powders were mechanically milled at a rotation speed of 1000 rpm for short time in Ar atmosphere, using a planetary ball mill. To produce Cu-xTiB 2 composites (x = 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 wt. %), the <b>raw</b> and <b>milled</b> TiB 2 powders were mixed with Cu powders {{by means of}} a turbular mixer, respectively. Sintering of mixed powders was carried out in a SPS facility under vacuum. High-energy ball-milling resulted in refinement of TiB 2 particles. XRD patterns of milled TiB 2 powders indicated broader TiB 2 peaks with decreased intensities. After sintering at 950 for 5 min using the <b>raw</b> and <b>milled</b> TiB 2 mixture powders, the sintered density decreased with increasing TiB 2 content regardless of milling of TiB 2. In the case of raw TiB 2, hardness rapidly increased from 4 to 44 HRB with increasing TiB 2 content. The electrical conductivity changed from 95. 5 to 80. 7 %IACS. For mixtures of Cu powders with milled TiB 2 powders, hardness increased from 38 to 67 HRB as TiB 2 content increased, while the electrical conductivity varied from 88 % to 51 % IACS.

This study aimed to assess exposure to crystalline silica and cement dust among workers of a cement industry in Saveh city, Iran.. Material and Method: In this cross-sectional study, 62 samples of respirable dust were collected from breathing zone of the workers in different sections of factory. Determination of {{respirable fraction}} of cement dust concentrations carried out using gravimetric method according to the NIOSH method no. 0600. Visible absorption spectrophotometry was used according to the NIOSH method no. 7601 to determine crystalline silica content of respirable dust samples.. Result: The highest exposure concentrations to respirable fraction of cement dust was observed in the <b>Raw</b> <b>Mill</b> and Cement Mill, and the lowest exposure in Administrative Department and Kiln the range of workers exposure in the production sites were 1. 77 to 18. 89 mg/m 3. The range of workers exposure to the crystalline silica in the production sites was 0. 011 to 0. 104 mg/m 3. The highest and lowest mean of exposures was observed in the <b>raw</b> <b>Mill</b> and cement mill respectively. Occupational exposure to the crystalline silica in 57 % of site samples exceeded adjusted TLV recommended by NIOSH and Iranian of Occupational Health Technical Committee (0. 05 mg/m 3). The average of free SiO 2 fraction in whole site samples was 1. 17 % varying from 0. 49 % in the cement Mill to 1. 53 % and 1. 7 % in crusher and Kiln sections, respectively. Conclusion: Levels of exposure to cement respirable dust in all productive sections were significantly higher than the adjusted TLV. However, in administrative and control departments it was lower than the TLV level. Regarding crystalline silica, levels of exposure only in “Raw mill” and “kiln” were significantly higher than the adjusted TLV.

The South African cement industry is responsible for 5 % of the electrical consumption for the mining and industrial sector.

One hundred and twenty personal ‘total ’ dust samples were collected from 80 randomly selected workers from eight a priori occupational groups (OGs) based on work areas using a 37 mmMillipore sampler. The between-group, within-group and within-worker variances were determined to assess the con-trast in exposure level between the OGs and to estimate the attenuation and standard error of the theoretical exposure–response slope. Using mixed-effect model estimates, the probability of overexposure relative to the occupational exposure limit (OEL) was assessed for each OG. The geometric means of total dust exposure were higher in the cranes (38. 64 mg m 3), packing (21. 30 mg m 3) and crusher (13. 48 mg m 3) than in the cement mill (3. 23 mg m 3), kiln (2. 87 mg m 3), <b>raw</b> <b>mill</b> (1. 85 mg m 3), maintenance (1. 16 mg m 3) and administration (0. 29 mg m 3).
