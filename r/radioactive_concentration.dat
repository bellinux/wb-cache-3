40|$|The <b>radioactive</b> <b>concentrations</b> of (166 m) Ho, (134) Cs and (133) Ba {{solutions}} {{have been}} standardised using a 4 πβ- 4 πγ coincidence counting system we have recently set up. The detection in the beta channel {{is performed using}} various geometries of a UPS- 89 plastic scintillator optically coupled to a selected low-noise 1 in. diameter photomultiplier tube. The light-tight thin capsule that encloses this beta detector is housed within the well of a 5 in. × 5 in. NaI(Tl) monocrystal detector. The beta detection efficiency can be varied either by optical filtering or electronic discrimination when the electrons loose all their energy in the plastic scintillator. This 4 πβ- 4 πγ coincidence system improves on our 4 πβ(PC) -γ system in that its sample preparation is less labour intensive, it yields larger beta- and gamma-counting efficiencies thus enabling the standardisation of low activity sources with good statistics in reasonable time, and it makes standardising short-lived radionuclides easier. The resulting <b>radioactive</b> <b>concentrations</b> of (166 m) Ho, (134) Cs and (133) Ba are found to agree with those measured with other primary measurement methods thus validating our 4 πβ- 4 πγ coincidence counting system...|$|R
5000|$|If {{good health}} physics {{controls}} are maintained {{in a laboratory}} where radionuclides are used, {{it is unlikely that}} the overall radiation dose received by workers will be of much significance. Nevertheless the effects of low doses are mostly unknown so many regulations exist to avoid unnecessary risks, such as skin or internal exposure. Due to the low penetration power and many variables involved it is hard to convert a <b>radioactive</b> <b>concentration</b> to a dose.1 μCi of P-32 on a square centimetre of skin (through a dead layer of a thickness of 70 μm) gives 7961 rads (79.61 grays) per hour [...] Similarly a mammogram gives an exposure of 300 mrem (3 mSv) on a larger volume (in the US, the average annual dose is 620 mrem or 6.2 mSv [...] ).|$|E

In this study, the <b>radioactive</b> <b>concentrations</b> of 210 Pb and 40 K in a cigarette sample were first measured. The transfer factors of the nuclides from tobacco into smoke and solution (saliva and/or alcohol) were then examined. Moreover, the radiation doses from smoke inhalation were also evaluated. The <b>radioactive</b> <b>concentrations</b> of 210 Pb and 40 K in the cigarette tobacco were 0. 01 and 0. 3 Bq/cigarette. Since this 210 Pb activity and the 210 Po activity previously reported for the same sample were comparable, it can be concluded that there was a radioactive equilibrium between the 2 nuclides. The observed transfer factor of 210 Pb (12 %) into smoke was almost {{the same as that of}} 40 K (15 %), whereas the reported value for 210 Po (60 %) was significantly higher. The radiation doses due to inhalation of cigarette smoke varied from organ to organ, depending on the organotropic properties of the nuclide. For example, the kidneys, respiratory tract, and spleen showed relatively high doses from 210 Pb and 210 Po. The leaching rates indicated an inconsistent tendency related to solution types. This result could suggest that alcohol drinking, which is common in smokers, does not especially enhance the leaching characteristics...|$|R

Although the annual intake of 232 Th estimated using these values did not exceed the annual limit intake (ALI, 1. 6 × 102 Bq), we recommend reducing 232 Th exposure by substituting thoriated electrodes with a thorium-free electrodes, setting up local ventilation systems, and by using respiratory protective equipment.
