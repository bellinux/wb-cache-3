50|$|Two-wheel tractor {{or walking}} tractor motoculteur Einachsschlepper oder Bodenfräse are generic terms {{understood}} in the USA and in parts of Europe to represent a single-axle tractor, which is a tractor with one axle, self-powered and self-propelled, which can pull and power various farm implements such as a trailer, cultivator or harrow, a plough, or various seeders and harvesters. The operator usually walks behind it or rides the implement being towed. Similar terms are mistakenly applied to the household <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller</b> or power tiller; although these may be wheeled and/or self-propelled, they are not tailored for towing implements. A two-wheeled tractor specializes in pulling any of numerous types of implements, whereas rotary tillers specialize in soil tillage with their dedicated digging tools. This article concerns two-wheeled tractors as distinguished from such tillers.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also a}} fair bit of {{confusion}} in nomenclature regarding machines of similar size/configuration, that operate a single implement (such as power tillers; rear-tine tillers; rotary hoes; rotary ploughs; rotary tillers; Rotavators; etc.) The important distinction between a two-wheel tractor and any of these machines is that the two-wheel tractor is a single-axle, walk-behind machine designed to operate multiple interchangeable implements, where machines in the categories above typically only operate one implement (such as a tiller), which implement is often integral to the machine (rather than being removable). [...] "Power tiller" [...] {{can be understood as}} a garden tiller/rototiller of the small (...) petrol/gasoline/electric powered, hobby gardener variety; they are often sold as a <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller,</b> though the technical agricultural use of that term refers solely to an attachment to a larger tractor. Alternatively, the terms [...] "power tiller" [...] or [...] "rotary tiller" [...] are always understood in Asia and elsewhere to be rubber- or iron-wheeled, self-propelled machines of [...] and usually powered by heavy-duty single-cylinder diesel engines (many Asian countries historically have had a high luxury tax on petrol/gasoline). Adding to the nomenclature confusion, agricultural engineers like to classify them as single-axle tractors. For clarity, the rest of this article refers to the self-propelled, single-axle, multi-attachment tractive machines as two-wheel tractors.|$|E
50|$|The Latin words hortus (garden plant) and cultura (culture) {{together}} form horticulture, classically {{defined as}} the culture or growing of garden plants. Horticulture is also sometimes defined simply as “agriculture minus the plough.” Instead of the plough, horticulture makes use of human labour and gardener’s hand tools, although some small machine tools like <b>rotary</b> <b>tillers</b> are commonly employed now.|$|R

5000|$|In 1930, {{automobile}} manufacturer Cadwallader Washburn [...] "Carl" [...] Kelsey {{was introduced}} to the rototiller by H.B. Hiller, a German immigrant who once worked for Siemens' [...] "boden frasen" [...] division. Kelsey opened a sales office using the name Rototiller Co. on Broadway in New York City. He then started importing Siemens boden frasen from Germany. In 1932, Kelsey incorporated using the new company name Rototiller, Inc. and the [...] "Rototiller" [...] trademark (Kelsey didn't coin the name 'Rototiller' it was already being used in Europe). The operation was moved to Long Island City, NY. and SIMAR from Switzerland was added to the line. Carl Kelsey designed, patented and made several improvements to the SIMAR and Siemens machines because of the different American soils versus the European soil that had been farmed for many more centuries. One major improvement was a shock absorber to reduce tine spring return bounce. In 1934 Kelsey and Rototiller, Inc. introduced its first <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller</b> of its own design, the Model AA All-American. And in 1937 Rototiller, Inc. moved from its Long Island City facility to 102nd Street and 9th Avenue in Troy, New York. In 1945 after selling the larger B-series Rototillers and trademark to Graham-Paige Motors, Rototiller, Inc. converted to full-time production of various models of small horsepower home garden size rototillers.|$|E
5000|$|The unique long-handled [...] "Thai" [...] type two-wheel tractor was {{developed}} in the late 1950s by M.R. Debriddhi Devakul (M.R. stands for Mom Rajawong, meaning that his great-grandfather was the King of Thailand, and that he could be properly addressed as [...] "Prince"), head of the Engineering Division of the Thai Rice Department, of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. As the early 2WTs did not have steering clutches, longer handles were provided for turning and controlling the tractor more easily in fields. Initially the engines were taken from kerosene engine powered irrigation pumps, but as the popularity of the tractor became obvious (known as the [...] "Iron Buffalo"), three Japanese firms set up diesel engine factories in Thailand with agreements to progressively increase local content. Later, steering clutches were provided on many companies' models. The tractor gear box and chassis are made by many local industries (Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Agri-Mechanics Co Ltd., Ayutthaya Tractor Factory, Cosmonoki Thai International Co. Ltd., C.R. Tractor Co Ltd, Inter Kankaset Co. Ltd, Jakpetch Tractor Co. Ltd., Jor Charoenchai Tractor, Kor Rungruang, Muileng Industry Ltd., Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Siam Kubota Industry Co. Ltd., etc.). Initially, factories copied from one another, and competing for sales {{to the point that the}} tractor's chassis without engine has become very inexpensive, about one third to one half the cost of the engine. The [...] "Thai tractor" [...] eventually evolved into a more general standard [...] "NC" [...] type models with three gears forward, one reverse, and steering clutches. Attachments that are available are moldboard and disc plows, spiked tooth harrows, trailed-type (non-powered) rotary puddlers (lateral drums with protruding paddles), various types of levelers and simple trailers (usually without brakes or lights). Recently (2010), a new NC Plus model offered by Siam Kubota comes with a [...] (PTO) that can drive a <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller</b> and other attachments. Additionally many farmers use V-belts to connect the stationary tractor engine to power centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps, rice threshers, maize shellers etc. Recently inexpensive Chinese-made NC models have come on the international market but attempts by Siam Kubota and others to keep them out of Thailand, Cambodia and elsewhere due to claims of copyright infringement. Through the 1980s and 1990s, more than 50,000 tractors were reportedly being produced and sold each year and by 2006 more than 70,000 were being produced and even more imported so that estimates of 2WT population is between 1.7 - 2.0 million 2WTs in Thailand.|$|E
