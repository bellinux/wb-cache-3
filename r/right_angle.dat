5|$|Silver birch {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> to the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E
5|$|This star lies at a vertex of {{a widely}} spaced {{asterism}} called the Summer Triangle, {{which consists of}} Vega plus the two first-magnitude stars Altair, in Aquila, and Deneb in Cygnus. This formation is the approximate shape of a right triangle, with Vega located at its <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> The Summer Triangle is recognizable in the northern skies for there are few other bright stars in its vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in ants, the hind-wings and fore-wings are {{of equal}} length. Most of the time, the alates are poor flyers; their {{technique}} is to launch {{themselves in the}} air and fly in a random direction. Studies show that in comparison to larger termites, smaller termites cannot fly long distances. When a termite is in flight, its wings remain at a <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> and when the termite is at rest, its wings remain parallel to the body.|$|E

5|$|Ptolemy, {{possibly}} {{drawing on}} earlier {{sources of information}} {{as well as more}} contemporary accounts from the Agricolan invasion, identified 18 tribes in Scotland in his Geography, but many of the names are obscure. His information becomes much less reliable in the north and west, suggesting early Roman knowledge of these area was confined to observations from the sea. Famously, his coördinates place most of Scotland north of Hadrian's Wall bent at a <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> stretching due eastward from the rest of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark can be most {{reliably}} {{distinguished from}} the bull shark {{by the number of}} precaudal (before the caudal fin) vertebrae (89–95 in C. amboinensis versus 101–123 in C. leucas). Externally, it has a greater size difference between its dorsal fins (first-to-second height ratio >3.1:1 versus ≤3.1:1 in C. leucas) and the notch in its anal fin margin forms an acute angle (versus a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> in C. leucas). This species also usually has fewer tooth rows in the lower jaw (10–12 on each side versus 12–13 in C. leucas).|$|E
5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> to the wind shear direction.|$|E

5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E
5|$|Most {{art historians}} {{believe that there}} are a number of {{indicators}} that the panel was the left-hand wing of a dismantled diptych. The frame contains clasps, implying it was once hinged to a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a right-hand wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of the panel, facing right.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros, made short {{work of the}} unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs {{managed to}} get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before {{dropping}} their torpedoes—close {{enough to be able}} to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to make sharp evasive maneuvers—but all of their torpedoes either missed or failed to explode. Remarkably, senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers never questioned why half a dozen torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no results. The abysmal performance of American torpedoes in the early months of the war became a scandal. Torpedo after torpedo either missed by running directly under the target, prematurely exploded, or struck targets with textbook <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> hits (sometimes with an audible clang) and failed to explode.|$|E

5|$|The route {{began at}} a {{turnaround}} {{next to the}} Old Point Loma Lighthouse in the Cabrillo National Monument, near {{the southern tip of}} Point Loma. Heading north along the crest of the Point Loma peninsula, it passed through Fort Rosecrans Military Reservation and Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery before exiting the former through a gate and entering the Wooded Area neighborhood of Point Loma as Catalina Boulevard. SR209 passed through this residential neighborhood and provided access to Point Loma Nazarene University. The SR209 designation then made a right turn onto Cañon Street, curved to the southeast, and went downhill to the bayside location of the old La Playa Trail. At the intersection with Rosecrans Street, the designation made a turn to the northeast at a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> onto Rosecrans.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
50|$|A double prism is {{a device}} to measure <b>right</b> <b>angles,</b> {{consisting}} of two five sided prisms stacked {{on top of each}} other and a plumb-bob. It is used to stake out <b>right</b> <b>angles,</b> for example on a construction site.|$|R
50|$|A {{transverse}} {{valley is}} a valley which cuts at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> across a ridge or, in mountainous terrain a valley that generally runs at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> {{to the line}} of the main mountain chain or crest.

5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the sight head to the <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E
5|$|The large upper incisors are orthodont, {{with their}} cutting edge {{at about a}} <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> to the upper molars, and heavily {{pigmented}} with orange. Those of T.hylophilus are narrower, less procumbent, and less pigmented. The orthodont upper incisors suffice to distinguish T.ucucha from all {{other members of the}} genus but T.australis and T.daphne, which have much shorter and narrower incisors. The left and right molar rows are parallel. The molars are more hypsodont (high-crowned) than in other Thomasomys. The anterocone, the cusp {{at the front of the}} first upper molar, is divided into distinct cuspules at the lingual (inner) and labial (outer) sides by an anteromedian flexus. The accessory ridges on the upper molars, the anterolophs and mesolophs, are less well-developed than in T.hylophilus. The third upper molar is reduced relative to the second, much more so than in T.hylophilus. The lower molars are generally similar to the uppers, but the anteroconid (the equivalent of the anterocone on the first lower molar) is often undivided and the third molar is unreduced.|$|E

5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E
5|$|Indraloris molars {{are short}} and {{organized}} in two main lophs (lobes). They differ from Sivaladapis teeth in being shorter and broader, with a shorter talonid {{and a smaller}} hypoconulid. In Indraloris himalayensis lower molars, there are four main cusps (protoconid and metaconid in the trigonid, hypoconid and entoconid in the talonid), which give the crown a rectangular aspect, although the labial cusps (protoconid and hypoconid) are placed somewhat anterior to their lingual counterparts. In I.kamlialensis, the entoconid is distinct from the hypoconulid, which is large, but the tooth is otherwise similar. The cusps are high relative to those of extant lorises and approximately equal in height. The cristid obliqua, a crest, descends from the hypoconid to a point on the lingual side of the protoconid. On the hypoconid, this crest forms a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> with the posterolophid, which runs towards the hypoconulid in the back lingual corner of the tooth. Between the metaconid and entoconid, the talonid basin is open. In I.himalayensis at least (the structure is damaged in the only known lower molar of I.kamlialensis) there is a well-developed hollow in the trigonid {{in front of the}} protoconid and metaconid. There is a labial cingulum between the protoconid and hypoconid. YGSP 32152 is so worn that little of its structure remains visible. It shows a short trigonid and a distinct entoconid. A small hypoconulid, close to the entoconid, is suggested by an enamel swelling. This specimen is fragmentary enough that it could also represent a catarrhine primate or a carnivoran.|$|E
5|$|The single known tooth, a worn left upper molar {{known as}} T Li 175, is large for a treeshrew, with {{a length of}} 3.57mm and width of 4.79mm. Although Mein and Ginsburg {{described}} it a second upper molar (M2), Ni and Qiu argued in 2012 {{that it is more}} likely a first upper molar (M1). It is dilambdodont (with a W-shaped chewing surface) and the labial surface (the side of the cheeks) is concave and bears a cingular crest. A well-developed small cusp, a mesostyle, is present on the labial side. The presence of the mesostyle distinguishes the animal from Ptilocercus, {{the only member of the}} treeshrew family Ptilocercidae. The lingual (tongue) side is narrow. A large cusp, the protocone, is on the front lingual corner. Two crests descend from it; one reaches the paracone on the front labial side and another approaches the metacone to the back of the tooth. A smaller cusp, a hypocone, is on the back lingual corner. This feature distinguishes T.miocenica both from the treeshrew genera Dendrogale, Prodendrogale, and Palaeotupaia, which lack the cusp entirely, and from Anathana and Urogale, which have a large hypocone. In T.miocenica the back and lingual sides of the hypocone are straight and form a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> with each other. The tooth most closely resembles Tupaia species with a simple mesostyle, such as the common treeshrew (Tupaia glis). However, this species is smaller and unlike in T. miocenica, the hypocone is not isolated from the protocone by a narrow valley.|$|E
