40|$|In animal cells, {{cytokinesis}} occurs by constriction of an actomyosin <b>ring.</b> In <b>fission</b> yeast cells, <b>ring</b> constriction is {{triggered by}} the septum initiation network (SIN), an SPB-associated GTPase-regulated kinase cascade that coordinates exit from mitosis with cytokinesis. We have identified a novel protein, Etd 1 p, required to trigger actomyosin <b>ring</b> constriction in <b>fission</b> yeasts. This protein is localised at the cell tips during interphase. In mitosis, it relocates to the medial cortex region and, coincident with cytokinesis, it assembles into the actomyosin ring by association to Cdc 15 p. Relocation of Etd 1 p from the plasma membrane to the medial ring is triggered by SIN signalling and, reciprocally, relocation of the Sid 2 p-Mob 1 p kinase complex from the SPB to the division site, a late step in {{the execution of the}} SIN, requires Etd 1 p. These results suggest that Etd 1 p coordinates the mitotic activation of SIN with the initiation of actomyosin ring constriction. Etd 1 p peaks during cytokinesis and is degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent 26 S-proteasome pathway at the end of septation, providing a mechanism to couple inactivation of SIN to completion of cytokinesis. © 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.

40|$|International audienceIn {{animal and}} yeast cells, the mitotic spindle is aligned perpendicularly to {{the axis of}} cell division. This ensures that sister chromatids are {{separated}} to {{opposite sides of the}} cytokinetic actomyosin <b>ring.</b> In <b>fission</b> yeast, spindle rotation is dependent upon the interaction of astral microtubules with the cortical actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we show that addition of Latrunculin A, which prevents spindle rotation, delays the separation of sister chromatids and anaphase promoting complex-mediated destruction of spindle-associated Securin and Cyclin B. Moreover, we find that whereas sister kinetochore pairs normally congress to the spindle midzone before anaphase onset, this congression is disrupted when astral microtubule contact with the actin cytoskeleton is disturbed. By analyzing the timing of kinetochore separation, we find that this anaphase delay requires the Bub 3, Mad 3, and Bub 1 but not the Mad 1 or Mad 2 spindle assembly checkpoint proteins. In agreement with this, we find that Bub 1 remains associated with kinetochores when spindles are mispositioned. These data indicate that, in fission yeast, astral microtubule contact with the medial cell cortex is monitored by a subset of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins. We propose that this checkpoint ensures spindles are properly oriented before anaphase takes place...|$|R
40|$|SummaryA {{paradigm}} of cytokinesis in animal cells {{is that the}} actomyosin contractile ring provides the primary force to divide the cell [1]. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, cytokinesis also involves a conserved cytokinetic ring, which has been generally assumed to provide the force for cleavage [2 – 4] (see also [5]). However, in contrast to animal cells, cytokinesis in yeast cells also requires the assembly of a cell wall septum [6], which grows centripetally inward as the <b>ring</b> closes. <b>Fission</b> yeast, like other walled cells, also possess high (MPa) turgor pressure [7 – 9]. Here, we show that turgor pressure {{is an important factor}} in the mechanics of cytokinesis. Decreasing effective turgor pressure leads to an increase in cleavage rate, suggesting that the inward force generated by the division apparatus opposes turgor pressure. The contractile ring, which is predicted to provide only a tiny fraction of the mechanical stress required to overcome turgor, is largely dispensable for ingression; once septation has started, cleavage can continue in the absence of the contractile ring. Scaling arguments and modeling suggest that the large forces for cytokinesis are not produced by the contractile ring but are driven by the assembly of cell wall polymers in the growing septum...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundCytokinesis in many eukaryotes {{involves}} {{the function of}} an actomyosin-based contractile <b>ring.</b> In <b>fission</b> yeast, actomyosin <b>ring</b> maturation and stability require a conserved signaling pathway termed the SIN (septation initiation network). The SIN consists of a GTPase (Spg 1 p) and three protein kinases, all of which localize to the mitotic spindle pole bodies (SPBs). Two of the SIN kinases, Cdc 7 p and Sid 1 p, localize asymmetrically to the newly duplicated SPB in late anaphase. How this asymmetry is achieved is not understood, although {{it is known that}} their symmetric localization impairs cytokinesis. ResultsHere we characterize a new Forkhead-domain-associated protein, Csc 1 p, and identify SIN-inhibitory PP 2 A complex (SIP), which is crucial for the establishment of SIN asymmetry. Csc 1 p localizes to both SPBs early in mitosis, is lost from the SPB that accumulates Cdc 7 p, and instead accumulates at the SPB lacking Cdc 7 p. Csc 1 p is required for the dephosphorylation of the SIN scaffolding protein Cdc 11 p and is thereby required for the recruitment of Byr 4 p, a component of the GTPase-activating subunit for Spg 1 p, to the SPB. ConclusionsBecause Cdc 7 p does not bind to GDP-Spg 1 p, we propose that the SIP-mediated Cdc 11 p dephosphorylation and the resulting recruitment of Byr 4 p are among the earliest steps in the establishment of SIN asymmetry...|$|R

The <b>ring</b> <b>fission</b> of OH-DDVA is an essential step in the DDVA degradative pathway. A 15 -kb EcoRI fragment isolated from the cosmid library complemented the growth deficiency of a mutant on OH-DDVA. Subcloning and deletion analysis showed that a 1. 4 -kb DNA fragment included the gene responsible for the <b>ring</b> <b>fission</b> of OH-DDVA. An open reading frame encoding 334 amino acids was identified and designated ligZ. The deduced amino acid sequence of LigZ had 18 to 21 % identity with the class III extradiol dioxygenase family, including the β subunit (LigB) of protocatechuate 4, 5 -dioxygenase of SYK- 6 (Y. Noda, S. Nishikawa, K. -I. Shiozuka, H. Kadokura, H. Nakajima, K. Yano, Y. Katayama, N. Morohoshi, T. Haraguchi, and M. Yamasaki, J. Bacteriol. 172 : 2704 – 2709, 1990), catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase I (MpcI) of Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP 222 (M. Kabisch and P. Fortnagel, Nucleic Acids Res. 18 : 3405 – 3406, 1990), the catalytic subunit of the meta-cleavage enzyme (CarBb) for 2 ′-aminobiphenyl- 2, 3 -diol from Pseudomonas sp. strain CA 10 (S. I. Sato, N. Ouchiyama, T. Kimura, H. Nojiri, H. Yamane, and T. Omori, J. Bacteriol. 179 : 4841 – 4849, 1997), and 2, 3 -dihydroxyphenylpropionate 1, 2 -dioxygenase (MhpB) of Escherichia coli (E. L. Spence, M. Kawamukai, J. Sanvoisin, H. Braven, and T. D. H. Bugg, J. Bacteriol. 178 : 5249 – 5256, 1996). The <b>ring</b> <b>fission</b> product formed from OH-DDVA by LigZ developed a yellow color with an absorption maximum at 455 nm, suggesting meta cleavage. Thus, LigZ was concluded to be a ring cleavage extradiol dioxygenase. LigZ activity was detected only for OH-DDVA and 2, 2 ′, 3, 3 ′-tetrahydroxy- 5, 5 ′-dicarboxybiphenyl and was dependent on the ferrous ion...|$|E

Electron-impact experiments, together with metastable ion studies and accurate mass measurements, evidenced many different fragmentation processes.

40|$|Organic {{pollutants}} {{comprise a}} potential group of chemicals {{which can be}} dreadfully hazardous to human health. As they persist in the environment, {{they are capable of}} long range transportation, bioaccumulation in human and animal tissue and biomagnifications in food chain. Phenolic compounds are hazardous pollutants that are toxic at relatively low concentration. The use of microbial catalysts in the biodegradation of organic compounds has advanced significantly during the past three decades. The efficiency of biodegradation of organic compounds is influenced by the type of the organic pollutant, the nature of the organism, the enzyme involved, the mechanism of degradation {{and the nature of the}} influencing factors. This also depends on aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, degradation of phenol was shown to be initiated by oxygenation into catechols as intermediates followed by a ring cleavage at either the ortho or meta position, depending on the type of strain. Aerobically, phenol is first converted to catechol, and subsequently, the catechol is degraded via ortho or meta fission to intermediates of central metabolism. The initial <b>ring</b> <b>fission</b> is catalysed by an ortho cleaving enzyme, catechol 1, 2 dioxygenase or by a meta cleaving enzyme catechol 2, 3 dioxygenase, where the product of <b>ring</b> <b>fission</b> is a cis-muconic acid for the former and 2 -hydro cis muconic semi aldehyde for the latter...|$|E
40|$|International audienceActin {{is a major}} {{actor in}} the {{determination}} of cell shape. On the one hand, site-directed assembly/disassembly cycles of actin filaments drive protrusive force leading to lamellipodia and filopodia dynamics. Force produced by actin similarly contributes in membrane scission in endocytosis or Golgi remodeling. On the other hand, cellular processes like adhesion, immune synapse, cortex dynamics or cytokinesis are achieved by combining acto-myosin contractility and actin assembly in a complex and not fully understood manner. New chemical compounds are therefore needed to disentangle acto-myosin and actin dynamics. We have found that synthetic, cell permeant, short polyamines are promising new actin regulators in this context. They generate growth and stabilization of lamellipodia within minutes by slowing down the actin assembly/disassembly cycle and facilitating nucleation. We now report that these polyamines also slow down cytokinetic <b>ring</b> closure in <b>fission</b> yeast. This shows that these synthetic compounds are active also in yeasts, and these experiments specifically highlight that actin depolymerization {{is involved in the}} ring closure. Thus, synthetic polyamines appear to be potentially powerful agents in a quantitative approach to the role of actin in complex processes in cell biology, developmental biology and potentially cancer research...|$|R
40|$|The {{contractile}} ring {{is composed}} of F-actin, type II myosin and more than 100 cytokinetic <b>ring</b> proteins. In <b>fission</b> yeast, the anillin-related protein Mid 1 plays {{a critical role in}} organizing the early steps of contractile ring formation and functions as a scaffold to bridge the cell cortex with the contractile ring. Cells lacking mid 1 form off-centered, highly disorganized ring structures and exhibit severe cytokinesis defects. Coincident with its cortical accumulation, Mid 1 becomes hyper-phosphorylated. Our previous research demonstrates that cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc 2, and the polo-like kinase, Plo 1, directly phosphorylate Mid 1. In addition to consensus phosphorylation motifs for Plo 1 and Cdc 2, Mid 1 contains several RXXS motifs, which fit the phosphorylation consensus sequence for Sid 2 kinase. Sid 2 is the most downstream kinase in the Septation Initiation Network signaling cascade, which signals from the spindle pole body to trigger constriction of the contractile ring. A combination of site-directed mutagenesis with mass spectroscopy and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping identified multiple Sid 2 phosphorylation sites within Mid 1. Interestingly, phospho-site mutants displayed cell division defects, including sensitivity to low dose latrunculin A and disorganized actin localization. While phospho-site mutants maintained the mitotic spindle checkpoint, the majority of cells exhibited severe polarity phenotypes and Mid 1 protein levels increased when compared to checkpoint activated cells expressing wild-type Mid 1. Given that Mid 1 departure from the ring coincides with Sid 2 relocalization to the division site, Sid 2 may temporally regulate the interaction of Mid 1 with the membrane or other contractile ring components; our initial experiments favor Sid 2 regulating Mid 1 dissociation from the cell cortex...|$|R
40|$|The fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe grows only {{in length}} {{in a highly}} {{polarized}} manner in a process tightly regulated by both the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons, which play key roles {{in the establishment of}} cell polarity and growth of the cell respectively. Previous studies have shown that within the microtubule cytoskeleton a large group of proteins accumulate at the cell poles, where they are believed to form a “polarisome” which coordinates the cell’s polarity. Whilst the main functions and key interactions between these proteins are known, many of the finer details remain unclear. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic network of different actin structures, with multiple changes occurring that are regulated by actin binding proteins (ABPs). One of the most important actin binding proteins is tropomyosin, which is responsible for stabilising interphase actin cables and the cytokinetic actomyosin <b>ring</b> (CAR). Within <b>fission</b> yeast tropomyosin is present in both acetylated and unacetylated forms which each localise to distinct actin structures. Interphase actin cables and the CAR are nucleated by two different formins; For 3 and Cdc 12 respectively. Within this study {{it has been shown that}} it is these formins that determine which tropomyosin isoform associates with specific actin structures. Exchanging the localisation of these formins results in a corresponding exchange of tropomyosin present on actin filaments. This exchange also has a subsequent effect on actin dynamics and the interaction of other ABPs. In addition, when investigating the regulation of cell polarity, it was shown that this is a very complex process. Proteins from both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons playing key roles in the transport, recruitment, tethering and turnover of each other as shown by deletions of one polarity protein often having a significant effect on the localisation and abundance of others...|$|R
