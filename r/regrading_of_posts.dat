50|$|The {{football}} stadium—which {{also serves}} as home for the track and field programs—underwent an extensive renovation. This included a <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> the playing surface and the installation of synthetic turf, {{as well as the}} addition of seating for more than 2,000 fans, a new pressbox, a new concession stand, and new lights. The stadium debuted in August 2007.|$|R
40|$|Discrete piles {{are used}} to {{stabilise}} infrastructure slopes, especially where there is insufficient additional land to allow construction of large toe berms or <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> the slope. Compared with more conventional structures such as retaining walls, there are little field data on how discrete piles typically bend and displace under slope loading. This paper presents the results from monitoring a number of discrete piles used to stabilise a railway embankment at Hildenborough, Kent. Bending deflections deduced from strain gauges are compared with the displacements and rotations measured by inclinometer tubes cast into the piles. Four years after pile installation, the piles were bending downslope over their lower halves, with little bending measured in the upper sections. <b>Regrading</b> <b>of</b> the rockfill piling platform shortly after pile construction caused some of the pile loading, with further loading caused by the continued tendency for slope movement. Analysis of the piles using a simple elastic analysis gives bending moments and displacements close to those measured...|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} depot {{was constructed in}} 1913 when the duplication of the line between Emu Plains and Glenbrook was completed. The depot was available for service from December 1913, but was not officially opened till 31 January 1914. With the duplication and <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> the line, the heavy grades below Valley Heights were eliminated, the ruling gradient from Penrith to Valley Heights being 1 in 60.|$|R
50|$|AMBC {{officials}} said in November 1930 that Arlington Memorial Bridge {{would be all}} but complete in January 1931. All that remained was the surfacing of the roadway and <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> roads on the Virginia side.

50|$|Many small alleys on Ludgate Hill {{were swept}} {{away in the}} late 1860s to build Ludgate Hill railway station between Water Lane and New Bridge Street, a station of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. It was closed in 1923 and the railway bridge and viaduct between Holborn Viaduct and Blackfriars {{stations}} was demolished in 1990 to enable {{the construction of the}} City Thameslink railway station in a tunnel. This also involved the <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> the slope of Ludgate Hill at the junction.|$|R
50|$|Being {{closely linked}} with the {{government}} (this being a product of having the Colonial Secretary as the Honorary President) the Association focused on primarily using petitions and persuasion rather than direct confrontation to secure improvements in the service. This method proved successful initially and the Association was able to secure the <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> public officers, receipts of grant-in-aid and bonuses and secured the admission of women to the permanent service. The association also gained equal representation with government {{on a number of}} important committees which had been set up to consider reforms to the service.|$|R

50|$|Although {{in retrospect}} it is {{referred}} to as the Denny Regrade (and the name has become the name of a neighborhood), there were, in fact, several separate <b>regrades</b> <b>of</b> the former Denny Hill, beginning with private-sector efforts. Around 1900, property owners along relatively low-lying First Avenue took it upon themselves to cut through from Pike Street to Cedar Street. A similar cut (but initiated by the City) lowered Second Avenue in 1904; around the same time, the south part of the hill was shaved off as Pike and Pine Streets were regraded between Second and Fifth Avenues.|$|R
50|$|A {{junction}} existed 200 yd to {{the south}} of the station, with the main line going to Riversdale railway station and the loop line towards Canterbury station on the Lilydale railway line. This connection was only open between 15 March 1892 and 12 April 1893. An 18-lever frame was provided at the Lilydale line connection, later reduced to 16 levers. In 1911 a spoil siding was constructed north of Shenley, between the Canterbury and Mont Albert Road road overbridges. Earth fill obtained by widening the cutting at that point was used in the <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> the Lilydale line.|$|R
40|$|We generalise Koszul and D-Koszul algebras by {{introducing}} {{a class of}} graded algebras called (D,A) -stacked algebras.

In the monomial case, we give an explicit description of the Ext algebra by quiver and relations, and show that the ideal of relations has a quadratic Gröbner basis; this enables us to give a <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> the Ext algebra under which the regraded Ext algebra is a Koszul algebra.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{nearly the entire}} route offered {{spectacular}} views. A deal was struck: the community would agree {{to pay for the}} private property {{that would have to be}} obtained to widen the streets (including land that would need to be filled or excavated); City Engineer R. H. Thomson would be responsible for contracts and would deal with any necessary <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> cross streets; the boulevard would eventually be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Park Department, which would landscape and surface the street. A 1907 ordinance authorized this plan and in 1908 it was incorporated into the Olmsted Plan, but in 1910 the project was still mired in lawsuits over land condemnation.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, 210 ft of the up {{main track}} through {{the station was}} laid and {{ballasted}} using 110a and 113a flat bottom rail and wooden sleepers. The Ruston & Hornsby diesel shunter was moved from the isolated goods dock. This is the first standard gauge loco on the Somerset & Dorset mainline south of the Mendips since the demolition train departed in July 1967, exactly 42 years before. The wooden box van has also been moved to the same track. Progress in 2010 included acquiring a tracked Priestman Mustang excavator, finishing construction of the up platform wall, <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> the cattle dock track bed and preparations for tracklaying, and the connection of the station to the mains drainage system.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, cable {{barriers}} {{were installed}} in the median from milepost 6 to milepost 15 as a stopgap measure. These new barriers, installed for $2 million, required the <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> the median and upgrades to the drainage system. These new protective devices {{have proved to be}} worthwhile, preventing many crossover accidents which have plagued the highway since the 1990s, mostly attributed to an increase in traffic on the overburdened Interstate Highway. This cable barrier system was extended to Exit 28 at Milton in 2005 and future measures will ensure {{that the rest of the}} Interstate Highway system in West Virginia, where a depressed grassy median of similar width exists, will receive one.|$|R
25|$|From {{the time}} of his arrival in Seattle, Thomson had {{considered}} the hilly landscape and the extensive mudflats as obstacles to the city's growth. He launched several regrading projects, most notably the extensive Denny Regrade, but also the Jackson regrade (between Main and Judkins Streets and 4th and 12th Avenues) and the <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> Dearborn Street, with the 12th Avenue Bridge (now Jose P. Rizal Bridge) spanning Dearborn and connecting First Hill to Beacon Hill. He also drove Westlake Avenue through from Downtown to Lake Union, the first flat route connecting the two. He also worked with railroad magnate James J. Hill to get the Great Northern Railway to bypass the already crowded waterfront with a 1906 railway tunnel under Downtown.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the class of}} (D,A) -stacked algebras, which generalise the classes of Koszul algebras, d-Koszul algebras and (D,A) -stacked monomial algebras. We show that the Ext algebra of a (D,A) -stacked algebra is finitely generated in degrees 0, 1, 2 and 3. After investigating some general properties of E(Ʌ) for this class of algebras, we look at a <b>regrading</b> <b>of</b> E(Ʌ) and give examples for which the regraded Ext algebra is a Koszul algebra. Following this we give a general construction of a (D,A) -stacked algebra Ʌ from a d-Koszul algebra Ʌ, setting D = dA, with A ≥ 1. From this construction we relate the homological properties of Ʌ and Ʌ, including the projective resolutions {{and the structure of}} the Ext algebra...|$|R

40|$|This article {{determines the}} effect of {{rounding}} (pointing-off) of grade percentages to the nearest whole number on the probability distribution <b>of</b> <b>regrading</b> in the peanut industry. Results show that rounding causes graders to have to regrade an extra 4 % of samples even when they follow all directions and make no mistakes. When rounding was not used, the sample weight {{had little effect on}} the probability <b>of</b> <b>regrading.</b> With rounding, the probability <b>of</b> <b>regrading</b> was reduced by beginning with a larger than 500 -gram sample. Thus, rounding provides an incentive to take overweight samples in order to avoid regrading. Overweight samples can overestimate the value of peanuts. A low-cost way to improve peanut grading accuracy would be to round to tenths rather than whole numbers. grading, normal-jump distribution, peanuts, regrading, rounding, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

The area around Union Station, originally a tide flat that was filled during the regrades, was home to a coal gasification power plant and later the station's railyard.|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of constructing a transformation, or <b>regrading,</b> <b>of</b> a discrete data set {{such that the}} histogram of the transformed data matches a given reference histogram {{is commonly known as}} histogram modification. The technique is widely used for image enhancement and normalization. A method which has been previously derived for producing such a regrading is shown to be “best” {{in the sense that it}} minimizes the error between the cumulative histogram of the transformed data and that of the given reference function, over all single-valued, monotone, discrete transformations of the data. Techniques for smoothed regrading, which provide a means of balancing the error in matching a given reference histogram against the information lost with respect to a linear transformation are also examined. The smoothed regradings are shown to optimize certain cost functionals. Numerical algorithms for generating the smoothed regradings, which are simple and efficient to implement, are described, and practical applications to the processing of LANDSAT image data are discussed...|$|R
