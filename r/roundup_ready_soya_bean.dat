40|$|Abstract: With the {{widespread}} use of <b>Roundup</b> <b>Ready</b> <b>soya</b> (event 40 - 3 - 2) (RRS), the traceability of transgenic components, especially protein residues, in different soya-related foodstuffs has become an important issue. In this report, transgenic components in commercial soya (including RRS) protein concentrates were firstly detected by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot. The results illustrated the different degradation patterns of the cp 4 -epsps gene and corresponding protein in RRS-derived protein concentrates. Furthermore, western blot was applied to investigate the single factor of food processing and the matrix on the disintegration of CP 4 -EPSPS protein in RRS powder and soya-derived foodstuffs, and trace the degradation patterns during the food production chain. Our results suggested that the exogenous full length of CP 4 -EPSPS protein in RRS powder was distinctively sensitive to various heat treatments, including heat, microwave and autoclave (especially), and only one degradation fragment (23. 4 kD) of CP 4 -EPSPS protein was apparently observed when autoclaving was applied.

40|$|Background: In {{spite of}} {{being among the}} main foods {{responsible}} for allergic reactions worldwide, soybean (Glycine max) derived products continue to be increasingly widespread {{in a variety of}} food products due to their well-documented health benefits. Soybean also continues {{to be one of the}} elected target crops for genetic modification. The aim of this study was to characterize the soya proteome and, specifically, IgE-reactive proteins as well as to compare the IgE response in soya-allergic individuals to genetically modified <b>Roundup</b> <b>Ready</b> <b>soya</b> versus its non-transgenic control. Methods: We performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of protein extracts from a 5 % genetically modified <b>Roundup</b> <b>Ready</b> flour sample and its non-transgenic control followed by Western blotting with plasma from 5 soya sensitive individuals. We used peptide tandem mass spectrometry to identify soya proteins (55 protein matches), specifically IgE-binding ones, and to evaluate differences between transgenic and non-transgenic samples. Results: We identified 2 new potential soybean allergens – one is maturation associated and seems to be part of the late embryogenesis abundant proteins group and the other is a cysteine proteinase inhibitor. None of the individuals tested reacted differentially to the transgenic versus non-transgenic samples under study. Conclusion: Soybean endogenous allergen expression does not seem to be altered after genetic modification. Proteomics should be considered a powerful tool for functional characterization of plants and for food safety assessment. Fundação Calouste Gulbenkia...|$|R

40|$|In relay {{intercropping}} systems, late-planted crops often grow {{under the}} shade of the canopy of early-planted tall crops and then transfer to full sunlight after the harvest of the early-planted crops. In order to know the effects of recovery growth of the late-planted <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> in maize–soya bean relay intercropping, a field experiment was carried out to observe architectural, morphological, physiological and anatomical traits of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> plants related to shade and subsequent removal in intercropping before and after maize harvest, respectively. During shade period, <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> biomass was severely reduced, and stem elongation was stimulated. Typical features of shade grown leaves were found, such as lower LMA (leaf mass per unit area), thinner thickness, higher chlorophyll content, lower chlorophyll a:b ratio. Whole-plant leaf area analysis found that <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> increased leaf area ratio by adjusting leaf morphology rather than by dry mass allocation. After maize harvest, leaf area and leaf mass increased rapidly, contributing to compensation growth in intercropped <b>soya</b> <b>bean.</b> Meanwhile, physiological and anatomical traits of leaf went back to similar levels as grown in sole cropping. However, stem morphological traits were irreversible after removal of shade. Finally, no difference on seed weight per plant of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> was observed between relay intercropping and sole cropping. Based on these findings, we speculated the recovery growth might be the direct determining factor on pod formation in <b>soya</b> <b>bean,</b> and improvement on the capacity of recovery growth could increase yield of relay intercropped <b>soya</b> <b>bean...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the bioavailability of selenium (Se) from milled <b>soya</b> <b>beans,</b> a plant protein, to lambs after various degrees of heat treatment. Thirty Dohne Merino lambs (ca. 25 kg live weight, 4 months old) were allocated randomly within sex and weight groups into three treatment groups. During the experimental period, they were fed a diet consisting of a large proportion of milled <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> as their main source of Se and other feeds low in Se to balance the diet. Blood was drawn during this period and analysed for Se and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. Chemical and Se analyses were performed on the feed and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> samples as well as on the organs, wool and rumen fluid of the lambs. Although the ADIN concentration of the <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> increased with increasing heat treatments, more heat damage could have been inflicted on it to differentiate the different <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> fractions in comparison to each other. On average, the in sacco disappearance of the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and Se was higher for the unprocessed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> compared to the two processed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> fractions. As a result, the lambs receiving the unprocessed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> (control group- C-group) had a significant higher rumen bacterial Se concentration than the lambs receiving the heat¬treated <b>soya</b> <b>beans.</b> Despite this higher concentration, the liver Se concentration of this group was statistically significantly lower compared to the two heat-treated groups. This can be interpreted that the heat processing of the <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> enhanced its Se fraction to be taken up by the liver. However, those differences were biologically not significant. The average liver Se concentration between the lambs receiving the over- ¬processed- (a-group) and those receiving the ideal treated <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> (I-group), did not differ, indicating that the excessive heat treatment did not influence the amount of Se reaching the lower digestive tract of the a-group. Although the Se concentration of the heart muscle of the a-group was statistically significantly lower than for the I-and C-groups, those differences biologically were not significant. Despite an increase in the erythrocyte GSH-Px activity over the duration of the trial in all three the treatment groups, no significant differences between the three treatment groups were observed at any stage. It is concluded from this study that the heat treatment of <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> has not influenced the incorporation and the bioavailability of its Se fraction to any significant degree.

40|$|The pending {{approval}} of the unconfined release of <b>Roundup</b> <b>Ready</b> wheat in North America has {{brought to the attention}} of regulators and scientists in North America the issue of coexistence of genetically engineered (GM) and non-GM crops. In Canada, there has been great adoption by farmers of <b>Roundup</b> <b>Ready</b> and other GM canola varieties. At the time of commercial release of GM canola in Canada no specific GM, non-GM coexistence plans were considered or implemented. GM traits (transgenes) have since become ubiquitous in canola crops in Canada and this has led to some problems. For example, although <b>Roundup</b> <b>Ready</b> canola provides direct operational value to adopting farmers, controlling volunteer <b>Roundup</b> <b>Ready</b> canola in low disturbance direct seeding systems adds cost for farmers. The spread of the <b>Roundup</b> <b>Ready</b> trait in canola means that this added cost is borne by both adopters and nonadopters of the technology.

The objectives of this experiment were: (1) to determine the response in growing steers to increasing levels of molassed sugar-beet pulp (MSBP) as a supplement to grass silage, (2) to compare MSBP and barley, and (3) to ascertain if there was a response to the inclusion of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal as a protein source with both MSBP and barley. Weanling steers (n = 154) were assigned to the following treatments: (1) silage only, (2) silage plus a low level of MSBP, (3) silage plus a low level of MSBP plus <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal, (4) silage plus a high level of MSBP, (5) silage plus a high level of MSBP plus <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal, (6) silage plus a high level of barley, and (7) silage plus a high level of barley plus <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal. Low MSBP, high MSBP and barley levels were 1. 5 kg, 3. 0 kg and 3. 0 kg per head daily, respectively. Where <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal was included it replaced 0. 2 kg/day (low) or 0. 4 kg/day (high) of MSBP or barley. The duration of the treatments was 125 days (winter) after which the animals grazed together for 148 days. Silage intake decreased linearly (P < 0. 001) with increasing MSBP level. Addition of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal had no effect on silage intake with low MSBP or barley but increased (P < 0. 05) intake with high MSBP. Live-weight gain increased both linearly (P < 0. 001) and quadratically (P < 0. 01) with increasing MSBP. There was a significant live-weight response to the addition of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal which was greater at the high than at the low MSBP level and was greater for MSBP than barley. Across all treatments, growth rate at pasture was inversely related to growth rate in winter. Final live weights for the treatments as listed were 376, 395, 411, 400, 430, 427 and 428 (s. e. 14. 2) kg. It is concluded that there was a curvilinear live-weight gain response to increasing MSBP level. There was no end-of-grazingseason live-weight response to the inclusion of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal with barley but there was with MSBP, particularly at the high level. MSBP with <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal was equivalent to a similar quantity of barley. peer-reviewedNational Development Plan 2000 – 200...|$|R

Home grown or locally produced feeds, such as nitrogen fixating forage and grain legumes as well as rapeseed products, are shown to give less contribution to environmental problems than imported feeds. The objective {{of the study was to}} compare dry matter intake, live weight gain, feed efficiency and profitability in calves fed two levels of forages with high inclusion of red clover together with two different amounts of rapeseed cake vs. <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal. <b>Soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal gave the highest live weight gain and the best profitability. However, a greater amount of rapeseed together with clover/grass silage also gave a good live weight gain and profitability, close to the results for <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal...|$|R
40|$|<b>Soya</b> <b>beans,</b> {{like other}} legumes, contain low {{concentrations}} of the nutritionally essential sulphur amino acid, methionine. Cysteine, although not an {{essential amino acid}} {{because it can be}} synthesized from methionine, also influences the nutritional quality of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> products when it is only present in low levels. A low cysteine content will also aggravate a methionine deficiency. <b>Soya</b> <b>bean</b> lines deficient in 7 S protein subunits have been identified. The 7 S proteins contain substantially less methionine and cysteine than the 11 S proteins. With the myriad of genetic null alleles for these subunits {{it may be possible to}} tailor the 7 S/ 11 S storage protein ratio and their total composition in seeds to include only those subunits with the richest sulphur amino acid composition. Cotyledon feeding experiments, using isolated <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> cotyledons, demonstrated that addition of methionine to the culture media caused increased synthesis of both proteins and free amino acids but the mechanism by which this takes place is not clear...|$|R

Other intercropping patterns studied include 1 maize: 1 soya bean; 2 maize: 5 soya bean; 4 maize: 4 <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> and 5 maize: 2 <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> rows. Both maize and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> were adversely affected by intercropping as shown by partial equivalent ratios (PLER). The adverse effect of competition was greater under low rainfall conditions, but irrigation and high rainfall tended to improve productivity of intercrop systems. Overall, results indicated that intercropping maize with <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> was more efficient than sole cropping with regard to Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) and income. Strip intercropping was more productive than in-row intercropping but is used by farmers because of perceived advantages of mechanical weeding. The results suggest that from a biological point of view, greater efficiency would be achieved by adopting a strip intercropping arrangement of 5 maize: 2 <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> rows as a cropping pattern. This arrangement was more productive than sole cropping in a season with 426 mm of rainfall when all other intercropping treatments evaluated achieved LER < 1. 00...|$|R
