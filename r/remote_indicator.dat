Measurements were made at two sites differing in altitude (800 and 2600 m) over several growing seasons. At high elevation, potential PSII effi-ciency, measured by chlorophyll fluorescence (the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence; Fv/Fm) at predawn, de-creased with decreasing air temperature and varied greatly among species. At the lowest air temperature (– 3 °C) studied, variation in Fv/Fm among species ranged from 0. 33 to 0. 72. In contrast, at low elevation where air temperature was moderate, seasonal variation in Fv/Fm was small {{in all of the}} study species. When species, elevation and season data were pooled, despite the high variation in Fv/Fm among species, a good correlation between Fv/Fm and PRI was observed. When compared at the same value of PRI, Fv/Fm of evergreen trees was higher than that of perennial grasses; however, when the minimum temper-ature on the measurement day was below 0 °C, Fv/Fm was un-derestimated relative to PRI.

However, in order to retrieve the ET with an accuracy approaching 10 %, LST should be retrieved to within 1 ◦C or better, disregarding other elements of uncertainty. The removal of atmospheric effects is key towards achieving a precise estimation of LST and it requires detailed information on water vapor. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat 8 captures data in two long wave thermal bands with 100 -meter resolution. However, the US Geological Survey has reported a calibration problem of TIRS bands caused by stray light, resulting in a higher bias {{in one of its}} two bands (4 % in band 11, 2 % in band 10).

Simulations are performed over the period 1980 - 2001 and are compared to satellite observations over the last 9 years. The surface EKE pattern in the basin is dominated by a region along the West coast of Green-land where eddies, mainly anticyclonic, are formed by instability of the main currents flowing over the continental slope, consistent with previous ideal-ized results. Here the interannual changes {{are linked to the}} shear of the incoming boundary current system imposed as boundary condition to the model domain. The highly variable strength of the East Greenland current at the northeast boundary, derived from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) reanalysis, strongly influences the vortex formation. In the center of the Labrador Sea, where deep convection occurs, a statis-tically significant portion of the modeled interannual surface EKE variability is correlated with the local atmospheric forcing, and both heat and wind fluxes play an important role and can be adopted as predictors at a lag of two-three months. The Arctic Oscillation index can also be used as a <b>remote</b> <b>indicator</b> of the atmospheric fluxes, but with lower skill than local measure-ments.

Multi-spectral platforms, including Landsat and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), acquire imagery in the visible to shortwave infrared and thermal infrared (TIR) domain at resolutions ranging from 30 to 1000 m. Land-surface temperature (LST) derived from TIR satellite data has been reliably {{used as a}} <b>remote</b> <b>indicator</b> of ET and surface moisture status.

In this study, the data mining sharpener (DMS; Gao et al., 2012) technique is applied over irrigated farming areas located in harsh desert environments in Saudi Arabia. The DMS approach sharpens TIR imagery using finer resolution shortwave spectral reflectances and functional LST and reflectance relationships established using a flexible regression tree approach.

40|$|In a {{range of}} plant species from three Californian {{vegetation}} types, we examined the widely used "normalized difference vegetation index" (NDVI) and "simple ratio" (SR) as indicators of canopy structure, light absorption, and photosynthetic activity. These indices, which are derived from canopy reflectance in the red and near-infrared wavebands, highlighted phenological differences between evergreen and deciduous canopies. They were poor indicators of total canopy biomass due to the varying abundance of non-green standing biomass in these vegetation types. However, in sparse canopies (leaf area index [LAI]° 0 - 2), NDVI was a sensitive indicator of canopy structure and chemical content (green biomass, green leaf area index, chlorophyll content, and foliar nitrogen content). At higher canopy green LAI values (> 2; typical of dense shrubs and trees), NDVI was relatively insensitive to changes in canopy structure. Compared to SR, NDVI was better correlated with indicators of canopy structure and chemical content, but was equivalent to the logarithm of SR. In agreement with theoretical expectations, both NDVI and SR exhibited near-linear correlations with fractional PAR intercepted by green leaves {{over a wide range}} of canopy densities. Maximum daily photosynthetic rates were positively correlated with NDVI and SR in annual grassland and semideciduous shrubs where canopy development and photosynthetic activity were in synchrony. The indices were also correlated with peak springtime canopy photosynthetic rates in evergreens. However, over most of the year, these indices were poor predictors of photosynthetic performance in evergreen species due to seasonal reductions in photosynthetic radiation-use efficiency that occurred without substantial declines in canopy greenness. Our results support the use of these vegetation indices as <b>remote</b> <b>indicators</b> of PAR absorption, and thus potential photosynthetic activity, even in heterogeneous landscapes.

This approach was applied for 2002 / 2003 growing season in Haouz plain, Morocco. <b>Remote</b> sensing-based <b>indicators,</b> reflecting equity and adequacy of the irrigation water delivery were estimated. Adequacy was determined according to Relative Irrigation supply (RIS), Depleted Fraction (DF) and Relative Evapotranspiration (RET) and equity according to the coefficient of variation of ETc. The analysis of these indicators exhibits a great variability among fields. Variability in irrigation performance at all levels, associated factors and possible improvements are discussed. This study demonstrates how remote sensing-based estimates of water consumption provide better estimates of irrigation performance at different scales than the traditional field survey methods...|$|R
40|$|Low {{resolution}} {{satellite imagery}} {{has been extensively}} used for crop monitoring and yield forecasting for over 30 years and {{plays an important role}} in a growing number of operational systems. The combination of their high temporal frequency with their extended geographical coverage generally associated with low costs per area unit makes these images a convenient choice at both national and regional scales. Several qualitative and quantitative approaches can be clearly distinguished, going from the use of low resolution satellite imagery as the main predictor of final crop yield to complex crop growth models where <b>remote</b> sensing-derived <b>indicators</b> play different roles, depending on the nature of the model and on the availability of data measured on the ground. Vegetation performance anomaly detection with low resolution images continues to be a fundamental component of early warning and drought monitoring systems at the regional scale. For applications at more detailed scales, the limitations created by the mixed nature of low resolution pixels are being progressively reduced by the higher resolution offered by new sensors, while the continuity of existing systems remains crucial for ensuring the availability of long time series as needed by the majority of the yield prediction methods used today.
