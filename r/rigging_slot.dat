As casino employees have noticed, if there's money involved, there are unscrupulous people out there willing to grab it. These feature criminals like Dennis Nikrasch, the infamous slot cheater who reigned for 22 years. Real security camera footage probably unseen anywhere else allows viewers {{to have a look}} at the daily cheaters' main job. Many forms of cheating are included, such as point shaving, <b>rigging</b> <b>slot</b> machines, and manipulating the game of craps.|$|E
5000|$|Dennis Nikrasch (September 12, 1941 [...] - [...] 2010) was a Vegas slot cheater and {{a former}} {{locksmith}} {{who was responsible for}} spearheading the biggest casino theft in Las Vegas history, by grabbing $16,000,000 from <b>rigging</b> <b>slot</b> machines over a 22-year period. His career began in Chicago, Illinois as a locksmith. He then found out that he could break into any lock he wished, due to his extensive knowledge of the tools, and became associated with members from a key Chicago crime family until his arrest in 1961. When he was released in 1970, he realized that he could make even bigger profits by manipulating slot machines in Las Vegas. From 1976 until 1983, he obtained $10 million from this method. He was then found in 1986 and sentenced to five years in prison. He was released in 1991, but didn't return to Vegas headlines until 1996, when he returned, this time with a new approach in response to the higher levels of security. He actually managed to keep his cheating secret until November 1998, when one of his accomplices revealed information about his cheating machines. He was arrested and sentenced to 7.5 years in prison, being released in 2004. He died in 2010 from unknown causes.|$|E
50|$|Ocean's men use {{the money}} they made off with to buy {{property}} north of the Las Vegas Strip for Reuben. To punish Benedict for attempting to steal the diamonds, Ocean donates Benedict's $72 million portion of the take to charity, forcing Benedict to publicly admit his philanthropy via television appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show (which Ocean was shown watching earlier), a scene viewed by Danny, Rusty and Linus in the airport's lounge. As the group disperses, Rusty ensures that the real Five Diamond reviewer, who suffered numerous discomforts during his stay at the hotel, is compensated by allowing him to win the $11,000,000 jackpot on a <b>rigged</b> <b>slot</b> machine at the airport.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{they plan}} to prevent [...] "The Bank" [...] from winning the prestigious Five Diamond Award, which all of Bank's {{previous}} hotels have won. Saul Bloom poses as the reviewer of the board, while the real reviewer is treated horribly during his stay by Ocean's associates and the staff on their payroll. Next, {{they plan to}} <b>rig</b> the casino's <b>slot</b> machines and games to force a payout of more than $500 million in winnings, forcing Bank to cede control of the casino to the board. This requires defeating [...] "The Greco Player Tracker," [...] a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence system that ensures that all winnings are legitimate by measuring the players' biometric responses for authenticity.|$|R
