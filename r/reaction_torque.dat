50|$|The three {{rotor blades}} were {{mounted on a}} ring {{assembly}} supported by bearings, allowing free rotation around the fuselage. At {{the end of each}} was a ramjet. To start the rotors spinning, simple rockets would have been used. As the speed increased, the flow of air would have been sufficient for the ramjets to work and the rockets would expire. The pitch of the blades could be varied with the effect of changing the speed and the lift produced. There was no <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> to cause a counter rotation of the fuselage, since the rotor blades were driven at their tips by the ramjets. Fuel was carried in the fuselage tanks, and was piped through the centre support ring and along the rotors to the jets.|$|E

40|$|Owing to the {{dynamics}} coupling between a free-floating base and a manipulator, the non-stationary {{base of a}} space robot will face the issue of base disturbance due to a manipulator’s motion. The <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> acted on the satellite base’s centroid is an important index to measure the satellite base’s disturbance. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is made, and a novel way to derive the analytical form of the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is proposed. In addition, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> null-space is derived, in which the manipulator’s joint motion is dynamically decoupled from {{the motion of the}} satellite base, and its novel expression demonstrates the equivalence between the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> null-space and the reaction null-space. Furthermore, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> acted as an optimization index can be utilized to achieve satellite base disturbance minimization in the generalized Jacobian-based end-effector Cartesian path tracking task. Besides, supposing that the redundant degrees of freedom are abundant to achieve reaction torque-based active control, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> can be used to realize satellite base attitude control, that is, base attitude adjustment or maintenance. Moreover, because reaction torque-based control is a second-order control scheme, joint torque minimization can be regarded as the optimization task in reaction torque-based active or in-active control. A real-time simulation system of a 7 -DOF space robot under Linux/RTAI is developed to verify and test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed ideas.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two novel redundancy resolution schemes {{aimed at}} locally minimizing the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> {{transferred to the}} spacecraft during manipulator manoeuvres. The subject {{is of particular interest}} in space robotics because reduced reactions result in reduced energy consumption and longer operating life of the attitude control system. The first presented solution is based on a weighted Jacobian pseudoinverse and is derived by using Lagrangian multipliers. The weight matrix is defined by means of the inertia matrix which appears in the spacecraft <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> dynamics. The second one is based on a least squares formulation of the minimization problem. In this formulation the linearity of the forward kinematics and of the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> dynamics equations with respect to the joint accelerations is used. A closed-form solution is derived for both the presented methods, and their equivalence is proven analytically. Moreover, the proposed solutions, which are suitable for real-time implementation, are extended in order {{to take into account the}} physical limits of the manipulator joints directly inside the solution algorithms. A software simulator has been developed in order to simulate the performance of the presented solutions for the selected test cases. The proposed solutions have then been experimentally tested using a 3 D free-flying robot previously tested in an ESA parabolic flight campaign. In the test campaign the 3 D robot has been converted in a 2 D robot thanks to its modularity in order to perform planar tests, in which the microgravity environment can be simulated without time constraints. Air-bearings are used to sustain the links weight, and a dynamometer is used to measure the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque.</b> The experimental validation of the presented inverse kinematics solutions, with an insight on the effect of joint flexibility on their performance, has been carried out, and the experimental results confirmed the good performance of the proposed methods. In particular, two test cases have been analyzed in order to validate and evaluate the performance of both the unconstrained solution and the solution which takes into account the robot physical limits...|$|E

40|$|In space {{robotics}} missions, {{either in}} the scenario of space servicing or debris capture, both the minimization of the energy required for the manipulator manoeuvre and the minimization of the reactions transferred to the base spacecraft are of crucial importance. Indeed, {{both of them are}} related to the possibility of having a longer system operative life in space: for the energy minimization this is straightforward, and for the reaction minimization {{this is due to the}} fact that the Attitude Control System is going to spend less fuel for attitude recovery and correct pointing of antennas after the manipulator manoeuvre if the reactions transferred to the base spacecraft have been minimized. In this paper, a minimum kinetic energy inverse kinematics solution for redundant manipulators has been introduced and validated by simulation. Its performance has been compared to the classical inverse kinematics solution which minimizes joint velocities and to the one that minimizes the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> transferred to the base spacecraft for a 3 -degrees-of-freeedom planar manipulator. Two different end-effector trajectories have been used for validation and then for the comparison of the different inverse kinematics solutions in terms of: total energy required for performing the task, maximum required power, maximum kinetic energy, maximum <b>reaction</b> <b>torque,</b> and maximum joint angles, velocities, and accelerations. Finally, the new concept of iso-energy curve has been introduced, and a set of them has been drawn over the robot workspaces, which have been computed using the kinetic energy minimization solution and the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> minimization solution, considering or not the robot joint limits. This method shows that preferential minimum energy directions exist for the robot end-effector motion, and these are approximately the same for the different inverse kinematics solutions considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} the {{reactions}} transferred to the spacecraft during a manipulator manoeuvre {{is an important issue}} {{in order to reduce the}} energy consumption and extend the operating life of the Attitude Control System. In this paper the performance of a novel least-squares-based reaction control method recently introduced by some of the authors is analyzed in the case of multi-degrees-of-freedom 3 D space manipulators. The proposed method locally minimizes the base reactions transferred by the manipulator to the base spacecraft by exploiting its redundancy, and has some important advantages with respect to the previous ones presented in the literature: a simple mathematical formulation, the possibility to use simple least-squares real-time routines for the solution, and the possibility to take into account the joint limits and the joint velocity and acceleration limits of the manipulator. The methods can be profitably used for the minimization of the base <b>reaction</b> <b>torques,</b> forces, and weighted combinations of them. The main objectives of the study presented in this paper are the implementation in a software simulator and the validation of the aforementioned reaction control solution in the case of 3 D space robots, the study of the Zero Reaction Workspace of a modular 3 D space robot, and the analysis of its dependence on the robot initial configuration and on the number of degrees of freedom of the robot.

40|$|The nutational {{stability}} of a dual-spin satellite {{under the influence}} of an applied <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is analyzed. It is assumed that since the solar paddle attachments to the hub of the spacecraft are not rigidly locked, the effect of the solar panels can be replaced by a constant <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> acting on the hub of the spacecraft.

The variational equations of motion are developed about such an equilibrium position using the SAS-A spacecraft as a model. Energy dissipation on the rotor as well as the main body is included. This nonautonomous set of differential equations are linearized and transformed to an autonomous set using the Lyapunov Reducibility Theorem. The {{stability of}} the kinematically similar system is examined numerically using representative SAS-A parameters for the case when either pair of solar panels is assumed to be loosely attached.

40|$|We {{present a}} method that allows {{automatic}} reaction of a robot to physical collisions, while preserving {{as much as possible}} the execution of a Cartesian task for which the robot is kinematically redundant. The work is motivated by human-robot interaction scenarios, where ensuring safety is of primary concern whereas preserving task performance is an appealing secondary goal. Unexpected collisions may occur anywhere along the manipulator structure. Their fast detection is realized using our previous momentum-based method, which does not require any external sensing. The <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> applied to the joints reduces the effective robot inertia seen at the contact and lets the robot safely move away from the collision area.
