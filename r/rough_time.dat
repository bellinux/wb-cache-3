Though he injured several times in his captaincy career, and replaced by Upul Tharanga in many winning notes, reporters suggested that Mathews will not captain until 2019 Cricket World Cup.|$|E
500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a <b>rough</b> <b>time.</b> She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine.

2500|$|Clough was {{a popular}} choice to be {{appointed}} England manager throughout the 1970s and 1980s. However, it was widely felt that the FA were uneasy about appointing him {{on account of his}} numerous outspoken comments about the English football authorities. He was interviewed for the job twice, in 1977 and 1982, but lost out to Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson respectively. Such was the demand for Clough to be given the job that incumbent manager Robson told then-FA chairman Sir Bert Millichip: 'I'm having a <b>rough</b> <b>time</b> and everybody wants Brian – give the job to him.

I don't believe in it and it makes me crazy. So my job was then to humiliate the people who were doing the humiliating." [...] Executive producer and production manager Gregory Goodman later stated about Clooney's comments in the media, [...] "It doesn't reflect well on [...] It's like some stupid sandbox quarrel." [...] In early 2012, Clooney indicated that he and Russell had mended their relationship, saying [...] "We made a really, really great film, and we had a really <b>rough</b> <b>time</b> together, but it's a case of both of us getting older. I really do appreciate the work he continues to do, and I think he appreciates what I'm trying to do." ...|$|E

These same two items–ghosts and spirits–would {{be incorporated into the}} Gunnulfsen's lyrics.

The song is about Gunnulfsen's girlfriend, who helped her during a <b>rough</b> <b>time</b> in her life. Gunnulfsen didn't think the band would record it; she thought it was [...] "too poppy." [...] "My House" [...] is about a poltergeist and is [...] "also a metaphor for a person, being like, 'Go away.'"

[...] "White Noise" [...] came about as a spur of the moment idea. Gunnulfsen had previous noticed something on Tumblr about Poltergeist and [...] "I was like, 'Oh! That's perfect". The demo of the song was under the working title [...] "White Boiz" [...] and featured a different drum beat in the chorus. The group replaced this different drum beat with a [...] "half-time, really dragging beat" [...] and experimented with an EBow.
