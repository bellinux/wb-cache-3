This document is intended to serve a varied audience including: users wishing to display and manipulate raster image data, programmers responsible for either interfacing the RM <b>format</b> with other <b>raster</b> <b>formats</b> or for developing new RMT device drivers, and programmers charged with installing the software on a host platform...|$|R

50|$|Most vector formats implicitly support {{transparency}} {{because they}} simply avoid putting any objects {{at a given}} point. This includes EPS and WMF. Forvector graphics this may not strictly be seen as transparency, but it requiresmuch of the same careful programming as transparency in <b>raster</b> <b>formats.</b>|$|R
50|$|SVG {{images can}} be {{produced}} {{by the use of}} a vector graphics editor, such as Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Flash Professional, or CorelDRAW, and rendered to common <b>raster</b> image <b>formats</b> such as PNG using the same software.

50|$|The Rec. 601 video <b>raster</b> <b>format</b> {{has been}} re-used {{in a number}} of later standards, {{including}} the ISO/IEC MPEG and ITU-T H.26x compressed formats - although compressed formats for consumer applications usually use chroma subsampling reduced from the 4:2:2 sampling specified in Rec. 601 to 4:2:0.|$|E
50|$|The use of SVG {{on the web}} {{was limited}} {{by the lack of}} support in older {{versions}} of Internet Explorer (IE).

50|$|Most typical <b>raster</b> <b>formats</b> cannot store HDR data (32 bit {{floating}} point values per pixel component), {{which is why}} some relatively old or complex formats are still predominant here, and worth mentioning separately. Newer alternatives are showing up, though. RGBE is the format for HDR images originating from Radiance and also supported by Adobe Photoshop.|$|R

50|$|The RDP {{performs}} rasterization, converting images into <b>raster</b> <b>format</b> before {{output to}} the display. The RCP also provides the CPU's access to main system memory via a 250 MB/s bus. Unfortunately, this link {{does not allow}} direct memory access for the CPU. The RCP, like the CPU, is passively cooled by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above.|$|E

Embeddings into C++ and Java APIs allow invocation of queries, {{as well as}} client-side convenience functions for array handling. Arrays per se are delivered in the main memory format of the client language and processor architecture, ready for further processing. Data format codecs allow to retrieve arrays in common <b>raster</b> <b>formats,</b> such as CSV, PNG, and NetCDF.|$|R
50|$|Raster-based stacked {{surfaces}} {{depict the}} surface of each buried geologic unit, and can accommodate data on lateral variations of physical properties. In this example from Soller and others (1999), the upper surface of each buried geologic unit was represented in <b>raster</b> <b>format</b> as an ArcInfo Grid file. The middle grid is the uppermost surface of an economically important aquifer, the Mahomet Sand, which fills a pre- and inter-glacial valley carved into the bedrock surface. Each geologic unit in <b>raster</b> <b>format</b> can be managed in the data model, in a manner not dissimilar from that shown for the stack-unit map. The Mahomet Sand is continuous in this area, and represents one occurrence of this unit in the data model. Each raster, or pixel, on the Mahomet Sand surface has a set of map coordinates that are recorded in a GIS (in the data model bin that is labeled “Pixel coordinates”, which is the raster corollary of the “Geometry” bin for vector map data). Each pixel can have {{a unique set of}} descriptive information, such as surface elevation, unit thickness, lithology, transmissivity, etc.).|$|E
50|$|In recent years, SVG {{has become}} a {{significant}} format that is completely independent of {{the resolution of the}} rendering device, typically a printer or display monitor. SVG files are essentially printable text that describes both straight and curved paths, as well as other attributes. Wikipedia prefers SVG for images such as simple maps, line illustrations, coats of arms, and flags, which generally are not like photographs or other continuous-tone images. Rendering SVG requires conversion to <b>raster</b> <b>format</b> at a resolution appropriate for the current task. SVG is also a format for animated graphics.|$|E
5000|$|The {{raw form}} of data {{is a set}} of x,y,z {{coordinate}} points. With recent advances, resolution has improved dramatically. Raw data can be processed to remove unwanted areas or features. Outputs such as topographic maps with contour lines can also be derived from lidar. Programs to manipulate lidar data include ENVI, ERDAS IMAGINE, ArcInfo, and ESRI ArcView (with 3D analyst ext.) One useful derivation of lidar data is the DEM (Digital Elevation Model). DEMs are displayed in a <b>raster</b> <b>format</b> with a matrix. The DEM has a specified cell size that corresponds to the earth’s surfaces. The cell contains the average elevation of the points within it.|$|E
