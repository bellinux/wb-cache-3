40|$|The Uganda Constitution of 1995 spelt out the {{principle}} of decentralization by devolution. Accordingly, from 1995 to 2005, district local governments had a dejure mandate to hire and fire all categories of civil servants through their respective district service commissions (DSCs). Following the Constitutional amendment in September 2005, the right to hire and fire district chief administrative officers (CAOs) reverted to central government. Critics <b>of</b> <b>recentralization</b> <b>of</b> CAO appointments contend that the shift in the policy and legislation for managing CAOs runs contrary to {{the principle}}s of decentralization by devolution. This paper argues that <b>recentralization</b> <b>of</b> CAOs has confused reporting, reduced the autonomy of sub-national governments in civil service management, undermined accountability of CAOs to elected councils, and shifted the loyalty of CAOs from local governments with and for which they work to central government that appoints and deploys them. To deepen accountability in local governments, the paper advocates for decentralization of CAO appointments, but for participation of central government in recruitment of CAOs within the confines of a separate personnel system. It further calls for a rethinking of the current call by the 9 th Parliament to recentralize human resource in health in local governments owing to accountability challenges of managing the civil service in sub-national governments under an integrated personnel system...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the quiet yet pervasive transfer of power from central governments to subnational units in Africa since the early 1990 s. Central governments have justified this trend by arguing it promotes {{one or more of}} three goods: democracy, development, and accommodating diversity. The authors survey six selected countries representing federal-unitary and regional differences to evaluate their degree of formal and substantive political, administrative, and financial autonomy. Transfer of powers to subnational units, the authors conclude, is a real and nearly universal trend. However, many central governments have clawed back this grant of power in numerous ways, which led to an informal <b>recentralization</b> <b>of</b> power. Moreover, central governments of federations have deliberately strengthened local government at the expense of regional autonomy. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

In this process over the last decade, former Bell affiliates have sought union support before regulatory commissions, and the unions have leveraged their political power to make important gains in collective bargaining and in organizing new members. As a result, the outcomes for union members and prospects for union institutional viability are more positive than they otherwise would have been...|$|R

The literature on this phenomenon is, nonetheless, small andsuffers from several theoretical andmethodological shortcomings: in particular, {{a unit of}} analysis problem that causes past studies to mistakenly de-emphasize the importance of local actors. We posit that administrative unit proliferation occurs where and {{when there is a}} confluence of interests between the national executive and local citizens and elites from areas that are politically, economically, and ethnically marginalized. We argue further that although the proliferation of administrative units often accompanies or follows far-reaching decentralization reforms, it likely results in a <b>recentralization</b> <b>of</b> power; the proliferation of new local governments fragments existing units into smaller ones with lower relative intergovernmental bargaining power and administrative capacity.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an analytical theory of appropriateness judgments that introduces structural dimensions {{in the study}} of social rationality of organization members.

Illustration of this approach is based on the study of controversial judicial decisions and dynamics of advice networks in a courthouse where lay judges have to choose between punitive and nonpunitive awards in cases of unfair competition in business. In this case, coevolution is facilitated by an endogenous process <b>of</b> centralization decentralization <b>recentralization</b> <b>of</b> advice networks over time, and by use of a procedural “weak legal culture” that helps align and homogenize conflicting normative choices among organization members. It is suggested that this approach to social rationality helps revisit our understanding of social processes, in this case collective learning and secondary socialization in organizations and flexible labor markets...|$|R

40|$|The {{last several}} months have {{witnessed}} several important developments in the transitioning economies of the former Soviet Union.

In October 1994 the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) established the Interstate Economic Committee (IEC), the first CIS institution vested with real decision-making authority. The EEC's establishment shifts the balance of centrifugal and centripetal forces in the CIS and promises to be only the first of many such integrative steps leading to the <b>recentralization</b> <b>of</b> economic activity in the former Soviet Union. The precise kind of integration, Russia's role in whatever new system emerges, and integration's impact on economic reform and development, not to mention East-West relations, remain open questions.

The hypothesis is that similarities in expenditure autonomy of their intermediate-level governments are a consequence of changes in that direction enacted with the new Constitutions, dating back from 1991 in Colombia and from 1988 in Brazil. To test such hypothesis the paper first shows the differences in economic conditions during the 1990 s in both countries after the Constitutional changes; subsequently, it shows how the previous developments {{within the realm of}} intergovernmental relations are very similar from the political point of view, allowing to understand how the loss of expenditure autonomy of intermediate-level governments during the 1990 s took place.

The geostrategic position of the Italian peninsula {{can be seen as a}} logistic platform at the centre of the maritime trades in the Mediterranean area, giving to its port cities the role of gateway of economic flows. The port poles, meant as hubs, are able to attract investments and create economic growth and territorial development through new operative models of urban usage and management. The management policies have to consider the environmental characteristics and distinctive features, respecting the identity of the places as concrete evidence of history, a source of intellectual development and therefore, cultural richness.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes Colombia's conflictive nineteenth-century state-building process, focusing in the subnational {{territories of}} Antioquia and Cauca. It studies the interconnected processes of territorial reconfiguration and decentralization (and <b>recentralization)</b> <b>of</b> state-authority from 1850 to 1899. Throughout these decades, the conflictive {{relations between the}} central government and the political elites in the nine subnational territories, and among them, {{set the stage for}} uncompromising politics and recurrent crises, that more frequently than not led to warfare and to abrupt institutional changes. Antioquia and Cauca were key players in these processes, counterbalancing the political elites governing in Bogotá. Though at times, their conflict-ridden relationship amplified political crises. Using taxation as an indicator of the subnational governments' effective political power and institutional development, I found that Antioquia, although territorially and demographically smaller than Cauca, developed into a far more effective collector of taxes, even before the consolidation of a coffee export economy but did not do so in the case of Cauca, although in other aspects, the two regions were more similar than different. This result contributes {{to the understanding of the}} state- building processes at the regional level and to explaining the persistence of institutional differences between Colombia's subnational territorie...|$|R

He asks how modern rulers respond to the disintegration of a fixed, shared social reality in late modernity, and to the fact that our main legitimating mythologies - such as that of (political) representation, which once ordered the allocation <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> - no longer provide the reassurance and belief in ruler’s authority. To understand the nature <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> and its disintegration, the author explores rulers’ consciousness by categorising their responses in two archetypical models <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> inspired by Machiavelli’s Prince and Shakespeare’s tragic hero. They represent the authority-effects of fear and reassurance and the two modern modes <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> cultivation: increasing social distance and decreasing social distance The thesis argues that modern authority is tragic because the logic by which the dominant archetypical roles try to authorise themselves is self defeating. It illustrates this with a history <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> which describes the characteristically modern drive for the exposure, immanence, and transparency <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> informed by a desire for emancipation and mastery, and how it is paralleled by a degradation <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> and these typically modern archetypes that continue to determine Western culture. Reintegration <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> would require a more dimensional understanding of the concept.
