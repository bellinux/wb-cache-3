500|$|No. 460 {{was moved}} from Northumberland in October 1969 to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg. Although {{a part of}} the museum, it was not owned by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission until it was officially donated to the museum in December 1979, by the Penn Central Transportation Company, which {{received}} ownership when the Pennsylvania was merged with the New York Central Railroad. No. 460 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1979. From 1982 to 1984, volunteers at the museum cleaned the locomotive, replaced wooden window frames and doors, applied <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitor</b> primer and repainted the metal. The locomotive's [...] "asbestos lagging" [...] was removed in 2008. A $400,000 restoration, lasting 3 to 4 years, is planned and is expected to start once an unrelated project at the museum is completed in the summer of 2011. 460 was moved into the museum restoration shops on March 17, 2010 after raising $50,000 and receiving an additional $50,000 donation. From July to August 2010, 460 was [...] "blasted" [...] to remove the several layers of lead paint from the locomotive. The blasting uncovered original timing marks and stamped numbers showing that the origins of some of the parts on 460 were cannibalized from other E6s locomotives. The cosmetic restoration of the 460 was completed in October2016.|$|E

2500|$|A 5% to 9% {{hydrofluoric}} acid gel is also {{commonly used to}} etch all ceramic dental restorations to improve bonding. For similar reasons, dilute {{hydrofluoric acid}} is a component of household rust stain remover, in car washes in [...] "wheel cleaner" [...] compounds, in ceramic and fabric <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> and in water spot removers. Because {{of its ability to}} dissolve iron oxides as well as silica-based contaminants, hydrofluoric acid is used in pre-commissioning boilers that produce high-pressure steam.|$|R
5000|$|Rust {{formation}} can {{be controlled}} with coatings, such as paint, lacquer, or varnish that isolate the iron from the environment. Large structures with enclosed box sections, such as ships and modern automobiles, often have a wax-based product (technically a [...] "slushing oil") injected into these sections. Such treatments usually also contain <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Covering steel with concrete can provide some protection to steel because of the alkaline pH environment at the steel-concrete interface. However rusting of steel in concrete can still be a problem, as expanding rust can fracture or slowly [...] "explode" [...] concrete from within.|$|R
50|$|The non drying types contain {{anti-rust}} chemicals {{similar to}} those in anti-rust waxes. Petroleum-based rust-inhibitors provide several benefits, including the ability to creep over metal, covering missed areas. Additionally, a petroleum, solvent-free <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitor</b> remains on the metal surface, sealing it from rust-accelerating water and oxygen. Other benefits of petroleum-based rust protection include the self-healing properties that come naturally to oils, which helps undercoatings to resist abrasion caused by road sand and other debris. The disadvantage of using a petroleum-based coating is the film left over on surfaces, rendering these products too messy for top side exterior application, and unsafe in areas where it can be slipped on. They also cannot be painted.|$|E
5000|$|The Dolomite, perhaps unfairly, {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for fragility. The introduction of the Dolomite came at a turbulent time for BL and Triumph in particular with many new model introductions, completely new architecture and alloy head/iron block construction of the OHC slant-4, meant that dealership mechanics were not {{fully aware of the}} servicing requirements of the engine. In particular, it required the cooling system to be kept in good condition, and partially filled with a <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> otherwise corrosion leading to radiator blockages and overheating could occur. With a well maintained example, ownership need not be an issue today. Amongst enthusiasts, the Dolomite and especially Sprint are still popular, with many parts still available and excellent club support.|$|E

As part of EPA’s National Partnership for Environmental Priorities http://www.epa.gov/npep (NPEP) program, Crown set a partnership goal of eliminating chromium from its paints. Crown reduced its hazardous waste emissions by more than 300,000 pounds by removing chromium (in the form of ammonium dichromate as a flash <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitor)</b> from water-based paint formulations. By installing a new powder coat paint line, Crown eliminated more than 65 percent of wastewater from its water curtain paint booths, cutting more than 200,000 pounds of wastewater and sludge. The results included reduced air emissions, a better work environment and a savings of $65,000 a year.|$|E

Newer retardants use ammonium sulfate or ammonium polyphosphate with attapulgite clay thickener or diammonium phosphate with a guar gum derivative thickener. These are not only less toxic but act as fertilizers to help the regrowth of plants after the fire. Fire retardants often contain wetting agents, preservatives and <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and are colored red with ferric oxide or fugitive color to mark where they have been dropped. Brand names of fire retardants for aerial application include Fire-Trol and Phos-Chek.|$|R
25|$|A {{common use}} of sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is in the}} production of parts washer detergents. Parts washer detergents based on sodium hydroxide {{are some of the most}} aggressive parts washer cleaning chemicals. The sodium hydroxide-based detergents include surfactants, <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and defoamers. A parts washer heats water and the detergent in a closed cabinet and then sprays the heated sodium hydroxide and hot water at pressure against dirty parts for degreasing applications. Sodium hydroxide used in this manner replaced many solvent-based systems in the early 1990s when trichloroethane was outlawed by the Montreal Protocol. Water and sodium hydroxide detergent-based parts washers are considered to be an environmental improvement over the solvent-based cleaning methods.|$|R

40|$|In the {{machining}} of metals, fluids {{are used as}} lubricants, chip removers, <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> and coolants. A variety of machining fluids are used based on compatibility with the metal and {{the machining}} process. After a part has been machined it often must be cleaned to ensure the success of further processing steps (such as electroplating). Historically firms have cleaned work-pieces in degreasers containing chlorinated solvents. Under the Montreal Protocol companies ’were required to phase-out production of 1, 1,l-TCA (trichloroethane) and chlorofluorocarbons (e. g., CFC- 113) by 1995.

5000|$|Anti-Friction (AF) {{coatings}} are [...] "lubricating paints" [...] {{consisting of}} fine particles of lubricating pigments, such as molydisulfide, PTFE or graphite, blended with a binder.

Many dry film lubricants also contain special <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitors</b> which offer exceptional corrosion protection. Most long-wearing films are of the bonded type but are still restricted to applications where sliding distances are not too long. AF-coatings are applied where fretting and galling is a problem (such as splines, universal joints and keyed bearings), where operating pressures exceed the load-bearing capacities of ordinary oils and greases, where smooth running in is desired (piston, camshaft), where clean operation is desired (AF-coatings will not collect dirt and debris like greases and oils), and where parts may be stored {{for long periods of}} time.|$|R
50|$|Underbalanced {{drilling}} {{is usually}} {{more expensive than}} conventional drilling (when drilling a deviated well which requires directional drilling tools), and has safety issues of its own. Technically the well is always in a blowout condition unless a heavier fluid is displaced into the well. Air drilling requires a faster up hole volume as the cuttings will fall faster down the annulus when the compressors are taken off the hole compared to having a higher viscosity fluid in the hole. Because air is compressible mud pulse telemetry measurement while drilling (MWD) tools which require an incompressible fluid can not work. Common technologies used to eliminate this problem are either electromagnetic MWD tools or wireline MWD tools. Downhole mechanics are usually more violent also because the volume of fluid going through a downhole motor or downhole hammer is greater than an equivalent fluid when drilling balanced or over balanced {{because of the need}} of higher up hole velocities. Corrosion is also a problem, but can be largely avoided using a coating oil or <b>rust</b> <b>inhibitors.</b>|$|R
