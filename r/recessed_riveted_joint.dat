40|$|This project {{deals with}} the stress {{analysis}} of <b>riveted</b> lap <b>joints.</b> The present work involves the appropriate configuration and characterization of these joints for maximum utilization. By using finite element method, stress and fracture analyses are carried out under both the residual stress field and external tensile loading. Using a two step simulation, riveting process and subsequent tensile loading of the lap joint are simulated to determine the residual and overall stress state. Residual stress state due to riveting is obtained by interference and clamping misfit method. By employing different interference and clamping misfit values, the effects of riveting process parameters on stress state are examined. Two cracks namely the semi elliptical surface crack at faying surfaces of plates and the quarter elliptical corner crack at rivet hole are the most widely observed crack types in <b>riveted</b> <b>joints.</b> Fracture analysis of cracked <b>riveted</b> <b>joints</b> is carried out by introducing these two crack types to the outer plate at a plane perpendicular to the loading.

40|$|<b>Riveted</b> lap <b>joints</b> {{are being}} used {{traditionally}} for long in the aerospace industry. These joints are the crucial zones that are designed under damage tolerance procedures in the civil aircraft industry. Conventional design procedures of <b>riveted</b> lap <b>joints</b> {{are based on the}} assumption that all rivets carry equal load. As this assumption is not entirely valid as found in research literature associated with fatigue and fracture, it is important to investigate this point in terms of the static strength of the <b>riveted</b> <b>joint</b> as well. Hence, in the present study, <b>riveted</b> <b>joint’s</b> static strength experiments and numerical studies are carried out on four different (single and multi-row) <b>riveted</b> lap <b>joints</b> with strain gauges placed at specified locations. The experiments show that all the <b>riveted</b> lap <b>joints</b> sustained the estimated ultimate load and failed only after reaching or exceeding the joint failure load. All these <b>riveted</b> lap <b>joints</b> are analyzed by non-linear finite element method, considering the rivet yielding, plate yielding, geometrical nonlinear and secondary bending effects of the lap joint. The analysis of <b>riveted</b> lap <b>joints</b> shows that though there is unequal load distribution among the rivets in the elastic regime, once the rivets start yielding, significant redistribution of the load takes place among the rivets and the load sharing between the rivets is nearly equal at the failure load of the joint. The agreement between the finite element analysis strains and experimental strains is reasonably good at the failure load and this in conjunction with the aforementioned experimental finding proves that the rivets share nearly equal load at the joint failure load and justifies the conventional design methodology of <b>riveted</b> <b>joints.</b> To the authors’ knowledge no previous research evidence for such correlation was found and this paper confirms conventional design procedures are adequate, though complex interactions between the plate and rivets tend to exist based on non-linear behavior. ...|$|R

In some aspects, this kind of union has a superior performance {{when compared to other}} connections, like glued bond joints (which have lower mechanical and thermal resistances) and screwed joints (which may have an inferior performance to fatigue behavior). Nonetheless, due to their geometrical characteristics, stress concentrations inevitably occur, which contributes to fatigue crack initiation and, eventually, to a catastrophic failure. Today, the vast dissemination of finite element codes makes the numerical {{analysis of}} these joints much more expeditious. On the other hand, if not well conducted, FE analyses become expensive and laborious, besides generating results not always satisfactory. In this work, 3 D numerical models of <b>riveted</b> <b>joints</b> produced according to aeronautic procedures and requirements were built, employing different parameter and strategies. The results were compared to experimental data, obtained from test machine transducers (force and displacement) and the use of strain-gages, with the purpose of comparing the models’ performance from the accuracy and computational cost point of views. Thus, the aim of this work is to determine the best procedure to conduct a FE analysis of a <b>riveted</b> <b>joint,</b> and which parameters must be considered to reach accurate and reliable results...|$|R
