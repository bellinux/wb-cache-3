40|$|Abstract Background Contrary to {{recommendations}} {{in a national}} clinical guideline, baseline audits from five community-based stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>teams</b> demonstrated an evidence-practice gap; only 17 % of eligible people with stroke were receiving targeted rehabilitation by occupational therapists and physiotherapists to increase outdoor journeys. The primary aim of this feasibility study was to design, test, and evaluate the impact of an implementation program intended to change the behaviour of community <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>teams.</b> A secondary aim was to measure {{the impact of this}} change on client outcomes. Methods A before-and-after study design was used. The primary data collection method was a medical record audit. Five community <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>teams</b> and a total of 12 professionals were recruited, including occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and a therapy assistant. A medical record audit was conducted twice over 12 months (total of 77 records pre-intervention, 53 records post-intervention) against a guideline recommendation about delivering outdoor journey sessions to people with stroke. A behavioural intervention (the 'Out-and-About Implementation Program') was used to help change team practice. Active components of the intervention included feedback about the audit, barrier identification, and tailored education to target known barriers. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of medical records containing evidence of multiple outdoor journey sessions. Other outcomes of interest included the proportion of medical records that contained evidence of screening for outdoor journeys and driving by team members, and changes in patient outcomes. A small sample of community-dwelling people with stroke (n = 23) provided pre-post outcome data over three months. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and t-tests. Results Medical record audits found that teams were delivering six or more outdoor journeys to 17 % of people with stroke pre-intervention, rising to 32 % by 12 months post-intervention. This change represents a modest increase in practice behaviour (15 %) across teams. More people with stroke (57 %) reported getting out of the house as often as they wanted after receiving the outdoor journey intervention compared to 35 % one year earlier; other quality of life outcomes also improved. Conclusions The 'Out-and-About Implementation Program' helped <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>teams</b> to change their practice, implement evidence, and improve client outcomes. This behavioural intervention requires more rigorous evaluation using a cluster randomised trial design. </p...|$|R

40|$|For {{older people}} who have had a stroke, {{appropriate}} housing can promote independence and well being. However, suboptimal team accommodation recommendations may result in placement of an individual where their needs are not met, and their skills are not maximized. Although clinical judgments regarding patient discharge are routinely made by <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>teams,</b> this area has received limited research attention. This study examines how <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>teams</b> determine the most appropriate housing to recommend to stroke patients after their discharge from hospitals. A Social Judgment Theory approach was used to document and analyze the accommodation recommendations and policies of 13 <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>teams</b> (clinician n = 74). Teams were asked to consider 50 hypothetical stroke patients, and determine the most appropriate discharge housing to recommend to these patients. Each stroke patient was described in terms of 8 attributes: mobility status, ability to manage their own affairs, patient's choice of housing, personal activity of daily living (ADL) skills, domestic and community ADL skills, general health status, social situation, and premorbid living arrangements. Clinicians were provided with a response scale on which to record their recommendations. The results showed considerable yet reliable differences among teams concerning recommendations made, and judgment policies adopted. Although the highly structured and hypothetical nature of this research limits the external validity of findings, the results suggest that teams may also face difficulties with housing recommendations in the more complex clinical environment. Further studies to assess actual clinical team decision making are needed. Such studies could lead {{to the development of a}} standardized research-based protocol to help teams formalize and optimize their housing recommendations. © 1995 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: During {{transition}} to adulthood young adults {{with disabilities are}} at risk of experiencing limitations due to changing physical and social requirements. Purpose: To determine whether young adults with transversal upper limb reduction deficiency (tULRD) have experienced limitations in various domains of participation during {{transition to}} adulthood and how they dealt with these limitations. Participants: Fifteen participants (mean age 21. 4 years) with tULRD. Methods: A qualitative study was performed using a semi-structured interview based on the Rotterdam Transition Profile to identify the limitations experienced in participation domains. Results: Almost all the participants reported difficulties in finding a suitable study or job. Most young adults were convinced they were suitable for almost any study or job, but their teachers and potential employers were more reserved. Few difficulties were reported on the domains leisure activities, intimate relationships/sexuality, housing/housekeeping and transportation. Participants preferred to develop their own strategies for dealing with limitations.

40|$|Background and Purpose The best {{treatment}} {{and management of}} stroke patients {{has been shown to}} be in stroke units by multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>teams.</b> Since the composition of stroke units differs it is important to know the extent to which the different components contribute to this result. Physiotherapy is one component of most <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>teams</b> and recent systematic reviews have shown that patients with stroke receiving more physiotherapy achieve more recovery from disability. However, information about the actual amounts of physiotherapy needed to achieve this result is not known. Method A pragmatic, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial comparing recovery from disability in subjects receiving the current standard amount of 30 minutes' physiotherapy with those receiving double that amount (60 minutes). The study included measures of physical performance and function, psychological aspects of anxiety and depression, and perceived control over recovery. Results Some 114 subjects were recruited to the study; full six-week data are available for 104 subjects and six-month data for 93 subjects. Comparison of initial to six-week difference scores in the control and intervention groups of the whole sample did not show a significant difference. Scrutiny of the recovery curves of the whole sample showed that, in half the sample, three distinct patterns of recovery were demonstrated. Conclusion These results suggest that doubling the physiotherapy time available for patients in a stroke unit will not provide a measurable benefit for all patients. The subgroup analysis of patterns of recovery must be regarded as speculative, but provides the basis for hypotheses about those likely to respond well to more intensive therapy...|$|R
