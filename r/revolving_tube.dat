25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the flyer frame where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the cap frame the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The <b>revolving</b> <b>tube</b> and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|E
2500|$|At launch, the ship's {{armament}} {{consisted of}} a single 4-inch Mark VIII gun, three 12-pounder guns, a [...]303-inch Maxim gun, two [...]303-inch Lewis guns, and three <b>revolving</b> torpedo <b>tubes</b> for 18-inch torpedoes. Four depth charge chutes were installed in 1917, although two were later removed in 1919. Two depth charge throwers were added during a 1918 refit; at the same time, one of the torpedo tubes was removed.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{stability}} of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was studied in high vacuum using tungsten nanoparticles as miniaturized thermal probes. The particles {{were placed on}} CNTs inside a high-resolution transmission electron microscope equipped with a scanning tunneling microscope unit. The setup allowed manipulating individual nanoparticles and heating individual CNTs by applying current to them. CNTs were found to withstand high temperatures, up to the melting point of 60 -nm-diameter W particles (~ 3400 K). The dynamics of W particles on a hot CNT, including particle crystallization, quasimelting, melting, sublimation and intradiffusion, were observed in real time and recorded as a video. Graphite layers reel off CNTs when melted or premelted W particles <b>revolve</b> along the <b>tube</b> axis...|$|R
40|$|Facts in {{the real}} {{condition}} is show that the little entrepreneur using the conventional devices in small village for make “es puter”, causes the worker have many complaint while making “es puter”. Appear this complaint can make musculoskeletal injury for the worker. As {{a result of this}} activitythere are many complaints with the most dominant of complaints occur in the neck, arm, wrist, knee, and ankle. That injuries happen while <b>revolve</b> the ice <b>tube,</b> the process experience friction with ice in the outside of the tube. In this research have done identify desire and expectation of worker had done with interview, and the result is translated become necessity and become a concept of design device. The second phase is determinate device dimension base on anthropometric dimension. The last phase is making machining “Es Puter”. The result is “es Puter” machine with revolve mechanism using motor with 1400 rpm, is reduction became 70 rpm, and the production cost Rp 3. 557. 400, 00. This device giving repair in processing position in making “Es Puter” then can decrease musculoskeletal injury, as well as have safety, comfortable, and can shorten production time became 1 hour...|$|R
5000|$|A {{detailed}} description was provided in British Husbandry, {{sponsored by the}} Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, The operation of trussing is in England performed with great nicety, and is so well deserving of imitation, that a description of it cannot be considered misplaced. The cutting is commenced at that end which is the least exposed to the weather, and should be begun at the left-hand corner. The binder begins by forming [...] "thumb-bands" [...] of the most inferior hay for tying up the trusses; in making which he is assisted by a boy, who holds both ends of a wisp of damped hay between his hands. He then catches the wisp with the crook of an implement called in different places, a [...] "twiner", a [...] "throw-crook", or a [...] "windle" [...] which is made, like fig. 1., of a circular piece of iron about {{a foot and a}} half long, inclosed in a hollow tube of wood as at a. This he grasps with his left hand, and then turning the handle b, the crook <b>revolves</b> in the <b>tube,</b> and the band is instantaneously twisted.This done, he measures the cut to be made in the stack, which is decided by the usual size of the trusses — each being as nearly as possible three feet by two and a half, and thick in proportion to the fineness and closeness of the hay; those of the best quality being the thinnest. He then mounts the ladder and cuts perpendicularly through the thatch, as far down as will produce the requisite number of trusses. This he does with a very strong and sharp knife, about thirty inches in length by nearly six in breadth of the blade, and formed as in fig. 2. The handle is however often made short and straight from the blade, but the form above represented allows of more power being exerted by the workman in cutting through the stack, and it is an operation which demands considerable strength.Having cut the necessary quantity, he next uses an iron spike, nearly three feet in length, with a small handle at the top, as at fig. 3. which he thrusts into the truss, and thus separates it in nearly its exact weight from the stack; afterwards laying it upon two of the bands, which have been previously stretched upon a weighing machine, of the annexed form, and furnished with a 56 lb. weight, though steelyards are sometimes used, but are not more convenient, while they are more expensive. The machine can be made by any common carpenter of a size to hold a truss of hay, the height about four feet, and of proportionate length, for less than fifty shillings.The truss is then encircled by the bands, at about 10 inches from each end, being afterwards turned under, as a tie, in the same manner as those of sheaves of corn. An expert hay-binder can thus truss two loads in his day's work; and the common price, if done by the job, is 2s. 6d. per load. It will be readily conceived that this mode is preferable to that of delivering hay loose; for although it occasions the charge of binding, it yet secures it from every kind of waste: it is accurately weighed, securely loaded upon the cart, occupies the smallest space, and can be easily carried or delivered, without difficulty, through a loft window.|$|R
