40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} a review of three {{investigations}} of fatal air transport aircraft accidents and two reports of near fatal air transport aircraft incidents. All of the accident and incident reports reviewed found that the Air Transport rated pilots who caused the accidents and incidents were deficient in manual flightpath control skills. The study identified the following areas of manual flightpath control skill deficiencies: stall recovery, <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>attitudes,</b> flightpath control for visual landing approaches, and rudder control during engine failure. Recommendations for training and checking procedures to address these skill deficiencies are proposed. Training recommendations include: exposure to novel, unexpected stalls and unusual attitudes, sudden failure of auto flight systems during critical phases of flight, and increased practice of rudder control techniques during engine failures. Checking procedures should be modified to include closer evaluation of. all manual flightpath control skills...|$|E

40|$|The {{information}} architecture of general aviation cockpits is shifting {{from one of}} independent mechanical instruments to one of digital sensors, common databuses, and liquid crystal displays. This integrated architecture presents an opportunity to improve general aviation safety through enhancements to the flight display utilizing the data, computing power, and display capabilities available on a modem integrated cockpit. A study of general aviation accident causes identified takeoff and climbout, stall, and spatial disorientation as potential root causes that could be addressed with enhancements to the Primary Flight Display of an integrated general aviation cockpit. To address these accident causes, four prototype enhancements were designed, implemented on a PFD, and flight tested in a single-engine general aviation aircraft. A Takeoff Performance Monitor prototype demonstrated the usefulness of automating the published takeoff distance calculation required of, but seldom performed by, pilots and also showed that performance deficiencies {{as small as a}} 10 % reduction in power can be detected within the first few seconds immediately after throttle-up. The prototype was also able to predict takeoff distance in real-time within 200 feet by 55 knots using a simple acceleration model. A Dynamic Stall and V-Speeds prototype calculated stall speeds, best angle of climb speed, best rate of climb speed, and best glide speed given the current flight conditions and marked them on the airspeed indicator. Subject pilots reported the speeds aided in maintaining awareness of stall margin and optimal performance conditions. (cont.) An Angle of Attack Estimator that used a speed-based method and an angle-based method to compute the angle of attack using only the data available on the PFD without additional sensors was prototyped along with two means of display; a traditional angle of attack gauge and a Pitch Limit Indicator. Both estimator methods were compared to an angle of attack vane during a series of maneuvers. It was shown that a speed-based angle of attack estimator along with the pitch limit indicator is a useful stall avoidance aid. Finally, an Unusual Attitude Alerting prototype provided specific verbal cues over the intercom when pitch or roll limits were exceeded to aid a pilot in <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>attitudes.</b> Subject pilots preferred alerts that commanded the recovery maneuver over alerts that informed the pilot of the attitude but left the recovery procedure to the pilot, and preferred both to alerts that simply told the pilot to recover without specific information about the attitude. by Daniel R.

40|$|Unsuccessful <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> <b>unusual</b> flight <b>attitudes,</b> or airplane upset, is {{considered}} {{an important factor in}} civil aviation accidents. It is generally recognized that there is a clear need for enhanced training of <b>recovery</b> procedures <b>from</b> <b>unusual</b> flight <b>attitudes,</b> i. e. situations where an aircraft unintentionally exceeds the parameters of the normal flight envelope. Exercising these conditions in the real world is unsafe, expensive and, if performed in smaller aircraft, not representative of the situation in commercial aircraft. Ground-based simulation of these extreme conditions is an interesting alternative for pilot instruction. However, at present, hexapod-based flight simulators used for pilot training are not certified for this purpose. Desdemona, a novel simulation facility, offers an extended motion envelope with enhanced motion capabilities which may prove adequate to simulate upset recovery events. The six degrees-of-freedom motion system features a gimbaled gondola which allows for unlimited rotation about three axes. In addition, the gondola can move up and down along a 2 m long heave axis, and horizontally along an 8 m long linear track. This track can be rotated on a planetary axis so as to produce a sustained linear acceleration up to 3 G. The cockpit contains a projection system for out-the-window imagery, and can be reconfigured into different cockpit layouts. Desdemona has become operational in January 2008. This paper discusses the preliminary concepts for the simulation of upset recovery conditions based on the unique Desdemona motion features. This paper also introduces the motion envelope of upset conditions in support of pilot training...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{collaborative}} European research project ‘Simulation of UPset Recovery in Aviation’ (SUPRA) is to develop breakthrough simulator technologies for teaching pilots to detect and recover from adverse flight upsets {{that could lead to}} <b>unusual</b> <b>attitudes</b> and loss-of-control. In the project, the high-performance research simulator DESDEMONA is utilized, which integrates a flight simulator having a six-degrees-of-freedom motion platform with a sustained acceleration capability up to 3. 0 g. These characteristics result in improved simulation of motions encountered in upset conditions, compared to conventional fixed base or hexapod simulators. This paper describes a study consisting of two experiments to determine how accurate pilots can judge and reproduce a specific G-level in the DESDEMONA simulator, and respectively, how their control behavior depends on G-forces during <b>unusual</b> <b>attitude</b> recovery. In total seventeen civil pilots, without previous G-maneuvering experience, participated in the study. The results show that pilots without previous G-exposure tend to overestimate G-levels based on their seat-of-the-pants, resulting in performance below the target G-level. With minimum training, their performance instantly improved up to adequate level. However, a retest after six months showed that this improvement did not endure. With respect to aircraft control during <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> a nose-low <b>unusual</b> <b>attitude,</b> the pilots showed significantly better performance with G-cueing simulation, in terms of deviation from the target G-load, compared to fixed-base simulation in which they tend to ‘over-G’. It can be concluded that G-cueing simulation results in improved upset recovery performance of civil pilots compared to Fixed-base simulation. Hence, simulation of upset recovery with G-cueing may result in more realistic and adequate recovery training...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two simulator experiments {{studying how}} accurately pilots can judge and reproduce specific g loads {{and how their}} control behavior depends on the sensation of physical g loads during <b>unusual</b> <b>attitude</b> recovery. Seventeen commercial pilots participated. The first experiment shows that pilots tend to overestimate g loads, resulting in performance below the target g load. With brief training, their performance instantly improved up to adequate levels. However, a retest after 6 months shows that this improvement did not endure. The second experiment shows that centrifuge-based g cueing helps pilots to recover <b>from</b> a nose-low <b>unusual</b> <b>attitude,</b> with significantly smaller deviations and within the limit load, whereas in the fixed-base condition they tend to pull almost 20 % too much g load. It is concluded that physical g cueing results in improved upset recovery control and may contribute to more realistic and adequate recovery training.

Phosphorous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies of gastrocnemius and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles showed no abnormalities at rest. During aerobic exercise there was an abnormally rapid decrease in phosphocreatine concentration but the pH remained within the normal range. There was a build-up of phosphomonoester (probably glucose 6 -phosphate), usually indicative of a block in glycolysis.
