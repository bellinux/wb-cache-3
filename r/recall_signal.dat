5000|$|Iron Man {{was present}} in the Red Onslaught's {{concentration}} camp when the Scarlet Witch cast the inversion spell that finally defeated him. The day was saved, but now, he sees things differently. Flying over San Francisco, he delivers a mobile device app that gives the user free access to Extremis 3.0, along with {{instructions on how to}} use it to change your body into whatever you want. One week later, Iron Man teams up with She-Hulk on the streets of San Francisco. A kid has been exposed to gamma radiation, gained a monstrous visage and some super-strength, and has started wrecking the street and calling himself [...] "Teen Abomination" [...] (who resembles a teenage version of Abomination). Iron Man starts lecturing the new villain about the importance of branding, but he is met with a blow that takes his head clean off only for Iron Man to reveal that he is controlling the armor remotely. Teen Abomination is stunned by the revelation long enough for Iron Man to incapacitate him with a uni-beam. In the aftermath, She-Hulk lectures Iron Man about using too much force, and vocally disapproves of his callous behavior. From his swimming pool, Tony sends a remote <b>recall</b> <b>signal</b> and the armor returns to the lab. Pepper Potts comes to the pool and tells Tony that she needs to talk to him in private. Tony says he will meet her inside. An hour later, he saunters in rather than immediately. Pepper notices that he has started drinking again. Tony shows her the latest Iron Man suit, which is going to replace the Model 42: the Endo-Sym Armor. A liquid smart-metal design, it utilizes elements of symbiotes and its boot process is fully psionic. Pepper cuts out his spiel about its aesthetic appeal by accusing him of not considering the ramifications of giving everyone with a smartphone access to Extremis. Everyone who had no way of accessing the app is the city's new underclass, while everyone who had access to the app has become part of a wave of orgiastic irresponsibility that has swept the city. On a street corner, a gang of Extremis-enhanced urbanites corner a homeless woman and accuse her of blemishing their perfect future. Before the second punch is thrown though, they are accosted by Daredevil who promises violence if they don't disperse. Suddenly, the leader of the mob keels over in pain. People around the city do the same as Tony explains to Pepper the second part of his strategy to leverage Extremis to provide Stark Industries (as he still calls it) with a large amount of money. Every single Extremis enhancile in San Francisco writhes on the pavement as their biology subtly rewrites itself to default. Every single mobile device in the city pings explaining through a new message that their trial period has expired, and that to continue, they must pay $99.99 per day. Putting on his Endo-Sym Armor, Tony decides to {{get a good look at}} the city from the air. That night, Pepper discusses Tony's condition with someone. She says that years ago, Tony said his greatest fear was not that someone would take the contents of his life and use it against him, but rather that something would take his mind, and use him to destroy his life. Pepper believes that this has happened and that she and her co-conspirator need to activate [...] "the contingency." [...] Her ally steps from the shadows revealing that the unnamed person is wearing an early Iron Man suit as he agrees with her.|$|E

40|$|Navigation is a {{foundational}} {{skill for}} animals. From insects to birds to mammals, many animals have developed various strategies {{to search for}} that which they require, remember its location, then safely return home. Discovering some of the techniques these animals use has yielded unique solutions for the navigational problems of artificial autonomous systems. Yet many questions remain unanswered regarding the navigational abilities that so many animals appear to possess. One such ability is path encoding and recall - learning a set of places in an environment and the connectivity between those places, then using the resulting graph or map for myriad goals. Empirical data collected {{over the past century}} indicates that some animals, and specifically rodents, are capable of behaviours difficult to reconcile with non-path-based explanations. In more recent decades, since the discovery of spatially sensitive 2 ̆ 7 place cells 2 ̆ 7 in the rat brain, it has become clear that the hippocampus plays a significant role in map-based navigation. Simultaneously developing in the field of mobile autonomous systems have been algorithmic techniques to solve a similar map-based navigation problem, termed Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), which highlight the information-theoretical principles involved. The goal of this thesis has been to explore, using spiking neural modelling techniques, how the electrophysiological and anatomical properties of the rodent hippocampus can satisfy the theoretical requirements of an online path learning and recall system. Recognition of novelty is a key element of any memory system. In particular, it is a core component both in learning and recognising locations and in linking locations into paths. Existing studies have demonstrated learning mechanisms capable of developing appropriate unique memories, and corresponding recall mechanisms capable of ignoring random variance in the input. These features are necessary for navigational memory from a theoretical perspective, and also provide a good fit for some electrophysiological data. However these studies have not addressed the issue of when each process, learning and recall, should occur. The first part of this thesis extends existing models of the hippocampal network, incorporating the timing of individual spikes, and using this extra dimension to provide an internal novelty signal. It demonstrates how a network that matches known hippocampal anatomy can instigate a race between a teaching signal and <b>recall</b> <b>signal,</b> with the teaching signal winning the race only {{in the case of a}} novel input. Using this novelty signal, what constitutes a novel input can itself be modified dynamically, without destabilising the system. In a navigational context, individual memories can be likened to place, and sequences of such memories to paths. The predominant interpretation of the spatial selectivity of place cells is that these cells are 2 ̆ 7 coding for 2 ̆ 7 the location of the animal at the time of their firing. Beyond this pure spatial selectivity, evidence demonstrates that during traversal of a cell 2 ̆ 7 s place field, its firing precesses with respect to the local theta oscillation - an effect termed 2 ̆ 7 theta phase precession 2 ̆ 7 - and this precession is correlated with relative progression through the place field. One common interpretation of this precession effect is that it provides a greater degree of locational specificity. The remainder of this thesis explores an alternative hypothesis that place fields and theta phase precession are evidence of a path encoding and recall mechanism. A mechanism based on the known anatomy of CA 3 is proposed that is consistent with many dynamical properties of the region and can explain known variations in spatial selectivity across the CA 3 network. The proposed mechanism suggests that CA 3 performing path encoding and recall over complete foraging ranges could be the functional justification for anatomical and dynamical variation across the region. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the implications of this theory on the interpretation of place cell data, and an outline of experimental designs for its validation...|$|E

After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat--the swiftest keeled of all--seemed to have succeeded in fastening--at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens.

But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail--stunsail on stunsail-- after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out.

Yet there is little empirical evidence that legislators actually adjust their voting behavior in response to partisan and ideological shifts in the electorate.

40|$|Abstract. The {{misclassification}} error {{which is}} usually used in tests to compare classification algorithms, {{does not make a}} distinction between the sources of error, namely, false positives and false negatives. Instead of summing these in a single number, we propose to collect multivariate statistics and use multivariate tests on them. Information retrieval uses the measures of precision and <b>recall,</b> and <b>signal</b> detection uses true positive rate (tpr) and false positive rate (fpr) and a multivariate test can also use such two values instead of combining them in a single value, such as error or average precision. For example, we can have bivariate tests for (precision, recall) or (tpr, fpr). We propose to use the pairwise test based on Hotelling’s multivariate T 2 test to compare two algorithms or multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to compare L> 2 algorithms. In our experiments, we show that the multivariate tests have higher power than the univariate error test, that is, they can detect differences that the error test cannot, and we also discuss how the decisions made by different multivariate tests differ, to be able to point out where to use which. We also show how multivariate or univariate pairwise tests can be used as post-hoc tests after MANOVA to find cliques of algorithms, or order them along separate dimensions. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{forgetting the}} details of events from one’s {{personal}} past is generally viewed as a negative outcome, it may serve an adaptive function, especially when the environment contains inescapable reminders of negative events. M. C. Anderson and Huddleston (2012) proposed that repeatedly suppressing thoughts of an autobiographical experience eventually leads to its persistent forgetting and that individuals might purposefully suppress thoughts of negative autobiographical experiences to promote emotional stability and resilience in response to fre-quent reminders. Although their review reveals plentiful evi-dence for the effectiveness of suppression-induced forgetting (SIF) of laboratory materials, associated effects on autobio-graphical memory and the concomitant emotional impact seemed to have gone undiscovered. We therefore developed a method to initiate their investigation and applied it to memo-ries generated by dysphoric and nondysphoric students in response to emotional and nonemotional cues. To vary retrieval suppression, we used the think/no-think (TNT) suppression paradigm developed by M. C. Anderson and Green (2001).

Let us <b>recall</b> the echo <b>signal</b> model. The SAR echo is one of electromagnetic wave forms, and Maxwell’s equations are the basic and accurate tools for electromagnetic wave measurement. Mathematically, the SAR imaging procedure is an inverse problem of the electromagnetic wave. Many mathematical and practical researchers are interested in these types of inverse problems [1 – 5].|$|R
30|$|Each domain is {{a subset}} of the domain’s true expanse. The reason is that some cells close to the {{periphery}} of each domain have very low signal-to-noise ratio (<b>recall</b> that the <b>signal</b> decays to zero at the periphery and so the average correlation between those cells with the rest of their domain does not exceed the δ threshold). More quantitatively, the inferred domains include about 80 %- 90 % of the ground-truth cells in each domain. In non-overlapping regions this fraction is higher (85 %- 95 % of the cells), while in overlapping regions it drops to 45 %- 80 %. The extent of overlapping regions is harder to correctly identify especially when a domain (e.g., domain 2) overlaps with a stronger domain (e.g., domains 1 or 3); the stronger domain effectively masks the signal of the weaker domain. The average pairwise cross-correlation of the cells in each domain varies between 55 %- 70 % in the ground-truth data, while the inferred domains have slightly higher average cross-correlation (65 %- 75 %) due to their smaller expanse.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} continuous telemetric trans-abdominal fetal electrocardiogram (a-fECG) in women undergoing labour induction at home. Study Design: Low risk women with singleton term pregnancy undergoing labour induction with retrievable, slow-release dinoprostone pessaries (n = 70) were allowed home for up to 24 hours, while a-fECG and uterine activity were monitored in hospital via wireless technology. Semi-structured diaries were analysed using a combined descriptive and interpretive approach. Results: 62 / 70 women (89 %) had successful home monitoring; 8 women (11 %) were <b>recalled</b> because of <b>signal</b> loss. Home monitoring lasted between 2 – 22 hours (median 10 hours). Good quality signal was achieved {{most of the time}} (86 %, SD 10 %). 3 women were recalled back to hospital for suspicious a-fECG. In 2 cases suspicious a-fECG persisted, requiring Caesarean section after recall to hospital. 48 / 51 women who returned the diary coped well (94 %); 46 / 51 were satisfied with home monitoring (90 %). Conclusions: Continuous telemetric trans-abdominal fetal ECG monitoring of ambulatory women undergoing labou...|$|R
5000|$|At 7.30 am the {{bombardment}} {{stopped and the}} four waves of the battalion rose and advanced into a devastating hail of machinegun bullets and artillery fire. They were caught in machinegun fire from their exposed left and their front. The third and fourth waves were cut in half before they even reached No-Mans land. A few survivors {{made it to the}} German wire (uncut) and on the right wing some even found their way into the German front line. Few of these were able to return. Corporal Outram, a <b>signaller,</b> <b>recalled</b> that; [...] "as {{far as the eye could}} see, the last two men left standing on the battlefield were himself and another signaller, A. Brammer. They signalled to each other. Outram turned his head for a moment, and when he looked back Brammer had gone."The remnants of the battalion were taken out of the line on the evening of 3 July, having lost 513 officers and men killed, wounded or missing; a further 75 were slightly wounded.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after noon}} on 8 March, the tug was moored to a wharf at Newport News, Virginia, when the {{quartermaster}} spotted some black smoke {{near the mouth}} of the Elizabeth River. Zouave got underway and headed across Hampton Roads to investigate. Soon observers on the tug could make out [...] "what to all appearances looked like the roof of a very big barn belching forth smoke as from a chimney on fire." [...] After a Confederate flag came in view, the men on Zouave concluded that the strong looking craft was the long expected Southern ironclad CSS Virginia—the rebuilt Merrimack—finally emerging to challenge the Union blockaders. Zouave then opened up with her 30-pounder Parrott rifle and fired about a half-dozen rounds before she was <b>recalled</b> by a <b>signal</b> hoisted on board Cumberland. By this time, the Union warships in Hampton Roads and batteries at Newport News had also opened fire on the Southern ironclad. When Virginia reached a position abreast of Congress, she fired a broadside into that Union frigate and headed straight for Cumberland.|$|R
