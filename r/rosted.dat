Conclusions are drawn about <b>Rost’s</b> contribution specifically in terms of implications for researching leadership development which focuses beyond leaders, developing theories in terms of a kaleidoscope metaphor and the particular relevance of <b>Rost’s</b> writings to leadership development within public and voluntary sectors...|$|R

5000|$|From {{the start}} {{the library was}} open to all citizens. At the time most lending {{libraries}} charged a membership fee, {{making it impossible for}} poorer people to access them. However, the initial collection was largely made up of texts in German, French, Latin and Danish and was therefore largely only of interest to members of the educated upper class. In 1802 it was decided to move the library to the Oslo Cathedral School and to merge it with the school's collection. Jacob <b>Rosted</b> was both librarian of the Deichman Library and rector of the school. The library remained part of the school until the mid 1800s, when it go its own premises. Under the leadership of Haakon Nyhuus, who was head librarian from 1898-1913, the library became a model for public libraries throughout the Nordic region. Nyhuus modernised the library along American lines, having spent eight years in America and been inspired by [...] Carnegie libraries. Among his innovations were the introduction of reading rooms and the addition of books for children and young people. During Nyhuus' time as librarian, the collection tripled in size and the borrowing of books increased by 25 times. The library had an estimated 4000 visitors a day. The library now has a bust of Nyhuus.|$|E
