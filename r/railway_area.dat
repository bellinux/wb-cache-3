40|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>areas</b> are {{considered}} as large greenspaces and are recognized important {{in improving the}} biodiversity and dynamic of urban flora. In this study, we examined the flora composition and diversity along intra-city railway lines in Lublin, SE Poland and Lviv, W Ukraine. The flora has been analyzed in terms of species composition (multivariate ordination techniques), life span, life form, type of pollination mode, seed dispersal, life strategy sensu Grime, hemerophoby, urbanity degree, {{and in terms of}} habitat preferences using ecological indicator values. The multivariate analysis (CCA) clearly revealed that abiotic factors (topographical), weather elements (annual precipitation and air temperature), and soil attributes (moisture, trophy, pH, salinity) differed between two cities and impacted on the differences in railway flora composition. Plants growing on the intra-urban <b>railway</b> <b>areas</b> are mainly hemicryptophytes/perennials, C, CR, CRS-strategists, insect-, self-, or wind-pollinated, reproducing by seeds and mainly dispersed by wind. Intra-urban <b>railway</b> <b>areas</b> are predominated by native species, however the participation of invasive alien species is higher than their proportion in domestic floras. The share of invasive species is greater in <b>railway</b> <b>areas</b> of Lviv, ca. 12 % (45 species) compared to 8 % in Lublin (36 species). Spontaneous flora in intra-urban <b>railway</b> <b>areas</b> represent distinct adaptations to unique urban-industrial ecosystems with different degree of anthropogenic disturbance...|$|R

The invasive species list was similar for the two cities, with the most invasive species occurring at both (81. 4 %), 8. 5 % occurring only in Lublin and 10 % only in Lviv. The proportion of invasive species in the total flora was almost 1. 5 -fold higher at Lviv compared to Lublin. Invasive species have originated mainly from continental America (45. 7 %), followed by Asia and Eurasia. The participation of invasive plants derived from Asia and Eurasia at Lviv is higher than at Lublin. The invasive flora includes {{a wide range of}} taxonomic groups, with a predominance of Asteraceae and Poaceae.

40|$|La relazione tra sviluppo della rete del trasporto su ferro ed espansione della città è da sempre molto stretta. Tra “città” e “ferrovia” si instaura un rapporto di sinergia e  complementarietà, che talvolta si trasforma in una difficile convivenza. In Italia, negli ultimi decenni, l’ammodernamento delle infrastrutture ed il riassetto della rete ferroviaria ha portato alla dismissione di numerosi scali. Ciò ha reso possibile la messa a punto di programmi che prevedono una loro riconversione a nuovi usi. Gli interventi che riguardano le aree ferroviarie possono avere una duplice origine: progetti che prendendo spunto dalla opportunità di ammodernamento o realizzazione di una nuova stazione coinvolgono anche le aree limitrofe o programmi che riguardano vaste aree dismesse o in via di dismissione occupate da fasci di binari, depositi e capannoni, ecc. Le aree ferroviarie dismesse presentano caratteristiche che consentirebbero un loro riuso all’interno di un piano complessivo che utilizzi come elemento qualificante la possibilità di operare contestualmente sul sistema dei trasporti e sulle scelte urbanistiche. La riqualificazione di queste aree potrebbe essere il terreno di sperimentazione di progetti di riconversione che operano anche scelte di radicale ridisegno delle reti del trasporto pubblico. Il contributo, partendo da queste premesse, illustra i programmi messi a punto per gli scali ferroviari dismessi di Milano e Firenze. The {{relationship}} between railways network development and urban sprawl {{has always been}} very close. A relationship of synergy and complementarity, which sometimes becomes a difficult cohabitation, between the “city “ and the “railroad” is established: {{the presence of the}} service and infrastructure networks can represent a weakness for achieving a balanced development, or even a factor of risk and of environmental pollution. In Italy, in the last decades, the modernization of infrastructures and the reorganization of the railway network led to the abandonment of many areas. This has made possible the setting up of programs aimed at achieving the conversion of the former <b>railway</b> <b>areas</b> to new land uses. Interventions regarding the <b>railway</b> <b>areas</b> may have a double origin: projects inspired by the opportunity to upgrade or to build up a new station that also involve the surrounding areas or programs that cover wide abandoned or being abandoned areas occupied by bundles of tracks, stores and warehouses, etc [...] The disused <b>railway</b> <b>areas</b> have characteristics that would allow their reuse within a comprehensive plan based on the possibility of working at the same time on the transport system and on the land use planning. The redevelopment of these areas could be the testing ground of transformation projects involving also the radical re-design of public transport networks. The paper, starting from these assumptions, is focused on the programs developed for the disused <b>railway</b> <b>areas</b> in Milan and Florence. In Milan, many transformation projects start from the abandonment of the <b>railway</b> <b>areas.</b> Here earlier than in other Italian cities, programs aimed at working simultaneously on the reorganization of the transport system and on large real estate development initiatives have been implemented. In 2005, the Municipality of Milan and the Ferrovie dello Stato Group SpA (the Italian Infrastructure Manager) signed a Framework Agreement referred to stations and areas no longer useful for the railway service, located in different districts of the city and covering a total area of about 1. 300. 000 square meters. The stated objective of the agreements was to organize the urban development of the disused <b>railway</b> <b>areas</b> with the enhancing of the public transportation rail in Milan. Even {{in the case of the}} city of Florence, disused <b>railway</b> <b>areas</b> have long been the subject of agreements among local authorities and the Ferrovie dello Stato group. The incoming of the high-speed train in the urban area has been the opportunity to redefine the rail system mobility not only of the entire city but also of its metropolitan area. Within this comprehensive project, in the 2008 a Memorandum of Intent has been signed by the Municipality, the Region, the Province and the Ferrovie dello Stato group, referred to the <b>railway</b> <b>areas,</b> covering a total surface of about 267. 000 square meters, mainly located in the center of the city...|$|R

50|$|The railway line {{is perhaps}} the most {{difficult}} new railway line project undertaken on the Indian subcontinent. The terrain passes through the young Himalayas which are full of geological surprises and numerous problems. The alignment for the line presents one of the greatest railway engineering challenges ever faced, with the only contest coming from the Qingzang Railway in Tibet that was completed in 2006 and crosses permanently frozen ground and climbs to more than 5000 m above sea level. While the temperatures of the <b>railway</b> <b>area</b> are not as severe as in Tibet, it does still experience extreme winters with heavy snowfalls. However, what makes the route even more complex is the requirement to pass through the Himalayan foothills and the mighty Pir Panjal range, with most peaks exceeding 15000 ft in height.|$|E
50|$|However, {{around this}} area, {{there were several}} dozen villages more or less prosperous, such as Mallickerbaag, Kanchanpalli or Kanchrapara, Bhabanipur, Ghoshpara Chandua and Kampa.

In 1914 a carriage and wagon shop were added. Subsequently, a planned Railway Township was laid and built to the East & South West of the Workshops {{with a wide range}} of infrastructure - roads, drains, bridges, street lights, internal Railway lines, parks, Institutes, Administrative Buildings, Technical School, Hospital, Co-operative shopping stores, Bazaar, playgrounds for football, Tennis, golf, theatres attached to each institute (Hindmarsh, Institute, Bell Institute, Spalding Institute), Officers’ Club etc. The resulting population increase caused the construction of huts and pucca buildings, necessitating laying out Municipal infrastructure beyond the <b>Railway</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
