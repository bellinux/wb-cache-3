50|$|It took Saints until 1983 {{to return}} - albeit {{for a single}} season - before setting a record through {{suffering}} two successive <b>relegations</b> <b>in</b> 1984 and 1985.

50|$|<b>Relegation</b> <b>in</b> 1974 was {{a warning}} and {{although}} N.E.C. were promoted {{a year later}} eventually finishing seventh, the club trajectory was heading the wrong way. Each year, the team fought against relegation and fewer spectators watched their matches. During this period, N.E.C. ended every season as either a top club in the first division or a bottom club in the major league. In little over a decade, they changed leagues six times: <b>relegation</b> <b>in</b> 1983, promotion <b>in</b> 1985, <b>relegation</b> <b>in</b> 1986, promotion <b>in</b> 1989, <b>relegation</b> <b>in</b> 1991, and finally promotion in 1994. N.E.C. suffered many difficult years and disappeared almost from professional football from time-to-time. In 1981, the club were given support from the town when the professionals and amateurs separated. In 1987, the club was declared bankrupt, but N.E.C. remained existent only because 80% of creditors waived their claims.|$|R
