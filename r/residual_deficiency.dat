40|$|We {{introduce}} a new real valued invariant for finitely presented groups called <b>residual</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Its main property is the following. Let G be a finitely presented group. If the <b>residual</b> <b>deficiency</b> of G is greater than one, then G has a finite index subgroup with deficiency greater than one. The latter property is strong. For instance, such a group is large, has positive rank gradient and positive first L^ 2 -Betti number, among other properties. We also compute the <b>residual</b> <b>deficiency</b> of some well known families of presentations, prove that <b>residual</b> <b>deficiency</b> minus one is supermultiplicative with respect to finite index normal subgroups and find lower bounds for the <b>residual</b> <b>deficiency</b> of quotients.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} growth of very low birthweight (VLBW) {{children}} in early adolescence with that of their normal birthweight peers; to examine the role of factors contributing to growth-parental height, perinatal variables, bone maturity and sexual maturation; to examine the correlation between head growth and cognitive and educational outcome. METHODS: Standing and sitting heights, weight, occipito-frontal circumference (OFC), skinfold thicknesses and pubertal staging were assessed in 137 VLBW children and 160 controls at 11 - 13. 5 years of age. Ninety six (70 %) of the VLBW children had their bone age assessed using the TW 2 method. Reported parental heights were obtained by questionnaire. All children had standardised tests of cognitive and educational ability. Perinatal data had been collected prospectively {{as part of a}} longitudinal study. RESULTS: VLBW children had lower heights, weight, and OFC. Skinfold thicknesses were no different. The children's short stature was not accounted for by difference in parental height, degree of pubertal development, or by retarded bone age. Indeed, the TW 2 RUS score was significantly advanced in the VLBW children. Using the bone ages to predict final adult height, 17 % have a predicted height below the third centile and 33 % below the tenth. Weight was appropriate for height, but there was a <b>residual</b> <b>deficiency</b> in OFC measurements after taking height into account. In the VLBW group smaller head size was associated with lower IQ and mathematics and reading scores. CONCLUSIONS: Growth problems persist in VLBW children and final heights may be even more abnormal than present heights suggest. VLBW children have smaller OFCs than expected from their short stature alone and this may be associated with poorer educational and cognitive outcomes...|$|E

40|$|A high {{proportion}} of clinically successful rotator cuff repairs are left with <b>residual</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in the cuff itself. 8, 9 Suture anchor fixation for rotator cuff repairs has gained popularity in the recent past. Several studies have investigated the biomechanical characteristics of rotator cuff repairs {{in an effort to}} identify possible sites of failure. These sites have included failure via suture cutting through bone tunnels, suture breakage, knot slippage, suture anchor pullout, and soft tissue failure at the suture-tendon junction. Meyer et al 11 recently detailed that suture breakage at the anchor eyelet may in fact be a significant concern for the strength of soft tissue repairs using suture anchors. They tested 22 different metallic suture anchors loaded with No. 2 braided nonabsorbable suture material. In every case, the suture broke at the anchor eyelet at up to 73 % lower loads than when the suture was tested on a smooth hook. We hypothesized that a previously unrecognized phenomenon {{may play a role in}} the failure mode of rotator cuff repairs: varying the depth of suture anchor insertion. Two variables may play a role in exposing the suture/anchor eyelet to untoward forces. First, Roth et al have shown that anchors inserted into the glenoid settle to the cortical surface with cyclic loading. 14 This settin...|$|R
40|$|Emergence, as a {{relatively}} new concept in the natural and social sciences, has multiple meanings. As an analogical philosophical concept which consciously resists the dialectical opposition of reductive physicalism and immaterial dualism for the understanding of physical reality, it presupposes an evolutionary world view which is open-ended in its mode of operation rather than conceptually closed. Within such an open-ended world view, the implicit paradigm for the dialectical relationship between the One and the Many will necessarily {{be different from the}} corresponding paradigm for that relation within a closed metaphysical system. The {{purpose of this article is}} to set forth an understanding of the relation between the One and the Many that rationally justifies an open-ended, process-oriented metaphysics which in turn confirms the proposed validity of that same paradigm for the understanding of physical reality from an evolutionary perspective. Hence, I first lay out the historical development of the classical paradigm for the One and the Many in Western philosophy and at the same time point to its <b>residual</b> <b>deficiencies</b> for a full explanation of physical reality. Then I sketch what I see as a new paradigm for understanding the relation between the One and the Many which does not prioritize either the One over the Many or the Many over the One but sees them as intrinsically interdependent for their existence and intelligibility. Finally, I apply this revised understanding of the relation between the One and the Many to analysis of the generic notion of emergence in the natural sciences. Further application of this new paradigm for the relation between the One and the Many within each of the natural sciences and within the social sciences and the humanities will inevitably involve many other individuals than the author. </em...|$|R
40|$|Residuals {{generated}} by the society through its production and consumption activities are discharged to the water, air and land resulting in the degradation of the ambient environmental quality. The economics of this problem is recognized to stem from the divergence between private and social costs leading to overproduction and consumption and hence resource misallocation in the economy. Most traditional analysis of environmental problems have been confined to resolving externalities involving a single <b>residual.</b> Two <b>deficiencies</b> must be recognized at the outset in such an approach. First, the degree of 2 ̆ 7 third pary 2 ̆ 7 effect depends on the characteristic of the residual which can generally be described by an n-component vector of concentration of different constituents and therefore, each constituents present in the residual needs to be given attention. Secondly, any treatment of residuals generate other different forms of residuals. In other words, there exists a trade-off between residuals that {{can be described in}} terms of a transformation function. Therefore policies aimed at mitigating external effects will have to necessarily take into account the residual modification processes. This study attempts to present an approach incorporating these concepts to determine suitable management schemes for the growing regional economy of the eastern part of Utah...|$|R
40|$|Cointegration is an {{important}} topic for timeseries, and describes a relationship between two series in which a linear combination is stationary. Classically, the test for cointegration {{is based on a}} two stage process in which first the linear relation between the series is estimated by Ordinary Least Squares. Subsequently a unit root test is performed on the <b>residuals.</b> A well-known <b>deficiency</b> of this classical approach is that it can lead to erroneous conclusions about the presence of cointegration. As an alternative, we present a framework for estimating whether cointegration exists using Bayesian inference which is empirically superior to the classical approach. Finally, we apply our technique to model segmented cointegration in which cointegration may exist only for limited time. In contrast to previous approaches our model makes no restriction on the number of possible cointegration segments. 1...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the validity of an integrated treatment protocol for correction of this facial deformity. A retrospective study was performed on adult HFM patients who received two-jaw orthognathic surgery combined with facial contouring procedures in the first stage, and fat injection for the <b>residual</b> facial <b>deficiency</b> in the second stage. Inclusion criteria were patients treated by the same surgeon and follow-up at least 6 months. The demographic, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected. We defined a facial surface area discrepancy index (FDI) for objective assessment of the symmetry between the affected and non-affected side, and utilized visual analogue scale (VAS) for subjective evaluation of facial asymmetry before and after surgical treatment. A total of 14 patients were included. The mean age at orthognathic surgery was 21. 7 years. Four patients were categorized as Pruzansky-Kaban type I, while the remaining 10 patients were type II (7 patients type IIA, 3 patients type IIB). Fat injection as a secondary procedure was performed in eleven cases (79 %). The mean pre- and postoperative FDI was 87. 6 ± 6. 3 and 95. 4 ± 5. 2 with a significant advance for symmetry (p < 0. 001). The pre- and postoperative VAS for asymmetry was 7. 2 ± 1. 7 and 3. 8 ± 2. 4 respectively, with a significant improvement (p = 0. 002).

40|$|Introduction. Patients {{with severe}} {{combined}} immunodeficiency (SCID) may present with residual circulating T cells. While all cells are functionally deficient, resulting in high susceptibility to infections, only some of these cells are causing autoimmune symptoms. Methods. Here we compared T-cell functions including the number of circulating CD 3 + T cells, in vitro responses to mitogens, T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, TCR excision circles (TREC) levels, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) enumeration in several immunodeficinecy subtypes, clinically presenting with nonreactive <b>residual</b> cells (MHC-II <b>deficiency)</b> or reactive cells. The latter includes patients with autoreactive clonal expanded T cell and patients with alloreactive transplacentally maternal T cells. Results. MHC-II deficient patients had slightly reduced T-cell function, normal TRECs, TCR repertoires, and normal Tregs enumeration. In contrast, patients with reactive T cells exhibited poor T-cell differentiation and activity. While the autoreactive cells displayed significantly reduced Tregs numbers, the alloreactive transplacentally acquired maternal lymphocytes had high functional Tregs. Conclusion. SCID patients presenting with circulating T cells show different patterns of T-cell activity and regulatory T cells enumeration that dictates the immunodeficient and autoimmune manifestations. We suggest that a high-tolerance capacity of the alloreactive transplacentally acquired maternal lymphocytes represents a toleration advantage, yet still associated with severe immunodeficiency...|$|R

40|$|Maize is the world’s {{third most}} {{important}} cereal after wheat and rice. It {{serves as a}} staple food to more than 1. 2 billion of the world population. However, its production is threatened by declining soil fertility; mainly due to low inputs of fertilizers containing major elements to replenish lost soil nutrients and unsustainable soil tillage practices linked to mono-cropping. To examine the influence of N, P and K and residual compost on maize growth and yield, an experiment was carried out at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria. Utilizing the long-term maize trial, controls (0 and W), seven inorganic fertilizer treatments (N, P, K, NP, NK, PK & NPK) and seven organic + inorganic fertilizer treatments (WN, WP, WK, WNP, WNK, WPK & WNPK) were used. The influence of these fertilizer and residual compost treatments on maize seed viability (germination), plant growth, reproductive development, pollen performance, grain yield parameters, yield and grain yield water-use efficiency was investigated. Higher seed viability was associated with balanced soil nutrient status (WNPK & NPK), whilst deficient soil nutrient status (0, N, P & K) resulted in lower seed viability. Plant growth (plant height, total dry mass and LAI) and reproductive development (tassel length, ear length, and days to tasseling and silking) were positively influenced by a balanced soil nutrient status and <b>residual</b> compost. <b>Deficiencies</b> in soil nutrients restricted maize plant growth and delayed reproductive development. This highlighted {{the importance of a}} balanced soil nutrient status in attaining a vigorous crop and good reproductive development. Soil nutrient deficiencies (0, P & K treatments) enhanced the production of pollen (mass per plant), but resulted in low pollen quality (viability and germination). Balanced soil nutrient status (WNPK & NPK) resulted in the production of high quality pollen (viability and germinability), which however had a low mass. In both 2012 / 2013 and 2013 / 2014 seasons, maize grain components; cob length, number of kernel rows per cob, number of kernels per row, mass per kernel and mass of 100 kernels were positively influenced by balanced soil nutrient status. Grain yield and water use efficiency were also positively influenced by a balanced soil nutrient status (WNPK & NPK), whilst deficient soil nutrient status had a negative effect.

40|$|Nicotianamine chelates and {{transports}} micronutrient metal ions in plants. It {{has been speculated}} that nicotianamine is involved in seed loading with micronutrients. A tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) mutant (chloronerva) and a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) transgenic line have been utilized to analyze the effects of nicotianamine loss. These mutants showed early leaf chlorosis and had sterile flowers. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has four NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE (NAS) genes. We constructed two quadruple nas mutants: one had full loss of NAS function, was sterile, and showed a chloronerva-like phenotype (nas 4 x- 2); another mutant, with intermediate phenotype (nas 4 x- 1), developed chlorotic leaves, which became severe upon transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase and upon iron (Fe) <b>deficiency.</b> <b>Residual</b> nicotianamine levels were sufficient to sustain the life cycle. Therefore, the nas 4 x- 1 mutant enabled us to study late nicotianamine functions. This mutant had no detectable nicotianamine in rosette leaves of the reproductive stage but low nicotianamine levels in vegetative rosette leaves and seeds. Fe accumulated in the rosette leaves, while less Fe was present in flowers and seeds. Leaves, roots, and flowers showed symptoms of Fe deficiency, whereas leaves also showed signs of sufficient Fe supply, as revealed by molecular-physiological analysis. The mutant {{was not able to}} fully mobilize Fe to sustain Fe supply of flowers and seeds in the normal way. Thus, nicotianamine is needed for correct supply of seeds with Fe. These results are fundamental for plant manipulation approaches to modify Fe homeostasis regulation through alterations of NAS genes...|$|R
40|$|Background Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is a {{congenital}} disorder {{characterized by}} craniofacial malformation {{of one or}} {{both sides of the}} lower face. Since these anomalies are associated with soft-tissue deficiencies, corrective surgery is often difficult. Bone grafts have typically been used for augmentation, but distraction osteogenesis now offers an alternative for many craniofacial deficiencies, but there are few if any appropriate distraction devices and surgical procedures for the augmentation of craniofacial transversal dimensions. Methods The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a technique for guided augmentation of craniofacial transversal dimensions through distraction osteogenesis. We tested the efficacy of a prototype distractor, developed in collaboration with Medartis, using cadavers and demonstrated its application for the correction of the transverse dimension of the temporozygomatic region in a patient with Goldenhar syndrome. Results CT scans showed a 4 -mm transverse augmentation of the bony surface after 9 days and a 10 -mm increase after 30 days. Upon removal of the distractor (60 days after the first surgery) CT indicated good bony fusion and a stable result in the transverse plane. Six months after removal of the distractor, 3 D computed tomography confirmed the success of the transverse augmentation, as it appeared to be stable and reliable. Conclusions Distraction osteogenesis, using our device, can be used to correct the transverse dimension of the temporozygomatic region in HFM patients. It should also be considered for the correction of <b>residual</b> postsurgical skeletal <b>deficiency</b> due to surgical relapse or deficient growth, and unsatisfactory skeletal contour. © 2013 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

The aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether the routine semiquantitative fluorescent spot test could detect all cases of G 6 PD deficiency, including those cases with partial <b>deficiency</b> (<b>residual</b> red cell G 6 PD activity between 20 - 60 % of normal). We compared the results of G 6 PD screening by the semiquantitative fluorescent spot test and quantitative G 6 PD activity assay on a group of 976 neo-nates and 67 known female heterozygotes. The values for mean G 6 PD activity of G 6 PD-normal neonates and 293 healthy adult females were determined. There was no significant difference in the mean normal G 6 PD activity between the two racial groups in the neonates (669 Malays, 307 Chinese) and in the 293 healthy adult females (150 Malays, 143 Chinese) group. The values for the upper limits of total deficiency (20 % of normal residual activity) for neonates and adult females were 2. 92 U/gHb and 1. 54 U/gHb, respectively. The upper limits of partial deficiency (60 % of normal residual activity) were 8. 7 U/gHb and 4. 6 U/gHb respectively. The prevalence of G 6 PD deficiency among the male neonates was 5. 1 % (26) by both the fluorescent spot test and the enzyme assay method. The G 6 PD activity levels of all 26 cases of G 6 PD-deficient male neonates were < 20 % normal (severe enzyme deficiency).

40|$|The {{mitochondria}} {{are essential}} for cellular energy production and are involved in many processes in the cells. The mitochondria contain their own DNA (mtDNA) that is vital for oxidative phosphorylation since it encodes enzymes of the respiratory chain. Mutations in the mtDNA and alterations in the mtDNA copy number are attributed to various human disorders including cancer. Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by severe depletion of the mtDNA. MDS predominantly manifests in high energy demanding tissues such as the skeletal muscle, brain and liver. Mutations in the genes {{that are responsible for}} providing precursors for the mtDNA synthesis such as thymidine kinase 2 (TK 2) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) are known to cause MDS. In an attempt to rescue the mtDNA depletion caused by thymidine kinase 2 (Tk 2) deficiency in mice, the deoxyribonucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) was expressed in the Tk 2 deficient mice (Dm-dNK+/-Tk 2 -/-). The Dm-dNK+/- expression was able to rescue the Tk 2 -/- mice and prolong their life span from 3 weeks to up to 20 months. The Dm-dNK expression driven by the CMV promoter was observed in all tissues with highest expression in skeletal muscle and lower expression in heart, liver and adipose tissues. Dm-dNK+/-Tk 2 -/- mice maintained normal mtDNA levels in the skeletal muscle and liver throughout the observation time of 20 months. The Dm-dNK expression resulted in highly elevated dNTP pools with dTTP pools being > 100 times higher than in the wild type mice. However, the large increase in the dTTP pool did not cause mutations in the nuclear or the mitochondrial DNA. A significant reduction in total body fat (both subcutaneous and visceral fat) was observed only in the Dm-dNK+/-Tk 2 -/- mice compared to wild type mice, which indicates an altered fat metabolism in these mice mediated through <b>residual</b> Tk 2 <b>deficiency.</b> To elucidate effective treatment strategies for TK 2 deficiency, a novel mouse model with liver specific expression of Dm-dNK driven by the albumin promoter was generated. Two founder mice with high Dm-dNK expression and activity in the liver was selected for further characterization. These mice will be used to study whether Dm-dNK expression in a single tissue would be able to rescue the sever phenotype caused by Tk 2 deficiency in mice. The mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier, SLC 25 A 10, is involved in the transport of dicarboxylates such as malate and succinate across the mitochondrial inner membrane. To understand the role of the SLC 25 A 10 carrier in regulating cancer cell growth, metabolism and transformation, a knockdown of SLC 25 A 10 in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A 549) was established and characterized. The growth properties of SLC 25 A 10 knockdown cells changed to a less malignant phenotype, with increased dependency on glutamine and altered NADPH production. An increase in expression of glutamate dehydrogenase and decrease in expression of lactate dehydrogenase indicated a metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in the SLC 25 A 10 knockdown cells.

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, a number of {{terminal}} deficiencies of the short arm of chromosome 9 have been isolated. Each deficiency arose as the consequence of a meiotic breakage of the short arm of chromosome 9 following crossing over in plants homozygous for a chromosome 9 with a duplication of the short arm or for a structural rearrangement of the segments of chromosome 9. In each case, {{the extent of the}} deficiency was determined at pachytene in the F 1 plants which had received a normal chromosome 9 from one parent and a recently broken (deficient) chromosome from the other parent. Tests showed that deficiencies which ranged from minute to one-third of the distal segment of the short arm were all female transmissible. Those which extended into the first distinct chromomere were transmissible through the pollen. None of the longer terminal deficiencies were male transmissible. Because of the male and female transmission of the very short terminal deficiencies, plants which were heterozygous for these deficiencies were self-pollinated to determine if viable endosperms and embryos could be obtained which were homozygous for these deficiencies. In these F 1 plants, the normal chromosome carried c and the deficient chromosome carried C. The C mutant is located in the short arm within the 5 th or 6 th chromomere from the distal end. In these F 1 plants, 30 individuals were classified as having received a broken chromosome 9 which was deficient for only the knob. Self-pollinations of these heterozygous deficient plants gave typical ratios of 3 C to 1 c. The endosperms and embryos in both classes of kernels were normal. Plants arising from both the C and c kernels were likewise normal in appearance. Cytological examination of some of these F 2 plants showed the presence of the two deficient chromosomes 9. It may be concluded that a homozygous deficiency of the knob does not obviously alter the appearance and functioning of any tissues. Seven of the original F 1 plants were classified as having a chromosome 9 which was deficient for the knob and the adjacent segment of thin chromatin which joins the knob with the first distinct chromomere. Self-pollinations of these plants likewise gave typical ratios of 3 C to 1 c. The endosperms and embryos were normal in appearance. In all 7 cases, the seedlings arising from these kernels segregated in the ratio of 3 green to 1 pale-yellow. The pale-yellow seedlings are normal in morphology but die following exhaustion of food supplies in the kernels. Linkage of the pale-yellow phenotype with C, carried by the deficient chromosome, was obvious in each case. Through genetic and cytological means, it was possible to determine in each case that the recessive pale-yellow phenotype is produced {{as a consequence of the}} homozygous deficiency. Intercrosses between plants heterozygous for these 7 pale-yellow mutants showed that all 7 were either identical or allelic. The recessive mutant yg 2 is known to be located close to the end of the short arm of chromosome 9. Combinations of a chromosome 9 carrying yg 2 with any of the 7 deficient chromosomes 9 produced only normal green seedlings and plants. It may be concluded that the deficiencies which produce the pale-yellow phenotype are not long enough to include the Yg 2 locus. In six F 1 plants, the broken chromosome 9 was classified as being deficient for a terminal segment which extended into and included a part of the first distinct chromomere. These deficiencies were slightly longer than those which produced the pale-yellow phenotype. Following self-pollinations of these plants, normal F 2 ratios of 3 C to 1 c appeared in four of the six cases and a slight reduction of the C class in two of these cases. When these kernels were germinated, white seedlings segregated in ratios expected from a recessive mutant. In all cases, linkage of the white seedling mutants with C was obvious. It was possible to determine for each case that the white seedling phenotype resulted when these seedlings were homozygous for the deficient chromosomes 9. Intercrosses of heterozygous deficient plants of all 6 cultures were made to determine the allelic relations of the white seedling mutants. White seedlings segregated in the F 1 following all 15 combinations, indicating that the white seedling mutants were allelic if not identical. Intercrosses between plants heterozygous for the 7 pale-yellow producing deficiencies and the 6 white producing deficiencies gave rise to the typical pale-yellow phenotype in one-fourth of the progeny of all 42 crosses. It was determined that the pale-yellow phenotype arose following combinations of the two deficient chromosomes in a zygote. Thus, the deficiency mutants pale-yellow and white are allelic. Pale-yellow is dominant over white. This would be expected because the <b>residual</b> homozygous <b>deficiency</b> following combinations of the two deficient chromosomes is only that which would produce the pale-yellow phenotype. Plants heterozygous for the 6 white seedling producing deficiencies were crossed by plants homozygous for yg 2. In the progeny of all 6 crosses, a ratio of 1 green plant to 1 yellow-green plant appeared. Appropriate tests showed that the yellow-green plants were those which had received the deficient chromosome 9 from the heterozygous parent. Therefore, it may be concluded that the white mutants are allelic to yg 2, with yg 2 dominant over white. This would be expected if the nominal deficiencies causing the white seedling mutants included the locus of Yg 2. From the point-of-view of genetic analysis, the pale-yellow and white seedling mutants are comparable in all ways to other known recessive mutants in maize. The allelic expressions of pale-yellow and white and yg 2 and white, and the non-allelic expression of pale-yellow and yg 2 would be difficult to interpret following a purely genetic analysis. These results are readily interpretable when the cytological conditions are known. The phenotypic expression following combinations of any two of the three mutants may be considered a reflection of the residual effects of over-lapping deficiencies. The mutants pale-yellow and white are repeatedly produced following the meiotic breakage of chromosome 9. Among 2577 such recently broken chromosomes 9 which were tested, 55 gave rise to the pale-yellow phenotype and 33 to the white phenotype. In contrast to most mutation inducing agents, the chromosomal breakage mechanism is a "mutation" inducing process which "induces" the same mutant time and again...|$|R
