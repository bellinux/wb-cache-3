5000|$|... "Hyperventilation" [...] can be {{achieved}} through delivery of (1) too many breaths per minute; (2) breaths that are too large and exceed the patient’s natural lung capacity; or (3) a combination of both. With use of manual resuscitators, neither rate nor inflating volumes can be physically controlled through built-in safety adjustments within the device itself, and as highlighted above, studies show providers frequently exceed designated safety guidelines for both ventilation rate (10 breaths per minute) and volume (5 - 7 mL / kg body weight) as outlined by the American Heart Association [...] and European Resuscitation Council. [...] Numerous studies have concluded that ventilation at rates in excess of current guidelines are capable of interfering with blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, however the pre-clinical experiments associated with these findings involved delivery of inspiratory volumes in excess of current guidelines (e.g., they assessed the effects of hyperventilation via both excessive rate and excessive volumes simultaneously). A more recent study published in 2012 expanded knowledge on this topic by evaluating the separate effects of (1) isolated excessive rate with guideline-compliant inspiratory volumes; (2) guideline-compliant rate with excessive inspiratory volumes; and (3) combined guideline non-compliance with both excessive rate and volume. [...] This study found that excessive rate more than triple the current guideline (e.g., 33 breaths per minute) may not interfere with CPR when inspiratory volumes are delivered within guideline-compliant levels, suggesting that ability to keep breath sizes within guideline limits may individually mitigate clinical dangers of excessive rate. [...] It was also found that when guideline-excessive tidal volumes were delivered, changes in blood flow were observed that were transient at low ventilation rates but sustained when both tidal volumes and rates were simultaneously excessive, suggesting that guideline-excessive tidal volume is the principal mechanism of side effects, with ventilation rate acting as a multiplier of these effects. [...] Consistent with previous studies where both excessive rate and volumes were found to produce side effects of blood flow interference during CPR, a complicating factor may be inadequate time to permit full expiration of oversized breaths in between closely spaced high-rate breaths, leading to the lungs never being permitted to fully exhale between ventilations (also called [...] "stacking" [...] of breaths). [...] A recent advancement {{in the safety of}} manual ventilation may be the growing use of time-assist devices that emit an audible and/or visual metronome tone or flashing light at the proper guideline-designated <b>rate</b> <b>interval</b> for breath frequency; one study found these devices may lead to near 100% guideline compliance for ventilation rate. [...] While this advancement appears to provide a solution to the [...] "rate problem" [...] associated with guideline-excessive manual resuscitator use, it may not address the [...] "volume problem" [...] which may continue to make manual resuscitators a patient hazard (as complications can still occur from over-inflation even when rate is delivered within guidelines).|$|E

Differences in data between groups were compared using t-test. ResultsThe epilepsy group had a lower mean heart <b>rate</b> <b>interval</b> and a lower high frequency power. ConclusionsPatients with FLE have interictally faster heart rates, attributed to lower parasympathetic drive, which may contribute to the higher incidence of sudden death that is seen in this group of patients.

40|$|To obtain {{more and}} {{accurate}} biogenic {{volatile organic compound}} (BVOC) emission rates for more plant species in China and further improve the accuracy of emission rates used in BVOC emission inventories, we conducted field measurements and developed a statistical approach for estimating representative emission rates. We performed field measurements of BVOC emissions from 50 plant species at nine locations in China using our established semi-static enclosure system. The emissions of 102 VOCs, including isoprene, α -pinene, β -pinene, and other VOC species, were analyzed with a custom-built online gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector system. From the results, broadleaf trees were the greatest potential emitters of isoprene, while needle-leaf trees emitted more pinene. Shrubs had lower isoprene and pinene emission potentials, but higher emission potentials for other VOCs. Methyl methacrylate, isopropylbenzene, isopentane, acetone, ethane, propane, toluene, and xylene were the dominant species among other VOCs, probably with high emission intensities. Therefore, their emissions {{should be considered in}} future global and regional BVOC estimation studies. Next, we summarized our field measurements along with reported emission rates from China and abroad. The emission intensity categories were produced based on statistics, with more detailed categories, accurate emission <b>rate</b> <b>intervals</b> and representative <b>rates</b> compared to previous studies. The results showed that the BVOC emission intensities of plants displayed different categories, such as lowest, lower, low, moderate, high, higher, and highest.

The {{aim of this study}} has been to further explore the underlying nature of the epimerases, some of which are thought to create G-subunits by moving processively along the alginate chains. The smallest epimerase from the mannuronan C- 5 genes, know to form polyalternating alginate structures (PolyMG), AlgE 4, as well as AlgE 6, which manly introduce long G-block stretches, were further investigated. Moreover, two synthetically created epimerases, AlgE 46 and AlgE 64, were provided by the department of Biotechnology, NTNU. Investigation of the synthetic epimerases may provide insight into the importance of the structural composition of the mannuronan C- 5 epimerases. Dynamic force spectroscopy of single-molecule measurements between the substrate chains PolyM and PolyMG, and the epimerases AlgE 4, AlgE 6, AlgE 46 and AlgE 64 were carried out using the optical tweezers.

Finally, for the synthesized epimerases, binding strengths ranging from 2 &# 8722; 6. 5 pN, 4 &# 8722; 9. 5 pN and 3 &# 8722; 8 pN at loading <b>rate</b> <b>intervals</b> 10 &# 8722; 450 pN/s, 10 &# 8722; 240 pN/s and 50 &# 8722; 300 pN/s were measured for the AlgE 46 -mannuronan, AlgE 64 -mannuronan and AlgE 64 -PolyMG, respectively. All epimerases, whether naturally occurring or synthetically created, were shown tobind stronger to PolyM than to PolyMG. Furthermore, single energy barriers were located between 0. 6 &# 8722; 1. 35 nm for all investigated complexes. The interplay of non-covalent interactions between the complexes (indicated by the location of the energy barriers), as well as the bond lifetimes were consistently greater for the complexes involving PolyM, than for the ones involving PolyMG. Although certain tendencies were observed when comparing naturally occurring epimerases with the synthesized ones, no &# 64257;rm conclusion could be drawn to the underlying nature of the di&# 64256;erent structural components of the mannuronan C- 5 epimerases. However, ongoing NMR-spectroscopy studies on AlgE 64 and AlgE 46 may provide more information concerning the epimerization process of mannuronan/polyalternating alginates, such that the obtained observation from this study can be put in a biological context. Lastly, the AlgE 4 epimerase was concluded to processively epimerize mannuronan to form polyalternating alginate chains. Similar conclusions for the other epimerases could not be drawn since information regarding the catalytic constants of the epimerization process of a single M-residue for these epimerases are not accessible in the litterature. </p...|$|R
