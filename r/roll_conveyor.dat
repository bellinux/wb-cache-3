The problem arises because consumers are at geographically separate locations, this has resulted in the need to store inventory at multiple locations so as to cause problems in coordinating the management of the distribution system marketing, {{as well as on the}} production that will produce the best products. It required a good distribution system and supply products appropriate to the level of customer satisfaction and corporate profits can awake. CV. Dawn Prosperous Engineering is a manufacturing company engaged in the field of industrial coatings <b>Roll</b> <b>Conveyor</b> and Rubber Packing, distribution the company is based at the request of the customer. Inside This company has not found the existence of a planning and scheduling product distribution activities are well coordinated, so the demand for each type of product resulting in less controlled delays in product distribution. Given these problems, it carried out the planning and distribution scheduling methods Distribution Requirements Planning (DRP). It is expected that the planning and scheduling of distribution activities well, success in meeting customer demand will become more optimal, improved sales performance in fulfilling orders in a timely manner and the right amount so that distribution costs can be minimized. The results of the research showed that scheduling activities for the distribution <b>Roll</b> <b>Conveyor</b> products in March 2012 as the delivery to Pasuruan 140 units, Malang as many as 119 units, as many as 131 units Mojokerto, Jombang as many as 136 units and as many as 142 units Kediri.

40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of new variants and continuously decreasing lot sizes following the paradigm of individualized production require the frequent reconfiguration of assembly systems. Albeit advances in ‘plug and produce’, current assembly systems remain limited when additional processes, changes in process sequence or processing time are required. This limitation is caused by physical constraints related to the typically employed fixed transfer systems (e. g. <b>roll</b> <b>conveyors)</b> and temporal constraints resulting from line balancing. Based on {{a review of the}} state of the art a framework is proposed to assess the adaptability of different flexibilisation approaches to industrial assembly. The matrix-shaped framework covers different levels of production systems from work stations to production networks on one axis and considers three different objects, i. e. technical resources, organization, and control and traceability on the second axis. Different criteria for assessment are assigned to each field of the matrix. Based on requirements derived from literature and discussions with experts from different industries it is concluded that the paradigm of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS) is suitable for adaption to small-lot and small to medium series assembly. Key boundary conditions for the application are outlined and further research topics to enable the application in industrial assembly are identified...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{boundary}} layers over a continuous moving or stretching surface {{is important in}} several engineering processes. For example, materials manufactured by extrusion processes and heat treated materials travelling between a feed roll and a wind-up <b>roll</b> or on <b>conveyor</b> belts have {{the characteristics of a}} continuous moving or stretching surface. Sakiadis [1] and Crane [2] were probably the first to study the boundary layer flow over a continuously moving or a stretddng surface in an ambient fluid.

5000|$|Valu-Mart was a {{chain of}} {{discount}} stores founded in Seattle in 1958. [...] Its parent company was Weisfields Jewelers. For many years Weisfields was a store that carried jewelry, as well as televisions (many Seattle residents purchased their first television set from them), radios, stereos, and other consumer electronics products. Once Valu-Mart was put into place, Weisfields strictly became a jewelry store. The chain also had stores in Oregon, where they originally were named Villa-Mart.Separate grocery sections in the stores featured curbside grocery (or parcel) pickup by placing the grocery bags into numbered bins that <b>rolled</b> onto a <b>conveyor</b> allowing the customer to drive {{up to the front}} of the store to pick them up by giving the attendant a plastic card with the numbered bin they used. The groceries were then loaded into the car usually by store employees.|$|R
50|$|Riders {{begin by}} {{climbing}} 65 {{feet to the}} top of the Blastenhoff tower. Two-passenger rafts are brought {{to the top of}} the tower on a conveyor belt. After passengers board and once the blocking systems indicates the channel ahead is clear, a small <b>conveyor</b> <b>rolls</b> the raft forward into the first drop — the ride's largest. At the bottom of the drop, water jets propel the raft uphill into a small dip and then another short uphill section. The raft then enters an enclosed tube section and travels 190 degrees back the other direction. This section features two drops and two uphill blasts followed by a right turn in an enclosed tube. Upon exiting the tube the raft drops downhill, turns right again then drops downhill a second time. Another uphill blast leads to a downhill section then the final uphill blast sends the rafts into an enclosed tube with a right turn helix followed by a left turn then a final small drop into the splash pool.|$|R
40|$|For {{measuring}} the straightness of moving steel beams, a methodology {{was developed and}} an inspection machine was built {{with a set of}} image processing tools to control it. The method consists in developing a specific software to perform three main tasks: reading the position of the beams in several positions; correlating all those positions monitored by the cameras; and reporting the quality of the beam straightness. Computer vision technology as a non contact measuring device is used by the inspection machine. From the production process the beams <b>roll</b> on a <b>conveyor</b> therefore several video cameras are used to log information not only about the lateral position but also the height of the steel beams. The user can decide the number of cameras and the distance between them. Should one camera fail or be switched off, the measuring system is not affected as long as the system has a minimum of three cameras extracting acceptable points. The system output is the non linearity deviation of the beam, compensating factors for lateral or angular movements in the horizontal measuring plane of the beam and the beam profile. The output is displayed in a computer screen, according to the line method and the least square method...|$|R

40|$|Photograph of the {{interior}} of a stamp mill, Los Angeles(?), ca. 1900. The mill is about three-stories tall, constructed mainly of wood, and has a sloping roof. Eight coffin-shaped boxes used to hold conveyor belts allow the two workers to sift through the crushed rocks or ores. Eventually, the crushed materials fall into a container {{at the end of the}} conveyor belt. At the start of each conveyor belts are cylindrical heads made of metal. They are attached to pistons and in turn are attached to some kind of mechanical device on the second floor. Two men sit on the ledge and appear to be overseeing the process on the second floor. Two men on the first floor are looking through the crushed materials that <b>roll</b> down the <b>conveyor</b> belts. Light bulbs hung from electrical cords attached to the building's structural beams dangle freely just above the conveyor belts.; "Stamp mills are used to pulverize ore, salt, rocks, etc., into powder form or until they could pass through a 30 -mesh screen. Miners would bring their gold bearing rocks to get the gold ore out. If they did not own a stamp mill, typically, they had to pay the owner of the mill a certain amount of gold to use the stamp mill. Stamp mills consists of heavy iron heads on vertical shafts. Horizontal shafts are turned by some mechanical means to move the vertical stem up and down (similar to piston heads on cam shafts).

5000|$|... "Nostalgic" [...] has {{received}} a very positive response from various music critics, most of them complimenting the 1980s nostalgia evoked from the song. Editors of Entertainment Weekly included {{it as one of}} their [...] "16 songs we're loving this spring" [...] list, citing that Clarkson's lost-love anthem, which is tinged with shimmering synths and the most ladylike of power chords, is potent even if one is only [...] "nostalgic" [...] for Lisa Frank stickers and Day-Glo fanny packs. Reviewing for The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski remarked that Clarkson's voice cracks with bluesy grit of the track, and commended that as one of the loose moments that energizes the album. In his review for the The Dallas Morning Newss Guide Live section, music critic Hunter Hauk wrote that [...] "Nostalgic" [...] amounts to a perfect pop confection. Reviewing Piece by Piece for Idolator, Jonathan Riggs complimented the song as a [...] "sister-in-song" [...] of [...] "Stronger" [...] (2011). [...] The Plain Dealers Troy L. Smith praised [...] "Nostalgic" [...] as fantastic as it takes the listener on a trip back to the 1980s. In both their interviews with Clarkson, Official Charts Company's editor Rob Cobsey and Glamours Alyse Whitney extolled it as a great song, with Cobsey also endorsing it to her as a prospective single. Jason Scott of Popdust.com praised it as the most adventurous of all the album's tracks. Chuck Arnold of Rolling Stone also complimented Clarkson's vocals over the synth strut the track, along with its 1980s homage. However, Slant Magazine's Alexa Camp was indifferent to the song, saying that the songs that should ostensibly inspire nostalgia instead feel like they just <b>rolled</b> off a <b>conveyor</b> belt.|$|R
