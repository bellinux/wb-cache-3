Therefore, this paper has been developed with a growing concern on the transformation process in historic temple streets of Srirangam, located in the Tamilnadu, India. Primarily, it reviews an extensive literature and develops a theoretical framework for understanding the transformation of the temple streets in the new digital era.

40|$|Human {{activities}} can cause strong alterations in the environment. As physically sensitive areas, coastal lagoons {{are particularly vulnerable}} to water quality deterioration and eutrophication problems caused by population growth, urbanization and effluent disposal. Óbidos Lagoon is a small and shallow coastal lagoon subjected to different environmental pressures. One of these pressures is the effluent disposal of the Casalito Waste Water Treatment Plant. Presently, this urban discharge serves a population of 920 <b>resident</b> <b>inhabitants</b> but is expected to serve a population of 10000 in the near future. This study reports {{the effect of the}} urban discharge upon primary production and fecal coliform contamination in Óbidos Lagoon. To study the impact of the discharge is very important; this ecosystem was considered vulnerable according to the national water authority (INAG-Instituto da Água) eutrophication criteria (Decree-Law nº 149 / 2004, 22 June). The water quality in the lagoon must also respect the European Community Batching Water Directive (European Union Directive 76 / 160 /EEC), which aims to protect surface water quality, as well as the national legislation referring to water quality (namely, Decree-Law nº 236 / 98) ...|$|R

50|$|In {{his inaugural}} address, Buchanan {{committed}} himself to serving only one term; {{he kept his}} word, and supported Vice President John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 presidential election. He also spoke critically about the growing divisions over slavery and its status in the territories. He asserted that Congress should play no {{role in determining the}} status of slavery in the states or territories. The new President said, It is the imperative and indispensable duty of the government of the United States to secure to every <b>resident</b> <b>inhabitant</b> the free and independent expression of his opinion by his vote. This sacred right of each individual must be preserved. That being accomplished, nothing can be fairer than to leave the people of a territory free from all foreign interference to decide their own destiny for themselves, subject only to the Constitution of the United States. Furthermore, Buchanan argued that a federal slave code should protect the rights of slave-owners in any federal territory. He alluded to a pending Supreme Court case, Dred Scott v. Sandford, which he stated would permanently settle the issue of slavery. In fact, Buchanan already knew the outcome of the case, and had even played a part in its disposition.|$|R

40|$|We have {{identified}} the influence of host and parasite factors {{that give rise to}} characteristic antibody isotype profiles with age seen in human populations living in different areas of schistosomiasis endemicity. This is important in the immunobiology of this disease. It is also of interest in the context of human responses to chronic antigen stimulation, vaccines, allergens, and other pathogens. In populations exposed to endemic schistosomiasis, factors such as intensity and duration of infection are age dependent. They therefore confound the influence of host age on antiparasite responses. Here, we resolved these confounding factors by comparing the developing antibody responses of an immunologically naive immigrant population as they acquired the infection {{for the first time with}} those of chronically infected <b>resident</b> <b>inhabitants</b> of the same region of Schistosoma mansoni endemicity in Kenya. Recent arrival in the area strongly favored immunoglobulin G 3 (IgG 3) responses against the parasite. The antibody isotype responses associated with human susceptibility to reinfection after chemotherapy were elevated in those suffering high intensities of infection (IgG 4 responses against worm and egg antigens) or were characteristic responses of young children irrespective of the intensity or duration of infection (IgG 2 responses against egg antigen). IgE responses against the adult worm, a response associated with resistance to reinfection after chemotherapy, increased with the ages of infected individuals and were also favored in those currently suffering higher intensities of infection...|$|R
40|$|The Human Development Index (HDI) {{based on}} life expectancy, {{education}} and per-capita income, {{is one of}} the most used indicators of human development. However, undeniable problems in data collection limit between-countries comparisons reducing the practical applicability of the HDI in official statistics. Elvidge et al. (2012) proposed an alternative index of human development (the so called Night Light Development Index, NLDI) derived from nighttime satellite imagery and population density, with improved comparability over time and space. The NLDI assesses inequality in the spatial distribution of night light among <b>resident</b> <b>inhabitants</b> and has proven to correlate with the HDI at the country scale. However, the NLDI presents some drawbacks when applied to smaller analysis' spatial domains, since similar NLDI values may indicate very different levels of human development. A modified NLDI overcoming such a drawback is proposed in this study to assess human development at 3 spatial scales (the entire country, 5 geographical divisions and 20 administrative regions) in Italy, a country with relevant territorial disparities in various socioeconomic dimensions. The original and modified NLDI were correlated with 5 independent indicators of economic growth, sustainable development and environmental quality. The spatial distribution of the original and modified NLDI is not coherent with the level of human development in Italy being indeed associated with various indexes of environmental quality. Further investigation is required to identify in which socioeconomic context (and at which spatial scale) the NDLI approach correctly estimates the level of human development in affluent countries...|$|R
