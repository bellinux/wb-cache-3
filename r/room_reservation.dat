25|$|The {{presence}} of powerful businesswomen—still a rare sight—in {{some of these}} groups helps get them heard. Prior to 2008, women {{were not allowed to}} enter hotels and furnished apartments without a chaperon or mahram. With a 2008 Royal Decree, however, the only requirement for a woman to be allowed to enter hotels is a national ID card, and the hotel must inform the nearest police station of their <b>room</b> <b>reservation</b> and length of stay; however, this happens with everybody staying in the hotel. In April 2010, a new, optional ID card for women was issued which allows them to travel in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The cards include GPS tracking, fingerprints and features that make them difficult to forge. Women do not need male permission to apply for the card, but do need it to travel abroad. Proponents argue that new female identity cards enable a woman to carry out her activities with ease, and prevent forgeries committed in the name of women.|$|E
