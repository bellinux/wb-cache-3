5|$|Ibrahim {{moved to}} secure control of Iraq region, but {{although}} he captured Kufa, Hasan ibn Sahl, {{who had made}} Wasit his base of operations, managed to get to Basra first. However, the governor of Egypt, Abd al-Aziz al-Azdi, recognized Ibrahim as Caliph. In Khurasan, the Sahlids at first downplayed the events at Baghdad, falsely informing al-Ma'mun that Ibrahim had merely been declared governor (amir) rather than Caliph. Finally, in December 817 Ali al-Rida succeeded in revealing to al-Ma'mun the <b>real</b> <b>situation</b> in Iraq, and convinced him that the turmoil in the Caliphate was far greater than the Sahlids presented it to be, and that a reconciliation with Baghdad was necessary. Al-Ma'mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire, and on 22 January 818 he left Marv and began a very slow journey west to Baghdad. Fadl ibn Sahl was murdered on 13 February, probably on al-Ma'mun's orders, although {{the rest of his}} family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen the Barmakids. Indeed, Hasan ibn Sahl was for the time being confirmed in his brother's position, and al-Ma'mun was betrothed to one of his daughters. Ali al-Rida also died during the march on 5 September, possibly of poison. His burial place at Sanabad, now known as Mashhad ("the place of martyrdom"), was to become a major Shi'a pilgrimage site.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to re-examine the {{importance}} of autonomical aspects of school mathematics. First, two aspects of mathematics, empirical and autonomical, will be found in some philosophical researches. Then, some discussions in mathematics education will be organized based on these two aspects, and examples from ordinary school mathematics contents will be re-examined to show the importance of autonomical aspects even in school mathematics. Finally, compatibility of this paper with recent tones in mathematics education will be checked. Recently, it may be required that school education should be related to everyday or <b>real</b> <b>situations</b> more closely, as reflected in integrated or cross curricular, and such tones seem to influence mathematics education. For example, some tendencies showing closer relations between mathematics and <b>real</b> <b>situations</b> can be seen in the review of recent researches in mathematics education (De Corte et al., 1996). This paper will re-examine a relation between mathematics and <b>real</b> <b>situations</b> to discuss these issues soundly, and will try to show that it is theoretical or autonomical aspects of mathematics to make mathematics useful in <b>real</b> <b>situations.</b> EMPIRICAL AND AUTONOMICAL ASPECTS OF MATHEMATIC...|$|R

At this the hostages began being released, with the Arabs sending a hostage back and the Turgesh in turn releasing one of the hostages they held.

Whatever illusions the Roman {{leadership}} had, they were shattered by the arrival of the Parthian delegation to Rome in the spring of 63. Their demands, and the subsequent interrogation of the centurion who accompanied them, revealed to Nero and the Senate the true extent of the disaster, which Paetus had concealed in his dispatches. Nevertheless, in the words of Tacitus, the Romans decided to [...] "accept a dangerous war over a disgraceful peace"; Paetus was recalled, and Corbulo placed again in charge of the campaign into Armenia, with extraordinary imperium which placed him above all other governors and client rulers in the East. Corbulo's post as governor of Syria was entrusted to Gaius Cestius Gallus.|$|E

For instance, in a flashback to Jones working in a corporate environment, she does not wear a suit, instead [...] "wear her jeans and find a really cool jacket, maybe a vintage thing, maybe something that she borrowed from Trish". For a flashback where Jones wears a large sandwich costume, a [...] "variety" [...] of costumes were ordered online, with the chosen suit then distressed to [...] "look dirty and old"; [...] "a mere shadow of its former sandwich self," [...] becoming [...] "more of a hoagie than a sandwich." [...] In another flashback, Jones imagines escaping Kilgrave's control. The bright yellow dress the character wears in the dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to the character's <b>real</b> <b>situation,</b> with Maslansky calling it [...] "so beautiful and so free and so light".|$|E

500|$|The {{regicide}} of al-Amin soured al-Ma'mun's victory. Tahir {{was soon}} transferred {{out of the}} public eye to an unimportant post in Raqqa, but his deed lastingly tarnished the prestige and image of the Abbasid dynasty. According to Elton Daniel, [...] "It shattered the sacrosanct aura which had surrounded the person of the Abbasid caliphs; For the first time, an Abbasid ruler had been humiliated and put to death by rebellious subjects". As al-Ma'mun remained in Marv and made no signs of returning to the caliphal capital, a wave of Arab antipathy towards al-Ma'mun and his [...] "Persian" [...] supporters came to the fore in the western regions of the Caliphate, particularly in Baghdad and surroundings, which feared being degraded to a mere province. This was furthered when the new Caliph entrusted the governance of the state to Fadl ibn Sahl, who intended to permanently move the Muslim world's centre of power eastwards to Khurasan, where he and his circle could control the reins of power to the exclusion of other groups. Fadl was also responsible for side-lining many other supporters of al-Ma'mun; thus, when Harthama ibn A'yan went to Marv to inform al-Ma'mun of the <b>real</b> <b>situation</b> in the west, the Sahlids turned the Caliph against him and he was executed on charges of treason in June 816. In response, Harthama's son Hatim led a short-lived revolt in Armenia.|$|E
500|$|Troilus is rewarded a rare {{happy ending}} {{in the early}} Doctor Who story The Myth Makers. The script was written by Donald Cotton who had {{previously}} adapted Greek tales for the BBC Third Programme. The general tone is one of high comedy combined with a [...] "genuine atmosphere of doom, danger and chaos" [...] with the BBC website listing A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum as an inspiration together with Chaucer, Shakespeare, Homer and Virgil. Troilus is again an andropais [...] "seventeen next birthday" [...] described as [...] "looking too young for the military garb". Both [...] "Cressida" [...] and [...] "Diomede" [...] are the assumed names of the Doctor's companions. Thus Troilus' jealousy of Diomede, whom he believes also loves Cressida, is down to confusion about the <b>real</b> <b>situation.</b> In the end [...] "Cressida" [...] decides to leave the Doctor for Troilus and saves the latter from the fall of Troy by finding an excuse to get {{him away from the}} city. In a reversal of the usual story, he is able to avenge Hector by killing Achilles when they meet outside Troy. (The story was originally intended to end more conventionally, with [...] "Cressida", despite her love for him, apparently abandoning him for [...] "Diomede", but the producers declined to renew co-star Maureen O'Brien's contract, requiring that her character Vicki be written out.) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we propose}} a Configurable Model Based DSS capable {{of dealing with}} generic {{problems}} being modeled by Linear Programming (LP) and by Fuzzy Sets (FS) in a deterministic and uncertain context, respectively. The DSS assumes {{the transformation of the}} original model with fuzzy coefficients into an equivalent crisp model where the fuzzy coefficients are represented as alpha-parametric values, which can vary in a predefined interval based on the alpha parameter. Through the DSS, solutions obtained by solving the deterministic model and the equivalent crisp model for different alpha-values are compared based on the objectives and performance parameters defined by the Decision Maker (DM). Due to the uncertainty in data, expected performance of solutions can change under <b>real</b> <b>situations.</b> The DSS allows simulating future <b>real</b> <b>situations</b> by generating different projections of uncertain parameters. New performance of previously generated solutions can be tested under these hypothetical <b>real</b> <b>situations</b> by means a third model (Model for the Real Performance Assessment). Finally, the DM can choose the solution to be implemented taking into account the performance of solutions under planned and real uncertainty...|$|R
