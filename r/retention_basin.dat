500|$|The westernmost {{part of the}} [...] Sava River {{course in}} Croatia, takes the river east, through {{the western part of}} the Zagreb County, between Samobor and Zaprešić. The area {{encompasses}} forests interspersed by marshes and lakes formed in gravel pits. As the Sava approaches the capital of Croatia, Zagreb, the marshes give way to urban landscape, but there are surviving examples of the gravel pit lakes, such as the Jarun, and the Bundek within the city. At the western outskirts of Zagreb, there is the western terminus of the [...] Sava–Odra flood-relief canal connecting the Sava to the Odra River plain which is intended to act as flood control <b>retention</b> <b>basin.</b> The canal has been built in response to the most destructive flooding of the river that occurred in Zagreb in 1964, when one third of the city was flooded and 17 people were killed. The city itself marks the western extent of the Sava River basin area especially prone to flooding, spanning from Zagreb to confluence of the river in Belgrade, Serbia.|$|E

30|$|Not all {{benefits}} of <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> {{were included in}} this analysis. Reductions to downstream flooding also reduce damage to livestock, machinery, infrastructure, and crop lands. <b>Retention</b> <b>basins</b> also provide wildlife habitat and recreational services. At Pelly’s Lake, the retention site is being used in a public education capacity. These benefits were not monetized {{in the current study}} as {{it is very difficult to}} determine an accurate value. However, inclusion of these benefits in the economic assessment would further increase the value of multi-purpose retention systems on the Manitoba landscape.|$|R

This thesis also presents the legislative requirements and statutory basis for the provision of public utilities and environmental protection at local level for the areas of drainage and wastewater treatment. Study contains a description of the quantitative status and the source of these waters with presentation of stream quality conditions Grosupeljščica and its planned reconstruction. The study is based on evaluating different solutions of protection the stream Grosupeljščica. The evaluation of the solutions depends on characteristics of sewage system. My suggestion is the construction of <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> or addition in the vicinity of existing dischargers at the existing system. Dimensions of <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> are calculated and based on the German guidelines ATV -A 128 E, 1992.

In this paper, the hydraulic behaviour of an enhancement is discussed which utilizes {{the concept of}} a Fusegated spillway. The hydraulic analysis is undertaken using a finite difference model called ERCOLINO. This mathematical model allows the hydraulic and attenuation efficiency of standard basin spillway alternatives to be compared with the Fusegated spillway. The accuracy and reliability of the mathematical model has been validated against physical model tests for various configurations. The proposed model has been created to assist the designer in finding a suitable spillway configuration for river <b>retention</b> <b>basins...</b>|$|R

Mayor Lurie toured the site and immediately agreed with Warren. The Mayor then moved and re-configured the water <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> to preserve the Site. The Las Vegas Springs site later became the Las Vegas Springs Preserve.|$|E
