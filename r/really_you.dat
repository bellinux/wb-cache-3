[...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense <b>really</b> <b>you,</b> or express what you and others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E
500|$|Frank {{frequently}} {{wrote of}} her difficult {{relationship with her}} mother, and of her ambivalence towards her. On 7 November 1942 she described her [...] "contempt" [...] for {{her mother and her}} inability to [...] "confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness," [...] before concluding, [...] "She's not a mother to me." [...] Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: [...] "Anne, is it <b>really</b> <b>you</b> who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?" [...] She came to understand that their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{figures are}} pierced in a {{conventional}} manner, in which bent limbs separate from and rejoin the body. The later, more abstract figures are often penetrated by spaces directly through the body, by which means Moore explores and alternates concave and convex shapes. These more extreme piercings developed in parallel with Barbara Hepworth's sculptures. Hepworth first pierced a torso after misreading a review of one of Henry Moore's early shows. The [...] plaster [...] (1951) in the Tate, is characteristic of Moore's later sculptures: an abstract female figure intercut with voids. As {{with much of the}} post-War work, there are several bronze casts of this sculpture. When Moore's niece asked why his sculptures had such simple titles, he replied, [...] "All art should have a certain mystery and should make demands on the spectator. Giving a sculpture or a drawing too explicit a title takes away part of that mystery so that the spectator moves on to the next object, making no effort to ponder the meaning of what he has just seen. Everyone thinks that he or she looks but they don't <b>really,</b> <b>you</b> know." ...|$|E

500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's <b>really,</b> <b>you</b> know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E

And if you don't change it, obviously you are offending {{a lot of people}} inadvertently. [...] We haven't made any decisions about what we'll do." [...] Stephen Fry, writer for the remake, was asked to provide several alternative names for the dog, and came up with several suggestions. [...] Executive producer David Frost rejected them all, saying [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I think that's what we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want." [...] Jackson's assistant contradicted this a week later, however, saying [...] "To stay true to the story, you can't just change [...] We have not made any decisions yet. The script is still being written; and that decision will be made closer to the time." ...|$|E
