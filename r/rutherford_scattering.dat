5000|$|<b>Rutherford</b> <b>{{scattering}}</b> is {{the elastic}} scattering of charged particles by the Coulomb interaction.

It is now exploited by the materials analytical technique Rutherford backscattering. <b>Rutherford</b> <b>scattering</b> was first referred to as Coulomb scattering because it relies only upon static electric (Coulomb) forces, and the minimal distance between particles is set only by this potential. The classical <b>Rutherford</b> <b>scattering</b> of alpha particles against gold nuclei is an example of [...] "elastic scattering" [...] because neither the alpha particles nor the gold nuclei are internally excited.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{structure}} and chemistry of interfaces {{are known to}} affect the mechanical and electrical beha- viors of oxide ceramics [1, 2]. It is therefore useful to obtain experimental data regarding the atomic {{structure and}} chemistry of these interfaces {{that can be used}} as the basis of atomistic simulations [3, 4]. Z-contrast STEM imaging has become increasingly popular among materials scientists for structure determination because the images are more directly interpretable than conventional high-resolution TEM images. Z-contrast imaging is an incoherent imaging process; thus the phase ambiguity inherent to HREM images is removed. Moreover, because the high-angle, or <b>Rutherford</b> <b>scattered,</b> electrons are used for image formation, there is chemical sensitivity in the images. For oxide materials, Z-contrast imaging has been a useful technique for understanding interface structures and defects. In particular, Z-contrast images directly reveal the projected cat- ion sublattices of th...|$|R
50|$|The {{differential}} cross section is extremely useful quantity in many fields of physics, as measuring it can reveal {{a great amount of}} information about the internal structure of the target particles.

5000|$|The impact {{parameter}} [...] {{is defined as}} the perpendicular distance between the path of a projectile and the center of a potential field [...] created by an object that the projectile is approaching (see diagram).

50|$|In nuclear physics, an inelastic {{collision}} {{is one in}} which the incoming particle causes the nucleus it strikes to become excited or to break up. Deep inelastic scattering is a method of probing the structure of subatomic particles {{in much the same way}} as Rutherford probed the inside of the atom (see <b>Rutherford</b> <b>scattering).</b> Such experiments were performed on protons in the late 1960s using high-energy electrons at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC). As in <b>Rutherford</b> <b>scattering,</b> deep inelastic scattering of electrons by proton targets revealed that most of the incident electrons interact very little and pass straight through, with only a small number bouncing back. This indicates that the charge in the proton is concentrated in small lumps, reminiscent of Rutherford's discovery that the positive charge in an atom is concentrated at the nucleus. However, in the case of the proton, the evidence suggested three distinct concentrations of charge (quarks) and not one.|$|E
40|$|In frontal {{collisions}} of protons in the CERN (ISR) storage rings, a 100 -fold {{atomic nucleus}} density compression has been reached. Does this mean {{the production of}} new elementary particles, or does matter become homogeneous? The primary structures at the instant of collision can be reconstructed from observations of the stable fission products. They consist of pure mesonic matter; their properties are independent of both collision energy and type of colliding particle. Their number increases with collision energy. These surface impacts become more frequent with increasing energy. Central impact is recognizable by large deflection, as in <b>Rutherford's</b> <b>scattering</b> experiment. So far, large deflections of electrons and neutrinos, scattered by protons, have been found. Mesons with large deflections have also been found at ISR. These impacts are possibly attributable to point-like structures in the proton. (0 refs) ...|$|R

50|$|His {{study of}} the {{electrodynamic}} theories of André-Marie Ampère and Wilhelm Weber led him to reconsider the usual interpretation of the <b>Rutherford</b> <b>scattering</b> data, which ignores the variation in force between charged particles {{as a result of}} relative velocities and accelerations. Calculations based on the Weber electrodynamics forced Moon to re-conceptualize most of what is, still today, taken for granted in atomic and nuclear physics.|$|E
50|$|Electrons {{produced}} in nuclear decay are called beta particles. Because of their low mass relative to atoms, they are strongly scattered by nuclei (Coulomb or <b>Rutherford</b> <b>scattering),</b> {{much more so}} than heavier particles. Beta particle tracks are therefore crooked. In addition to producing secondary electrons (delta rays) while ionizing atoms, they also produce bremsstrahlung photons. A maximum range of beta radiation can be defined experimentally which is smaller than the range that would be measured along the particle path.|$|E
50|$|The {{singularity}} in the <b>Rutherford</b> <b>scattering</b> cross-section {{formula is}} unphysical of course. If the scattering cross-section is zero {{it implies that}} the projectile never comes close to the target, {{but in this case}} it also never penetrates the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus either. The pure Coulomb formula for the scattering cross-section shown above must be corrected for this screening effect, which becomes more important as the energy of the projectile decreases (or, equivalently, its mass increases).|$|E

40|$|At {{a meeting}} such as this, one {{is tempted to}} compare our present struggles to {{understand}} string theory, and to find clearer evidence for or against the claim that it describes our universe, with the deep issues discussed at past Solvay conferences. Now my experience has been that when visiting Belgium, giving in to temptation is generally a good thing to do, so with no further apology let us proceed. As was beautifully described here by Peter Galison, the 1911 meeting focused on the theory of radiation, and the quantum hypotheses invented to explain black body radiation and the photoelectric effect. These were simple descriptions of simple phenomena, which suggested a new paradigm. This was to accept the basic structure of previous models, but modify the laws of classical mechanics by inventing new, somewhat ad hoc rules governing quantum phenomena. This paradigm soon scored a great success in Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom.

50|$|Note {{also that}} heavy ions cannot {{backscatter}} from light ones: it is kinematically prohibited. The kinematical factor must remain real, and this limits the permitted scattering angle {{in the laboratory}} frame of reference. In ERD it is often convenient to place the recoil detector at recoil angles large enough to prohibit signal from the scattered beam. The scattered ion intensity is always very large compared to the recoil intensity (the <b>Rutherford</b> <b>scattering</b> cross-section formula goes to infinity as the scattering angle goes to zero), and for ERD the scattered beam usually has to be excluded from the measurement somehow.|$|E
