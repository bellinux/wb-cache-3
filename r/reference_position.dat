2500|$|NMR {{spectroscopy}} is {{a technique}} {{that has been used}} over the years to study important dynamic aspects of base flipping. This technique allows researchers to determine the physical and chemical properties of atoms and other molecules by utilizing the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei. In addition, [...] NMR can provide a variety of information including structure, reaction states, chemical environment of the molecules, and dynamics. [...] During the DNA base flipping discovery experiment, researchers utilized NMR spectroscopy to investigate the enzyme-induced base flipping of HhaI methyltransferase. In order to accomplish this experiment, two 5-fluorocytosine residues were incorporated into the target and the <b>reference</b> <b>position</b> with the DNA substrate so the 19F chemical shift analysis could be performed. Once the 19F chemical shift analysis was evaluated, it was then concluded that the DNA complexes existed with multiple forms of the target 5-fluorocytosine along the base flipping pathway.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} precise {{closed-loop control}} of microjets {{under the influence}} of the magnetic fields in three-dimensional (3 D) space. For this purpose, we design a magnetic-based control system that directs the field lines towards <b>reference</b> <b>positions.</b> Microjets align along the controlled field lines using the magnetic torque exerted on their magnetic dipole, and move towards the <b>reference</b> <b>positions</b> using their self-propulsion force. We demonstrate the controlled motion of microjets in 3 D space, and show that their propulsion force allows them to overcome vertical forces, such as buoyancy forces, interaction forces with oxygen bubbles, and vertical flow. The closed-loop control localizes the microjets within a spherical region of convergence with an average diameter of 406 +/- 220 lm, whereas the self-propulsion force allows them to swim at an average speed of 222674 lm/s within the horizontal plane. Furthermore, we observe that the controlled microjets dive downward and swim upward towards <b>reference</b> <b>positions</b> at average speeds of 232 +/- 40 lm/s and 316 +/- 81 lm/s, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{effective}} <b>reference</b> plane <b>position</b> of the spectroradiometer {{measuring head}} determines the {{variation of the}} measured irradiance signal at different distances from the radiation source. Incomplete knowledge of the true <b>reference</b> plane <b>position</b> may result in significant measurement errors, if calibration {{and use of the}} spectroradiometer take place at different distances from the source. We describe a method for determining the effective measurement plane of spectroradiometer diffusers, based on distance dependence of the measured signal. The angular responsivity of the diffuser needs {{to be taken into account}} in the data analysis, especially if there are large deviations from the ideal cosinusoidal responsivity. A clear correlation was found between the measured shifts of the <b>reference</b> plane <b>positions</b> and deviations from ideal angular responsivity which may, in general, help to identify diffusers with large shifts of <b>reference</b> plane <b>positions...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical method for evaluating lateral-torsional coupling in the elastic earthquake response of asymmetric multistory buildings. A transformation technique is first developed {{to shift the}} floor centers of mass of an asymmetric building to new <b>reference</b> <b>positions</b> where {{the sum of the}} squares of all floor rotations of the building due to lateral inertia loads is a minimum. By setting the locus of the floor centers of mass of the building at the new <b>reference</b> <b>positions,</b> a representative eccentricity and an effectively uncoupled system for the building can be established on the basis which an equivalent eccentric single mass system can be developed. The additional lateral translations caused by seismic torsional effects in the building can be analytically determined and expressed in terms of the representative building eccentricity and the uncoupled periods evaluated using the effectively uncoupled system. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method are illustrated with two 30 -story practical buildings. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Traditional radio-map-based {{localization}} methods need {{to sample}} {{a large number}} of location fingerprints offline, which requires huge amount of human and material resources. To solve the high sampling cost problem, an automatic radio-map construction algorithm based on crowdsourcing is proposed. The algorithm employs the crowd-sourced information provided by {{a large number of}} users when they are walking in the buildings as the source of location fingerprint data. Through the variation characteristics of users’ smartphone sensors, the indoor anchors (doors) are identified and their locations are regarded as <b>reference</b> <b>positions</b> of the whole radio-map. The AP-Cluster method is used to cluster the crowdsourced fingerprints to acquire the representative fingerprints. According to the <b>reference</b> <b>positions</b> and the similarity between fingerprints, the representative fingerprints are linked to their corresponding physical locations and the radio-map is generated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the cost of fingerprint sampling and radio-map construction and guarantees the localization accuracy. The proposed method does not require users’ explicit participation, which effectively solves the resource-consumption problem when a location fingerprint database is established...|$|R
