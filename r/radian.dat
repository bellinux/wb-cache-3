25|$|Rational {{numbers are}} the {{quotient}} field of integers. Rational expressions are the quotient {{field of the}} polynomials (over some integral domain). Since a coefficient is a polynomial of degree zero, a radical expression such as √2/2 is a rational fraction. Another example (over the reals) is , the <b>radian</b> measure of a right angle.|$|E
500|$|The {{trigonometric}} functions rely on angles, and mathematicians generally use <b>radians</b> as units of measurement. [...] {{plays an important}} role in angles measured in <b>radians,</b> which are defined so that a complete circle spans an angle of 2 <b>radians.</b> The angle measure of 180° is equal to [...] <b>radians,</b> and 1° = /180 <b>radians.</b>|$|R
2500|$|To {{determine}} the trigonometric functions for angles of [...] <b>radians</b> (60°) and [...] <b>radians</b> (30°), {{we start with}} an equilateral triangle of side length 1. All its angles are [...] <b>radians</b> (60°). By dividing it into two, we obtain a right triangle with [...] <b>radians</b> (30°) and [...] <b>radians</b> (60°) angles. For this triangle, the shortest side is , the next largest side is [...] and the hypotenuse is 1. This yields: ...|$|R
5000|$|... where [...] and [...] are {{north and}} south lines of {{latitude}} (measured from the equator in <b>radians</b> with angle increasing northward), and [...] and [...] are east and west lines of longitude (where the angle in <b>radians</b> increases eastward). Mathematically, this represents an arc of angle [...] swept around a sphere by [...] <b>radians.</b> When longitude spans 2 <b>radians</b> and latitude spans [...] <b>radians,</b> the solid angle {{is that of a}} sphere.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the {{aforementioned}} situation with distance, the scale of angles is the same in pure mathematics, physics, and computing. It {{does not depend on}} the scale of distances; all distances may be multiplied by some fixed factor, and all angles will be preserved. Usually, the angle is considered a dimensionless quantity, but there are different units of measurement, such as <b>radian</b> (preferred in pure mathematics and theoretical physics) and degree (°) (preferred in most applications).|$|E
25|$|Like {{the video}} camera, most {{sampling}} schemes are periodic; that is, {{they have a}} characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space. Digital cameras provide {{a certain number of}} samples (pixels) per degree or per <b>radian,</b> or samples per mm in the focal plane of the camera. Audio signals are sampled (digitized) with an analog-to-digital converter, which produces a constant number of samples per second. Some of the most dramatic and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content.|$|E
25|$|Again, {{this happens}} with {{electrons}} before it happens with heavier particles. For example, the electrons used by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer in 1927, accelerated by 54 volts, had a wavelength of 0.167nm, which was {{long enough to}} exhibit a single diffraction side lobe when reflecting {{from the face of}} a nickel crystal with atomic spacing of 0.215nm. With a larger vacuum chamber, it would seem relatively easy to increase the angular resolution from around a <b>radian</b> to a milliradian and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns of integrated circuit computer memory.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand's {{commitment}} to the Balkan states commenced in 1992 with the deployment of five soldiers as UN Military Observers serving with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). In 1994 New Zealand committed {{the first of two}} Company Groups of mechanised infantry serving as part of British battalions. These were termed OP <b>RADIAN.</b> When this commitment was withdrawn New Zealand continued to commit 12 to 15 artillery and armoured soldiers to the British contingent, as well as three Staff Officers to the NATO Stabilisation Force (SFOR). As the mission evolved, the New Zealand contingent changed to a Liaison and Observation Team in the Bosnian town of Preijedor. The contribution was maintained through the handover of the NATO SFOR mission to the European Union EUFOR Althea on 2 December 2004. The LOT was withdrawn on 5 April 2007 but the three staff officers, the last in a continuous 15-year contribution to the peacekeeping effort in the former Yugoslavia, departed on 29 June 2007. One member was seriously wounded during this period.|$|E
