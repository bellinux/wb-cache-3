25|$|The Hurricane was {{a steady}} gun platform, and had {{demonstrated}} its ruggedness as several were badly damaged yet returned to base. But the Hurricane's construction made it dangerous if it caught fire; the wood frames and fabric covering {{of the rear}} fuselage allowed fire to spread through the rear fuselage structure easily. In addition, the gravity fuel tank in the forward fuselage sat {{right in front of}} the instrument panel, without any form of protection for the pilot. Many Hurricane pilots were seriously burned as a consequence of a jet of flame which could burn through the instrument panel. This became of such concern to Hugh Dowding that he had Hawker retrofit the fuselage tanks of the Hurricanes with a self-expanding <b>rubber</b> <b>coating</b> called Linatex. If the tank happened to be punctured by a bullet, the linatex coating would expand when soaked with petrol and seal it. Some Hurricane pilots also felt that the fuel tanks in the wings, although they were protected with a layer of Linatex, were vulnerable from behind, and it was thought that these, not the fuselage tank, were the main fire risk.|$|E

500|$|The bar faced a major {{crisis in}} October 2004 when a crack {{developed}} in the glass wall between the bar and the pool, which could have resulted in [...] of water emptying into the bar. The bar was open when the crack occurred and was noticed immediately. [...] Staff of the O'Haire Inn immediately began draining the pool, which took four hours to complete. [...] The fire department also kept their pumper truck standing by in case more rapid removal of water was needed. [...] The old double-paned glass was replaced with triple-paned glass, and while the repairs were performed the pool area was also given a new <b>rubber</b> <b>coating.</b> [...] The autographs of Nolte and Hannah were lost, as the bar's manager explained, [...] "the crack went right through their signatures." ...|$|E

When the needle is screwed into the {{translucent}} plastic needle holder, the rubber needle is inside the holder, and the exposed needle will be inserted into the vein. When a Vacutainer tube is inserted into the holder, its rubber cap is punctured by the inner needle and the vacuum in the tube pulls blood through the needle and into the tube. The filled tube is then removed and another can be inserted and filled the same way. The amount of air evacuated from the tube predetermines how much blood will fill the tube before blood stops flowing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, {{activated}} carbon was prepared from <b>rubber</b> seed <b>coat</b> by physicochemical activation {{for the removal}} of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) dye from aqueous solution.

The adsorption uptake was found to increase with increase in initial dye concentration and contact time. Change in temperature and pH also played an important role to RBBR adsorption capability.
