In contrast to existing resynthesis techniques, which consider only single-output Boolean functions and the combinational {{portion of a}} circuit, we consider multioutput functions and retiming, and develop effective algorithms that incorporate recent improvements to SAT-based Boolean matching. Our experimental results show that with the optimal logic depth, the resynthesis considering multioutput functions <b>reduces</b> <b>area</b> by up to 0. 4 % compared to the one considering single-output functions, and the sequential resynthesis <b>reduces</b> <b>area</b> by up to 10 % compared to combinational resynthesis when both consider multi-output functions.

25|$|In {{southern}} Mount Lebanon in 1590, Fakhr-al-Din II {{became the}} successor to Korkmaz. He soon established his authority as paramount prince of the Druze in the Shouf area of Mount Lebanon. Eventually, Fakhr-al-Din II was appointed Sanjakbey (Governor) of several Ottoman sub-provinces, with responsibility for tax-gathering. He extended his control over {{a substantial part of}} Mount Lebanon and its coastal area, even building a fort as far inland as Palmyra. This over-reaching eventually became too much for Ottoman Sultan Murad IV, who sent a punitive expedition to capture him in 1633. He was taken to Istanbul, kept in prison for two years and then executed along with one of his sons in April 1635.

25|$|In 1924 Nieuport {{produced}} a {{design for a}} single-seat sesquiplane fighter of mixed construction, the Nieuport-Delage NiD 42, which was ordered in small numbers for the French air force, entering service in 1927. Nieuport developed three refined versions in 1927, the all-metal NiD-52 and NiD-72 and the mixed construction Nieuport-Delage NiD 62. Like the NiD 42 on which it was based, the NiD 52 was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Hb V12 engine, but the wooden monocoque rear fuselage was replaced by an equivalent made of duralumin and the wooden wing ribs by light alloy, while retaining a fabric covering. Both the main and secondary wings were of <b>reduced</b> <b>area</b> compared to the NiD-42, and an enlarged tail fitted {{in an attempt to}} improve the aircraft's handling. Armament remained two 7.7mm Vickers machine guns.|$|E

5000|$|Agricultural {{production}} was severely affected. Australia's cotton production had dropped, {{with the smallest}} area planted in 20 years, a 66% reduction compared to five years earlier which was considered a [...] "normal" [...] year. The crop had been half its usual size for three of the previous five years. Water use by the industry fell by 37% between 2000/01 and 2004/05, due mainly to the drought. In the order of 20 cotton communities and 10,000 people directly employed by the cotton industry are impacted by the drought.

Bourke has had adequate water for only one cotton crop in the last five years. Stock feed was also becoming scarce and farmers are finding it difficult to feed cattle and sheep. Dairy producers were hit particularly hard by the drought with 2004 a particularly bleak year in the sector, as a drought-caused drop in production sent revenue in the industry down by 4.5%.|$|R
40|$|The role of plasma {{membrane}} (PM) {{area as a}} critical factor during cell motility is poorly understood, mainly due to an inability to precisely follow PM area dynamics. To address this fundamental question, we developed static and dynamic assays to follow exocytosis, endocytosis, and PM area changes during fibroblast spreading. Because the PM area cannot increase by stretch, spreading proceeds by the flattening of membrane folds and/or {{by the addition of}} new membrane. Using laser tweezers, we found that PM tension progressively decreases during spreading, suggesting the addition of new membrane. Next, we found that exocytosis increases the PM area by 40 – 60 % during spreading. <b>Reducing</b> PM <b>area</b> <b>reduced</b> spread <b>area,</b> and, in a reciprocal manner, <b>reducing</b> spreadable <b>area</b> <b>reduced</b> PM <b>area,</b> indicating the interconnection between these two parameters. We observed that Golgi, lysosomes, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein vesicles are exocytosed during spreading, but endoplasmic reticulum and transferrin receptor-containing vesicles are not. Microtubule depolymerization blocks lysosome and Golgi exocytosis but not the exocytosis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein vesicles or PM area increase. Therefore, we suggest that fibroblasts are able to regulate about half of their original PM area by the addition of membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein compartment...|$|R
25|$|Radicalized {{by recent}} events, Polish reformers (whether in exile or still {{resident}} in the <b>reduced</b> <b>area</b> remaining to the Commonwealth) were soon working on preparations {{for a national}} insurrection. Tadeusz Kościuszko, a popular general and {{a veteran of the}} American Revolution, was chosen as its leader. He returned from abroad and issued Kościuszko's proclamation in Kraków on March 24, 1794. It called for a national uprising under his supreme command. Kościuszko emancipated many peasants in order to enroll them as kosynierzy in his army, but the hard-fought insurrection, despite widespread national support, proved incapable of generating the foreign assistance necessary for its success. In the end, it was suppressed by the combined forces of Russia and Prussia, with Warsaw captured in November 1794 at the Battle of Praga.|$|E
25|$|The {{new light}} at Caloundra Head had a {{relatively}} short working life, with nearby high-rise residential unit development obscuring views of the light from sea and rendering it ineffective. Downgraded, the 1968 light was transferred on a <b>reduced</b> <b>area</b> of land (868m2) to the Queensland Treasury in 1974 and it continued to operate as a harbour light and signal station. A new tower, Point Cartwright Light, constructed {{at the mouth of}} the Mooloola River at Point Cartwright in 1978 took over the role of lighting the North West Channel. In 1992 the function of the Caloundra Signal Station was replaced by an automatic radar/microwave link unit on the roof of units at Wickham Point to the east, resulting in the station being de-manned. In the late 1990s the light was replaced by a beacon on Wickham Point. Some radio equipment was left in operation at the Caloundra Signal Station, which is still used by local emergency services.|$|E
25|$|The sugar industry, {{once the}} {{mainstay}} of the island's economy, declined during {{the early decades of}} the twentieth century, and finally collapsed in the 1940s when the US Navy took over much of the land on which the sugar cane plantations stood. After an initial naval construction phase, opportunities for making a living on the island were largely limited to fishing or subsistence farming on <b>reduced</b> <b>area.</b> Crops grown on the island include avocados, bananas, coconuts, grains, papayas and sweet potatoes. A small number of permanent local jobs were provided by the US Navy. Since the 1970s General Electric has employed a few hundred workers at a manufacturing plant. Unemployment was widespread, with consequent social problems. The 2000 US census reported a median household income in 1999 dollars of $9,331 (compared to $41,994 for the USA as a whole), and 35.8% of the population of 16 years and over in the labor force (compared to 63.9% for the USA as a whole).|$|E
