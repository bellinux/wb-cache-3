25|$|Reform of {{the economy}} was {{the goal of the}} National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. It sought to end {{cutthroat}} competition by forcing industries to come up with codes that established the rules of operation for all firms within specific industries, such as minimum prices, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated the codes which were approved by NIRA officials. Industry needed to raise wages as a condition for approval. Provisions encouraged unions and suspended antitrust laws. NIRA was found to be unconstitutional by unanimous decision of the US Supreme Court in May 1935; Roosevelt strongly protested. Roosevelt reformed the financial <b>regulatory</b> <b>structure</b> of the nation with the Glass–Steagall Act, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to underwrite savings deposits. The act also sought to curb speculation by limiting affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms. In 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to regulate the trading of securities, while the Federal Communications Commission was established to regulate telecommunications.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{changes the}} {{existing}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>structure,</b> {{by creating a}} number of new agencies (while merging and removing others) in an effort to streamline the regulatory process, increasing oversight of specific institutions regarded as a systemic risk, amending the Federal Reserve Act, promoting transparency, and additional changes. The Act's intentions are to provide rigorous standards and supervision to protect the economy and American consumers, investors and businesses; end taxpayer-funded bailouts of financial institutions; provide for an advanced warning system on the stability of the economy; create new rules on executive compensation and corporate governance; and eliminate certain loopholes that led to the 2008 economic recession. The new agencies are either granted explicit power over a particular aspect of financial regulation, or that power is transferred from an existing agency. All of the new agencies, and some existing ones that are not currently required to do so, are also compelled to report to Congress on an annual (or biannual) basis, to present the results of current plans and explain future goals. Important new agencies created include the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Office of Financial Research, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.|$|E

Time Magazine cited many analysts saying the party's need to maintain control of the economy and of information undermines the independence of any regulatory system. One analyst, Willy Lam, a Senior Fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, indicated that CCP's pervasive control over political and economic resources has resulted in the absence of meaningful systematic checks and balances. [...] "Institutions that could provide some oversight over party and government authorities—for example, the legislature, the courts or the media—are tightly controlled by CCP apparatchiks." [...] A Beijing-based consultancy, Dragonomics, concurred that [...] "the problem was rooted in the Communist Party's continued involvement in pricing control, company management and the flow of information".

Instead, any effort to reform the financial supervisory structure must explicitly address the country 9 ̆ 2 s most fundamental need, which is to strengthen institutions and governance structures. Key institutional characteristics must already be in place to undertake such a reform successfully, including sound political and legal systems and enforcement mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{recently}} completed large-scale enviromental sequencing projects produced {{a large amount}} of genetic information about microbial communities ('metagenomes') which is not biased towards cultured organisms. It is a good source for estimation of the abundance of genes and <b>regulatory</b> <b>structures</b> in both known and unknown members of microbial communities. In this study we consider the distribution of RNA <b>regulatory</b> <b>structures,</b> riboswitches, in the Sargasso Sea, Minnesota Soil and Whale Falls metagenomes. Results Over three hundred riboswitches were found in about 2 Gbp metagenome DNA sequences. The abundabce of riboswitches in metagenomes was highest for the TPP, B 12 and GCVT riboswitches; the S-box, RFN, YKKC/YXKD, YYBP/YKOY regulatory elements showed lower but significant abundance, while the LYS, G-box, GLMS and YKOK riboswitches were rare. Regions downstream of identified riboswitches were scanned for open reading frames. Comparative analysis of identified ORFs revealed new riboswitch-regulated functions for several classes of riboswitches. In particular, we have observed phosphoserine aminotransferase serC (COG 1932) and malate synthase glcB (COG 2225) to be regulated by the glycine (GCVT) riboswitch; fatty acid desaturase ole 1 (COG 1398), by the cobalamin (B 12) riboswitch; 5 -methylthioribose- 1 -phosphate isomerase ykrS (COG 0182), by the SAM-riboswitch. We also identified conserved riboswitches upstream of genes of unknown function: thiamine (TPP), cobalamine (B 12), and glycine (GCVT, upstream of genes from COG 4198). Conclusion This study demonstrates applicability of bioinformatics to the analysis of RNA <b>regulatory</b> <b>structures</b> in metagenomes. </p...|$|R

In 1972, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the HMO Model Act, which was intended to provide a model <b>regulatory</b> <b>structure</b> for states to use in authorizing the establishment of HMOs and in monitoring their operations. In practice, an HMO is a coordinated delivery system that combines both the financing and the delivery of health care for enrollees.

Specialty services require a specific referral from the PCP to the specialist. Non-emergency hospital admissions also require specific pre-authorization by the PCP. Typically, services are not covered if performed by a provider not an employee of or specifically approved by the HMO unless it defines the situation to be an emergency.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{examples}} of legal enactments designed to consciously preserve the environment, {{for its own}} sake or human enjoyment, are found throughout history. In the common law, the primary protection was found in the law of nuisance, but this only allowed for private actions for damages or injunctions if there was harm to land. Thus smells emanating from pig sties, strict liability against dumping rubbish, or damage from exploding dams. Private enforcement, however, was limited and found to be woefully inadequate to deal with major environmental threats, particularly threats to common resources. During the [...] "Great Stink" [...] of 1858, the dumping of sewerage into the River Thames began to smell so ghastly in the summer heat that Parliament had to be evacuated. Ironically, the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848 had allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close cesspits around the city in an attempt to [...] "clean up" [...] but this simply led people to pollute the river. In 19 days, Parliament passed a further Act to build the London sewerage system. London also suffered from terrible air pollution, and this culminated in the [...] "Great Smog" [...] of 1952, which in turn triggered its own legislative response: the Clean Air Act 1956.
