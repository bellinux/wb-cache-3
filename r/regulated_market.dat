40|$|Abstract- The {{transmission}} system operator (TSO) is re-sponsible {{for keeping the}} balance between production and consumption in the power system. In order to do so, the TSO continuously trades power on the so-called <b>regulating</b> <b>market.</b> Hydropower is a flexible power source well suited for trading on the <b>regulating</b> <b>market</b> because it allows fast changes in generation output. This paper describes an optimization model for creating optimal bidding strategies for the <b>regulating</b> <b>market</b> from a hydropower producer perspective. The model is based on nonlinear stochastic programming, where the <b>regulating</b> <b>market</b> prices are considered stochastic variables. The model also includes generation of regulating power price scenarios and scenario tree construction...|$|R

25|$|In 1944 at Bretton Woods, as {{a result}} of the {{collective}} conventional wisdom of the time, representatives from all the leading allied nations collectively favored a regulated system of fixed exchange rates, indirectly disciplined by a US dollar tied to gold—a system that relied on a <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> economy with tight controls on the values of currencies. Flows of speculative international finance were curtailed by shunting them through and limiting them via central banks. This meant that international flows of investment went into foreign direct investment (FDI)—i.e., construction of factories overseas, rather than international currency manipulation or bond markets. Although the national experts disagreed to some degree on the specific implementation of this system, all agreed on the need for tight controls.|$|E
25|$|The UK has a {{partially}} <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> economy. Based on market exchange rates, the UK is today the fifth-largest {{economy in the}} world and the second-largest in Europe after Germany. HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and is responsible for issuing notes and coins in the nation's currency, the pound sterling. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. The pound sterling is the world's third-largest reserve currency (after the US dollar and the euro). Since 1997 the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, headed by the Governor of the Bank of England, has been responsible for setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year.|$|E
