2500|$|The Kalamazoo Airport's 1958 {{terminal}} had two jetways and {{housed the}} air traffic control tower. A Non-Radar Approach Control, located in Battle Creek and servicing Kalamazoo, was Commissioned in 1969. The air traffic control tower provides ATC services between the hours of 6:00â€“23:00 local time. When the control tower is operational, the airport lies within FAA Class [...] "D" [...] airspace. When the approach control is operational pilots may elect to receive radar services associated within a Terminal <b>Radar</b> <b>Service</b> Area (TRSA). The Terminal Control Center (TRACON) facility was not established until 1975, and radar was not installed until 1978.|$|E
2500|$|Los Angeles Airways (LAA) Flight 417, [...] piloted by Captain Kenneth Lee Waggoner, former USMC {{helicopter}} pilot, was a {{regularly scheduled}} passenger flight from Los Angeles International Airport to the Disneyland Heliport in Anaheim, California. [...] The aircraft and crew had completed three round trips to various destinations in the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan Area beginning at 0607 PDT and departed the ramp at Los Angeles for Flight 417 at 1026. [...] The flight, operating under Visual Flight Rules was cleared by Air traffic control {{to take off}} and proceed eastbound at 10:28:15. [...] At 10:29:30 the flight reported to Hawthorne Tower that it was departing Los Angeles eastbound along Imperial Highway at [...] [...] At 10:32:55 Air Traffic Control advised, [...] "L.A. four seventeen, seven miles east, <b>radar</b> <b>service</b> terminated."

This paper presents a comprehensive {{description of the}} effects that a wind farm may cause on the different <b>radar</b> <b>services,</b> and it compiles {{a review of the}} recent research results regarding the mitigation techniques to minimize this impact. Mitigation techniques to be applied at the wind farm and on the radar systems are described. The development of thorough impact studies before the wind farm is installed is presented as the best way to analyze in advance the potential for interference, and subsequently identify the possible solutions to allow the coexistence of wind farms and <b>radar</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{squadron}} {{was quickly}} repurposed {{and brought back}} on 1 August 1962 as Marine Air Traffic Control Unit 73 (MATCU-73).

50|$|Terminal <b>Radar</b> <b>Service</b> Area was {{established}} {{as part of}} a program to create Terminal Radar stations at selected airports. Because these were never subject to the rulemaking process of 14 CFR Part 91, they do not actually fit into any of the existing U.S. classifications of airspace and have been classified as non-part 71 airspaces. While operating in these airspaces, a pilot who chooses to participate will receive radar services, but participation is not required for VFR operations.|$|E
