5|$|NSP6 is a {{nucleic acid}} binding protein and is encoded by gene 11 from an {{out-of-phase}} open <b>reading</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
5|$|Genomic DNA is {{tightly and}} orderly packed {{in the process}} called DNA condensation, to fit the small {{available}} volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA {{is located in the}} cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an open <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open <b>reading</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E
40|$|The mutational {{response}} {{index and}} measurements of codon bias were determined in eight potential open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> in a Frankia operon that encodes genes for nitrogen fixation. The functionality {{of the different}} open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> is assessed {{in light of these}} results and compared with previously published results, as is the applicability of these techniques to the assessment of translational function of putative open <b>reading</b> <b>frames...</b>|$|R
50|$|The genome is {{a single}} {{stranded}} circular DNA molecule 2600 bases in length. It has two open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> encoding a replicase and capsid protein. The <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> are arranged in opposite orientations on the genome. A stem loop is present between the 3' ends of the open <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> This is like chimpanzee stool associated circular virus and unlike any other known circular DNA virus.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Approximately 40 % of {{mammalian}} mRNA sequences contain AUG trinucleotides upstream of {{the main}} coding sequence, with a quarter of these AUGs demarcating open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> of 20 or more codons. In order to investigate whether these open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> may encode functional peptides, we have carried out a comparative genomic analysis of human and mouse mRNA 'untranslated regions' using sequences from the RefSeq mRNA sequence database. Results We have identified over 200 upstream open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> which are strongly conserved between the human and mouse genomes. Consensus sequences associated with efficient initiation of translation are overrepresented at the AUG trinucleotides of these upstream open <b>reading</b> <b>frames,</b> while comparative analysis of their DNA and putative peptide sequences shows evidence of purifying selection. Conclusion The occurrence {{of a large number}} of conserved upstream open <b>reading</b> <b>frames,</b> in association with features consistent with protein translation, strongly suggests evolutionary maintenance of the coding sequence and indicates probable functional expression of the peptides encoded within these upstream open <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> </p...|$|R
5|$|Type I systems {{sometimes}} {{include a}} third component. In {{the case of}} the well-characterised hok/sok system, in addition to the hok toxin and sok antitoxin, there is a third gene, called mok. This open <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> almost entirely overlaps that of the toxin, and the translation of the toxin is dependent on the translation of this third component. Thus the binding of antitoxin to toxin is sometimes a simplification, and the antitoxin in fact binds a third RNA, which then affects toxin translation.|$|E
5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases {{are known as}} frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result {{in a completely different}} translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in in vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
5|$|The S segment {{consists}} of 1953bases, of which 1287 (starting at position 43) code for the nucleocapsid protein. In addition, a second 192-base open <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> {{occurs in the}} middle of this sequence (starting at position 122), as in several other hantaviruses. Among three specimens of O.couesi, the sequence in this segment differed by only 1%, and all changes were silent mutations. The amino acids of the S segment differ by 7 to 10% from those of the related hantaviruses Bayou virus (BAYV; from the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris), Catacamas virus (CATV; from a Honduras population of Oryzomys couesi), and Black Creek Canal virus (BCCV; from the hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus). The nucleotide sequence differs by 24% from those viruses.|$|E
40|$|Some {{statistical}} {{properties of}} open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> in all currently available complete genome sequences are analyzed (seventeen prokatyotic genomes, and 16 chromosome sequences from the yeast genome). The size distribution of open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> {{is characterized by}} various techniques, such as quantile tables, QQ-plots, rank-size plots (Zipf's plots), and spatial densities. The issue {{of the influence of}} CG% on the size distribution is addressed. When yeast chromosomes are compared with archaeal and eubacterial genomes, they tend to have more long open <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> There is little or no evidence to reject the null hypothesis that open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> on six different <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> and two strands distribute similarly. A topic of current interest, the base composition asymmetry in open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> between the two strands, is studied using regression analysis. The base composition asymmetry at three codon positions is analyzed separately. It was shown in these genome sequences that the first codon position is G- and A-rich (i. e. purine-rich); there is a co-existence of A- and T-rich branches at the second codon position; and the third codon position is weakly T-rich...|$|R
50|$|The {{usage of}} {{multiple}} <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> {{leads to the}} possibility of overlapping genes; there may be many of these in virus, prokaryote, and mitochondrial genomes. Some viruses, e.g. Hepatitis B virus and BYDV, use several overlapping genes in different <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since DNA is {{interpreted}} {{in groups of}} three nucleotides (codons), a DNA strand has three distinct <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> The double helix of a DNA molecule has two anti-parallel strands so, with the two strands having three <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> each, there are six possible frame translations.|$|R
25|$|Cro binds to OR3, {{preventing}} {{access to}} the PRM promoter, preventing expression of the cI gene. N binds to the two Nut (N utilisation) sites, one in the N gene in the PL <b>reading</b> <b>frame,</b> {{and one in the}} cro gene in the PR <b>reading</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
25|$|Only a few {{papillomavirus}} types encode a short protein {{from the}} E8 gene. In {{the case of}} BPV-4 (papillomavirus genus Xi), the E8 open <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> may substitute for the E6 open <b>reading</b> <b>frame,</b> which is absent in this papillomavirus genus. These E8 genes are chemically and functionally similar to the E5 genes from some human papillomaviruses, and are also called E5/E8.|$|E
25|$|A codon {{is a set}} {{of three}} nucleotides, a triplet that code for a certain amino acid. The first codon {{establishes}} the <b>reading</b> <b>frame,</b> whereby a new codon begins. A protein′s amino acid backbone sequence is defined by contiguous triplets. Codons are key to translation of genetic information for the synthesis of proteins. The <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> is set when translating the mRNA begins and is maintained as it reads one triplet to the next. The reading of the genetic code is subject to three rules the monitor codons in mRNA. First, codons are read in a 5' to 3' direction. Second, codons are nonoverlapping and the message has no gaps. The last rule, as stated above, that the message is translated in a fixed <b>reading</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the sacU {{region have}} a {{pleiotropic}} phenotype. Certain mutations designated sacU(Hy), for example, express degradative enzymes at high levels, {{are able to}} sporulate {{in the presence of}} glucose, have severely reduced transformation efficiencies, and are nonmotile. We isolated and sequenced the sacU gene region of Bacillus subtilis. Two open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> were found in the sacU region, and sacU(Hy) mutations were localized to both of these open <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> The two open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> have similarities to two widespread families of proteins that mediate responses to environmental stimuli...|$|R

This 6225 bp sequence has been analysed for transcription signals and probable open <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> Similarities with herpes simplex virus, vari-cella-zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus genes were observed for three of the predicted open reading frames; avirion protein and a unique DNA helicase {{are believed to be}} the functional products of two of these open <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> Two other open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> are novel in that no homologues could be found, either in the known herpesvirus sequences or in the Protein Identification Resource database. Both of these open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> also lie in the genomic coding region of a 5 - 0 kb RNA which is transcribed throughout the infectious cycle...|$|R

For easy reference, input sequence and the translation frames are displayed in a scrollable text box.|$|R
25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus has}} a {{positive}} sense single-stranded RNA genome. The genome consists of a single open <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> that is 9600 nucleotide bases long. This single open <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> is translated to produce a single protein product, which is then further processed to produce smaller active proteins. This is why on publicly available databases, such as the European Bioinformatic Institute, the viral proteome only consists of 2 proteins.|$|E

25|$|Several highly sensitive, confirmatory {{real-time}} RT-PCR assays {{exist for}} rapid identification of MERS-CoV from patient-derived samples. These assays attempt to amplify upE (targets elements upstream of the E gene), open <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> 1B (targets the ORF1b gene) and open <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> 1A (targets the ORF1a gene). The WHO recommends the upE target for screening assays {{as it is}} highly sensitive. In addition, hemi-nested sequencing amplicons targeting RdRp (present in all coronaviruses) and nucleocapsid (N) gene (specific to MERS-CoV) fragments can be generated for confirmation via sequencing. Reports of potential polymorphisms in the N gene between isolates highlight the necessity for sequence-based characterization.|$|E
25|$|Genes {{within the}} {{papillomavirus}} genome are usually identified after similarity with other previously identified genes. However, some spurious open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> {{might have been}} mistaken as genes simply after {{their position in the}} genome, and might not be true genes.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{transcription}} and translation procedure was designed to translate multiple open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> from cloned DNAs. For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cloned DNA carrying three open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (sor, tat, and 3 '-orf), the approach yielded three authentic polypeptides. Clearly, the internal initiation codons {{can be used for}} reinitiation of translation of the downstream open <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> However, the downstream open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> were translated with relatively lower translational efficiencies. In general, the translational efficiency of RNAs depended significantly on their structures. The in vitro approach was utilized further to map the immunoreactive domains of the 3 '-orf and sor gene products of HIV. Deletion clones were constructed with deletions within the open <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> Translation products of these clones reacted differentially with anti- 3 '-orf and anti-sor rabbit immune sera and human sera from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and related disorders. Apparently, recombinant 3 '-orf and sor polypeptides used to immunize rabbits express many more immunogenic epitopes and/or different set of epitopes than is the case for the native proteins in humans infected with HIV. Immunoreactivity and immunogenicity of these gene products were significantly dependent on their structure and/or conformation...|$|R

40|$|We have {{analysed}} short open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (between 150 and 300 base pairs long) of {{the yeast}} genome (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with a two-step strategy.

The second step filters the candidate set by selecting open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> with high similarity to other known sequences (from any organism). As a result, we report ten new predicted proteins {{not present in}} the current sequence databases.
