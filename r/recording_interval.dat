40|$|Field {{measured}} data reflect real response of soil slopes under rainfall infiltration. Based on field measured pore-water pressure histories, prediction models for slope design can be calibrated. In this study, a probabilistic approach {{based on the}} Bayesian theory is adopted to calibrate a slope-stability model using time-varying response data and to justify appropriate monitoring duration and data <b>recording</b> <b>interval</b> for field monitoring programmes. As an illustrative case study, field measured pore-water pressure responses in a natural terrain slope in Hong Kong are used to calibrate a prediction model using the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation method. It is found that {{with the increase of}} measurement duration for model calibration, the uncertainties of soil parameters can be reduced. The duration of the calibrated data should be sufficiently long so as not to underestimate the model error. With regard to the effect of measurement interval, both the uncertainties of input parameters and the model error are increased with the increase of data <b>recording</b> <b>interval.</b> The correlations among the soil parameters are subject to greater uncertainties and the prediction accuracy of the calibrated model is reduced with a larger <b>recording</b> <b>interval...</b>|$|E

At the 2 cm depth, temperatures on the northern and horizontal surfaces sometimes stayed above those for the rock surface despite the daytime energy input from solar radiation.

Because the rock temperatures are quite different from those of the air the latter can, in no way, be used as a surrogate for rock thermal conditions.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new, unsupervised method for sorting and tracking the non-stationary spike signals of individual neurons in multi-unit extracellular recordings. While this method may {{be applied to}} a variety of problems that arise in the field of neural interfaces, its development is motivated by a new class of autonomous neural recording devices. The core of the proposed strategy relies upon an extension of a traditional expectation-maximization (EM) mixture model optimization to incorporate clustering results from the preceding <b>recording</b> <b>interval</b> in a Bayesian manner. Explicit filtering equations for the case of a Gaussian mixture are derived. Techniques using prior data to seed the EM iterations and to select the appropriate model class are also developed. As a natural byproduct of the sorting method, current and prior signal clusters can be matched over time in order to track persisting neurons. Applications of this signal classification method to recordings from macaque parietal cortex show that it provides significantly more consistent clustering and tracking results than traditional methods...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundInfectious {{diseases}} in farm animals affect animal health, decrease animal welfare and can affect human health. Selection and breeding of host individuals with desirable traits regarding infectious diseases {{can help to}} fight disease transmission, which is affected by two types of (genetic) traits: host susceptibility and host infectivity. Quantitative genetic studies on infectious diseases generally connect an individual’s disease status to its own genotype, and therefore capture genetic effects on susceptibility only. However, they usually ignore variation in exposure to infectious herd mates, which may limit the accuracy of estimates of genetic effects on susceptibility. Moreover, genetic effects on infectivity will exist as well. Thus, to design optimal breeding strategies, {{it is essential that}} genetic effects on infectivity are quantified. Given the potential importance of genetic effects on infectivity, we set out to develop a model to estimate the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on both host susceptibility and host infectivity. To evaluate the quality of the resulting SNP effect estimates, we simulated an endemic disease in 10 groups of 100 individuals, and recorded time-series data on individual disease status. We quantified bias and precision of the estimates for different sizes of SNP effects, and identified the optimum <b>recording</b> <b>interval</b> when the number of records is limited. ResultsWe present a generalized linear mixed model to estimate the effect of SNPs on both host susceptibility and host infectivity. SNP effects were on average slightly underestimated, i. e. estimates were conservative. Estimates were less precise for infectivity than for susceptibility. Given our sample size, the power to estimate SNP effects for susceptibility was 100 % for differences between genotypes of a factor 1. 56 or more, and was higher than 60 % for infectivity for differences between genotypes of a factor 4 or more. When disease status was recorded 11 times on each animal, the optimal <b>recording</b> <b>interval</b> was 25  to  50 % of the average infectious period. ConclusionsOur model was able to estimate genetic effects on susceptibility and infectivity. In future genome-wide association studies, it may serve as a starting point to identify genes that affect disease transmission and disease prevalence...|$|E
