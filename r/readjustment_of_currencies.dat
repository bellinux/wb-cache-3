The increase of SV occurring at work onset appears to compensate in HTRs for the sluggish <b>readjustment</b> <b>of</b> HR so that the rate <b>of</b> <b>readjustment</b> <b>of</b> Q is kept within normal limits. As a consequence, qm, t 1 / 2 q mon-, and t 1 / 2 VO 2 on- appear to be similar or only moderately delayed in HTRs compared with CTLs. It is concluded that in HTRs, because of constrained maximum HR, only work loads up to 60 % of the VO 2 max of CTLs may be attained; also, owing to the fast <b>readjustment</b> <b>of</b> Q, up to work loads of 75 to 100 W, the rest to work transition phase is not impaired...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{a typical}} {{localization}} technique, beacon nodes whose locations are known apriori, act as reference in estimating {{the location of}} user nodes. Placement of these beacons in the indoor environments has strong impact {{on the quality of}} the localization technique. When the operating environment is an indoor environment such as an office or building, the placement of beacons is very important due to the presence of obstructions which often result in nonuniform signal propagation error and self interference of beacon nodes. Besides, the structure of indoor environment keeps changing with time, affecting the beacon infrastructure. <b>Readjustment</b> <b>of</b> beacon nodes is time consuming and might interrupt the localization service. Hence, it is ideal to minimize the number <b>of</b> <b>readjustments</b> <b>of</b> the beacon nodes as far as possible. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm to minimize the number <b>of</b> the <b>readjustments</b> <b>of</b> beacon nodes and the interruption in localization service...|$|R

Consideration of human activity within the environment as three orders of impact, provides a basic framework for the appreciation and evaluation of long-term problems.

40|$|Since its {{adoption}} in 1983 the linked exchange rate {{system has been}} widely accepted by professionals in the financial sector as a key stabilizing factor for Hong Kong {{in the run-up to}} 1997. In fact, the operation of the linked exchange rate system can be said to have exceeded initial expectations. Apart from the rather large interest rate swings during the first few weeks of operation, interest rates in Hong Kong have been surprisingly stable. Contrary to expectations, {{there is no evidence that}} the link with the US dollar has led to larger interest rate fluctuations. However, the fact that the linked exchange rate system has functioned satisfactory from 1983 till now is not a sufficient reason for us to stick to the system with no reservation. As pointed out by Takagi, the benefit of maintaining stability against the linked currency must be comparted with the cost of greater fluctuation vis-a-vis other currencies. Moreover, the maintenance of a fixed link means that the country concerned is giving up an important tool for stabilization in the face of a major external shock. The next Section will examine some of the potential problems under the existing linked exchange rate framework. In Section III, I shall discuss the proposal of linking the Hong Kong dollar to a basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies.</b> I shall argue that effective linking of the Hong Kong dollar to a basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> can be achieved by the judicious <b>readjustment</b> <b>of</b> the HK dollar—US dollar link on regular basis. Section IV will argue that the proposal in Section III is only a second-best policy under the constraint of imperfect information. The first best policy is not linking the domestic currency to any fixed basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> but rather continuous relinking to the US dollar (or any other major currency) to achieve full employment. In Section V, I contend that adoption of such a rule by all the small economies of the world would automatically result in a high level of international economic coordination...|$|R
