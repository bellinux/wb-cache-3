60|$|And so, {{sending out}} hunting-parties {{right and left}} in chase of {{everything}} which had animal life, and picking up before nightfall a tolerably abundant <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game,</b> they went homewards, where Victoria was entrusted {{to the care of}} Synesius's old stewardess, and the soldiery were marched straight into the church; while Synesius's servants, to whom the Latin service would have been unintelligible, busied themselves in cooking the still warm game.|$|R
50|$|When the {{footprints}} were made, the estuary occupied a grassy, open valley surrounded by pine forests, with a climate {{similar to that}} of modern southern Scandinavia. It would have been inhabited by mammoths, rhinos, hippos, giant deer and bison, which were preyed upon by sabre-toothed cats, lions, wolves and hyenas. As well as an abundant <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game</b> and edible plants, the river gravels were rich in flint deposits, which early humans would have found an invaluable resource.|$|R
60|$|As their bark was {{exceedingly}} small, and {{burdened with}} but little lading, they resolved {{to abandon the}} usual route, and penetrate the wilderness through a maize of lakes and small rivers well known to their guide. By this arrangement they hoped to travel more speedily, and avoid navigating a long sweep of the river by making a number of portages; while, at the same time, the changeful nature of the route was likely to render it more interesting. From the fact of its being seldom traversed, it was also more likely that they should find a <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game</b> for the journey.|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, Sir Bindon Blood {{had joined}} General Jeffreys' brigade, {{which was still}} engaged in {{operations}} against the Mamunds. Several villages were burned, and large <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>game</b> and fodder carried off. The Mamunds at last sent in a party to negotiate; but it soon appeared {{that they had no}} intention of surrendering, for they had been joined by a considerable number of Afghans, and were ready for a fresh campaign. The Afghan borderers were in a good position, and were able to bring their forces to the assistance of the Mamunds with the assurance that, if they were repulsed, they could return to their homes.|$|R

This farewell visit was as kind and gracious as the first one had been repulsive. Lord Monmouth gave Coningsby his blessing and ten pounds; desired that he would order a dress, anything he liked, for the approaching Montem, which Lord Monmouth meant to attend; and informed his grandson that he should order that in future a proper <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game</b> and venison should be forwarded to Eton for the use of himself and his friends.|$|R

2500|$|Their {{economy was}} {{characterized}} by the practice of agriculture, animal husbandry, hunting, gathering and fishing. The proximity of their settlements to deciduous forests and steppe vegetation provided a good <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>game</b> for their diet and fuel for their fires, tools, and homes. In addition, their nearness to rivers, lakes, and marshes provided a good source <b>of</b> <b>game</b> fowl and fish, {{as well as a}} source of lithic materials (stone and clay) from the banks.|$|R
5000|$|Petroglyphs {{may be a}} form of writing, {{a method}} of communication, or a way to record events and there are many interpretations of them {{including}} commemorating victories in war; documenting the transfer of wealth or territory in settlement of a feud; important potlatches; shamanistic exploits, etc. They may also have a religious significance as well; by using petroglyphs as a ritual device to assure success of the hunt and to increase the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game,</b> but they may simply have no meaning beyond their artistic conception. Furthermore, petroglyphs are created by removing part of a rock surface by incising, pecking, carving or abrading. [...] Unfortunately the petroglyphs are typically not used by professional archaeologists. They usually avoid petroglyphs because they are very difficult to date and any interpretation is usually unscientific and very speculative.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Dick, accompanied {{by one or}} other of the hunters, always rode out from the line of march, and had no difficulty in providing an ample <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game.</b> He was careful, however, not to shoot more than was required, for both he and Mr Harvey viewed with abhorrence the taking of life unnecessarily, merely {{for the purpose of}} sport. He was able, nevertheless, to kill a great many deer without feeling that their flesh was wasted; for not only were the number of mouths in the caravan large, and their powers of eating wonderful, but the natives who came in to trade were always glad to eat up any surplus that remained--and indeed Mr Harvey found the liberal distribution of meat opened their hearts and much facilitated trade.|$|R
60|$|But he {{was told}} to go and hunt; and he went, with all his men, and sent home large {{supplies}} for the larder. And as he hunted, the free, fresh air of the forest comforted him, the free forest life came back to him, and he longed to be an outlaw once more, and hunt on forever. He would not go back yet, at least to face that Judith. So he sent back the greater part of his men with a story. He was ill; he was laid up at a farm-house far away in the forest, and begged the countess to excuse his absence. He had sent fresh <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>game,</b> and a goodly company of his men, knights and housecarles, who would escort her royally to Crowland.|$|R
5000|$|Jordanes, of Gothic descent, {{became a}} monk in Italy. In his mid-sixth-century AD Getica (De origine actibusque Getarum; The Origin and Deeds of the Goths), he {{described}} the large island of Scandza, on which the Goths originated. According to Jordanes, of the tribes living there, some are Adogit from within 40 days of the midnight sun. After the Adogit were the Screrefennae and Suehans, who also lived in the north. The Screrefennae did not raise crops, instead hunting and collecting bird eggs. The Suehans, a semi-nomadic tribe with good horses (comparable to the Thuringii), hunted furs to sell; grain could not be grown so far north. In about 550 AD, Procopius also described a primitive hunting people he called [...] "Skrithifinoi": [...] "Both men and women engaged incessantly just in hunting the rich forests and mountains, which gave them an endless <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game</b> and wild animals." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1982, when Darling was 16, {{they formed}} the company Galactic Software and <b>supplied</b> a {{succession}} <b>of</b> <b>games</b> {{to be published}} by Mastertronic, including The Last V8 (published under their MAD brand), one of several titles written by Darling.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{its main}} competitors, Mastertronic {{was a highly}} {{professional}} operation. The management understood that sourcing games was relatively easy while marketing and distribution was the hard part. Emphasis was set on creating a brand image, establishing distributor chains, persuading the larger high street stores to stock the product and ensuring a fast turn-round from the tape duplicators and the printers so that fresh <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> successful <b>games</b> could be produced quickly.|$|R
50|$|In 1771, Kasper Mansker made {{a second}} trip into {{the areas of}} Kentucky and Tennessee with Col. John Montgomery. This trip was marred by the {{disappearance}} of two members of their party who had remained at the camp in Kentucky while additional supplies were being acquired. He eventually set up camp along the Cumberland River in Sumner County, Tennessee. There was an ample <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game</b> and fertile valleys. Once again Indians attacked their camp and plundered supplies and took about 500 deer skins. These were eventually replaced, but in 1772, an ideal hunting area was identified by Mansker containing two salt licks located close to each other. Hunting was excellent, and Mansker eventually built a fort {{for himself and his}} neighbors at this site, near what is now Goodlettsville, Tennessee, in 1780. The fort was an important stopping place for settlers who arrived in middle Tennessee during the late 18th century until the early 19th century.|$|R
60|$|The cattle had thriven {{and were}} doing well, {{and a large}} field of Indian corn had been {{harvested}} {{for the use of}} the Kaffirs. The cattle had nearly doubled in numbers, as Mr Humphreys did not care about selling at present. The expenses of living were slight. Meat, fowls, and eggs were raised upon the farm, and the guns of Mr Humphreys and Dick provided them with a plentiful <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game.</b> Four milch cows were kept in a paddock near the house, and supplied it with milk, butter, and cheese. Groceries and flour had alone to be purchased, and, as Mr Humphreys said, he did not care if he did not sell a head of cattle for the next ten years; but he would be obliged to do so before long, as the farm would carry but a small number more than he already possessed, and its available extent for that purpose would diminish every year, as the planting went on.|$|R

40|$|Eliciting the {{economic}} benefits provided by protected areas is important {{in order to ensure}} that they are properly considered in policy and decision making. There are relatively few studies that provide a comprehensive overview of {{the economic}} benefits provided by European forest ecosystems, in spite of the large share of forests in the protected area system in most countries. An economic valuation of the ecosystem services supplied by the Hoge Veluwe forest in the Netherlands is presented. The Hoge Veluwe forest is one of the largest and most well-known protected areas in the country. The services included in the study are wood production, <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game,</b> groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration, air filtration, recreation, and nature conservation. A conservative estimate of the total economic benefits generated by the forest is around 2000 Euro/ha/year, which is more than three times higher than the per hectare-value generated by nearby agricultural land. The study provides an analysis of the economic value of eight ecosystem services, discusses the uncertainties of the value estimates, and examines the implications for financing protected area management...|$|R

40|$|Public {{attitudes toward}} hunting {{have passed through}} several {{distinct}} phases in American history. For the longest period of time — from the earliest colonial settle-ments to some indistinct point in the mid- 19 th century — hunting was simply another means of procuring food. But as the population grew increasingly urban and the nation industrialized, hunting was slowly redefined as sport, an activity under-taken not primarily to secure food but for recreation. In the 1870 s romantic tales of wilderness hunts frequently appeared in general-interest magazines, suggesting the sport was far enough removed from daily life that reading about it was emerging as its own form of leisure. 1 By the 1880 s, advances in food preservation and transpor-tation, fueled by growing urban markets, drove the commercial harvest <b>of</b> wild <b>game</b> to unprecedented levels; sport hunters found themselves competing against more efficient market hunters for ever-shrinking <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>game.</b> As early as the 1890 s their combined impact had driven regional game populations (and indeed some entire species, such as the passenger pigeon) to near extinction. Amidst these declines sport hunters organized to lobby for regulations that banned market hunting, estab...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} scope of {{indirect}} network effects in the home video game industry. We argue that the increasing prevalence of non-exclusive software gives rise to indirect network effects that exist between users of competing and incompatible hardware platforms. This is because software non-exclusivity, like hardware compatibility, allows a software firm to sell to a market broader than a single platform’s installed base, leading to a dependence of any particular platform’s software on all firms’ installed bases. We look for evidence of these market-wide network effects by estimating a model of hardware demand and software supply. Our software supply equation allows the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>games</b> for a particular platform to depend {{not only on the}} installed base of that platform, but also on the installed base of competing platforms. Our results indicate the presence of both a platform-specific network effect and – in recent years – a cross-platform (or generation-wide) network effect. Our finding that {{the scope of}} indirect network effects in this industry has widened suggests one reason that this market, which is often cited as a canonical example of one with strong indirect network effects, is no longer dominated by a single platform. network effects, software exclusivity, video games...|$|R
50|$|The English {{settlement}} at Jamestown {{had been}} established on May 24, 1607, {{with the arrival of}} three ships commanded by Captain Christopher Newport. The initial small group of 104 men and boys chose the location because it was favorable for defensive purposes, but it offered poor hunting prospects and a shortage of drinking water. Although they did some farming, few of the original settlers were accustomed to manual labor or familiar with farming. Hunting on the island was poor, and they quickly exhausted the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> small <b>game.</b> The colonists were largely dependent upon trade with the Native Americans and periodic supply ships from England for their food.|$|R

He placed under his care the domestic arrangements of the castle, retaining the servants who had been there under the royal officer. There was only a permanent garrison of twelve men, but this could be raised to a hundred were the tenants of the estates driven to take refuge within the walls. The expenses of keeping up the castle were not large. The rivers afforded an abundance of fish, and the forests on the mountainsides sheltered an ample <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>game.</b> Considerable numbers <b>of</b> half wild sheep {{and two or three}} herds of cattle grazed on the domain round the castle, and there were eight good horses in the stables, besides a score of others on the hills. Most of the holdings had vineyards, and were bound to furnish a certain amount of wine to the castle, and as the consumption had been small since the estate was confiscated, the cellars were full. Hector told the steward that the command of the castle itself would be taken by an officer whom he would send down from Paris, who would have control in all matters save in the management of the estate.|$|R
