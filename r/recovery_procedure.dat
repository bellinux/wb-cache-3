25|$|The Dutch Safety Board {{stated that}} the {{approach}} was not stabilized so the crew should have initiated a go around. The autopilot followed the glide slope while the autothrottle reduced thrust to idle due to a faulty radio altimeter showing an incorrect height. This caused the airspeed to drop and the pitch attitude to increase all unnoticed by the crew until the stick shaker activated. Prior to this, air traffic control caused the crew to intercept the glide slope from above and this obscured the erroneous autothrottle mode and increased the crew’s workload. The subsequent approach to stall <b>recovery</b> <b>procedure</b> was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} {{multiple}} computer systems and computer networks poses some interesting new problems and shows some older {{problems in the}} light of a new context. We are interested in the problems which are related to the design of communication protocols and error <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures.</b> In the design of computer systems, error <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures</b> have often not received very much attention, although they are essential for the reliable operation of most systems. In the case of multiple computer systems, appropriate error <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures</b> can be used to obtain a very much increased availability of the system services. This is also an advantage of computer networks. Whereas single computer systems can sometimes function to a certain extent without elaborate error <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures,</b> data communication protocols, on the other hand, normally have to contain explicit error <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures,</b> since the underlying communication line is normally not very reliable. Therefore, approaches that have been used for the design of protocols in compute...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Based on {{a review}} of the literature, this paper sets out to suggest that an organisation's service <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures</b> lead to three {{distinct}} outcomes; customer, process, and employee recoveries. The objective of the paper is to investigate the impact of service <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures</b> (i. e. the way service recovery is managed and executed) on these three outcomes and their relative impact on an Organisation's financial performance. Design/methodology/approach - A model, linking <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures</b> to the outcomes of recovery and financial performance, is tested using empirical data from a detailed survey of 60 organisations in the UK. Findings - It would appear that many organisations and academic researchers have focused their efforts on customer recovery and have, to some extent, ignored the potentially higher impact outcomes of process and employee recovery. The main finding was that service <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures</b> have a greater impact on employees and process improvement than on customers. Furthermore, while many organisations appear to be concerned with service recovery few seem to be good at it or gaining the benefits of recovered customers, improved processes or recovered employees. Research limitations/implications - This paper tries to encourage wider research into the impact of service recovery. The main limitations were sample size and selection. Practical implications - It challenges the way some organisations have focused their <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures</b> on satisfying or delighting customers and suggests that by doing so they are missing out on substantial benefits. It also suggests that many organisations {{have a long way to}} go to develop their <b>recovery</b> <b>procedures.</b> Originality/value - This work proposes three outcomes of service recovery and finds that the impact of process and employee recoveries may be more significant than customer recovery. ...|$|R
