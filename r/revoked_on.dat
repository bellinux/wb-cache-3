5|$|Sigismund {{took the}} {{customary}} oath of the Transylvanian monarchs on 23December 1588. Pope Sixtus V excommunicated {{him for the}} expulsion of the Jesuits. Sigismund's cousin, Cardinal Andrew Báthory, urged the pope to lift the ban, saying that the prince's Protestant advisors had forced him {{to throw out the}} friars. The pope authorized Sigismund to employ a confessor in May 1589, and the excommunication was <b>revoked</b> <b>on</b> Easter 1590.|$|E
5|$|Upon Carroll's {{return to}} Maryland, Hart was incensed {{both at the}} threat to his own power {{and the idea of}} a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration {{confirming}} the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined {{when he came to the}} defense of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally <b>revoked</b> <b>on</b> 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after, the {{government}} of New York City {{made a series of}} decisions announcing its intent to acquire ownership of the ferry. The Sinking Fund Commission decided in 1903 that the city could acquire the Staten Island ferry route in 1903. The city would pay $3.2 million to take over operations of the ferry, including $2 million for five new screw-propelled ships. From 1902 to 1903, there were debates on where to put the new Whitehall terminal; the location at Whitehall Street was decided as the best location. The locations of the Staten Island terminal were also debated, with the terminal proposed to be built in West Brighton, Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Port Richmond. In 1904, after the Staten Island Railway Company refused the city's offer of $500,000 for the two terminals, the city started a process to condemn the land around the terminals. The B's access to the Whitehall Street terminal was <b>revoked</b> <b>on</b> October 25, 1905. The city's Department of Docks and Ferries assumed ownership of the ferry and terminals. A new St. George Terminal was then built by the city for $2,318,720. The city acquired five boats from the B operation. The five new ships, one named for each of the new boroughs, were commissioned and entered service in 1905.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} by the NRL in 2016 {{of salary}} cap breaches, {{over a period}} of four years, resulted in it stripping the Eels of the twelve competition points the club has accrued so far in the 2016 NRL season. In addition to being fined $1 million, Parramatta also had its 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title <b>revoked..</b> <b>On</b> 19 July 2016 the Parramatta Leagues Club board was sacked by the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority, and an administrator appointed. This effectively also removed the Eels board as the seven directors on both boards were the same people. Max Donnelly, of Ferrier Hodgson was appointed as administrator.. At the time of the 12 point deduction, Parramatta were sitting 5th on the ladder but then found themselves at 14th position. Their first match played after the points deduction was against South Sydney at Parramatta Stadium, Parramatta lost the match 22-20 in a close game. 2016 would also prove to be the final year that Parramatta would play at Parramatta Stadium as it was due to be demolished at seasons end {{to make way for a}} new 30,000 seat stadium. The final home game played at Parramatta Stadium was against The St George Dragons in front of 13,553 spectators. Parramatta went on to beat St George 30-18. Parramatta's final game of 2016 saw them travel to New Zealand to play The Auckland Warriors. Parramatta won the match 40-18 with Bevan French scoring 3 tries. At the end of the season, Parramatta finished in 14th place on the ladder but if they had not been stripped of the 12 competition points they would have played in the finals..|$|E

Though the United Bond Insurance Company, which had posted the bond, argued that paperwork irregularities rendered the issuance of Kinne's bail illegal, the court ordered the company to forfeit the bond. Kinne was reportedly concerned about the monetary implications of this forfeiture: [...] "I could always use the money," [...] the Altus Times-Democrat quoted her as saying. [...] "I don't intend to spend all my life in jail." ...|$|E
