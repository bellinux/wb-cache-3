5|$|Win on time: In {{games with}} a time control, a player wins if the {{opponent}} <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> time, even if the opponent has a much superior position, {{as long as the}} player still has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent.|$|E
5|$|Due to the stuffy {{atmosphere}} and vapors {{in the dark}} and cramped hold, Pym becomes increasingly comatose and delirious over the days. He can't communicate with Augustus, and the promised supplies fail to arrive, so Pym <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> water. In the course of his ordeal, he discovers a letter written in blood attached to his dog Tiger, warning Pym to remain hidden, as his life depends on it.|$|E
5|$|Last Man Standing: Similar to Deathmatch, the player's {{objective}} is to remain alive longer than their opponents, putting an emphasis on number of deaths rather than kills. Players start with all weapons (except the Redeemer) available, fully loaded, and have a set number of lives. Power-ups, including health and ammunition packs, are unavailable. Once a player <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> lives, they lose.|$|E

50|$|Unlike some horror films, the character's weapons can <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bullets, the {{chainsaw}} will <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> gas and, while {{magic is}} the only way to win the game, the character can <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> power. The character can die easily, hence use of the save game feature is suggested.|$|R
50|$|WiN was {{initially}} {{divided into three}} different geographical operational theatres: Western <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Poznań, Central, <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Warsaw as well as Southern, <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Cracow. By 1946 this was reduced to Central and Southern. In January 1947 WiN called on the PSL to boycott the Soviet sponsored elections and to await intervention by Western Allies.|$|R
5|$|The game ends {{in defeat}} if the player crashes, <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel, or is {{shot down by}} taking too much damage. The player can also eject, but {{can only do so}} safely over Allied territory. The player is victorious if they defeat all enemy forces. During the game, points are awarded and {{displayed}} in the control panel for destroyed enemies and on game end tallied up in a high score table.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{imprisoned in}} a holding cell, but escapes by {{crawling}} through an air vent. Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear pool reactor. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat as the entire lair explodes. After the boat <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a Royal Navy ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's tow rope.|$|E
5|$|In Madison Park, Seattle, {{a family}} are {{gathered}} around the television. The mother leaves to go to bed, and {{the atmosphere in the}} room grows tense. The older of two sisters, Connie Bangs (Michelle Joyner) takes her sister Sara—who is clearly much younger than she is—to her bedroom and locks her in, warning her not to let her father inside. Connie <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house, fighting off her father, and is later found wandering the streets confused. She is taken to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), and admits that her father has been sexually abusing her for years.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the percentage of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits made by patients who recently <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their inhaled short-acting beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids and to characterize this understudied patient population. A secondary analysis was performed of data from four ED-based multicenter studies of acute asthma during 1996 – 1998 (n 64 EDs). In each study, consecutive adult patients, aged 18 – 54 years, with acute asthma underwent a structured interview that assessed running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> inhaled medications. The analytic cohort comprised 1095 adults. Overall, 324 patients (30 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 27 – 32 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> either of their inhaled beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids during the week before their index ED visit; 311 (28 %; 95 % CI, 26 – 31 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> inhaled beta-agonists per se. Among a subset of 518 patients on inhaled corticosteroids, 55 patients (11 %; 95 % CI, 8 – 14 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> inhaled corticosteroids. In the multivariable model, predictors <b>of</b> running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an asthma medication were male sex, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, no insurance, lower household income, and use of EDs as the preferred source of asthma prescriptions (all p 0. 05). Among patients who <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> medications, 49 % (95 % CI, 43 – 55 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> inhaled beta-agonists and 72 % (95 % CI, 58 – 84 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> inhaled corticosteroids, before onset of their acute asthma symptoms. In 1095 adult ED patients with acute asthma, we found that 30 % <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their inhaled asthma medications before the ED visit. Asthma patients who <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> medications had sociodemographic characteristics that may help with identification of preventable ED visits. Multifacete...|$|R

50|$|Winning can be {{achieved}} by four means: defeating the opponent's avatar, completing 4 player quests, having the opponent <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> cards in his/her deck, or, during a chess clock match, having the opponent <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|R
5|$|On {{his way out}} of town, Rick {{stops by}} the legless zombie. He apologizes for what {{happened}} to her and shoots her. Later, he is forced to abandon his car when he <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> gas, continuing {{the rest of the way}} on horseback. When he radios Morgan the next day, his signal is picked up by a survivors' camp where Shane, Rick's wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), and his son Carl (Chandler Riggs) are safe. Unaware that it is Rick on the other line, they lose radio signal before they can warn him of the dangers in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Pendragon's only form of defence in {{the game}} {{is his ability to}} utilise various magical spells, in which the correct spell is {{required}} in order to defeat certain enemies. If the player is hit by an attack of any enemy in the castle, Pendragon will lose energy, or in some cases, time will be deducted from the countdown timer. If the player completely <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> energy or fails to destroy the Staff of Karnath before midnight, the game will end.|$|E
5|$|Scott Gorman (William Hope) is {{commanding}} officer of the mission to LV-426, and the Colonial Marines do not take kindly to the inexperienced lieutenant. Although he performs adequately when they initially secure the empty colony, he quickly loses {{control of the situation}} when the Aliens ambush his troops. Ripley takes over, driving the command vehicle, and Gorman is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he transfers command of the colony's defense to Hicks. During the Aliens' assault on the operations room, Gorman tries to rescue Vasquez but his pistol <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition. Realizing they are trapped, they embrace and detonate a grenade (taking a number of Aliens with them).|$|E

50|$|Logano {{maintained}} a one-second lead over Kyle Busch with ten laps {{to go with}} a chance of being short on fuel. Ultimately, he <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel on the Long Pond Straightaway with three to go and Busch took over the lead. About a lap later, Truex <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel as well. On the last lap, Busch too <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel on the front-stretch, was passed by Matt Kenseth - who had taken the white flag 15 seconds behind Busch - in turn 2 and went on to take the checkered flag.|$|R
5|$|The M249 is gas {{operated}} and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding bipod is attached {{near the front}} of the gun, though an M192 LGM tripod is available. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like those used in the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use a rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> linked rounds.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a isometric format and is set on board a haunted galleon named the Blackwyche. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to free the soul of its former captain, Richard Cavendish. Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives, daggers and a magic sword to defend himself from enemy skeletons. The player begins the game with full energy and it will slightly deplete every time the player is hit by an enemy. If Pendragon completely <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> energy, a large skeletal hand will drag the player off-screen, thus killing him.|$|E
5|$|The train {{carrying}} {{the women and}} children is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor and encourages the Jews to observe the Jewish Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.|$|E

5|$|While {{trying to}} close the doors, the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if he touches an enemy, <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> time, runs {{off the edge of}} the floor he is on, or if all the doors are open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular Mario series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos and their variations. The {{opponent}} on the last stage of each hotel is one of the Koopalings, who each use different methods to attack Mario.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{information}} from Black, Mulder concentrates {{on trying to}} find Johnson, when Scully is attacked in the morgue by the dead deputy; Johnson saves her by shooting the deputy, before disappearing. The two agents put all their effort in to finding Johnson {{before it is too}} late. Mulder breaks into Johnson's house but is locked by Johnson in his basement, where he is attacked by the four corpses of the FBI agents; he manages to shoot and kill one of them. Frank shows up; after tying up Johnson, Frank shoots two of the zombies in the head. As his gun <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bullets and death seems imminent for Mulder and Frank, Scully arrives and shoots the final zombie.|$|E
5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E

Borat's truck <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> gas, and he begins to hitchhike to California. He is soon picked up by drunken fraternity brothers from the University of South Carolina. On learning {{the reason for his}} trip, they show him the Pam and Tommy sex tape, revealing that she is not the virgin he thought she was. After leaving the three students, Borat becomes despondent, burning the Baywatch booklet and, by mistake, his return ticket to Kazakhstan. He is also about to slaughter his pet hen, but then changes his mind and lets it go.|$|E
5|$|At first, Raziel can jump, glide {{using his}} torn wings, move blocks, {{and pick up}} and throw objects and enemies. Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can {{alternatively}} use weapons such as rocks, torches, spears and staffs, and the Soul Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, but can return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm and climb walls in the material realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim.|$|E
5|$|Barkley gets {{a police}} permit to raid the Buyers Club, but {{can do nothing}} but give Woodroof a fine. In 1987, the FDA changes its {{regulations}} such that any unapproved drug is also illegal. As the Club <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists {{that she would have}} to be fired.|$|E
