40|$|Because {{most studies}} of AIDS {{pathogenesis}} in nonhuman primates {{have been performed}} in Indian-origin <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques</b> (Macaca mulatta), {{little is known about}} lentiviral pathogenicity and control of virus replication following infection of alternative macaque species. Here, we report the consequences of simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIV- 89. 6 P and SIVmac 251 infection in cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) and <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques</b> of Chinese origin. Compared to the pathogenicity of the same viruses in Indian <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques,</b> both cynomolgus and Chinese <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques</b> showed lower levels of plasma virus. By 9 to 10 months after infection, both viruses became undetectable in plasma more frequently in cynomolgus than in either Chinese or Indian <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques.</b> Furthermore, after SHIV- 89. 6 P infection, CD 4 + T-cell numbers declined less and survival was longer in cynomolgus and Chinese <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques</b> than in Indian <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques.</b> This attenuated pathogenicity was associated with gamma interferon ELISPOT responses to Gag and Env that were generated earlier and of higher frequency in cynomolgus than in Indian <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques.</b> Cynomolgus macaques also developed higher titer neutralizing antibodies against SHIV- 89. 6 at 10 and 20 weeks postinoculation than Indian <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques.</b> These studies demonstrate that the pathogenicity of nonhuman primate lentiviruses varies markedly based on the species or geographic origin of the macaques infected and suggest that the cellular immune responses may contribute to the control of pathogenicity in cynomolgus macaques. While cynomolgus and Chinese <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques</b> provide alternative animal models of lentiviral infection, the lower levels of viremia in cynomolgus macaques limit the usefulness of infection of this species for vaccine trials that utilize viral load as an experimental endpoint...|$|R

For serial passages, 10 mL of whole blood {{from each of}} the P 1 <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques</b> at 60 d was transfused intravenously into two native <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques.</b> To analyze the changes of features in those monkeys by flow cytometry,PCR,binding antibody and sequence alignment. Simultaneously,SHIVCHN 19 P 4 virus stock was propagated by PBMCs co-culture. Results All of the four <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques</b> established systemic infection,the infectivity of the virus was considerably enhanced after passaging. The sequence analysis revealed that SHIVCHN 19 P 4 acquired adaptive changes. Conclusions Our findings provide a firm basis for establishing a SHIV infection model of Chinese <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques.</b> This model may be very useful for HIV- 1 subtype C vaccine and pathogenesis studies. 目的研究C亞型SHIVCHN 19 P 4 強毒株在中國恒河猴體內傳代中病毒學和免疫學等反應的變化特點,分離制備SHIVCHN 19 P 4 中國恒河猴傳代適應株病毒。方法選擇 4 只健康成年恒河猴,其中兩只經后肢靜脈感染SHIVCHN 19 P 4 病毒, 60 d后,分別采集EDTA抗凝全血靜脈途徑傳代至另兩只猴,使用流式細胞術、PCR、結合抗體檢測和序列分析等方法研究傳代動物病毒學、免疫學和序列變異特點。選擇性從傳代動物感染急性期外周血中分離PBMC,CD 8 +T細胞敲除后與正常PBMC共培養分離病毒。結果 4 只傳代動物均獲得系統性感染,且傳代后病毒毒力明顯增強,序列分析發現SHIVCHN 19 P 4 病毒序列在傳代過程中發生適應性改變;同時,成功分離制備SHIVCHN 19 P 4 傳代適應性病毒株。結論 SHIVCHN 19 P 4 在中國恒河猴體內適應性傳代研究為進一步建立C亞型SHIV強毒株/SAIDS模型奠定了良好的實驗基礎,為研究C亞型HIV- 1 流行株致病特點以及預防性黏膜疫苗和殺微生物的有效性評價提供了數據支持。 更多還...|$|R

40|$|Endometriosis {{affects a}} large {{percentage}} of the <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques</b> (Macaca mulatta) at our institution. When the disease is diagnosed in macaques on long-term research protocols, the treatment of choice in our facility is monthly administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to decrease estrogen release and subsequently diminish clinical signs associated with the disease. Because hormonal fluctuations associated with the normal menstrual cycle are known to affect parameters of glucoregulatory function in <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques,</b> we evaluated the effect of MPA treatment on glucoregulatory function cross-sectionally in 6 animals and longitudinally in 4 animals with endometriosis. Our hypothesis was that monthly administration of MPA for the treatment of endometriosis would negatively affect glucoregulatory function in <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques.</b> We found that adult female <b>rhesus</b> <b>macaques</b> on MPA therapy for 1. 4 to 36. 1 mo had lower insulin sensitivity than did age- and weight-matched healthy control animals.
