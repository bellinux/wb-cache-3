25|$|Throughout his term, Netanyahu {{was opposed}} by the {{political}} left wing in Israel and lost support from the right because of his concessions to the Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere, and due to his negotiations with Arafat generally. Netanyahu lost favor with the Israeli public after a long chain of scandals involving his marriage and corruption charges. In 1997, police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges for influence-peddling. He was accused of appointing an attorney general who would <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> and prosecutors ruled that there was insufficient evidence to go to trial. In 1999, Netanyahu faced another scandal when the Israel Police recommended that he be tried for corruption for $100,000 in free services from a government contractor; Israel's attorney general did not prosecute, citing difficulties with evidence.|$|E

She was put in therapy at the age of 14. Anderson listened to bands such as Dead Kennedys and Skinny Puppy. She was voted by her classmates as [...] "class clown", [...] "most bizarre girl" [...] and [...] "most likely to be arrested". She was, in fact, arrested on graduation night for breaking and entering into her high school in an attempt to glue the locks of the doors.

6000|$|At the {{beginning}} of his Majesty's reign, Lord Talbot came to the administration of a great department in the household. I believe no man ever entered into his Majesty's service, or into the service of any prince, with a more clear integrity, or with more zeal and affection for the interest of his master, and, I must add, with abilities for a still higher service. Economy was then announced as a maxim of the reign. This noble lord, therefore, made several attempts towards a reform. In the year 1777, when the king's civil list debts came last to be paid, he explained very fully the success of his undertaking. He told the House of Lords that he had attempted to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> of the king's tables and his kitchen. The thing, Sir, was not below him. He knew that there is nothing interesting in the concerns of men whom we love and honor, that is beneath our attention. [...] "Love," [...] says one of our old poets, [...] "esteems no office mean,"--and with still more spirit, [...] "Entire affection scorneth nicer hands." [...] Frugality, Sir, is founded on the principle, that all riches have limits. A royal household, grown enormous, even in the meanest departments, may weaken and perhaps destroy all energy in the highest offices of the state. The gorging a royal kitchen may stint and famish the negotiations of a kingdom. Therefore the object was worthy of his, was worthy of any man's attention.|$|E

50|$|Although {{voluntary}} intoxication is {{not considered}} an excuse for a criminal act, {{if it can be}} shown that the defendant was too intoxicated to deliberate or premeditate the wrongful act, (lacking malice aforethought), a defense of diminished capacity, while not excusing the defendant from responsibility for the act, can serve to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges.</b> Similarly, the plea of temporary insanity (applicable only to charges of murder) can serve to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> from first degree murder to assault or lessen the sentence if it can be shown that the defendant, due to intoxication, acted without deliberation or reflection (lacking malice aforethought), thus negating specific intent. However, ten states have rejected that specific intent can be negated by voluntary intoxication.

5000|$|On 8 June, the {{committee}} accepted {{a request by}} both defense and prosecution reducing to four the number of supplemental budget decrees {{to be considered in}} the trial. Thus, the number of witnesses in the process was reduced to forty.

The prosecution would be entitled to the same number. The decision to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> was supported by a report produced at the House of Representatives, which considered that two decrees signed by Rousseff without approval of Congress were neutral from a fiscal perspective, once the primary sources and financial expenses listed in the documents were equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|And {{while the}} on-court {{intensity}} remains with the rivalry, off-court controversy is seemingly ever-present as well.

5000|$|The {{character}} was introduced on-air on May 8, 2007. Kate walks into Sonny's office unannounced and demands {{the use of}} a phone because her car had broken down. Sonny eventually recognizes her as Connie Falconeri, his former love from Bensonhurst. Diane Miller (Carolyn Hennesy), Sonny's lawyer, later mentions Kate {{is considered one of the}} [...] "100 Most Powerful Women in America." [...] Kate purchases a mansion next door to Sonny. Soon after, Kate is suffering from a headache and mistakenly takes a libido-enhancement pill from a friend instead of ibuprofen. Under the effects of the drug, she seduces Sonny. When Kate is arrested for reckless driving and a hit and run, she is released into Sonny's custody, after spending the night in jail. The interim District Attorney, Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst), refuses the plea agreement, seeking to take revenge on Sonny through Kate. Kate's friend and former lover, Trevor Lansing, blackmails his son Ric, threatening him with losing custody of his daughter if he did not <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> against Kate.|$|E
5000|$|The police {{arrive on}} scene, and bring Nate along once {{learning}} {{of the attack on}} his family. They decide to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> against Nate and give the family an escort out of town. Robyn and Shane demand to return home, but along with Kenny, Nate insists they need the trip in order to repair their relationship as a family and have family memories. The next morning, they leave the motel for the campgrounds. A police cruiser escorts them a few miles down the road before turning back and racing to another emergency. Meanwhile, the robbers spot the family Land Rover and head on after it. As they keep driving, one of the straps holding the camping gear comes loose and so the family pulls over to fix it. As Nate and Robyn unload the camping gear, he hands her the sleeping bag full of money. When she opens it, her face turns white. She tells the boys {{to get back into the}} car before lashing out at Nate. Robyn believes Nate actually stole the money from members of a laundering scheme that exposed his real-estate fraud and threw him in jail, and that they were the ones who attacked her at the motel, and insists the camping trip was nothing but a ruse for them to [...] "start over". Nate is confused by her allegations and pleads with her he didn't do anything wrong. She throws the bag at Nate and drives off with the two boys, leaving him stranded. When he looks into the bag, he realizes that the money belongs to the robbers.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, {{the lack}} of {{progress}} {{of the peace process}} led to new negotiations which produced the Wye River Memorandum in 1998 which detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority to implement the earlier Interim Agreement of 1995. It was signed by Netanyahu and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, and on 17 November 1998, Israel's 120 member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Wye River Memorandum by a vote of 75-19. As Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized a policy of [...] "three no(s)": no withdrawal from the Golan Heights, no discussion of the case of Jerusalem, no negotiations under any preconditions.During his term, Netanyahu also began a process of economic liberalization, taking steps towards a free-market economy. Under his watch, the government began selling its shares in banks and major state-run companies. Netanyahu also greatly eased Israel's strict foreign exchange controls, enabling Israelis to take an unrestricted amount of money out of the country, open foreign bank accounts, hold foreign currency, and invest freely in other countries.Throughout his term, Netanyahu was opposed by the political left wing in Israel and lost support from the right because of his concessions to the Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere, and due to his negotiations with Arafat generally.

40|$|To {{address the}} need for a tumor-specific drug {{delivery}} system that can achieve both prolonged circulation and cellular retention at the tumor site, nanocomplexes of Zwitterionic Chitosan (ZWC) and Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) generation 5 were designed. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers have been widely explored as carriers of therapeutics and imaging agents, however, amine-terminated PAMAM dendrimers are rarely utilized in systemic applications due to its cytotoxicity and risk of opsonization, caused by its cationic charge. Such undesirable effects may be mitigated by shielding the PAMAM dendrimer surface with polymers that <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges.</b> However, this shielding may also interfere with PAMAM dendrimers 2 ̆ 7 ability to interact with target cells, thus reducing cellular uptake and overall efficacy of the delivery system. ZWC, a new chitosan derivative, has a unique pH-sensitive charge profile and can shield the cationic surface of PAMAM dendrimers and block adsorption of serum proteins to allow for prolonged circulation. The hypothesis of this approach is that ZWC is anionic and able to coat PAMAM in neutral pH but becomes positive in the acidic tumor microenvironment, revealing the polycationic drug carrier. We expect that ZWC will provide (i) stealth coating for PAMAM drug carrier during circulation (pH 7. 4) and (ii) be removed from the PAMAM drug carrier at acidic pH (pH 6. 3), allowing for cellular interaction. The cationic charge of PAMAM has been demonstrated to facilitate uptake and drug delivery to tumor cells via interactions with the negatively charged cell surface. Stable electrostatic complexes of ZWC and PAMAM dendrimers were formed at pH 7. 4, as demonstrated by fluorescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The presence of ZWC coating protected red blood cells and fibroblast cells from hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of PAMAM dendrimers, respectively. Confocal microscopy showed that the protective effect of ZWC disappeared at low pH as the complex dissociated due to the charge conversion of ZWC, allowing PAMAM dendrimers to enter cells. These results demonstrate that ZWC is able to provide a surface coverage of PAMAM dendrimers in a pH-dependent manner and, thus, enhance the utility of PAMAM dendrimers as a drug carrier to solid tumors with acidifying microenvironment. Paclitaxel, curcumin, and camptothecin were evaluated as model drugs for use in ZWC(PAMAM) drug carrier based on bioactivity against SKOV- 3 ovarian cancer cells and drug loading and release. Stability of nanocarriers in circulation is a requirement for successful tumor-specific drug release. Strategies to improve the stability of ZWC(PAMAM) NPs were also explored and evaluated. ...|$|E
