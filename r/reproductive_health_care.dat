In 2015 these targets became part of SDG5 (gender equality and empowerment) under Target 5.6: Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, where Indicator 5.6.1 is the proportion of women aged 15–49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> (p.31).|$|E
5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against the {{discrimination}} faced {{by women and}} minorities in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E

40|$|Pauline E Osamor, Christine Grady Department of Bioethics, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA Abstract: Autonomy is {{considered}} essential for decision-making {{in a range}} of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> situations, from <b>health</b> <b>care</b> seeking and utilization to choosing among treatment options. Evidence suggests that women in developing or low-income countries often have limited autonomy and control over their health decisions. A review of the published empirical literature to identify definitions and methods used to measure women’s autonomy in developing countries describe the relationship between women’s autonomy and their <b>health</b> <b>care</b> decision-making, and identify sociodemographic factors that influence women’s autonomy and decision-making regarding <b>health</b> <b>care</b> was carried out. An integrated literature review using two databases (PubMed and Scopus) was performed. Inclusion criteria were 1) publication in English; 2) original articles; 3) investigations on women’s decision-making autonomy for <b>health</b> and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilization; and 4) developing country context. Seventeen articles met inclusion criteria, including eleven from South Asia, five from Africa, and one from Central Asia. Most studies used a definition of autonomy that included independence for women to make their own choices and decisions. Study methods differed in that many used study-specific measures, while others used a set of standardized questions from their countries’ national health surveys. Most studies examined women’s autonomy in the context of <b>reproductive</b> <b>health,</b> while neglecting other types of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilized by women. Several studies found that factors, including age, education, and income, affect women’s <b>health</b> <b>care</b> decision-making autonomy. Gaps in existing literature regarding women’s autonomy and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilization include gaps in the areas of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> that have been measured, the influence of sex roles and social support, and the use of qualitative studies to provide context and nuance.
