40|$|Abstract — A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} modeling is developed using ABAQUS ® software. This includes riveted and rivet-bonded joints models. Both models undergo thermal heat caused by hot-driven <b>rivet</b> <b>process</b> and then are subjected to a constant velocity at one of its strip edges to simulate the shear tensile test up to the failure point. The developed FE models were based on elastic-plastic properties and ductile fracture limit criteria. In addition, the adhesive layer was modeled based on traction separation. Detailed experiments were conducted to evaluate these material properties and provide the FE developed models with these necessary data. The thermal stresses developed in riveted and rivet-bonded joints are assessed and reported. The present work shows that introducing an adhesive layer to riveted joints vastly reduces the stresses developed in these joints. In addition, the complete load-displacement curve for each joining model is obtained and compared with the finite element models without including the effect of thermal analysis...|$|R

50|$|The {{first stage}} in the {{manufacturing}} of aluminium boats was to cut out the hull skins and the other sheet metal parts such as the seats using templates under a radial arm router. Sections were then formed by a brake press and swaging, to form the gunwales and hull folds. Stiffening of sheet metal panels was {{by means of a}} 3,000 ton rubber press. Extruded gunwale, keel and strake sections of the hull were initially formed in a half-hard condition for ease of working and drop hammering, later being placed in a curing oven to bring them to full-hard condition. The skin sections were welded on wooden jigs on which the seats, gunwales, decks and extruded sections were positioned and riveted into position. The boat was then tested in a pressure tank to reveal any water leaks. The finished craft was then painted in a temperature-controlled paint shop. de Havilland also produced the polyurethane flotation material used in the boats which shaped and fitted into position. The company was noted for its use of rivets to join sections of the craft, together with the more common use of welding. In its advertisements, de Havilland Marine referred to this <b>riveting</b> <b>process</b> by the Sealomatic name.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid (bolted/bonded) joining is {{becoming}} one of the innovative joining processes for light weight structures in the transport industry, especially in the aerospace industry where weight reduction and high joining requirements are permanent challenges. Combining the adhesive bonding with the mechanical joining -riveting for instance- can lead to an enhancement of the properties of the joint compared to the wide established riveting, {{as a result of a}} synergistic load bearing interaction between the fastener and the adhesive bondline. The influence of the <b>rivet</b> installation <b>process</b> on a hybrid joint regarding the joint stress state, the change of the bondline thickness as well as its effects on the joint performance and load transfer are some of the factors that drive the users to a better understanding of the hybrid joining process. This paper deals therefore on one hand with the numerical simulation of the <b>rivet</b> installation <b>process</b> in an adhesively bonded joint to understand the phenomena occurring during the installation process and on the other hand with the investigation of the load transfer depending on the joint parameters. In order to simulate the rivet installation in adhesively bonded aluminium (2024 -T 351) adherends, two models have been developed. One for a solid rivet specified by the European standard EN 6081 another for a Lockbolt specified by the standards ASNA 2041 /ASNA 2045. The developed simulation model for the <b>rivet</b> installation <b>process</b> has been validated by comparing the simulation results with experiments regarding the qualitative change of the bondline thickness depending on the adhesive's Young's modulus and on the rivet type.
