5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are <b>rich</b> <b>men,</b> many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E
5|$|In {{late summer}} 1342, Kantakouzenos, {{accompanied}} by several Serbian magnates, marched into Macedonia {{at the head}} of a Greek and Serbian force, intending to break through to his wife, who still held out at Demotika. His advance was stopped almost immediately before Serres when the city refused to surrender, and the subsequent siege had to be abandoned after an epidemic killed most of his men, forcing him to retreat into Serbia with a rump force of barely 500 soldiers. Dušan led a more successful parallel campaign, capturing Vodena (Edessa). Serbian forces captured Florina and Kastoria shortly afterwards, thereby extending their hold over western Macedonia. The Serbs also expanded their control over Albania, so that by the summer of 1343, with the exception of Angevin-controlled Dyrrhachium, all of the region appears to have fallen under Serbian rule. Morale among Kantakouzenos' followers fell dramatically. Rumours circulated in Constantinople that a dejected Kantakouzenos planned to retire to Mount Athos as a monk, and riots broke out in the city in which several <b>rich</b> <b>men</b> were killed and their houses looted by the populace.|$|E
5|$|Wholesale {{reform of}} Oxford {{examinations}} {{began in the}} late eighteenth century, proposed by, among others, Brasenose's John Napleton in his pamphlet Considerations on the Public Exercises for the First and Second Degrees in the University of Oxford. It was Cleaver and his successor Frodsham Hodson that would continue the reforms and apply them to Brasenose itself. Cleaver was from the minor gentry and set out from the start to make Brasenose the place of <b>rich</b> <b>men.</b> Unable to secure the librarianship of the Bodleian whilst fellow, he had instead become tutor to his patron George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham – a position which he used to lead two of the Duke's sons {{and other members of the}} family to Brasenose; the sons' uncle, Baron Grenville, became the University's Chancellor. Under his leadership into the early nineteenth century, numbers improved dramatically and so did the class of people coming: Brasenose began to be dominated by gentlemen like the Egertons, the Grenvilles, and of Richard Rainshaw Rothwell I. Its income over doubled between 1790 and 1810 to £9,200 per annum, with the college maintaining its links to the north-west. Among the other acquisitions of Cleaver was the services of Hodson, a Liverpudlian.|$|E

Because the Balsan flat also was a salon for the French hunting and sporting élite, Chanel had opportunity to meet their demi-mondaine mistresses, who, as such, were women of fashion, upon whom the <b>rich</b> <b>men</b> displayed their wealth — as ornate clothes, jewelry, and hats.|$|E

Many <b>rich</b> <b>men</b> of Manila, frightened by the past troubles, took passage in these vessels (especially the Sant Antonio) with their households and property, with the greatest wealth that had ever left the Philippines. Both vessels experienced such severe storms during the voyage, that the flagship, without masts and greatly lightened and damaged, put back in distress to Manila. The Sant Antonio was swallowed up in the sea, {{and no one was}} saved.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} aspects of the organization of the Inquisition was its form of financing: devoid of its own budget, the Inquisition depended exclusively on the confiscation of the goods of the denounced. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of those prosecuted were <b>rich</b> <b>men.</b> That the situation was open to abuse is evident, as stands out in the memorial that a converso from Toledo directed to Charles I: Your Majesty must provide, before all else, that the expenses of the Holy Office do not come from the properties of the condemned, because if that is the case, if they do not burn they do not eat.|$|E
25|$|About corrupting Athenian youth, Socrates {{explained}} that the young, <b>rich</b> <b>men</b> {{of the city of}} Athens {{have little to do with}} their time. They therefore follow him about the city, observing his questioning of intellectual arguments in dialogue with other intellectual men. In turn, the young men imitate the method of Socrates. Moreover, the embarrassed men, whose arguments Socrates examined and found wanting, do not know how to avoid the ridicule of exposure as pretenders to wisdom. To not lose face, the beardless lads re-state the prejudicial, stock accusations against Socrates, that he is a morally abominable man who corrupts the youth of Athens with sophistry and atheism. In his defence, Socrates said, “For those who are examined, instead of being angry with themselves, are angry with me!” Hence is Socrates considered a wise man, yet has acquired a bad reputation among the politically powerful personages of Athens.|$|E

Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and his brother Max (Jake Wood) show no interest; however, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is more susceptible despite being married to Jane (Laurie Brett). Clare flirts with Ian, wears revealing clothes and talks suggestively but she is playing a game and has no intention of taking things further, acting shocked when Ian suggests that she does. She blackmails Ian, threatening to inform Jane of his dishonourable intentions unless he pays to keep quiet but Ian tells Jane himself so she confronts Clare, warning her to stay away from Ian.|$|E
25|$|Moneylending {{during this}} period was largely a matter of private loans {{advanced}} to persons persistently in debt or temporarily so until harvest time. Mostly, it was undertaken by exceedingly <b>rich</b> <b>men</b> prepared {{to take on a}} high risk if the profit looked good; interest rates were fixed privately and were almost entirely unrestricted by law. Investment was always regarded as a matter of seeking personal profit, often on a large scale. Banking was of the small, back-street variety, run by the urban lower-middle class of petty shopkeepers. By the 3rd century, acute currency problems in the Empire drove such banking into decline. The rich who were in a position {{to take advantage of the}} situation became the moneylenders when the increasing tax demands in the last declining days of the Empire crippled and eventually destroyed the peasant class by reducing tenant-farmers to serfs. It was evident that usury meant exploitation of the poor.|$|E
25|$|The daguerreotypes {{were not}} without drawbacks, however. The main {{difficulty}} {{was that they}} could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use negatives. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for portraiture. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one {{of two or more}} people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her genitals. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for these nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. It was cheaper to hire a prostitute and experience the sex acts than it was to own a picture of them in the 1840s. Stereoscopy was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes, including the erotic images. This technology produced a type of three dimensional view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of <b>rich</b> <b>men.</b> Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than 10,000 GBP.|$|E

25|$|We must {{single out}} the {{children}} who are endowed with high potentialities, and develop them as completely as possible. And in this manner give to the nation a non-hereditary aristocracy. Such children may be found in all classes of society, although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others. The descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities. These qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration. But this degeneration is often superficial. It comes chiefly from education, idleness, lack of responsibility and moral discipline. The sons of very <b>rich</b> <b>men,</b> like those of criminals, should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings. Thus separated from their family, they could manifest their hereditary strength. In the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality. The issue of the Crusaders is by no means extinct. The laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords. It is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination, courage, and judgment, of the heroes of the French or Russian Revolutions, of the high-handed business men who live among us, might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority. As we know, criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble-mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects. High potentialities are rarely encountered in the sons of honest, intelligent, hard-working men who have had ill luck in their careers, who have failed in business or have muddled along all their lives in inferior positions. Or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries. However, from such people sometimes spring artists, poets, adventurers, saints. A brilliantly gifted and well-known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon.|$|E
500|$|Nunney was {{considered}} a conservative, even slightly backward design and probably built to protect against French invasion. Historians such as Robert Liddiard and Matthew Johnson are now less certain. Nunney {{is regarded as a}} bold, striking design, similar in many ways to those at Herstmonceux or Saltwood Castle. Whilst Nunney does resemble many French castles, there is no direct evidence that it was built in imitation of these designs, and indeed there are other English castles, such as Mulgrave and Dudley, that have a similar structure to Nunney's. Nunney Castle may be better understood instead as characteristic of a wider range of tower-keeps built in England during the period, designed, as Nigel Pounds puts it, [...] "to allow very <b>rich</b> <b>men</b> to live in luxury and splendour." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 15th century, {{the fashion}} for the {{creation}} of very expensive, French-influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps spread, with new keeps being built at Wardour, Tattershall, and Raglan Castle. In central and eastern England, some keeps began to be built in brick, with Caister and Tattershall forming examples of this trend. In Scotland, the construction of Holyrood Great Tower between 1528 and 1532 drew on this English tradition, but incorporated additional French influences to produce a highly secure but comfortable keep, guarded by a gun park. These tower keeps were expensive buildings to construct, each built to a unique design for a specific lord and, as historian Norman Pounds has suggested, they [...] "...were designed to allow very <b>rich</b> <b>men</b> to live in luxury and splendour." ...|$|E

500|$|By early 1918, {{many cities}} in western Russia faced famine {{as a result}} of chronic food shortages. Lenin blamed this on the kulaks, or wealthier peasants, who {{allegedly}} hoarded the grain that they had produced to increase its financial value. In May 1918, he issued a requisitioning order that established armed detachments to confiscate grain from kulaks for distribution in the cities, and in June called for the formation of Committees of Poor Peasants to aid in requisitioning. This policy resulted in vast social disorder and violence, as armed detachments often clashed with peasant groups, helping to {{set the stage for the}} civil war. A prominent example of Lenin's views was his August 1918 telegram to the Bolsheviks of Penza, which called upon them to suppress a peasant insurrection by publicly hanging at least 100 [...] "known kulaks, <b>rich</b> <b>men,</b> [...] bloodsuckers".|$|E
500|$|The Great Tower at Raglan Castle, {{sometimes}} called the Yellow Tower of Gwent, sits outside {{the rest of the}} castle, protected by a moat and linked to the Fountain Court by a bridge. The fortification is representative of a trend during the 15th and 16th centuries in British castle building: tower keeps such as this, large, solid buildings designed for private accommodation, probably inspired by those in France, had started to appear in the 14th century at Dudley and Warkworth. In the 15th century the fashion spread, with the creation of French-influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps, such as those at Wardour and Tattershall. These were expensive buildings to construct, each built to a unique design and, as historian Norman Pounds has suggested, [...] "were designed to allow very <b>rich</b> <b>men</b> to live in luxury and splendour".|$|E
500|$|Harvey {{moved his}} office to his cottage next to the amphitheater, as work {{continued}} on the Pyramid. In January 1929, Harvey, along with Lowell and H. L.

The estimated cost of the Pyramid itself was $75,000, but Harvey exhausted his funds on construction of the amphitheater. The stock market crash of 1929 ended all construction. In a last-ditch effort to save the project, Harvey sent letters to wealthy men asking for funds to complete the project. In his letters he explained that civilization was dying and that only <b>rich</b> <b>men,</b> like the intended readers, could save it, if they could send money for his pyramid. Despite the fact that Harvey claimed his correspondence was [...] "the most important letter ever written" [...] he received no replies and the pyramid was never built.
