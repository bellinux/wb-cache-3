40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{using the}} principles of cross ventilation, stack effect, solar roof, and solar chimney techniques into a single roof design to possibly increase the internal air velocity and lower the internal temperatures for residential structures located in hot-humid climates. The environmental conditions common in hot-humid climates include low wind velocity, increased humidity levels and high ambient temperatures. The most benefi cial way to provide thermal comfort for the occupants living in these climates is to increase air velocity across the body, to lower humidity levels, and to lower internal temperatures. The goal is to design a roof system incorporating passive cooling and solar-induced cooling principles which will potentially increase the potential thermal comfort while outperforming conventional residential roof systems without using mechanical systems. The design in this research was tested using physical modeling with data collection and computational simulation using CosmosFlo Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. The software {{was used for the}} computational analysis used to estimate air velocity within the <b>roof</b> <b>testing</b> modules. The preliminary testing results demonstrate a decreased internal temperature using the proposed design over those internal temperatures using typical roofi ng methods. The air velocity test data from the physical models has proved unreliable due to location of the physical testing modules which were infl uenced by higher wind speeds associated with the trade wind fl ow inherent in Hawai‘i. The temperature differences proved large enough between the air inlet vents, interior space, and air cavity to provide increased air movement in the interior of the test v modules. The outcome of this research is encouraging and shows promise that the proposed design could possibly be benefi cial to increase the thermal comfort levels for residential structures in the hot-humid climates. Further exploration and a large amount of research and development are still needed to make this design more effi cient and cost effective for possible wide spread use...|$|E

40|$|A green <b>roof</b> <b>test</b> bed, {{established}} at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, was used to investigate its benefit for storm water management and urban heat island effect mitigation. The system comprised 3 units, 2 {{in the form of}} vegetated roofs and the other a bare roof. The system was equipped with automatic monitoring devices for measuring the hydrological data. Continuous data monitoring on the roofs was conducted to evaluate the thermal and hydrological effects. The study shows that the green <b>roof</b> <b>test</b> bed can significantly reduce the roof surface temperature (by an average of 7. 3 ºC) and lower the ambient air temperature (by an average of 0. 5 ºC) when compared with a bare roof during day time hours (from 10 : 00 am to 4 : 00 pm). The ability to reduce and delay the peak runoff was demonstrated by using a typical rainfall event with 18 mm depth. The designed system is useful in evaluating both thermal and hydrological benefits of a green roof system in tropical areas and can offer guidance to local managers in mitigating the urban heat island effect and designing storm water management strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{tracking}} the Maximum Power Point (MPP), known as MPPT, becomes problematic under realistic operating conditions {{due to the}} potential {{for there to be}} more than one local maxima. A very detailed physics based model has been developed for a PV module (in this application a PV roof tile) using the Orcad platform for PSpice. This model is unusual in that it properly represents partial module shading and cell temperature variation. The PV roof tile, based on polycrystalline silicon cells, comprises 18 series-connected cells. In the model, each cell is represented by a standard two-diode sub-model, for which different levels of radiation and cell temperature can be simulated to obtain a realistic overall I-V characteristic for the module. The model can be extended to model any reasonable number of PV roof tiles wired in series and parallel to form a roof array. The IV characteristics calculated in this way using PSpice will be validated using an outdoor PV <b>roof</b> <b>test</b> system located at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow...|$|R

Nine green <b>roof</b> <b>test</b> beds (TB) which vary systematically in their substrate composition and vegetation options have been monitored since April 2010 at the University of Sheffield, UK. Three green roof substrates were tested: two commercial substrates manufactured by Alumasc – Heather with Lavender (HLS) and Sedum Carpet (SCS) Substrate were considered alongside a Lightweight Expanded Clay Aggregate (LECA) -based substrate. Three vegetation treatments have been tested: a drought tolerant specie (sedum), a meadow flower mixture and a no vegetation option. Per event retention performance varied depending on the initial water content within the substrate and the characteristics of the rainfall event. Consistent behaviour was observed among the <b>tested</b> green <b>roof</b> configurations with respect to per event retention. Greater retention was associated with HLS and SCS substrates when compared with LECA. Vegetated configurations showed consistently higher retention performance. Sedum vegetation resulted in higher retention performance than Meadow Flower. This was particularly evident on the LECA substrate...|$|R

40|$|Obligatory {{standards}} are dictated to vehicle manufacturers for decreasing {{the high number}} of road dead tolls in rollover crashes; at the same time demands to produce light-weight vehicles have increased substantially to reduce the toxic gases emission. This paper presents a new design of the roof strengthening configuration in which sandwich material has been used. This type of configuration improves the energy absorption capacity of the vehicle roof system and dissipates impact energy in a controlled manner. In reality, carrying out <b>roof</b> crush <b>test</b> is not cost effective, thus numerical analysis of vehicle <b>roof</b> crush <b>test</b> has been performed according to standard FMVSS 216 test. Sandwich structures with unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite face-sheets and Expanded Polypropylene (EPP) foam core have been used to model different configurations for vehicle roof structure. The effects of increasing the foam core density and face-sheets thickness on the energy absorption and strength-to-weight ratio (SWR) of vehicle roof structure have been investigated. Results revealed that, the optimized sandwich solution type 6 with the face sheets thickness of 0. 8 mm and foam core of 70 kg/m 3 density reduces the vehicle roof panel mass by 68 % while it has almost the same structural performance with the steel solution having equal value of SWR...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} experimentalwork to determine {{the structure of the}} slipstream and wake of a high speed train. The experiments were carried out using a 1 / 25 th scale model of a four-coach train on a moving model rig (MMR). Flow velocities were measured using a rake of single hot films positioned close to the model side or <b>roof.</b> <b>Tests</b> were carried out at different model speeds, with and without the simulation of a crosswind. Velocity time histories for each configuration were obtained from ensemble averages of the results of a number of runs. A small number of particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) experiments were also carried out, and a wavelet analysis revealed details of the unsteady flow structure around the vehicle. It was shown that the flowfield around the vehicle could be divided into a number of different regions of distinct flow characteristics: an upstream region, a nose region, a boundary layer region, a near wake region and a far wake region. If the results were suitably normalized, the effect of model speed was small. The effect of crosswinds was to add an increment to the slipstream and wake velocities, and this resulted in very high slipstream velocities in the nose region...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{conceptual}} hydrological green roof model developed in Sheffield, UK, {{this article explores}} the potential hydrological performance characteristics of a green roof in Malaysia. The conceptual rainfallrunoff model was created from data collected on an extensive green <b>roof</b> <b>test</b> bed outfitted with a commercial green roof system. The model related the roof’s performance to the hydrological processes, the roof’s physical characteristics and the local climatic conditions. The developed model used both hydrological flux modelling and reservoir routing techniques to evaluate the performance of rainfall retention (volumetric control) and detention (temporal delay), respectively (Stovin et al., 2013; Vesuviano et al., 2014). Utilising the generic conceptual model, data from Batu Pahat, Malaysia was used to predict retention. The same physical configuration of the Sheffield test bed was assumed. An 11 -year rainfall record was used to explore the likely effectiveness of a similarly configured green roof in a Malaysian environment, both {{on an annual basis}} and in response to specific storm events. The simulation results indicated a similarly configured roof in a Malaysian climate could reduce runoff by 84 % on a per-event basis and achieved a 51 % overall volumetric retention.

40|$|Three hip roofed {{building}} {{models of}} 15 °, 20 °, and 30 ° roof pitch, respectively, are {{tested in a}} wind tunnel to investigate wind pressure distributions over hip roofs {{and the effect of}} roof pitch on roof pressures. The pressures measured on the hip roofs are then compared with those on gable roofs of otherwise similar geometry to evaluate the effect of roof shape on roof pressures. Finally, the measured roof pressures of commonly-used probability of occurrence are compared with Meecham's work in terms of local mean and peak pressures. The results show that roof pitch does affect both the magnitude and distribution of hip roof pressures. The 30 ° hip roof experiences the highest peak suction at roof corner among the three <b>tested</b> hip <b>roofs.</b> The worst peak suctions are much smaller on the hip roofs than on the gable roofs for 15 ° and 20 ° roof pitches.
