40|$|This {{appeal was}} {{originally}} heard by a bench of three judges and, afterwards, considered by a bench of nine {{in an effort}} to resolve recent contradictory decisions. It was held that the possessor of an immovable under a promise of sale authorizing the promising vendor to retake possession of the property without compensation or indemnity in the event of failure by the promising purchaser to fulfil his obligations under the deed, is entitled to the sixty-day notice prescribed by articles 1040 a and following of the Civil code. In the matter, the creditor, did not serve, as required by articles 1040 a and 1040 d C. c, the 60 days notice on the possessor with promise of sale. The fact that it would be pointless for the creditor to register the notice against his own property upon which the debtor had yet no <b>registered</b> <b>right</b> of ownership has no bearing, in the Court's opinion, upon the conclusion that the creditor is not obliged to give a 60 day notice to the debtor...|$|E
40|$|By {{entering}} into {{effect of the}} new Entity laws on the land registry, a new definition {{of the principle of}} trust is introduced, a definition that aims at the protection of the rights that have been acquired on the basis of incorrect or incomplete land registry status. However, the question arises of whether the third conscientious person will have any protection regarding the acquisition of property rights on real estate that is a part of marital assets, when such real estate is recorded in the land registry only belonging to one marital partner. In the legal theory and jurisprudence the issue of validity of the legal relation regarding the sale and the burdening of such real estate by the <b>registered</b> <b>right</b> holder has been raised. Bearing in mind the fact that in our legal system the principle of causal tradition is applied, coming to the correct position on this legal issue is very significant. Further scientific research in this area is of particular importance due to the ongoing process of the reform of land registry law, whose purpose is the reaffirmation of the land registry and the creation of legal presumptions for a faster and simpler legal disposition of real estate...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{know the}} {{patients}} ’ expectations and {{the fulfillment of}} these at family medicine consultations by resident doctors and to assess their effect on some consultation outcomes. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients attending family medicine consultations held by 38 resident doctors: 1, 301 eligible patients, 702 filled in all questionnaires. MEASUREMENTS: Before each visit, the patients ’ ex-pectations about that particular consultation were <b>registered.</b> <b>Right</b> after the visit was over, their percep-tion of several aspects of the communicative interac-tion with the doctor was measured. Later, patients were interviewed {{on the phone to}} know how their expectations had been fulfilled, how satisfied they were about the consultation, how they had followed the doctor’s suggestions, {{if they were going to}} seek further care for the same cause later, and the evolution of their clinical problem. Logistic regression was the main analysis used. RESULTS: The most common expectations were the doctor showing interest and listening (30. 5 %), getting some information about the diagnosis (16. 3 %), and sharing problems and doubts (11. 1 %). The rate of main expectations that were met was 76. 5 %. Satis-faction with the encounter was associated with the clinical evolution [odds ratio (OR) 2. 23; confidence interval (CI) : 1. 32 – 3. 75], and the fulfilling of the patients ’ main or two main expectations was signif-icantly related to all the measured outcomes (satis...|$|E
40|$|The ion-induced {{pressure}} instability {{is a hard}} limitation for {{the maximum}} intensity, and hence the ultimate luminosity achievable in a proton accelerator. This instability {{is due to the}} interaction of high intensity proton beams with the residual gas generating positive ions. These ions, accelerated by the beam space charge, impact on the vaccuum chamber wall and lead to the desorption of gaseous species like $H_{ 2 }, CH_{ 4 }, C_{ 2 }H_{ 4 }, C_{ 2 }H_{ 6 }, CO$ and $CO_{ 2 }$. These gases can in turn be ionized by the circulating beam, and initiate a pressure run-away process causing the loss of the stored beam. This phenomenon was first <b>registered</b> <b>right</b> at the beginning of operation of the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) at CERN in 1970. Later on, a long term evolution of the pressure was recorded for a stable stored beam current where a change of the residual gas composition was measured. In order to adapt the pumping speed and the surface treatments to the desired circulating beam currents, mathematical tools (e. g. VASCO code) exist to calculate pressure profiles in accelerator vacuum systems. A key input for these programs is the desorption yield of the surface, i. e. the number of molecules released by incoming ions and one of the limitations of these programs results from the lack of data concerning the ion-induced desorption yields dependence on the nature and mass of the incident ions. To improve our knowledge of these desorption yields, the ion-induced desorption of Oxygen-Free High Conductivity (OFHC) copper samples has been studied at room temperature for various primary ions: noble gas ions and ions produced by the ionization of the common gases encountered in accelerator vacuum systems, i. e. $H^{+}_{ 2 }, CH^{+}_{ 4 }, CO^{+}$ and $CO^{+}_{ 2 }$. The measured dependence of the desorption yields on the mass, energy and nature of the incident ions is presented and discussed. In this context, the decrease of the ion-induced desorption yield {{as a function of the}} incident ion dose (so called "beam cleaning") has been studied for OFHC-copper and other materials. From these measurements, desorption cross-sections have been calculated and are compared with results from corresponding measurements found in the literature. A model, which relates the sputter yield with the nuclear and electronic energy loss of ions in matter, has been applied to the ion-induced desorption: Conclusions concerning the influence of the mass and energy on the mechanism of desorption are presented...|$|E
40|$|To avoid {{collision}} {{in society}} caused by land proprietary concern, the government make {{a policy to}} manage land proprietary and conducting land registration, both systematically and sporadically, includes land registration at {{the first time and}} land registration data maintenance. Land registration data maintenance is done if it is occurred physical or juridical data changes on land registration object, which has been <b>registered,</b> because of <b>rights</b> transfer through trade, grant, barter and so on. In this thesis, writer adapts problems about 1) how is law awareness of Genengan society on the obligation to <b>register</b> <b>rights</b> transfer of land post-adjudication? 2) What factors are affecting law awareness of Genengan society on the obligation to <b>register</b> <b>rights</b> transfer of land post-adjudication? Here writer uses sociological-juridical approach, which means that conducting research by looking at law as human behavior in society, that is government regulation number 24 year 1997 managing about the establishment of land registration in regard to the committed to and development in society. In section 36 sub-section (2) government regulation number 24 year 1997 mentioned about the existence of rights holding obligation to register his/her land if it is occurred right transfer of land. But, what happen in the society, especially Genengan society, not all right transfer of land is registered because of some reasons. For instance, respondents perceive that cost to <b>register</b> <b>rights</b> transfer of land is weighed against them. Respondents do not know much about its procedure yet, because there is no information about land registration and previously do not get socialization from the concerned instance. Writer can give some thought contribution in this thesis, such as: government should review Land Registration Law related to the cost, adjusted to society economy condition, especially villager. It is expected that government simplify all the things related to both land registration costs and its procedures in one law, in order to not puzzling the society. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of intellectual property}} rights (IPR) to society and the economy in Europe has become increasingly clear in recent years. The study on the contribution made by IPR-intensive industries to the EU economy carried out in 2013, {{in partnership with the}} European Patent Office, demonstrated the {{importance of}} those industries. It showed they support directly or indirectly 35 % of jobs, almost 39 % of the EU’s GDP and 90 % of exter-nal trade. OHIM, through the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, has now carried out a follow-up study delving deeper into the influence of these rights at the firm or company level. This study, based on official public financial data from more than 2. 3 million EU firms, covers companies which own patents, trade marks and designs at both national and at EU level. The study shows that large companies are four times more likely to own IP rights than smaller companies- 40 % of larger firms have <b>registered</b> <b>rights,</b> compared with 9 % of SMEs.
