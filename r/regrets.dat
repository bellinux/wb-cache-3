40|$|Decision makers {{can become}} trapped by myopic <b>regret</b> {{avoidance}} in which rejecting feedback to avoid short-term outcome <b>regret</b> (<b>regret</b> associated with counterfactual outcome comparisons) leads to reduced learning and greater long-term <b>regret</b> over continuing poor decisions. In {{a series of}} laboratory experiments involving repeated choices among uncertain monetary prospects, participants primed with outcome <b>regret</b> tended to decline feedback, learned the task slowly or not at all, and performed poorly. This pattern was reversed when decision makers were primed with self-blame <b>regret</b> (<b>regret</b> over an unjustified decision). Further, in a final experiment in which task learning was unnecessary, feedback was more often rejected in the self-blame <b>regret</b> condition than in the outcome <b>regret</b> condition.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} new <b>regret</b> scales and examine whether a decision aid affects {{different aspects of}} <b>regret</b> in the treatment choice for prostate cancer. METHODS: This was a multicentre trial (three sites) with imbalanced randomization (1 : 2). From 2008 to 2011, patients with localized prostate cancer were randomized 1 : 2 to usual care (N = 77) or usual care plus a decision aid presenting {{risks and benefits of}} different treatments (N = 163). The treatments were surgery and (external or interstitial) radiotherapy. <b>Regret</b> was assessed before, and 6 and 12 months after treatment, using the Decisional <b>regret</b> scale by Brehaut et al. (Medical Decision Making, 23, 2003, 281), and three new scales focusing on process, option and outcome <b>regret.</b> The relation between decision aid and <b>regret</b> was analysed by anova. RESULTS: The concurrent validity of the new <b>regret</b> scales was confirmed by correlations between <b>regret</b> and anxiety, depression, decision evaluation scales and health-related quality of life. With a decision aid, patient participation was increased (P = 0. 002), but <b>regret</b> was not. If anything, in patients with serious morbidity the decision aid resulted in a trend to less option <b>regret</b> and less Brehaut <b>regret</b> (P = 0. 075 and P = 0. 061, with effect sizes of 0. 35 and 0. 38, respectively). Exploratory analyses suggest that high-risk patients benefitted most from the decision aid. CONCLUSION: The new <b>regret</b> scales may be of value in distinguishing separate aspects of <b>regret.</b> In general, <b>regret</b> was not affected by the decision aid. In patients with serious morbidity, a trend to lower option <b>regret</b> with a decision aid was observed...|$|R
40|$|Emotion {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular spots in recent {{decision}} making research, while <b>regret</b> is always being considered as the most relevant emotion with decision making. Current article firstly reviewed the literature of <b>regret</b> theory to date to profile the relation between <b>regret</b> and decision making under uncertainty through three mainlines: experienced <b>regret,</b> anticipated <b>regret</b> and <b>regret</b> orientation, respectively. And then, based on the theory of <b>regret</b> regulation raised by Zeelenberg recently, we came up with a theory of risk preference regulated by <b>regret.</b> Then three studies were conducted under the current framework, by using experiment, survey, and quasi experiment design. The major findings were below: In study 1, when playing ultimatum game, risk preference in decision making can be determined by experienced <b>regret</b> and anticipated <b>regret</b> of risk aversion, which made individual risk taking; In study 2, survey showed that risk orientation was negatively related with risk taking (health/safety, recreational and social); In study 3, when asked the Asian Disease Problem, risk preference can be determined by the coherence of the risk preference between the past decision and the current alternative. Individuals much more like alternative with the same risk preference of the past decision. A two way interaction was found, <b>regret</b> orientation, as a personality, was found as a moderator. Individuals with high <b>regret</b> orientation were more sensitive to the coherence of the risk preference than those with low <b>regret</b> orientation. Three studies provide fruitful evidences for the theory of risk preference regulated by <b>regret</b> in different prospective, show us the function of <b>regret</b> in decision making. 情绪是近期的决策领域的研究热点之一，后悔又是与决策联系最紧密的情绪问题，本文在回顾后悔研究的理论及相关文献，特别是基于Zeelenberg的后悔调节理论的基础上，从体验后悔，预期后悔和后悔倾向三条主线出发，探索后悔与风险决策的关系，分别采用行为实验，问卷调查和剧情实验的研究方法，获得了如下研究结果： 第一，在行为实验中，当被试玩最后通牒游戏时，风险规避的体验后悔和预期后悔能够影响决策者的风险偏好，让其更加追逐风险； 第二、在问卷调查中，后悔倾向和风险倾向（安全健康，休闲娱乐，以及社交三个子领域）有明显的负相关； 第三，在剧情实验中，当被试面对亚洲疾病问题时，现在决策与过去决策的风险偏好异同将影响个体现在决策的风险偏好，对于与过去决策的风险偏好相同的选项，个体的选择意愿高于与过去决策的风险偏好不同的选项。研究发现，后悔倾向对该关系存在调节作用——对于后悔倾向高的个体，现在决策和过去决策的风险偏好异同对于风险偏好的影响大于其对后悔倾向低的个体的影响。 第四、三个研究分别从三个不同的侧面对研究者提出的后悔调节风险偏好的理论进行了验证，揭示了后悔在决策过程中的作用，为理论的建构提供了实证证据...|$|R

Participants were presented with a sequence of two different decision tasks: a choice between two risky gambles followed by a matching task. To induce experienced <b>regret,</b> we provided two different types of feedback on the gambles: non-regret and <b>regret</b> feedbacks. To gain insights to the role of anticipated <b>regret</b> in mediating the effect of experienced <b>regret,</b> we also introduced two different types of feedback on the matching task: partial and complete feedback. We found that prior experienced <b>regret</b> and complete feedback on the subsequent choice should be both present for a change in behavior in the subsequent different choice. To interpret our results, we provide analytical considerations based on our hypothesis of changed subjective probability to <b>regret,</b> consistent with the observed behavior. risk choice, <b>regret</b> theory...|$|R
