40|$|Mustard leaf (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.) {{using as}} {{material}} {{of a traditional}} fermented vegetable food (Kimchi) in Korea, {{is one of the}} important vegetables. Two cultivars of mustard (red and green) were grown in the experimental farm of Chungnam National University and allowed them to grow until flowering stage. In this study, the variability of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content and mRNA transcript levels of genes involved in GABA biosynthesis were investigated in 2 cultivars (green and red mustard) of Brassica juncea. We observed that the transcript levels of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 1, 2, and 4 a in roots were the highest, whereas those in seeds were the lowest compared with other organs harvested at flowering stage in green mustard. The transcript levels in green and <b>red</b> <b>mustards</b> displayed similar transcription patterns among a variety of organs, except for those of BjGAD 2 and 4 a in roots. In red mustard, the GABA content in flower buds was the highest (179. 8 mg 100 g- 1 FW), whereas roots contained the lowest amount (1. 77 mg 100 g- 1 FW). In green mustard, the GABA content in young leaves was the highest (97. 76 mg 100 g- 1 FW), whereas seeds had the lowest (1. 23 mg 100 g- 1 FW). Green and red mustard contained varying amounts of GABA in different organs. Specially, because green and red mustard leaf has high GABA content compared with other vegetables, it {{can be used as a}} good vegetable for healthy...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Belgium, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), compiled an application to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance indoxacarb in rucola, cress, land cress, <b>red</b> <b>mustard,</b> other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves). In order to accommodate for the intended uses of indoxacarb, Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the limit of quantification to 1 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 1 mg/kg for the proposed uses on rucola, cress, land cress, <b>red</b> <b>mustard,</b> other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves). Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of indoxacarb on the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of indoxacarb on rucola, cress, land cress, <b>red</b> <b>mustard,</b> other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves) will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|R

40|$|Ready-to-eat baby-leaf {{vegetables}} {{market has}} been growing and offering to consumers convenient, healthy and appealing products, which may contain interesting bioactive compounds. In this work, the composition {{and the evolution of}} the phenolic compounds from different baby-leaf vegetables during refrigerated storage was studied. The phenolic compounds were extracted using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and the phenolic profile of each sample was analyzed and quantified by using LC-MS and LC-DAD methods, respectively, at the beginning {{and at the end of}} a 10 -day storage period. The baby-leaf vegetables studied included green lettuce, ruby red lettuce, swiss chard, spinach, pea shoots, watercress, garden cress, mizuna, <b>red</b> <b>mustard,</b> wild rocket and spearmint samples and a total of 203 phenolic compounds were tentatively identified and quantified. The main naturally phenolic compounds identified correspond to glycosylated flavonoids, with exception of green lettuce and spearmint leaves which had a higher content of hydroxycinnamic acids. Quantification of the main compounds showed a 10 -fold higher content of total phenolic content of ruby red lettuce (483 mgg- 1) in relation to the other samples, being the lowest values found in the garden cress (12. 8 mgg- 1) and wild rocket leaves (8. 1 mgg- 1). The total phenolic content only showed a significant change (p< 0. 05) after storage in the green lettuce (+ 17. 5 %), mizuna (+ 7. 8 %), <b>red</b> <b>mustard</b> (- 23. 7 %) and spearmint (- 13. 8 %) leaves. Within the different classes of phenolic compounds monitored, the flavonols showed more stable contents than the hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids, although the behavior of each compound varied strongly among samples. © 2014.

5000|$|In 1954, the Parker Jotter had an {{inverted}} [...] "V" [...] style clip without the arrow engraving. The 1954 Jotter came with red, green, light gray, dark gray and black barrels, made of grooved nylon, not smooth plastic. The following year, {{because of the}} popularity of the pen, the choice of colors was extended to include bright <b>red,</b> <b>mustard</b> yellow, bright green and bright orange. These later colors are more difficult to find now. There are also cap variations resulting from differences in imprints, most noticeably the introduction of the Parker arrow logo and two sizes of the [...] "MADE IN USA" [...] imprint. Towards the end of production, smooth barrels were introduced without a metal tip. These proved to be prone to splitting and a metal tip was incorporated to improve durability. These barrels are also found with the early so-called [...] "21" [...] variety (see immediately below).|$|R

40|$|Glucosinolates are {{secondary}} metabolites {{of almost}} all plants of the order Brassicales, and {{have been known to}} control nematode populations. In this study, 14 glucosinolates were identified, quantified, and compared in several varieties and cultivars of cruciferous plants including Brassica campestris ssp. pekinensis (Chinese cabbage), Brassica juncea var. crispifolia L. H. Bailey (mustard), Brassica juncea L. Czern. var. juncea (leaf mustard), Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala (kale), Raphanus sativus L. (radish), and Brassica campestris L. ssp. oleifera (winter turnip rape). The most abundant glucosinolate in mustard, leaf mustard, kale, and radish was sinigrin. In leaf mustard, the sinigrin content ranged from 193. 05 μmol/g to 215. 52 μmol/g, and in mustard, the sinigrin contents of blue <b>mustard</b> and <b>red</b> <b>mustard</b> were 219. 08 μmol/g and 215. 73 μmol/g, respectively. Kale and radish contained 137. 79 μmol/g and 120. 25 μmol/g, respectively, of sinigrin. Gluconapin was the most abundant glucosinolate in winter turnip rape, at 121. 17 μmol/g. Chinese cabbage contained mostly glucocochlearin (79. 88 μmol/g). These results will be useful in the development of environmentally friendly plant-based pesticides by allowing for proper control of glucosinolates based on those present in the chosen plant species. ...|$|R
50|$|Orcs {{vary widely}} in {{appearance}} {{as a result}} of frequent crossbreeding with other species. In general, they resemble primitive humans with grey-green skin covered with coarse hair. Orcs have a slightly stooped posture, a low jutting forehead, and a snout instead of a nose. Orcs have well-developed canine teeth for eating meat and short pointed ears that resemble those of a wolf. Orcish snouts and ears have a slightly pink tinge. Their eyes are human, with a reddish tint that sometimes makes them appear to glow red when they reflect dim light sources in near darkness. This is actually part of their optical system, a pigment which gives them infravision. Male orcs are about 5½ to 6 feet tall. Females average 6 inches shorter than males. Orcs prefer to wear colors that most humans think unpleasant: blood <b>red,</b> rust <b>red,</b> <b>mustard</b> yellow, yellow green, moss green, greenish purple, and blackish brown. Their armor is unattractive besides—dirty and often a bit rusty. Orcs speak Orcish, a language derived from older human and elvish languages. There is no common standard of Orcish, so the language has many dialects which vary from tribe to tribe. Orcs have also learned to speak local common tongues, but are not comfortable with them. Some orcs have a limited vocabulary in goblin, hobgoblin, and ogre dialects.|$|R

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{analysis of}} fat- and water-soluble vitamins from foods {{is a difficult}} task considering {{the wide range of}} chemical structures involved. In this work, a new procedure based on a sequential extraction and analysis of both types of vitamins is presented. The procedure couples several simple extraction steps to LC–MS/MS and LC–DAD in order to quantify the free vitamins contents in fresh-cut vegetables before and after a 10 -days storage period. The developed method allows the correct quantification of vitamins C, B 1, B 2, B 3, B 5, B 6, B 9, E and provitamin A in ready-to-eat green leafy vegetable products including green lettuce, ruby red lettuce, watercress, swiss chard, lamb's lettuce, spearmint, spinach, wild rocket, pea leaves, mizuna, garden cress and <b>red</b> <b>mustard.</b> Using this optimized methodology, low LOQs were attained for the analyzed vitamins in less than 100 min, including extraction and vitamin analysis using 2 optimized procedures; good repeatability and linearity was achieved for all vitamins studied, while recoveries ranged from 83 % to 105 %. The most abundant free vitamins found in leafy vegetable products were vitamin C, provitamin A and vitamin E. The richest sample on vitamin C and provitamin A was pea leaves (154 mg/g fresh weight and 14. 4 mg/ 100 g fresh weight, respectively), whereas lamb's lettuce was the vegetable with the highest content on vitamin E (3. 1 mg/ 100 g fresh weight). Generally, some losses of vitamins were detected after storage, although the behavior of each vitamin varied strongly among samples.
