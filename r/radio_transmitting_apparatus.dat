It is true that after the invention of the true vacuum triode in 1913 (see below), de Forrest continued to manufacture various types of <b>radio</b> <b>transmitting</b> and receiving <b>apparatus,</b> (examples of which are illustrated on this page). However, although he routinely described these devices as using [...] "Audions", they actually used high-vacuum triodes, using circuitry very similar to that developed by other experimenters.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{developmental}} {{investigation of}} sound <b>transmitting</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{is important in}} understanding the ontogenetic processes behind morphological diversity. The development of sound conducting apparatus was studied in Montpellier snake; Malpolon monspessulanus at 6. 5, 7. 2, 8. 3 and 9. 3 cm total body lengths using light microscopy study. The columella auris firstly appeared as undifferentiated rod shape mesenchymal cells. As the growth proceeded, it chondrified and differentiates into two main parts. In addition, the viscerocranium components which participate in formation of sound <b>transmitting</b> <b>apparatus</b> undergo critical organization. In more advanced stages, procartilagenous stylohyal chondrified and fuse with the well organized quadrate. These data considered {{as a base for}} functional and molecular mechanisms of sound <b>transmitting</b> <b>apparatus</b> studies and identification of diseases that may infect them...|$|R
