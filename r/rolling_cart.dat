The rest of The Lone Shark’s crew was usually working in the control room, keeping in contact with Haffner in the studio through a communication headset that was plugged into either Haffner’s camera or a port in the studio’s wall. Haffner almost always stood directly behind the camera that was pointed at Sharky, to keep Sharky from looking away from the camera as they spoke during the program. Because The Lone Shark was unscripted and the teleprompter on Sharky’s camera was not used for text to be read, Sharky asked the WFAC-TV technicians to show Haffner how to re-wire the teleprompter so that it displayed the same video feed that The Lone Shark’s viewers were watching. This was so that Sharky would be able to know exactly what could and could not be seen by the home viewers.

Laptop computer usage is a significant portion of business computer use. Many mobile computer users face problems with laptop and peripheral equipment transportation. This study gathered and analyzed data concerning three methods of laptop transportation: a briefcase, a shoulder bag, and a <b>rolling</b> <b>cart.</b> Methods were compared on the bases of heart rate, energy expenditure, biomechanical analysis, and subjective responses. With the cart, a significantly lower average heart rate (119 beats per minute) was measured, which, in turn, resulted in a lower percentage of maximum oxygen consumption (48 % for females and 46 % for males), and, therefore, also resulted in lower energy expenditure. Biomechanical analysis showed that the total compressive force on L 5 /S 1 was less for the cart than for the briefcase or the shoulder bag-, this transportation method created less stress on the L 5 /S 1 vertebral joint. When participants used the cart to transport a laptop and peripherals, they reported less pain, especially in the shoulder, upper arm, elbow, lower back, lower arm, wrist, and hand than when they used a shoulder bag or a briefcase. Also, slightly more then fifty percent of the participants would consider using a <b>rolling</b> <b>cart</b> on a daily basis, especially if it were designed for office use and not just for traveling. It was determined that the most effective laptop transportation method of those studied under laboratory controlled conditions was the <b>rolling</b> <b>cart.</b> Using the <b>rolling</b> <b>cart</b> produced less pain, required less energy, produced the least stress on the L 5 /S 1 vertebral joint than did the briefcase or the shoulder bag, and was reported to be the preferred method of transportation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Most {{existing}} {{approaches to}} indoor localization focus on using either cameras or laser scanners {{as the primary}} sensor for pose estimation. In scan matching based localization, finding scan point correspondences across scans is challenging as individual scan points lack unique attributes. In camera based localization, one {{has to deal with}} images with few or no visual features as well as scale factor ambiguities to recover absolute distances. In this paper, we develop multimodal approaches for two indoor localization problems by fusing a camera and laser scanners in order to alleviate the drawbacks of each individual modality. For our first problem we recover 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) of a camera-laser rig on a <b>rolling</b> <b>cart</b> in a 2 D plane, by using visual odometry to facilitate scan correspondence estimation. We demonstrate this approach to result in a 0. 3 % loop closure error for a 60 m loop around the interior corridor of a building.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{a discussion of}} the theoretical background for Fourier spatial filtering and a description of the design and construction of a portable in-class spatial filtering apparatus. A portable, in-class spatial filtering demonstration apparatus was designed and built. This apparatus uses liquid crystal display (LCD) panels from two projectors as the object and filter masks. The blue LCD panel from the first projector serves as the object mask, and the red panel from the second projector serves as the filter mask. The panels were extracted from their projectors and mounted onto aluminum blocks which are held in place by optical component mounts. Images are written to the LCD panels via custom open source software developed for this apparatus which writes independent monochromatic images to the video signal. The software has two monochromatic image windows, basic image manipulation tools, and two video feed input display windows. Two complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors are positioned to record the reconstructed image of the object mask and the diffraction pattern created by the object mask. The object and filter mask can be digitally changed and the effects on the filtered image and diffraction pattern can be observed in real-time.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [74]- 75) The {{purpose of}} this gait analysis study was to further research the electrogoniometric vibrotactile feedback methods that aid in patient gait therapy. As compared to the standard electrogoniometer used in patient therapy, a lighter, more comfortable device was designed and analyzed to provide the patient with specific information about his/her gait cycle during stance phase. Sensors were attached onto the patient's leg to acquire the necessary information. In this study, micro-arc electrolytic tilt sensors, or clinometers, were employed. Clinometers measure the angle, with respect to gravity, that provides linear information about the patient's knee joint angle. A time and frequency domain analysis was performed to reveal certain characteristics about the sensor's responses. The information concluded that, because of differing step and stride length and speed at which a person walks, only the time domain was of particular interest in determining the patients' problems such as hyperextension (HE). Research was done in two distinct phases, both preceded by baseline studies at Northern Illinois University (NIU). Phase I included five cognizant participating stroke patients at Marionjoy Rehabilitation Hospital (MJR). These patients were simply used for data collection purposes to first characterize the sensor's response. The setup included two sensors fastened onto the thigh and calf. The sensors were connected to a signal conditioning board, which was, in turn, connected to a "virtual instrument" driven data acquisition (DA) system. This DA system was interfaced to a computer which sat on a portable <b>rolling</b> <b>cart.</b> Patients were prepared and asked to walk 15 m {{in a straight line}} for a total of three trials to obtain an average. As a result of the Phase I initial data collection and analysis process, a vibratory device was developed. Phase II included three additional patients who were examined using the vibratory device. "Real-time" feedback was provided to the patient as he/she hyperextended during his/her therapy. These patients' trials were captured on video with the device in use. As a result, the first two patients were used as Phase II pilot studies to resolve any problems the device might have during the patient's therapy. The third patient in Phase II was used to evaluate the device daily in conjunction with a two-week therapy session. Both the patient and MJR found this study to be a useful predecessor to a modified device which indicates HE appropriately. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal for my efforts during this internship {{was to help}} prepare for the Space Launch System (SLS) integrated modal test (IMT) with Rodney Rocha. In 2018, the Structural Engineering Loads and Dynamics Team will have 10 days to perform the IMT on the SLS Integrated Launch Vehicle. After that 10 day period, we will have about two months to analyze the test data and determine whether the integrated vehicle modes/frequencies are adequate for launching the vehicle. Because of the time constraints, NASA must have newly developed post-test analysis methods proven well and with technical confidence before testing. NASA civil servants along with help from rotational interns are working with novel techniques developed and applied external to Johnson Space Center (JSC) to uncover issues in applying this technique to much larger scales than ever before. We intend to use modal decoupling methods to separate the entangled vibrations coming from the SLS and its support structure during the IMT. This new approach is still under development. The primary goal of my internship was to learn the basics of structural dynamics and physical vibrations. I was able to accomplish this by working on two experimental test set ups, the Simple Beam and TAURUS-T, and by doing some light analytical and post-processing work. Within the Simple Beam project, my role involves changing the data acquisition system, reconfiguration of the test set up, transducer calibration, data collection, data file recovery, and post-processing analysis. Within the TAURUS-T project, my duties included cataloging and removing the 30 + triaxial accelerometers, coordinating {{the removal of the}} structure from the current <b>rolling</b> <b>cart</b> to a sturdy billet for further testing, preparing the accelerometers for remounting, accurately calibrating, mounting, and mapping of all accelerometer channels, and some testing. Hammer and shaker tests will be performed to easily visualize mode shapes at low frequencies. Short analytical projects using MATLAB were also assigned to aid in research efforts. These included integration of acceleration data for comparison to measured displacement data. Laplace and Fourier transforms were also investigated to determine viability as a method of modal decoupling. In addition to these projects, I was also able contribute work that would benefit future interns and the division as a whole. I gave a short presentation and answered questions to aid in the recruitment of subsequent interns and co-ops for the division. I also assisted in revisions and additions to Intern/Co-Op Handbook to provide incoming employees with background information on the organization they are about to work for. I further developed tutorial on Pulse software, which was used for data acquisition for both experiments and will be helpful to interns and engineers that may be unfamiliar to the software. I gained a diverse range of experience throughout my internship. I was introduced to advanced dynamics and analytical techniques. This was through new experience with both hands on experimentation and analytical post processing methods.

40|$|In {{comparison}} to their weight, honeycomb composite structures {{have a high}} bending stiffness, which makes them very suited for every application where little weight is important, like airplanes, railway-cars and vehicles. The sandwich panels consist of two thin and stiff aluminium face sheets, which are bonded to a thick and lightweight aluminium honeycomb core. These structures are subjected to dynamic loading. However, in literature, there are hardly any fatigue properties of the honeycomb core described. The fatigue properties of the core are investigated using the finite element method and experiments. Depending on the load application, the honeycomb core fails either through core indentation or shear failure. For a fatigue prediction, both failure modes have to be investigated. Additionally the physical behavior of the honeycomb core is depending on {{the orientation of the}} core. Hence, fatigue tests were conducted in three directions of the core: the stiffest direction, the most compliant direction and the direction with the highest stresses. A three-point bending test setup was built to study the fatigue properties of the honeycomb core. Several fatigue tests were carried out with a load ratio of R= 0. 1 (maximum load 10 times bigger than minimum load) and the fatigue diagrams being illustrated. Additionally, Food-Cart Roller Tests (wheels of a <b>cart</b> <b>rolling</b> in a circle on a floor panel) were done to dynamically test the panels in every angle. The sandwich structures were modeled with the ANSYS finite element software. The simulations, which were used to determine the stress amplitudes in the specimens, are described in the following pages. In addition, buckling analyses were used to examine core indentation failure. Based on these simulations, failure predictions can be made. The fatigue life of the examined specimens is successfully approximated in this manuscript, with the lifetime analysis being based on the FKM-guideline (error less than 14 % in load amplitude) ...|$|R
