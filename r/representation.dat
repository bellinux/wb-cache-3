Wigner's theorem proved by Wigner in 1931, is a cornerstone of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. The theorem specifies how physical symmetries such as rotations, translations, and CPT symmetry are represented on the Hilbert space of states. According to the theorem, any symmetry transformation is represented by a linear and unitary or antilinear and antiunitary transformation of Hilbert space. The <b>representation</b> of a symmetry group on a Hilbert space is either an ordinary <b>representation</b> or a projective <b>representation.</b>|$|E

The {{present study is}} the first in which maternal and paternal attachment <b>representations</b> after term, moderately and very preterm birth are compared. In addition, special attention was directed toward disrupted attachment <b>representations.</b> Method Mothers and fathers of term infants (≥ 37 weeks of gestational age, n = 71), moderately preterm infants (≥ 32 – 37 weeks of gestational age, n = 62) and very preterm infants (< 32 weeks of gestational age, n = 56) participated in the present study. Attachment <b>representations</b> (balanced, disengaged, distorted) about their infants were evaluated with the Working Model of the Child Interview (WMCI). To asses disrupted <b>representations</b> the coding of the WMCI was extended with the disrupted scale (WMCI-D). Results The three main classifications of attachment <b>representations</b> were not affected by preterm birth. In addition, there were no gender differences in the rate of balanced <b>representations.</b> In case of non-balanced <b>representations</b> however, maternal <b>representations</b> were more often distorted, whereas fathers showed more often disengaged <b>representations.</b> Results further revealed that maternal disrupted attachment <b>representations</b> were marked by role/boundary confusion or disorientation, whereas paternal disrupted attachment <b>representations</b> were characterized by withdrawal. Conclusion Given the gender differences it is essential to tailor interventions according to the attachment <b>representations</b> of the parent, {{in order to be able}} to alter their non-balanced and/or disrupted attachment <b>representations.</b> Keywords: Preterm birth, Attachment <b>representations,</b> Disrupted attachment <b>representations,</b> Mothers, Father...|$|R
