25|$|Under a buyback {{program called}} the Resale Value Guarantee {{available}} in 37 U.S. states, a Tesla Model S sold before July 1, 2016 included {{the right to}} return it after three years with reimbursement of 43% to 50% of its initial price.

In addition to maintaining the resale value, Tesla hoped to secure a supply of used cars to refurbish and re-sell with warranty. According to Automotive News, the profit margin on used car sales in the U.S. is about triple that on new cars, and Tesla's direct sales would allow it capture resale profits.

For 2012, Kelley Blue Book expected the Volt to retain 42% of its original value after 3 years and 27% after 5 years.

Bob Lutz, GM Vice Chairman responsible for the Chevrolet Volt, in November 2011 stated the EV1 cost $250,000 each and leased for just $300 per month. GM stated the cost of the EV1 program at slightly less than $500 million before marketing and sales costs, and over $1 billion in total, although a portion of this cost was defrayed by the Clinton Administration's $1.25 billion Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) program.

40|$|The {{lossless}} intra-prediction coding modality of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard provides high coding performance while following frame-by-frame basis {{access to}} the coded data. This is of interest in many professional applications such as medical imaging, automotive vision and digital preservation in libraries and archives. Various improvements to lossless intra-prediction coding have been proposed recently, most of them based on sample-wise prediction using Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM). Other recent proposals aim at further reducing the energy of intra-predicted residual blocks. However, the energy reduction achieved is frequently minimal due {{to the difficulty of}} correctly predicting the sign and magnitude of <b>residual</b> <b>values.</b> In this paper, we pursue a novel approach to this energy-reduction problem using piecewise mapping (pwm) functions. Specifically, we analyze the range of <b>values</b> in <b>residual</b> blocks and apply accordingly a pwm function to map specific <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> to unique lower values. We encode appropriate parameters associated with the pwm functions at the encoder, so that the corresponding inverse pwm functions at the decoder can map values back to the same <b>residual</b> <b>values.</b> These <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> are then used to reconstruct the original signal. This mapping is, therefore, reversible and introduces no losses. We evaluate the pwm functions on 4 × 4 residual blocks computed after DPCM-based prediction for lossless coding of a variety of camera-captured and screen content sequences. Evaluation results show that the pwm functions can attain maximum bit-rate reductions of 5. 54...|$|R
