25|$|CD-R {{recording}} systems {{available in}} 1990 {{were similar to}} the washing machine-sized Meridian CD Publisher, based on the two-piece <b>rack</b> <b>mount</b> Yamaha PDS audio recorder costing $35,000, not including the required external ECC circuitry for data encoding, SCSI hard drive subsystem, and MS-DOS control computer. By 1992, the cost of typical recorders was down to $10,000–12,000, and in September 1995, Hewlett-Packard introduced its model 4020i manufactured by Philips, which, at $995, was the first recorder to cost less than $1000.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Irwin {{completed}} Rosebud, Garcia's fourth custom guitar. It {{was similar}} to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 <b>rack</b> <b>mount</b> synthesizer. The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the MIDI effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording Without a Net. Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to 11½ pounds. The inlay, a dancing skeleton holding a rose, covers a plate just below the bridge. The final cost of the instrument was $11,000.|$|E

2500|$|He {{also has}} used Fender Precision Basses, {{particularly}} when smashing basses {{at the end}} of a set. They are usually black Squier Precision Basses with white pickguards. He previously used Ampeg amplifiers with Ampeg 8 x 10" [...] loaded cabinets made with real wood, but had switched to Basson cabinets prior to their going out of business. [...] The Basson cabinets were notoriously heavy (typically running 230–250lbs), using medium density fiberboard covered with indoor-outdoor carpeting and loaded with Chinese Firestorm 1075 speakers (10"/75 oz magnets) and neoprene surrounds. [...] Many of these cabinets were painted red with latex paint to match tour themes. [...] Basson gave Sixx the cabinets in a marketing move to sell to metal-playing bassists, a very limited market. [...] Basson went out of business in 2010. While recording The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack, he used a 1959 Fender Precision which was amplified through a 1964 Fender Bassman. Sixx also uses Audiotech Guitar Products Source Selector 1X6 <b>Rack</b> <b>Mount</b> Audio Switcher.|$|E
