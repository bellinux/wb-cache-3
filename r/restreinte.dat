Ranise - In verification with proof assistants (such as PVS, HOL, and Nqthm), decision procedures are typically used for eliminating trivial subgoals represented for instance as sequents modulo a background theory. These theories axiomatize standard data-types such bit-vectors and {{have proved to}} be quite useful for, e. g., hardware verification. Elimination of trivial sequents often reduces to the problem of proving the unsatisfiability of conjunctions of literals modulo a background theory, which is the problem we shall consider here. We show how a superposition-based inference system for first-order equational logic can be used almost directly as a satisfiability procedure for various theories including lists, arrays, extensional arrays and combinations of them.

40|$|Proposals for a Restricted History of Mentalities The {{history of}} mentalities is {{currently}} poorly defined: after having successfully fullfilled {{a function of}} redistributing historical fields and objects, it has {{had a tendency to}} adopt a psychologistic aim, claiming to directly reach shared mental phenomena. I propose to restrict the field of the history of mentalities by assigning it the task of making a problematic description of the "collective", defined as the locus of articulation of general regularities and of subjects. This "collective", as I try to show through various examples borrowed from Medieval history, can be detected in discourse in the form of "statements" (verbal, iconic, ritual, etc.) whose structure and use place them at a tangent from the universes of belief that are sporadically and effectively assembled.

40|$|Colloque sans acte à {{diffusion}} <b>restreinte.</b> internationale. International audienceDefining the behaviour {{of a set}} of situated agents, {{such that}} a collaborative problem can be solved is a key issue in multi-agent systems. In this paper, we formulate this problem from the decision theoretic perspective using the framework of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (DEC-POMDP). Formulating the coordination problem in this way provides a formal foundation for study of cooperation activities. But, as it has been recently shown solving DEC-POMDP is NEXP-complete and thus it is not a realistic approach for the design of agent cooperation policies. However, we demonstrate in this paper that it is not completely desperate. Indeed, we propose an heuristic approach for solving DEC-POMDP when agents are memoryless and when the global reward function can be broken up into a sum of local reward functions. We demonstrate experimentally on an example (the so-called pursuit problem) that this heuristic is efficient within a few iteration steps...|$|E

40|$|Sylviane Léoni : French Rhetoric. Classical rhetoric, embodying {{a system}} of {{learning}} which is no longer accepted, is a true discipline which drew its meaning and coherence from its close relationship with philosophy, Aristotelian dialectics, topics, poetics and so on. These relationships, thanks to which rhetoric became an art in the classical sense, gradually dissolved in the 17 th and 18 th Centuries {{under the influence of}} Cartesianism and English empiricism. Nevertheless, the prestige of the classical tradition, force of habit and the institutional power backing up the teaching of the art of persuasion slowed down the decline of this discipline which, contrary to what is often said, was not limited in the 18 th Century to the production of stylistic effects and the study of figures and tropes.

The protocol relies on a contract between the operator who ensures a minimum rate and the source who must respect a rate that is dynamically allocated to him, according to the resources available in the networks. An ABR conformance algorithm for controlling the source rates through an interface has been defined by ATM Forum. A more efficient version of this algorithm has been designed rk 97. We present in this work the first complete mechanical verification of the equivalence between these two algorithms. The proof is rather involved and has been supported by the PVS theorem-prover. It has required many lemmas, case analysis and induction reasoning for the manipulation of non bounded scheduling lists. Some ABR conformance protocols have been automatically verified in previous works. However these protocols are approximations of the one we consider here...|$|E
