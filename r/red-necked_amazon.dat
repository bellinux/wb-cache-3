50|$|The <b>red-necked</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona arausiaca), {{also known}} as the red-necked parrot, Dominican blue-faced amazon, lesser Dominican amazon, and Jaco parrot, is an amazon parrot endemic to Dominica.|$|E
50|$|<b>Red-necked</b> <b>amazon</b> {{numbers have}} been {{diminishing}} through the 20th Century, primarily {{as a consequence of}} hunting for food and, to a lesser degree, the pet trade, and, more recently, by the clearing of forests for agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Nesting cavity {{competition}} with <b>red-necked</b> <b>amazons</b> and owls creates a tough living environment for imperial amazons. They only mate {{for a couple}} of months of the year, and guard their nests the rest of the year. A good quality nesting site is key to the survival and upbringing of their offspring.|$|R
5000|$|The {{call of the}} sisserou {{resides in}} the higher frequencies, a loud and even [...] "squeaky" [...] mix between shriek, squawk, and trill. Despite their {{colorful}} plumage, the birds are shy, difficult to approach, and will often only travel in groups no larger than three. They are found in pairs or small flocks, sometimes with <b>red-necked</b> <b>amazons.</b> They are good climbers and strong flyers with powerful wings. They prefer to perch {{on the tops of}} trees. They are difficult to detect, as they are well camouflaged by their plumage, concealing them from predators while feeding.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-necked</b> <b>amazon</b> is {{only found}} in the Caribbean island of Dominica. It lives {{throughout}} Montane and sub-montane forests of Morne Diablotion and Northern and Central Forest Reserves and sequestered State Lands that are above 1500 ft elevation.|$|E
50|$|Red-necked amazons {{are most}} {{vigorous}} and animated {{in the early}} mornings from dawn to around 10 am, {{and again in the}} late afternoon after about 4 pm. During those periods they are most communicative. The cry of the <b>red-necked</b> <b>amazon</b> is rough with a high-pitched squawk and usually uses two-syllable notes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Red-necked</b> <b>amazon</b> pairs are {{loyal to}} each other and tend to stay at the same nesting site for many years. Other than early morning and {{afternoon}} calls, these birds are fairly quiet and difficult to detect in the wild because they are well cloaked by their fluff. They are dexterous climbing birds and are prone to migrate seasonally, provisional on food supplies.|$|E
50|$|The Martinique amazon (Amazona martinicana) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of Caribbean parrot {{in the family}} Psittacidae. It is not known from any material remains, but {{was said to be}} similar to the <b>red-necked</b> <b>amazon</b> (A. arausiaca) from Dominica, the next major island to the north of Martinique. Natives are known to have traded extensively in parrots between the Antilles, and it seems that the Martinique population was in some way related to or even descended from A. arausiaca.|$|E
