40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{three different}} uses of <b>ratio</b> <b>variables</b> in aggregate data analysis: (1) as measures of theoretical concepts, (2) {{as a means}} to control an extraneous factor, and (3) as a correction for heteroscedasticity. In the use of ratios as indices of concepts, a problem can arise if it is regressed on other indices or variables that contain a common component. For example, the relationship between two per capita measures may be confounded with the common population component in each variable. Regarding the second use of ratios, only under exceptional conditions will <b>ratio</b> <b>variables</b> be a suitable means of controlling an extraneous factor. Finally, the use of ratios to correct for heteroscedasticity is also often misused. Only under special conditions will the common form ofregres sion with <b>ratio</b> <b>variables</b> correct for heteroscedasticity.

30|$|At 20 {{years of}} residence, there is {{evidence}} that optimal migration duration decreases in wage ratio at earlier ages in specification 1, as well as in specification 2. The rising significance levels in specification 1 are presumably due to the facts that the data are less sparse at 20 years of residence and that the effect of wage ratio depends more on age than duration of residence, unlike it is for ppp. However, this finding is not robust at all: in specifications 4 and 5, both the statistical significance and the magnitude of the wage <b>ratio</b> <b>variable</b> are quite low at all values of age at arrival. Moreover, in specifications 4 and 5, the coefficients of the wage <b>ratio</b> <b>variable</b> at all age-at-arrival values are much lower at 20 years of residence than at the time of arrival.|$|E

Their find-ings are {{contrasted with}} our previous analysis (MacMillan and Daft, a) that re-ported inference consistency across statistical models {{with respect to}} definitional dependency. This paper reconciles the two sets offindings byconcluding that defi-nitional dependency {{is not a problem}} in <b>ratio</b> <b>variable</b> research, but measurement error may cause inference inconsistency. Three recommendations are suggested for investigators who use ratio variables to study organization scale and similar socio-logical relationships. The decision to use a <b>ratio</b> <b>variable</b> to analyze sociological data seems natural and straightforward, yet on deeper analysis, that decision has im-plications that can be complicated and confusing. Several papers have been written that describe problems and offer suggestions about the use of ratio variables (Bollen and Ward; Fuguitt and Lieberson; Kasarda and Nolan; Long; MacMillan and Daft, a; Schuessler). No single paper has been definitive. Technical disagreements persist despite an increasing number of publications. Since Feinberg and Trotta's article in this issue is written largely in response to one of our previous papers, and since their conclusions appear to be at odds with our conclusions, a response and reconciliation seems warranted. Our original paper (a) and the analysis of Feinberg and Trotta together encompass two major topics concerning <b>ratio</b> <b>variable</b> anal-ysis-the impact of definitional dependency, and the impact of measure-ment error.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} testing of a scalable thermal management architecture for instruments, subsystems, or systems that must operate in severe space environments with wide variations in sink temperature. The architecture involves a serial linkage {{of one or more}} hot-side variable conductance heat pipes (VCHPs) to one or more cold-side loop heat pipes (LHPs). The VCHPs provide wide area heat acquisition, limited distance thermal transport, modest against gravity pumping, concentrated LHP startup heating, and high switching <b>ratio</b> <b>variable</b> conductance operation. The LHPs provide localized heat acquisition, long distance thermal transport, significant against gravity pumping, and high switching <b>ratio</b> <b>variable</b> conductance operation. The single-VCHP, single-LHP system described herein was developed to maintain thermal control of a small robotic lunar lander throughout the lunar day-night thermal cycle. It is also applicable to other variable heat rejection space missions in severe environments. Operationally, despite a 60 - 70 % gas blocked VCHP condenser during ON testing, the system was still able to provide 2 - 4 W/K ON conductance, 0. 01 W/K OFF conductance, and an end-to-end switching ratio of 200 - 400. The paper provides a detailed analysis of VCHP condenser performance, which quantified the gas blockage situation.

The analysis is made within the context of one-dimensional unsteady flow as in the work of Candel (1972). A mixture of thermally perfect gases is assumed as the working fluid, and the fluid composition consists of species 1 and a small and variable mole fraction of species 2 which has different molecular weight and specific heats as compared with species 1. In the absence of changes in the ratio of specific heat (gamma), the entropy variations due to temperature and molecular weight variations are equivalent as a sound source.
