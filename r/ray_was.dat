5|$|In 194950, {{none of the}} Harveys played {{together}} at first-class level; Merv had retired, Mick had moved to Queensland looking for more opportunities, while Neil was in South Africa with the Australian team. Ray and Mick played in one match each for the season, but not against the other. In 1950-51, <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> selected in two matches for Victoria, both when Neil and the other Test players were competing against England. Both of these were against Tasmania, so he did not meet Mick. However, there were no international fixtures coinciding with Victoria’s two matches with Queensland, and Neil met Mick {{in both of these}} matches. In 1951-52, <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> able to gain selection more regularly for Victoria. All of these came when Neil and the other Test players were playing for Australia; when they available for Victoria, <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> not selected. Ray played in both of Victoria's matches against Queensland, for whom Mick played in the first match.|$|E
5000|$|In diagram 1 {{the green}} <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> shown as {{reflecting}} from only one surface. This {{is a special}} case where the incoming <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> exactly normal (perpendicular) {{to one of the}} reflective faces. In the same diagram the orange and red <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> shown reflecting off of two surfaces. This is again a special case, the requirement being that the incoming <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> parallel to one of the reflecting planes. (In diagram 2, showing a retroreflective sphere, the incoming and outgoing <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> approximately parallel in special cases.) ...|$|R
50|$|Anticrepuscular rays or antisolar <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to}} crepuscular rays, but seen {{opposite}} {{the sun in}} the sky. Anticrepuscular <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> near-parallel, but appear to converge at the antisolar point because of linear perspective. Anticrepuscular <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> most frequently visible near sunrise or sunset. Crepuscular <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> usually much brighter than anticrepuscular <b>rays.</b> This <b>is</b> because for crepuscular rays, seen {{on the same side}} of the sky as the sun, the atmospheric light scattering and making them visible is taking place at small angles (see Mie theory).|$|R

5|$|Mitra had met Ray {{on the set}} of The River, where Mitra {{was allowed}} to observe the production, take {{photographs}} and make notes about lighting for personal reference. Having become friends, Mitra kept Ray informed about the production and showed his photographs. <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> impressed enough by them to promise him an assistant's position on Pather Panchali, and when production neared, invited him to shoot the film. As the 21-year-old Mitra had no prior filmmaking experience, the choice was met with scepticism by those who knew of the production. Mitra himself later speculated that <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> nervous about working with an established crew.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> quickly extradited to Tennessee {{and charged}} with King's murder. He confessed to the {{assassination}} on March 10, 1969, though he recanted this confession three days later.|$|E
5|$|Satyajit Ray's ancestry can {{be traced}} back for at least ten generations. Ray's grandfather, Upendrakishore <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> a writer, illustrator, philosopher, publisher, amateur {{astronomer}} and a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a religious and social movement in nineteenth century Bengal. He also set up a printing press by the name of U. Ray and Sons, which formed a crucial backdrop to Satyajit's life. Sukumar Ray, Upendrakishore's son and father of Satyajit, was a pioneering Bengali writer of nonsense rhyme (abol tabol) and children's literature, an illustrator and a critic. <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> born to Sukumar and Suprabha Ray in Calcutta.|$|E
50|$|Fiddler rays feed on bottoms shellfish, crabs, and worms, {{which they}} crush between their jaws. The eastern fiddler <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> known to {{scavenge}} from fish traps. Like other guitarfishes, fiddler <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> ovoviviparous. The egg capsules {{of the southern}} fiddler <b>ray</b> <b>are</b> reported to be golden in colour, containing three embryos each. It gives birth to litters of four to six young per breeding cycle. Fiddler <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> harmless and easily approached by divers. Southern fiddler <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> taken as bycatch by commercial trawlers and by recreational fishers; the flesh is of good quality and sold in small quantities.The Magpie fiddler ray (previously Trygonorrhina melaleuca) is now considered a variant of Trygonorrhina dumerilii.|$|R
50|$|The Sun City <b>Rays</b> <b>were</b> a {{short-lived}} professional baseball team, based in Sun City, Arizona. The <b>Rays</b> <b>was</b> {{a member of}} the Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1990 for the league's second season.|$|R

5|$|As Taeniura meyeni, {{the round}} ribbontail <b>ray</b> <b>was</b> {{described}} by German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle in their 1841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, {{based on two}} syntypes collected from Mauritius. However, this species is better known under the name Taeniura melanospila (or melanospilos), which was applied by Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker to a juvenile specimen from Java, in a 1953 volume of the scientific journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indië.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 195455 season, along with Neil, <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> called into an Australian XI for a Test trial against Len Hutton’s touring English team, the closest that two Harveys came to playing in a Test for Australia together. Ray did not make an impact in the match, scoring only seven in his solitary innings, and was not {{selected}} for Australian duty. He came in at No. 4 after the dismissal of his brother. <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> selected for all six of Victoria’s matches and played in all of these matches alongside Neil, as the domestic season was shortened and there were no scheduling clashes between the Tests and the domestic matches. Mick also played in all of Queensland's matches, and three brothers met in their states’ only meeting for the season.|$|E

5|$|Herbert James <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on 1 February 1893, {{the son of}} James Herbert Ray and {{his wife}} Mary née Rosseler. He was educated at Rhea County High School. In 1910, he was {{appointed}} to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, from which he graduated on 6 June 1914.|$|E
5|$|In 1955-56, <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> {{overlooked}} {{and spent}} four years out of first-class cricket, and he never played alongside Neil again at first-class level. Neil played in all of Victoria's matches, and Mick played in Queensland’s first six matches before being dropped for the second and final match against Victoria. In 1956-57, Mick played in two matches for Queensland {{earlier in the season}} before being dropped and retiring; neither were against Victoria, so none of the brothers played together in one match. <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> recalled to the Victorian team {{in the latter half of}} the 1958-59 season. By this time, Neil had moved to New South Wales for employment reasons, and played each other late in the season. The Harvey brothers never played together or against one another again at first-class level. In 1959-60, Neil was in the Indian subcontinent representing Australia as Ray played his final first-class season before retiring.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, King was {{planning}} a national occupation of Washington, D.C., {{to be called}} the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated by James Earl Ray on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. King's death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities. Ray, who fled the country, was arrested two months later at London Heathrow Airport. <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> sentenced to 99 years in prison for King's murder, and died in 1998 from hepatitis while serving his sentence.|$|E

Ray hates Little <b>Ray.</b> Little <b>Ray</b> <b>is</b> shown in the second season, riding with Ray, then Ray tells {{him to get out}} and jumps out the window, {{but at the end of}} the episode he comes back. Little <b>Ray</b> <b>is</b> not seen or {{mentioned}} again.|$|R
50|$|In bony fish, most fins {{may have}} spines or rays. A fin may contain only spiny rays, only soft rays, or a {{combination}} of both. If both are present, the spiny <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> always anterior. Spines are generally stiff, sharp and unsegmented. <b>Rays</b> <b>are</b> generally soft, flexible, segmented, and may be branched. This segmentation of <b>rays</b> <b>is</b> the main difference that distinguishes them from spines; spines may be flexible in certain species, but never segmented.|$|R
40|$|The {{solution}} of the Boltzmann transport equation using Method of Characteristics <b>ray</b> tracing can <b>be</b> accurate yet computationally expensive. <b>Ray</b> tracing would <b>be</b> inherently parallelizable with a very fine granularity if the boundary condition associated with each <b>ray</b> <b>were</b> known a priori. In practice, however, <b>ray</b> tracing <b>is</b> serial since the boundary condition for one <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> generally obtained from another ray in the problem. In the work here, an alternative implementation of <b>ray</b> tracing <b>is</b> presented that minimizes serialization and reduces the memory requirements. A new algorithm was implemented in the MOC code DeCART and demonstrated for a BWR assembly model...|$|R
5|$|It {{was later}} {{decided that the}} film would begin after the {{conclusion}} of the eighth and final season. It was to be set and shot on-location in Europe. Surnow, Cochran, Gordon, and Sutherland were going to be executive producers on the film, and Billy <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> going to write the screenplay. Shooting was planned to start in late 2010 or early 2011.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{followed}} Apur Sansar with Devi (The Goddess), a film {{in which}} he examined the superstitions in Hindu society. Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee, a young wife who is deified by her father-in-law. <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> worried that the censor board might block his film, or at least make him re-cut it, but Devi was spared. In 1961, on the insistence of Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> commissioned to make a documentary on Rabindranath Tagore, {{on the occasion of}} the poet's birth centennial, a tribute to the person who likely most influenced Ray. Due to limited footage of Tagore, Ray faced the challenge of making a film out of mainly static material. He said that it took as much work as three feature films.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 1949–50, {{with the}} Australian Test team in South Africa {{for the whole}} of the southern hemisphere summer, Victoria lost batsmen Lindsay Hassett, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey. Despite the extra vacancies, <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> only selected for one match, against Tasmania, making 9 and 45 in a four-wicket win. This was effectively a second-choice Victorian team as the leading players were involved in a Shield match against New South Wales at the same time.|$|E
500|$|The {{spotted eagle}} <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> {{included}} in the IUCN's Red List as [...] "near threatened". The <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> caught mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa. [...] They are also common in commercial marine life trade and are displayed in aquariums. Among the many efforts to help protect this species, South Africa's decision to deploy fewer protective shark nets has {{reduced the number of}} deaths caused by entanglement. South Africa has also placed restrictions on the number of <b>rays</b> that can <b>be</b> bought per person per day. In the state of Florida in the United States, the fishing, landing, purchasing and trading of spotted eagle <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> outlawed. [...] The spotted eagle <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> also protected in the Great Barrier Reef on the eastern coast of Australia.|$|R
50|$|Henri Becquerel himself {{proved that}} beta <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> fast electrons, while Rutherford and Thomas Royds proved in 1909 that alpha {{particles}} are ionized helium. Rutherford and Edward Andrade proved in 1914 that gamma <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> like X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths.|$|R
50|$|Sharks and <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> both {{cartilaginous}} fishes {{which can be}} contrasted with bony fishes. <b>Rays</b> <b>are</b> adapted for feeding on the bottom. Guitarfish are somewhat between sharks and rays, and show characteristics of both (though they <b>are</b> classified as <b>rays).</b>|$|R
5|$|Along {{with their}} better-known brothers, Mick and Ray played {{first-class}} cricket for Victoria, although the former moved to Queensland after one season for his native state {{due to a}} lack of opportunities. Neither approached the level of success of Neil or Merv and often found themselves dropped, although <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> a consistent player for Victoria for two seasons in the 1950s and came close to national selection. Mick's daughter, Pauline Harvey-Short, represented Australia in softball and her daughter, Kirby Short, plays for the Queensland women's cricket team. After his playing career ended, Mick became a Test cricket umpire, officiating in two matches. The two other brothers, Brian and Harold, played for Fitzroy in district cricket. Apart from Harold, all of the brothers represented Victoria at baseball.|$|E
5|$|Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, {{inside of}} which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand over her mouth to muffle, but he kills her by accident.|$|E
5|$|Harvey's {{performances}} were rewarded with selection for an Australian XI in a tour match against the England cricket {{team at the}} start of the 1954–55 season. However, the match was curtailed by rain and Harvey was not able to exhibit his talents on a sticky wicket highly difficult for batting. Listed at No. 4, Harvey came in after the dismissal of his brother and made seven in his only innings. As a result, <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> not chosen for the Test team alongside his brother during the season.|$|E
5000|$|A parabasal <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ray</b> that propagates {{close to}} some defined [...] "base ray" [...] {{rather than the}} optical axis.

In computer modeling, parabasal <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> [...] "real rays", that <b>is</b> <b>rays</b> that <b>are</b> treated without making the paraxial approximation. Parabasal rays about the optical axis are sometimes used to calculate first-order properties of optical systems.|$|R
