5|$|Australia first {{participated in}} the tournament at the 1981 Intercontinental Cup, {{managing}} only one win out of their seven games, finishing 8th. Missing the 1983 Intercontinental Cup, they returned in 1985 to repeat their previous performance: 1 win, 8th-place finish. They would not <b>reappear</b> at the tournament until 1993 where they improved to a 5–4 record to finish in 6th position.|$|E
5|$|Most are single-player games. On {{multi-user}} systems, leaderboards {{are often}} shared between players. Some roguelikes allow traces of former player characters {{to appear in}} later game sessions {{in the form of}} ghosts or grave markings. Some games such as NetHack even have the player's former characters <b>reappear</b> as enemies within the dungeon. Multi-player turn-based derivatives such as TomeNET, MAngband, and Crossfire do exist and are playable online.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{after the}} game's release, Sonic Team member and Sonic and the Black Knight {{director}} Tetsu Katano remarked {{that although he}} did not feel the Werehog concept was a mistake, time and resources were a limiting factor in the game's production. He also remarked that the Werehog may <b>reappear</b> in future games, or possibly in a sequel to Sonic Unleashed, should one be made.|$|E
50|$|The Wanderers then <b>reappeared</b> {{as guests}} at Duo Damsel and Bouncing Boy's wedding, and also <b>reappeared</b> during the Legion's clash with Darkseid.|$|R
50|$|Characters and {{situations}} from Hejji <b>reappeared</b> in later Dr. Seuss work. For example, the two goats {{with the single}} beard <b>reappeared</b> in the musical fantasy film The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T, scripted by Geisel.|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} of Neal Brose <b>reappears</b> in the author's fourth novel, Black Swan Green. In this novel, Brose {{is a young}} teenager living in Worcester. The {{character of}} Denholme Cavendish also <b>reappears</b> in the author's third novel, Cloud Atlas.|$|R
5|$|The 240-tonne A330 <b>reappear</b> {{years later}} when Airbus {{announced}} at the 2012 Farnborough Airshow {{that it would be}} an available option for both the A330-300 and the A330-200. In November 2012, the maximum take off weight was further increased to 242 tonnes; the first of these aircraft was to enter service with Delta Air Lines in Q2 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Wujing Zongyao divides Chinese {{warships}} {{into six}} categories: Tower ships (lou chuan), combat or war junks (dou xian or zhan xian), covered swoopers (meng chong), flying barques (zou ge), patrol boats (you ting), and sea hawk ships (hai hu). The Wujing Zongyaos typology for classifying Chinese warships would <b>reappear</b> in later naval texts for many centuries.|$|E
5|$|Wizard did not <b>reappear</b> as {{a four-year-old}} until October, when he {{defeated}} Derby winner Pope over {{one and a}} quarter miles at Newmarket. Pope had started the race as the 1/2 favourite. The following day, Wizard walked over for one-third of a subscription of 25 guineas each. These were his only two appearances in 1810.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few moments}} she <b>reappeared,</b> waited a moment with her tiny head just peeking out of the knot-hole, flashed round the post out of sight, and when I saw her again it was as she <b>reappeared</b> {{suddenly}} beside the male.|$|R
5000|$|Kawada, {{with his}} team of investigators, meets and {{interviews}} those who are purported to have <b>reappeared</b> after death, {{some of whom have}} been dead many years. The investigators also interview the families of the resurrected, who have aged (some significantly) since the death of the person who has now <b>reappeared.</b> In the case of the young boy, his mother has grown into an old woman, in other circumstances a youthful wife has <b>reappeared</b> to rejoin a husband now well into middle age.|$|R
50|$|Ernest Stickley, Jr. <b>reappears</b> in Stick.|$|R
5|$|A prequel, Dragon Warrior Monsters (Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland in Japan), was {{released}} in 1998. This game featured Terry and Milly years before the events of Dragon Quest VI. It {{was released}} in North America the next year, even though Dragon Quest VI was never released in North America. Along with Terry and Milly, several of the main enemies, including Mortamor, <b>reappear,</b> however, their previous roles have been eliminated, making them appear as just normal enemies. Mortamor and Murdaw (DeathMore and Mudou, respectively, in the localization) do appear as very challenging, very late in-game bosses, though.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from around}} 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little {{except for the}} stage. The {{critical}} assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, led {{to a decline in}} the popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century. In the 21st century, however, the composer's major French grand operas have begun to <b>reappear</b> in the repertory of numerous European opera houses.|$|E
5|$|As the {{lifeboats}} {{were brought}} alongside Carpathia, the survivors came aboard the ship by various means. Some were {{strong enough to}} climb up rope ladders; others were hoisted up in slings, {{and the children were}} hoisted in mail sacks. The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.12, with 74people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on Carpathia by 09:00. There were some scenes of joy as some families and friends were reunited, but in most cases hopes died as loved ones failed to <b>reappear.</b>|$|E

5|$|Blacklist again {{features}} Sam Fisher, {{a former}} Third Echelon Splinter Cell {{who is now}} the spymaster and commander of the newly installed Fourth Echelon. The game also sees the return of Fisher's old ally, Anna (Grim) Grímsdóttir, and new characters such as Isaac Briggs and Charlie Cole. Several supporting characters from Conviction <b>reappear,</b> including Victor Coste, Patricia Caldwell, and Andriy Kobin. There is also a cameo from former 3rd Echelon agents Archer and Kestrel.|$|E
5|$|If {{the protagonist}} manages to save Marie before {{defeating}} Izanami, the scene will then shift {{into a few}} months after the last scene of the true ending (and after the events of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax), where the protagonist will <b>reappear</b> at the Inaba train station on a visit. The protagonist will eventually meet up with his friends, who changed since the last time they all met, and will head to the Dojima household, where a surprise party was set up earlier by Dojima.|$|E
5|$|New Super Mario Bros. is a side-scrolling video game. While {{it is seen}} in 2D, most of the {{characters}} and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. The player can play as either Mario, or his brother, Luigi. Similar to previous Mario games, Mario (or Luigi) can collect coins, stomp on enemies, and break open blocks. Moves from 3D games featuring Mario <b>reappear</b> in New Super Mario Bros., including the ground pound, triple jump, and wall jump. Enemies from previous games, such as Boos, are also reintroduced.|$|E
50|$|Nearly 23 {{minutes in}} length, {{the song is}} divided into seven {{sections}}. A number of musical and lyrical themes do re-appear throughout. The melody of the verse in section I <b>reappears</b> as a flute melody between sections II and III. The melody of the chorus in section I <b>reappears</b> with new lyrics in the coda to section VI. The song that comprises the majority of section II <b>reappears</b> briefly in instrumental form {{at the beginning of}} section VI, and then returns to form the body of section VII, with new lyrics.|$|R

5|$|Once {{production}} began {{it became}} apparent that Part One and Part Two were under-running so more dialogue was written to fill in the time. It was originally intended that the character of Jackson would not <b>reappear</b> after the second episode, but during filming Saward became concerned that it appeared that he had been executed and so he and Clegg rewrote Part Three to include him. Part Three also looked to be under running so scenes from Part Four were brought forward and the final scenes with the Guardians were extended to compensate.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to writing}} the story, Hergé had read Balzac et son monde ("Balzac and His World"), a 1955 book written {{by his friend}} Félicien Marceau. Intrigued {{by the work of}} Honoré de Balzac, Hergé was {{inspired}} by the way in which Balzac had introduced an array of characters from his earlier work into The Human Comedy, and he subsequently adopted this trait for The Red Sea Sharks, in which a wide range of characters from The Adventures of Tintin make a reappearance. Hergé also introduced a new character, the Estonian pilot Piotr Skut, who would later <b>reappear</b> in Flight 714 to Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Territorial {{males are}} very site-faithful; 90% {{return to the}} same lekking sites in {{subsequent}} seasons, the most dominant males being {{the most likely to}} <b>reappear.</b> Site-faithful males can acquire accurate information about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. Such stable relationships reduce conflict and the risk of injury, and the consequent lower levels of male aggression are less likely to scare off females. Lower-ranked territorial males also benefit from site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting for the top males eventually to drop out.|$|E

5|$|The Devonian {{tetrapods}} {{went through}} two major bottlenecks during {{what is known}} as the Late Devonian extinction; one at the end of the Frasnian stage, and one twice as large at the end of the following Famennian stage. These events of extinctions led to the disappearance of primitive tetrapods with fish-like features like Ichthyostega and their primary more aquatic relatives. When tetrapods <b>reappear</b> in the fossil record after the Devonian extinctions, the adult forms are all fully adapted to a terrestrial existence, with later species secondary adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{aggression}} {{may even}} extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded as evil. Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra {{was believed to}} swallow the multitude of other gods, who in this instance are equated with the stars, which vanish at sunrise and <b>reappear</b> at sunset. In doing so, he absorbs the gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar Eye is said to assist in this effort, slaughtering the gods for Ra to eat. The red light of dawn therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter.|$|E
5|$|The first {{movement}} is in cut common (2/2) time. It {{starts with the}} cello, alone, playing eight quarter notes on the same B-flat. It is not until the third measure of the movement that the violins and viola enter. The cello's eight throbbing notes act as more than an introduction. They <b>reappear</b> at critical junctures throughout the movement, including {{at the beginning of}} the development and recapitulation sections, illustrating that they are part of the movement's primary thematic material. The melody that follows the eight cello notes is echoed in Beethoven's String Quartet No. 1 (Op. 18, No. 1).|$|E
