50|$|Analogue {{devices that}} perform a similar {{function}} include the synchro, the resolver, the rotary variable differential transformer (RVDT), and the <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Multiturn potentiometers {{are also}} {{operated}} by rotating a shaft, but by several turns {{rather than less}} than a full turn. Some multiturn potentiometers have a linear resistive element with a sliding contact moved by a lead screw; others have a helical resistive element and a wiper that turns through 10, 20, or more complete revolutions, moving along the helix as it rotates. Multiturn potentiometers, both user-accessible and preset, allow finer adjustments; rotation through the same angle changes the setting by typically a tenth as much as for a simple <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another type is {{the linear}} slider potentiometer, {{which has a}} wiper which slides along a linear element instead of rotating. Contamination can {{potentially}} enter anywhere along the slot the slider moves in, making effective sealing more difficult and compromising long-term reliability. An advantage of the slider potentiometer is that the slider position gives a visual indication of its setting. While the setting of a <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometer</b> {{can be seen by}} the position of a marking on the knob, an array of sliders can give a visual impression of, for example, the effect of a multi-band equalizer (hence the term [...] "graphic equalizer").|$|E
50|$|The Mix Controller was a {{collection}} of a Master and one or more I/O modules held in a custom frame. The modules could be arranged in any order in the frame. Each I/O module serviced four channels of audio. Each channel included a stereo LED bargraph meter, an output section, two microphone preamps, four auxiliary bus controls and two independent stereo faders per channel via 8 <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometers,</b> 2 linear faders and 15 pushbutton switches.|$|R
5000|$|As a result, the faders (potentiometers {{that operate}} by sliding up or down) or volume {{controls}} (<b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometers)</b> on the mixing board or audio processor gradually [...] "creep" [...] toward the maximum volume setting, which reduces {{the ability to}} manipulate the relative volumes between channels. It can also result in clipping or distortion of the master mix, which is when the overall volume of sound is too great for the equipment or recording medium intended to hold it.|$|R
50|$|User-accessible <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometers</b> can {{be fitted}} with a switch which {{operates}} usually at the anti-clockwise extreme of rotation. Before digital electronics became the norm such a component was used to allow radio and television receivers and other equipment to be switched on at minimum volume with an audible click, then the volume increased, by turning a knob. Multiple resistance elements can be ganged together with their sliding contacts on the same shaft, for example, in stereo audio amplifiers for volume control. In other applications, such as domestic light dimmers, the normal usage pattern is best satisfied if the potentiometer remains set at its current position, so the switch is operated by a push action, alternately on and off, by axial presses of the knob.|$|R
5000|$|Early Marauders had a {{three-way}} toggle {{switch on the}} treble side of the upper bout of the body (opposite the location on Les Pauls and ES-175s, similar to a Gibson Byrdland), to turn on either one or both pickups. In 1976, a <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometer</b> was introduced which allowed a range of blends between the two pickups. In still later Marauders, the potentiometer (now a chickenhead knob) was positioned between the volume and tone knobs. Marauders all had Schaller made [...] "Harmonica" [...] ("tune-o-matic" [...] style) bridges and the standard Gibson stopbar tailpiece. They had enclosed [...] "Gibson Deluxe" [...] tuners, and typical Gibson strap buttons.|$|E
50|$|Racing wheels {{started off}} as simple plastic wheels {{hooked up to}} a <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometer,</b> which were sprung by springs or bungees. Eventually {{manufacturers}} began to use electric motors in the controllers, in place of springs, in order to achieve a level of force feedback, first seen in Microsoft's Sidewinder wheel. At first this technology simply provided the centering force and other artificial effects such as shaking the wheel in a crash or other vibrations. However, as driving simulations have evolved, their physics engines have become more accurate and the developers have linked their in-game physics more closely to the force feedback. This allows the user to truly feel what forces go through the steering rack, instead of just artificial effects, and genuinely enhance the realism of the game. Despite this, some high end manufacturers believe that force feedback has still not been perfected, and therefore companies such as Thomas SuperWheel have not adopted a force feedback system in their products. Frex, on the other hand, has gone the other way and equips their high-end Simwheel with powerful force feedback and no mechanical centering device.|$|E
40|$|Maintaining {{good health}} {{is crucial to}} living an active lifestyle. A person's daily {{activities}} can be drastically impacted by the occurrences of an unforeseen injury. This active elbow orthosis device offers a convenient {{way for people to}} rehabilitate their elbow from its respective injury. Through the use of the developed iOS application, a person is able to perform his or her rehabilitation exercises from just about anywhere. This device attaches to a standard elbow brace and assists the patient in their movement through the application of a light force. The device utilizes an arduino microprocessor to communicate between the iOS application, sensor and motor. The desired range of motion is set via the iOS application and this information is relayed to the microprocessor. A <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometer</b> is utilized as the sensor, which rotates as the arm moves to detect the change in motion of the patient. This data is sent to the microprocessor which is able to detect the limits of the range of motion and signal to the motor to either stop or change directions. In this report, one will see the project background, the requirements set forth by the project sponsor, the design of the device, the test procedures and test results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the article}} is to analyze the command of a {{rehabilitation}} equipment. The presented rehabilitation equipment allows lower limb joints movements, in order to recover their functionality. The rehabilitation movements are known as continuous passive motion, term used in kinetotherapy. The command used is composed by of a pneumatic muscle supplied with air from a pressure proportional regulator and controlled by a reference module. The reference module, by means of <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometers,</b> can generate up to six different values of reference voltage which are transmitted as signals to the proportional controller. If no appeal {{to any of these}} benchmarks, the transmitted signal to the pressure regulator is a voltage that can be modified by an external potentiometer. The results of experiments shows that proportional pressure regulator allows easy modification of the pressure slope, with better results on rehabilitation movements...|$|R
40|$|The Dual Channel Matrix Switch Audio Receiver {{controls}} 2 separate {{audio output}} channels. Each channel plays {{any of the}} system 2 ̆ 7 s 3 inputs. This controller enables a user to play two separate audio signals through two separate speaker channels. The system design allows audio input from 2 RCA sources or 1 RCA source and a phono source. The system outputs an audio signal for each output simultaneously at up to 36 W on each channel for an 8 Ω load. The device allows a user to control the audio input and the volume of each output channel. An Arduino Uno R 3 microcontroller interfaced with front <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometers</b> and a display creates this capability.

40|$|Prosthetists {{have been}} fitting externally-powered {{components}} to individuals with “shoulder disarticulation”, upper extremity amputations for decades. These components {{have ranged from}} momentary contact switches that permitted carbon-dioxide to pass through tubes {{in order to create}} an articulating motion, to force sensitive resistors (FSRs) that vary the amount of resistance between thin conductive plates in order to permit varied current to flow and provide input to an electrical motor. Activation of these types of inputs requires contact by the user with their remaining residual limb or, in the case of individuals with congenital deficiencies, phocomelic digits. A variety of pull switches have also been used to harness the body motions provided by the user, which activate an electro-mechanical switch used to drive a motor. With the use of coupled <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometers,</b> the authors have chosen to investigate a unique approach to ipsilateral shoulder motion as a control source for two degrees of freedom...|$|R
40|$|Crop yield map is {{a useful}} means to {{quantify}} yield variations within the fields {{and to provide a}} scientific basis for implementing site-specific crop management strategies. This research explores the feasibility of developing a new silage yield monitoring system by employing a new mass flow sensor based on using the momentum of chopped material impacting a pivoted plate loaded by a retractable spring installed {{at the end of a}} chopper discharge spout. A precise <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometer</b> was used to measure the degree of pivoted plate rotation. To save and process the output voltage of the potentiometer, a programmable circuit comprising of AVR microcontroller ATMEGA series and MAX 232 microchip was used and the output data was sent to a portable computer for further processing. To calibrate the output signal of the sensor versus instantaneous chopped material flow rate, the chopper was fed artificially with predetermined mass flow rates of 6, 8 and 10 kg s- 1 of silage corn at five replications for each feeding rate. The results of statistical analysis showed high correlation between degrees of the pivoted-plate rotation and instantaneous feed rates with adjusted R 2 of 0. 98. To evaluate the accuracy of mass flow rate estimation, a platform scale weighing system was used during the field tests. The statistical analysis did not show any significant difference between sensor mass flow rate estimation and platform scale weighing system output. By using the resulted calibration equation, yield map of a silage cornfield was generated...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of the {{precipitation}} currents to two identical shielded receivers, constructed according to the design first suggested by Scrase (1958), the earth's electric potential gradient by the Field Mill method, wind speed (using a cup-generator type anemometer), and wind direction (using a <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometer).</b> The two rain receivers, situated on the flat roof of the Physics building of the Durham University, could be separated horizontally to 50 metres. Using an Elliott 803 digital computer, and by suitable programming, correlation coefficients between the two currents were calculated for various, tine lags between one current and the other, both when the receivers were placed side by side and when separated by 30 metres. The conclusion is reached that no significant difference could be obtained between the correlation coefficients calculated when the receivers were side by side {{and when they were}} at such a short distance apart, especially under continuous rainfall conditions. Comparisons were, therefore, made between the precipitation current measured at the Laboratory and that measured 900 metres away. Significant correlation was obtained for instantaneous measurements of the currents when there was no wind, but when the wind was blowing roughly {{in the direction of the}} receivers, a definite time lag was found between similar variations of the currents. By applying the same method of correlation-time lag analysis to the current, I, and the potential gradient, F, the author found on one occasion, for sleet and snow, that a significant negative correlation existed between the two parameters for a time lag- [...] of about 1 + 0 seconds of the current on the potential gradient, consistent with the idea that the time of fall of precipitation particles should be considered when fitting the functional relationship I = a(F + C) : the discrepancy between the values of constants a and C for Summer and Winter results found by Ramsay (1959) could thus be resolved. Some of the records, especially those of rain showers, did show that the space charge on the falling precipitation (as pointed out by Magono and Orikasa (1960)) is an important factor in the "Mirror- Image" phenomenon in low potential gradients, The author's results indicate, also, that the melting process is a plausible mechanism of precipitation charging...|$|E

40|$|Component {{testing is}} one of the most {{important}} tasks before it is put to use in any application. In this direction linearity of potentiometer plays an important role, especially the multi turn <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometers.</b> This is because; such potentiometers are used in vital applications such as in aircrafts for the maintenance of certain pressure systems and as rotary position sensors. Testing for linearity is an important task in such a scenario. Testing of components calls for an analog to digital converter for converting analog information into digital domain. The main aim of the present work is to design and develop an embedded system to test the linearity of such a potentiometer. Such a system is portable. The hardware makes use of a stepper motor, a Darlington driver IC ULN 2003 and a small jig to attach the potentiometer to a stepping motor. Philips ARM LPC 2103 -mixed signal controller controls the entire assembly. Software is developed to acquire data from potentiometer, to store the data on the on-chip memory, to display it on LCD, and to send the same to PC on serial lines using MAX- 232. The linearity plot is displayed on the system monitor. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{intensive}} study of {{various forms of}} transducers was conducted with application towards hermetically sealing the transducer and all electronics. The {{results of the study}} indicated that the Hall effect devices and a LED/phototransistor combination were the most practical for this type of application. Therefore, hardware was developed utilizing a magnet/Hall effect transducer for single action switches and LED/phototransistor transducers for <b>rotary</b> multiposition or <b>potentiometer</b> applications. All electronics could be housed in a hermetically sealed compartment. A number of switches were built and models were hermetically sealed to prove the feasibility of this type of fabrication. One of each type of switch was subjected to temperature cycling, vibration, and EMI tests. The results of these tests are presented...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} the motions and mooring forces {{of a typical}} internal turret moored Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) system under regular sea waves for different loading conditions i. e., 40 %DWT, 70 %DWT and 100 %DWT with different turret locations viz forward, midships and semi- aft positions is reported in this paper. A 1 : 100 scale model of 140000 DWT turret moored FPSO system was tested in a 2 m wide wave flume at a water depth of 1 m for the wave frequencies from 0. 55 Hz to 1. 25 Hz in steps of 0. 04 Hz. The motions were measured by <b>rotary</b> type <b>potentiometers</b> and proving ring type load cells were {{used to measure the}} mooring forces. From the analysis of the experimental results, it is found that among the three turret locations, the forward turret position is the best suited position for the internal turret moored FPSO system, so as to have favourable and safe working environment. In this turret location, the surge, heave and pitch motions are about 20 % to 30 % less in comparison with mid ship and semi-aft positions for all loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of {{the contributions of the}} NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) to the DARPA/AFRL/NASA/ Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) Smart Wing program is presented. The overall objective of the Smart Wing program was to develop smart** technologies and demonstrate near-flight-scale actuation systems to improve the aerodynamic performance of military aircraft. NASA LaRC s roles were to provide technical guidance, wind-tunnel testing time and support, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses. The program was divided into two phases, with each phase having two wind-tunnel entries in the Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT). This paper focuses on the fourth and final wind-tunnel test: Phase 2, Test 2. During this test, a model based on the NGC Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) concept was tested at Mach numbers up to 0. 8 and dynamic pressures up to 150 psf to determine the aerodynamic performance benefits that could be achieved using hingeless, smoothly-contoured control surfaces actuated with smart materials technologies. The UCAV-based model was a 30 % geometric scale, full-span, sting-mounted model with the smart control surfaces on the starboard wing and conventional, hinged control surfaces on the port wing. Two LaRC-developed instrumentation systems were used during the test to externally measure the shapes of the smart control surface and quantify the effects of aerodynamic loading on the deflections: Videogrammetric Model Deformation (VMD) and Projection Moire Interferometry (PMI). VMD is an optical technique that uses single-camera photogrammetric tracking of discrete targets to determine deflections at specific points. PMI provides spatially continuous measurements of model deformation by computationally analyzing images of a grid projected onto the model surface. Both the VMD and PMI measurements served well to validate the use of on-board (internal) <b>rotary</b> <b>potentiometers</b> to measure the smart control surface deflection angles. Prior to the final entry, NASA LaRC also performed three-dimensional unstructured Navier Stokes CFD analyses in an attempt to predict the potential aerodynamic impact of the smart control surface on overall model forces and moments. Eight different control surface shapes were selected for study at Mach = 0. 6, Reynolds number = 3. 25 x 10 (exp 6), and + 2 deg., 3 deg., 8 deg., and 10 deg. model angles-of-attack. For the baseline, undeflected control surface geometry, the CFD predictions and wind-tunnel results matched well. The agreement was not as good for the more complex aero-loaded control surface shapes, though, because of the inability to accurately predict those shapes. Despite these results, the NASA CFD study served as an important step in studying advanced control effectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of research {{associated with the}} analysis of the rowing stroke is concentrated in laboratories due to the aquatic nature of rowing. The limitations of the tethered connection between the boat and land, has meant that on-water data collection of the rowing stroke has been severely limited. The stroke is a fundamental facet of rowing and can be considered a closed cyclic motor skill which is both physically and technically challenging. Therefore the analysis and optimisation of the rowing stroke technique is of utmost importance to improving performance for rowers of all levels. The aim of this thesis was to investigate and design an inexpensive wireless augmented feedback rowing system with the capabilities of working on water. In order to design the system, a literature review of augmented feedback, the applications used to provide augmented feedback in sport and an investigation into the current commercial wireless technologies available was conducted. This led to the selection of 80. 11 b as the chosen wireless technology for this study. Investigations into the operating ranges and data rates of 802. 11 b when integrated with the National Instruments data acquisition hardware and LabView software chosen for the thesis were completed. This revealed the operating range to be valid for up to 200 m outdoors and have data rates of 4 Mb/s. Furthermore a review of kinematic and kinetic literature associated with the rowing stroke was carried out, with a particular focus on the sensors used in the instrumentation of the rowing boat and the use of feedback in rowing so as to identify the critical areas of the rowing stroke to analyze. These parameters were found to be: the gate angle, the blade angle and the seat position. To measure these parameters, the sensors required needed to be inexpensive and robust. A <b>rotary</b> spindle <b>potentiometer</b> was used to measure the gate angle and two string potentiometers were used to measure the seat position and blade angle. The sensors were verified and validated by comparing their measured values against the Motion Analysis Corporation 3 D Eagle camera system and Cortex software. A graphical user interface was designed using National Instruments LabView software to provide visual feedback from the sensor data for the rowing coach to view. This application allows the user to select different graphs relating to the oar, seat and blade. The complete system encompasses the data acquired from the selected sensors being transmitted from data acquisition laptop to the graphical user interface via the 802. 11 b wireless network. After thorough bench testing of the system, it was concluded that this wireless augmented feedback system for rowing has the required capabilities for on-water testing, the next stage in the systems development...|$|R
