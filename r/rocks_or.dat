50|$|Deadfalls are a {{primitive}} type of trap where one uses a <b>rock</b> <b>or</b> a log to catch an animal. Deadfalls {{have a long}} history among Native Americans. The flat <b>rock</b> <b>or</b> log must weigh five times more than the target animal. The <b>rock</b> <b>or</b> log is elevated with a lever type of action, using sticks. Sometimes string or wire is used with the lever. The <b>rock</b> <b>or</b> log was elevated 1 to 3 feet above the ground. There are several methods for making a trigger, which is placed under the deadfall. When the animal approaches the bait and touches the trigger, the <b>rock</b> <b>or</b> log falls, crushing the animal. These traps cost nothing to make but are time consuming to construct. These type of traps can be made before the season but just not set. When steel traps were invented in the late 1600s, trappers were able to make sets faster without having to construct deadfalls or snares.|$|R

5|$|Both {{in water}} and on land, the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and on land, they use {{structures}} such as logs, <b>rocks,</b> <b>or</b> small animal burrows for cover. They feed mainly on different invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E
5|$|Both parents remain {{involved}} in guarding the fry from brood predators {{and engage in}} behaviors to assist feeding such as moving leaves or fin digging (digging up the substrate with their fins). Brood care of eggs, larvae and free-swimming juveniles in the wild can last 4 to 6 weeks, and occurs only once per season {{for the majority of}} females. In contrast, females in aquaria are known to breed many times per year with short intervals of 12 or 13 days between broods, as long as suitable <b>rocks</b> <b>or</b> similar surfaces are available for them to lay their eggs on.|$|E
5|$|Many Polistes species {{aggregate}} over winter. Polistes exclamans clump {{in rather}} large aggregations while hibernating. “These aggregations are frequently found in protected places called hibernacula {{that can be}} as varied as crevices and cracks of <b>rocks</b> <b>or</b> trunks, beneath the bark of trees, between walls of buildings, or any other natural or artificial structures that provides protection during hibernation.” Although Polistes exclamans {{have been found in}} organ-pipe muddauber nests, a mud nest that can provide a certain level of protection, it is not thought to actually house hibernating Polistes exclamans over the winter.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about the {{internal}} structure of Puck. It is probably made of a mixture of water ice with the dark material similar to that found in the rings. This dark material is probably made of <b>rocks</b> <b>or</b> radiation-processed organics. The absence of craters with bright rays implies that Puck is not differentiated, meaning that ice and non-ice components have not separated from each other into a core and mantle.|$|E
5|$|The colonies {{are found}} in rotten wood, in the ground, under <b>rocks</b> <b>or</b> stones and in urban areas. The ants are both diurnal and nocturnal and forage on trees, in low {{vegetation}} and into human homes, where they are regarded as pests. These ants eat a variety of foods, including fruits, insects, sucrose, nectar and bird feces. They visit various flowers and attend {{to a variety of}} butterfly larvae. The thorny devil, an Australian lizard, predominantly feeds on Ochetellus workers, and other ant species also prey on them.|$|E
5|$|The lichen {{typically}} {{grows on}} rough bark in sheltered and shaded habitats in moist and dense subtropical forests. More rarely, {{it is found}} on <b>rocks</b> <b>or</b> on leaves. In the USA it occurs in hammocks (hardwood forests) and swamps which have standing water, {{at least part of}} the year. It is also common in oak or oak-pine scrub vegetation. The species is often associated with Cryptothecia striata in the USA.|$|E
50|$|A deadfall {{is a heavy}} <b>rock</b> <b>or</b> log that is tilted at {{an angle}} and held up with {{sections}} of branches, {{with one of them}} serving as a trigger. When the animal moves the trigger, which may have bait on or near it, the <b>rock</b> <b>or</b> log falls, crushing the animal. The <b>rock</b> <b>or</b> log must be at least five times heavier than the animal that is to be caught. For example, if the target animal is a 3 pound rabbit, the log must be at least 15 pounds.|$|R

5|$|While most jumping spiders prey {{mainly on}} insects and by active hunting, females of Portia also build webs to catch prey directly. These capture webs are funnel-shaped and widest {{at the top}} and are about 4,000cubic {{centimetres}} in volume. The web is initially built in about 2hours, and then gradually made stronger. A Portia often joins her own web on to one of a web-based non-salticid spider. When not joined to another spiders', a P. labiata female's capture web may be suspended from rigid foundations such as boughs and <b>rocks,</b> <b>or</b> from pliant bases such as stems of shrubs.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a {{freshwater}} {{species and}} {{is found in}} forested riverine habitats and areas of flooded forest around lakes. It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, {{but it is also}} found in quiet, nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil. It is able to travel quite large distances overland at night and sub-adult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools. In the northern and southern parts of its range, it is also found in gallery forests in savannah country, but it is absent from such habitats in Los Llanos and the Pantanal. Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of alligator. During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of <b>rocks</b> <b>or</b> sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water with their backs exposed.|$|E
5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on <b>rocks</b> <b>or</b> mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E

5|$|Geologists and the {{official}} Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend {{in a series of}} small steps. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation <b>rocks</b> <b>or</b> the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is gray sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool. Brown's book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types to classify waterfalls: falls, cascade, slide, and chute.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to larvae that have portable cases, {{members of the}} Annulipalpia have a completely different feeding strategy. They make fixed retreats in which they remain stationary, waiting for food to come to them. Members of the Psychomyiidae, Ecnomidae and Xiphocentronidae families construct simple tubes of sand and other particles held together by silk and anchored to the bottom, and feed on the accumulations of silt formed when suspended material is deposited. The tube can be lengthened when the growing larva needs to feed in new areas. More complex tubes, short and flattened, are built by Polycentropodidae larvae in hollows in <b>rocks</b> <b>or</b> other submerged objecte, sometimes with strands of silk suspended across the nearby surface. These larvae are carnivorous, resembling spiders in their feeding habits and rushing out of their retreat to attack any unwary small prey crawling across the surface.|$|E

5|$|Laura Knight {{spent the}} summer of 1908 working on the beaches at Newlyn making studies for her large {{painting}} of children in bright sunlight. The Beach was shown at the Royal Academy in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously. About this time she began painting compositions {{of women in the}} open air, in the plein-air manner, often on the <b>rocks</b> <b>or</b> cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, the landowner, a Colonel Paynter, was fully supportive and allowed Knight and the other artists a free rein. Daughters of the Sun, which showed several women, some naked, sitting by a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed. In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{normally}} nest in crevices between {{or under}} <b>rocks,</b> <b>or</b> burrow in the soil. When {{they make their}} own tunnels, they loosen the earth with their bills and kick out the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.|$|E
5|$|The game cuts to September 1978, as Reza and his pacifist friend Babak Azadi (Omid Abtahi) watch crowds {{chanting}} {{about the}} revolution from a rooftop, and Reza takes photographs. The two then walk the streets, and {{arrive at a}} protest where revolution leaders are giving speeches. Reza's cousin Ali Shirazi (Nicholas Guilak) arrives and, when the protest is interrupted by soldiers and the crowd begins to disperse, he tries to convince Reza to throw rocks at the soldiers. Babak opposes, and Reza is left {{to decide whether to}} act aggressively and throw <b>rocks,</b> <b>or</b> act passively and voice his concerns instead. When the soldiers start threatening the crowds by firing, Reza and Babak flee into an alley, shortly followed by Ali and an injured Abbas (Ray Haratian), one of the revolution leaders who was stabbed in the commotion. After briefly being tended to, Abbas is escorted away by Ali and Bibi Golestan (Mozhan Marnò).|$|E
