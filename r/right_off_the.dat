25|$|In 1946, {{concern was}} {{expressed}} in Parliament over {{the closing of}} the bridge to road traffic at peak times. The following year, the Manchester Ship Canal Company agreed that the bridge would generally stay open for road traffic during rush hour, though this could not be guaranteed. A cargo vessel struck the bridge on 28 December 1948, restricting the bridge to single-line working and a two-ton weight limit until repairs had been completed. In 1953, traffic was banned from turning <b>right</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bridge into Barton Road.|$|E
25|$|In {{deciding}} on {{what type of}} vine training system to use, growers will also consider the climate conditions of the vineyard where the amount of sunlight, humidity and wind could have a large impact on the exact benefits the training system offers. For instance, while having a large spread out canopy (such as what the Geneva Double Curtain offers) can promote a favorable leaf to fruit ratio for photosynthesis, it offers very little wind protection. In places such as the Châteauneuf-du-Pape, strong prevailing winds such as le mistral can take the fruit <b>right</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> vine so a more condensed, protective vine training system is desirable for vineyards there.|$|E

25|$|When the Blonds' time in Los Angeles ended {{near the}} end of 1975, they {{returned}} to the Tri State promotion and immediately targeted the United States Tag Team championship. On March 18, 1976, the duo defeated Greg Valentine and Gorgeous George, Jr. Due to disputes over pay and billing the Blonds’ time in Tri State was short lived, they quickly dropped the tag team title to Buck Robley and Bob Slaughter only eleven days after they won them. The Blonds next appeared in CWF once more, winning the Florida Tag Team titles from Steve Keirn and Bob Backlund not long after arriving in the territory. Just like with Tri State, their stay in Florida was short, as they dropped the titles to Mike Graham and Ken Lucas only a few months later and left. After a short stay in Florida, the duo began working for Jim Crockett’s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW). On January 17, 1977, Roberts and Brown defeated the team of Dino Bravo and Tim Woods for the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship and held on to it for three months until Bravo and new partner Tiger Conway Jr. beat them for the gold. During the summer of 1977, the Hollywood Blonds moved from Mid-Atlantic to Memphis and the NWA Mid-America promotion (later Continental Wrestling Association, CWA). In Memphis, the Blonds shot up the tag team ranks <b>right</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bat defeating Bob Ellis and Jim Garvin for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on July 25.

500|$|While {{recognized}} {{primarily as}} a playmaker leading up to his NHL career, Kariya was forced into shooting more as the Mighty Ducks lacked scorers {{in his first two}} seasons with the team. During his third NHL season, he commented that, [...] "If Teemu [...] had been here <b>right</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bat, then maybe I wouldn't have focused so much on shooting." [...] Kariya was able to put many shots on goal due to his quick release. In 1998–99, he led the League with 429 shots on goal, which at the time was the second-highest recorded total in NHL history. Nonetheless maintaining his passing ability, Kariya was particularly adept at making plays from deep in the offensive zone and beside the opposing team's net.|$|E

Chris makes uncomfortable comments, remarking that Leslie has an excellent uterus ("could easily have triplets <b>right</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bat") and asking whether she is having her period, presumably in anticipation of sex later. Leslie rejects his advances when the date ends, prompting him to make an angry goodbye, even though Leslie still needs to give him a ride home. Meanwhile, Mark (Paul Schneider) grows suspicious that Ann harbors romantic feelings for Justin. He eventually confronts Ann and accuses her of trying to [...] "save" [...] Justin for a possible relationship in the future. Mark asks Ann's ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt), who also recalls Ann's infatuation with Justin. Andy scolds Ann for hurting Mark's feelings, then tries to trick her into thinking she was still dating him, which does not work. Realizing her behavior was inappropriate, Ann sets Leslie up on a date with Justin.|$|E

In April 2011, Tim Miller was hired to make his directorial debut with the film, after working on the visual effects for some of the X-Men films.

Disorientated, the assaulting companies became separated and the battalion attack turned {{into a series of}} independent company attacks. D Company slowly continued forward however, and when the mist lifted suddenly at 11:20 they were left dangerously exposed still only halfway up the slope to their objective. The Australian approach had surprised the Chinese however, who were apparently expecting the assault from the north, and D Company succeeded in closing to within grenade range of the Chinese on Victor. During a fierce twenty-minute fire-fight the Australians cleared their first objective with the assistance of direct fire from supporting tanks, and indirect fire support from artillery, losing three killed and 12 wounded. Included among the Australian wounded was the company commander and one of the platoon commanders, both of whom remained in command despite gunshot wounds.

500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years.

That didn't happen <b>right</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea for the first time on any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E
