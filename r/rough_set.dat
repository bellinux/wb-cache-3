40|$|Abstract—Covering-based <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> is an {{extension}} of <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> and it is based on a covering instead of a partition of the universe. Therefore it is more powerful in describing some practical problems than <b>rough</b> <b>sets.</b> However, by extending the <b>rough</b> <b>sets,</b> covering-based <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> can increase the roughness of each model in recognizing objects. How to obtain better approximations from the models of a covering-based <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> is an important issue. In this paper, two concepts, determinate elements and indeterminate elements in a universe, are proposed and given precise definitions respectively. This research makes a reasonable refinement of the covering-element from a new viewpoint. And the refinement may generate better approximations of covering-based <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> models. To prove the theory above, it is applied to eight major coveringbased <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> models which are adapted from other literature. The result is, in all these models, the lower approximation increases effectively. Correspondingly, in all models, the upper approximation decreases with exceptions of two models in some special situations. Therefore, the roughness of recognizing objects is reduced. This research provides a new approach to the study and application of covering-based <b>rough</b> <b>sets.</b> Keywords—Determinate element, indeterminate element, refinement of covering-element, refinement of covering, covering-based <b>rough</b> <b>sets.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{combination}} {{of different types of}} sets such as fuzzy sets, soft <b>sets</b> and <b>rough</b> <b>sets,</b> abundant hybrid models have been presented in order to take advantage of each other and handle uncertainties. A comparative study of relationships and interconnections of some existing hybrid models has been carried out. Some foundational properties of modified soft <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> (MSR sets) are analyzed. It is pointed out that MSR approximation operators are some kinds of Pawlak approximation operators, whereas approximation operators of Z-soft <b>rough</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> are equivalent to approximation operators of <b>rough</b> fuzzy <b>sets.</b> The relationships among F-soft <b>rough</b> fuzzy <b>sets,</b> M-soft <b>rough</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> and Z-soft <b>rough</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> are surveyed. A new model called soft <b>rough</b> soft <b>sets</b> has been provided as the generalization of F-soft <b>rough</b> <b>sets,</b> and its application in group decision-making has been studied.

2500|$|<b>Rough</b> <b>set</b> {{theory is}} one of many methods that can be {{employed}} to analyse uncertain (including vague) systems, although less common than more traditional methods of probability, statistics, entropy and Dempster–Shafer theory.

Unlike other methods, as those given above, classical <b>rough</b> <b>set</b> analysis requires no additional information, external parameters, models, functions, grades or subjective interpretations to determine set membership – instead it only uses the information presented within the given data (Düntsch and Gediga 1995).

40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of covering generalized <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> {{has made a}} substantial contribution to the traditional theory of <b>rough</b> <b>sets.</b> The notion of attribute reduction {{can be regarded as}} one of the strongest and most significant results in <b>rough</b> <b>sets.</b> However, the efforts made on attribute reduction of covering generalized <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> are far from sufficient. In this work, covering reduction is examined and discussed. We initially construct a new reduction theory by redefining the approximation spaces and the reducts of covering generalized <b>rough</b> <b>sets.</b> This theory is applicable to all types of covering generalized <b>rough</b> <b>sets,</b> and generalizes some existing reduction theories. Moreover, the currently insufficient reducts of covering generalized <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> are improved by the new reduction.
