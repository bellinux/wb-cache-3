The story goes that the <b>Romans</b> <b>cut</b> out a spy's tongue, so when he reached bar Kokhba's camp, he was only able to nod or shake his head to answer bar Kokhba's questions. The number of questions is not limited to twenty.|$|R
60|$|John himself stood even higher, in the {{estimation}} of his followers, than he did at the commencement of the campaign. His own band had been particularly successful, and had several times encountered parties of the Romans almost equal to themselves in numbers. His plans had been always well laid, and on no occasion had the <b>Romans</b> <b>cut</b> off and killed any numerous parties. Altogether, the justness of his views had been established by experience, the men had gained confidence in themselves and in him, and now only regretted that they had had no opportunity of attacking the Romans in anything like equal numbers.|$|R

50|$|Roman discipline, {{organization}} and logistical systemization sustained combat effectiveness {{over a longer}} period. Notably, the Roman system of castra, or fortified camps, allowed the army {{to stay in the}} field on favorable ground and be rested and resupplied for battle. Well organized Roman logistics also sustained combat power, from routine resupply and storage, to the construction of military roads, to state run arsenals and weapons factories, to well organized naval convoys that helped stave off defeat by Carthage. The death of a leader generally did not cause the legions to lose heart in battle. Others stepped to the fore and carried on. In the defeat by Hannibal at the River Trebia, 10,000 <b>Romans</b> <b>cut</b> their way through the debacle to safety, maintaining unit cohesion when all around was rout, a testimony to their tactical {{organization and}} discipline.|$|R
50|$|Nicolas Jenson began {{printing}} in Venice {{with his}} original roman font from 1470. Jenson's {{design and the}} very similar <b>roman</b> types <b>cut</b> by Francesco Griffo c. 1499 and Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 are acknowledged as the definitive and archetypal roman faces that set the pattern {{for the majority of}} western text faces that followed.|$|R
5000|$|The Merveilleuses scandalized Paris with {{dresses and}} tunics {{modeled after the}} ancient Greeks and <b>Romans,</b> <b>cut</b> of light or even {{transparent}} linen and gauze. Sometimes so revealing they were termed [...] "woven air", many gowns displayed cleavage and were too tight to allow pockets. To carry even a handkerchief, the ladies had to use small bags known as reticules. They were fond of wigs, often choosing blonde because the Paris Commune had banned blonde wigs, but they also wore them in black, blue, and green. Enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and Greek-style sandals were the rage. The sandals tied above the ankle with crossed ribbons or strings of pearls. Exotic and expensive scents fabricated by perfume houses like Parfums Lubin were worn as both for style and as indicators of social station. Thérésa Tallien, known as [...] "Our Lady of Thermidor", wore expensive rings on the toes of her bare feet and gold circlets on her legs.|$|R
50|$|With {{the escape}} of the consul the Samnites focused their {{attention}} on Decius and his men. They surrounded the hilltop, but had not yet decided whether to risk an assault when night set in. Surprised {{that he had not}} been attacked, Decius sneaked down with his centurions to scout out the Samnite positions. Once back in his camp, Decius silently assembled his men and informed them that he intended to break out at night, silently if they could, by force if they were discovered. Moving in the spaces between the Samnite pickets, the Romans were halfway through when they were discovered. But when Decius and his men let out a battle cry the awakening Samnites were flung into chaos and the <b>Romans</b> <b>cut</b> their way through. Next morning the Roman army celebrated the safe return of Decius and his men. At the urgings of Decius, the consul ordered his army to attack the Samnites. The Samnites were taken wholly unprepared for battle and were scattered and their camp taken. The 30 000 Samnites who had fled into the camp were all killed.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly John sprang {{in at the}} Roman, {{throwing}} {{himself with}} all his force against him. He partially warded, with his sword, the blow which the Roman struck {{at him as he}} came in; but his weapon was beaten down, and the <b>Roman</b> blade <b>cut</b> through his thick headdress. But the impetus of his spring was sufficient. The Roman, taken by surprise by this sudden attack, tottered, and then fell with a crash, John falling on the top of him.|$|R
5000|$|One {{example from}} ancient times is the Battle of the Trebia river. Hannibal encamped within {{striking}} distance of the Romans with the Trebia River between them, and placed a strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment, near the battle zone. He had noticed, says Polybius, a [...] "place between the two camps, flat indeed and treeless, but well adapted for an ambuscade, as it was traversed by a water-course with steep banks, densely overgrown with brambles and other thorny plants, and here he proposed to lay a stratagem to surprise the enemy". When the Roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army, the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear. The result was slaughter and defeat for the Romans. Nevertheless, the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline {{on the part of the}} ambushed force. Although most of the legions were lost, about 10,000 <b>Romans</b> <b>cut</b> their way through to safety, maintaining unit cohesion. This ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from a kill zone is a hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation. (See Ranger reference below).|$|R
5000|$|The idea {{of using}} [...] "tracked" [...] roads is at least 2000 years old; {{quarries}} in Ancient Greece, Malta and the <b>Roman</b> Empire used <b>cut</b> stone tracks to haul loads pulled by animals, as the Greek Diolkos did for transporting ships overland.|$|R
60|$|The track, {{which had}} {{for the last five}} days' march {{proceeded}} along a comparatively level valley, now mounted rapidly, and turning aside from the valley of the Isere it led up the deep bed of the mountain torrent known as the Reclus; this stream ran in a deep trough hollowed out in a very narrow valley. The bed is now so piled with rocks and stones as to be impassable, and the <b>Romans</b> afterwards <b>cut</b> a road along {{on the side of the}} mountain. But at this time it was possible for men and animals to proceed along the bed of the torrent.|$|R
5000|$|The {{book has}} long been sought after {{as one of the}} most {{beautiful}} incunabula ever printed. The typography is famous for its quality and clarity. Its <b>roman</b> typeface, <b>cut</b> by Francesco Griffo, is a revised version of a type which Aldus had first used in 1496 for the De Aetna of Pietro Bembo. The type is thought to be one of the first examples of the italic typeface, and in incunabula, it is unique to the Aldine Press. The type was revived by the Monotype Corporation in 1923 as [...] "Poliphilus". In 1929, Stanley Morison directed another revival of the earlier version of Griffo's type. It was called [...] "Bembo".|$|R
5000|$|Tuff's primary {{economic}} value is as a building material. In the ancient world, tuff's relative softness {{meant that it}} was commonly used for construction where it was available. Tuff is common in Italy, and the Romans used it for many buildings and bridges. For example, the whole port of the island of Ventotene (still in use), was carved out from tuff. The Servian Wall, built to defend the city of Rome in the 4th century BC, is also built almost entirely from tuff [...] The <b>Romans</b> also <b>cut</b> tuff into small rectangular stones {{that they used to}} create walls in a pattern known as opus reticulatum.|$|R
50|$|Excavations {{carried out}} at the {{beginning}} of the 1930s under the floor of the Basilica of San Pancrazio led to the discovery of a <b>Roman</b> street that <b>cut</b> in two diagonally the church; they also brought to light some mausolea and ground graves, both inside the basilica and in its square, such demonstrating that the hypogeous cemetery also included an extended funerary area on the topsoil.|$|R
5000|$|The spy Harry Houghton wrote a {{book called}} [...] "Operation Portland" [...] after he was {{released}} from prison in which he outlined the explanation of Crabb's death which he claimed to have been given by his Russian handler, a man he knew as Roman, in July 1956. Houghton claims that shortly before the Soviet visit he had been meeting Roman in a pub in Puncknowle, Dorset, and happened to see a friend who worked at the Underwater Detection Establishment with her boyfriend who was a diver. The boyfriend was annoyed that he had been training for something special, which had just been called off. Shortly after hearing this, <b>Roman</b> had <b>cut</b> short the meeting.|$|R
5|$|The Mildenhall, Kaiseraugst, and Esquiline treasures {{comprise}} large {{items of}} tableware. Other hoards, however, {{such as those}} found at Thetford and Beaurains consist mostly of coins, jewellery, and small tableware items; these two hoards probably are pagan votive offerings. A hoard from Traprain Law in Scotland contains decorated <b>Roman</b> silver pieces <b>cut</b> up and folded, showing regard {{for the value of}} their metal alone, and may represent loot from a raid.|$|R
50|$|Baldock {{was founded}} by the Knights Templar (also {{the name of the}} town's {{secondary}} school) as a medieval market town in the 1140s. It was laid out by the Knights Templar on land in the manor of Weston in the hundred of Broadwater, granted by the earl of Pembroke, Gilbert de Clare, before his death in 1148. The 1850 tithe map, drawn up before the parish boundaries were extended in the later 19th century, clearly shows the boundaries of the land grant made from the manor of Weston in the 12th century. It is a triangular parcel of land beside the old <b>Roman</b> Road <b>cut</b> out from an older estate; {{it is likely that the}} Templars used their knowledge of mathematics when siting buildings.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the fall}} of the Jacobins and their Sans-culottes {{supporters}}, the supporters of the Thermidorian Reaction were known as the Incroyables and Merveilleuses. They scandalized Paris with their extravagant clothes. The Merveilleuses wore dresses and tunics modeled after the ancient Greeks and <b>Romans,</b> <b>cut</b> of light or even transparent linen and gauze. Sometimes so revealing they were termed [...] "woven air", many gowns displayed cleavage and were too tight to allow pockets. To carry even a handkerchief, the ladies had to use small bags known as reticules. They were fond of wigs, often choosing blonde because the Paris Commune had banned blonde wigs, but they also wore them in black, blue, and green. Enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and Greek-style sandals were the rage. The sandals were tied above the ankle with crossed ribbons or strings of pearls. Exotic and expensive scents fabricated by perfume houses like Parfums Lubin were worn as both for style and as indicators of social station. Thérésa Tallien, known as [...] "Our Lady of Thermidor", wore expensive rings on the toes of her bare feet and gold circlets on her legs. The Incroyables wore eccentric outfits: large earrings, green jackets, wide trousers, huge neckties, thick glasses, and hats topped by [...] "dog ears", their hair falling on their ears. Their musk-based fragrances earned them too the derogatory nickname muscadins among the lower classes, already applied to a wide group of anti-Jacobins. They wore bicorne hats and carried bludgeons, which they referred to as their [...] "executive power." [...] Hair was often shoulder-length, sometimes pulled up in the back with a comb to imitate the hairstyles of the condemned. Some sported large monocles, and they frequently affected a lisp and sometimes a stooped hunchbacked posture.|$|R
60|$|The {{battle of}} Trebia cost Malchus {{the loss of}} his father. It was against the portion of the force headed by Hamilcar that the <b>Romans,</b> who <b>cut</b> their way through the circle of foes which Hannibal had thrown round them, flung themselves. Hamilcar had in vain {{attempted}} to stem the torrent. Surrounded by his bravest officers, he had cast himself {{in the way of the}} Roman legion; but nothing could withstand the rush of the heavy armed spearmen, who, knowing that all was lost, and that their only hope was in cutting their way through the Carthaginians, pressed forward, shoulder to shoulder, and swept aside the opposition of their more lightly armed foes. Hamilcar and most of his officers fell, striving to the last to stem the current.|$|R
5000|$|But when Gelimer reached Ammatas's {{position}} {{and discovered that}} his brother had been killed, by the vanguard of John the Armenian, he became disconsolate and failed to give an order for one more assault — which would probably have destroyed the reeling <b>Roman</b> army and <b>cut</b> off the Huns and Byzantines who had earlier advanced toward Carthage after beating Ammatas and Gibamund. Instead, the Vandal attack was weakened while Gelimer buried his brother on the battlefield.|$|R
50|$|The Land Act of 1853 {{provided}} {{funding for}} the development of roads throughout the wilderness of Upper Canada. Grants were administered by the Department of Agriculture to survey and build the new roads. The roads followed the tradition of old <b>Roman</b> roads, and <b>cut</b> through the wilderness in a straight line, veering only when the terrain was impassable, but cutting through swamps and hills otherwise. Four primary roads were built: the Cameron Road, the Bobcaygeon Road, the Monck Road, and the Portage Road.|$|R
50|$|The liberty was {{partially}} bounded by rivers. To the south {{there was a}} short boundary with Erith in the Lessness hundred of Kent, formed by the River Thames. To the east the River Ingrebourne formed a boundary with the Chafford hundred of Essex and the parishes of (from north to south) South Weald, Upminster and Rainham. To the north of the liberty was much higher ground and the boundary with the Ongar hundred and the parishes of (west to east) Lambourne, Navestock and Stapleford Abbots. The western boundary was with the reduced Becontree hundred and the parish of Dagenham, partially formed by the River Beam. To the south the lower elevation formed the Hornchurch Marshes. The London to Colchester <b>Roman</b> Road <b>cut</b> through the liberty further north. In 1831 the total population of the liberty was 6,812.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{but it did}} betoken a most {{excellent}} penmanship. It was small; and {{the fingers}} were long and thin; the knuckles softly rounded; the nails hemispherical at the base; and the smooth palm furnishing few characters for an Egyptian fortune-teller to read. It was not as the sturdy farmer's hand of Cincinnatus, who followed the plough and guided the state; {{but it was as}} the perfumed hand of Petronius Arbiter, that elegant young buck of a <b>Roman,</b> who once <b>cut</b> great Seneca dead in the forum.|$|R
50|$|The {{typeface}} Basle <b>Roman</b> was <b>cut</b> for the Chiswick Press in 1854 by William Howard {{and cast}} at his foundry in Great Queen Street. It {{was first used}} for the Rev. William Calvert's The Wife's Manual (a book of religious verse), published in 1854; later editions followed in 1856 and 1861, both set in the same type which apparently had only one size, 10-11 pt and no italic. The Basle roman is a type based {{on the kind of}} roman type used by Johannes Froben of Basle in the early 16th century. In 1889 it was used by William Morris for his romance A Tale of the House of the Wolfings, and again for The Roots of the Mountains (date 1890 but appeared the year before). The volumes of religious verse by the Rev. Orby Shipley also used Basle roman: Lyra eucharistica (1863), Lyra messianica (1864) and Lyra mystica (1865).|$|R

50|$|The film {{portrays the}} fugitives as having {{no chance to}} find loyalists except in Britain, {{the whole of the}} West {{otherwise}} in Odoacer's hands. In fact, Odoacer's rule did not extend beyond the Italian Peninsula. Across the Adriatic in Dalmatia Emperor Julius Nepos still ruled; with the Eastern Empire stretching beyond. Across Northern France, <b>Roman</b> legions <b>cut</b> off from Italy in the area historians now call the Domain of Soissons remained opposed to Odoacer. In Barbarian ravaged Hispania, Roman writ still ran in the major cities, and in what is now Morocco, local Berber leaders continued to regard themselves as loyal vassals. Although the real usurper Romulus Augustus could not expect to find help in any of these places, he could have found safe haven if he required it. Certainly they would have been more promising than late fifth century Britain, the Roman legions having departed the island for the continent in 407, {{more than half a century}} before the action of the film.|$|R
50|$|In the Church of Scotland, it {{is normal}} for the Geneva gown to be vented (opened at the front), sleeveless, and worn over a cassock. The cassock, usually black (like its {{counterpart}} in the Church of England), also comes in blue (signifying the Royal Blue in the Flag of Scotland, which bears the Cross of St. Andrew, {{the patron saint}} of Scotland), or scarlet red signifying a Queen's Chaplain. This practice is sometimes followed by some English Methodists and American Presbyterians, although wearing the more familiar American-style gown, including wearing a black cassock in <b>Roman</b> or Anglican <b>cut.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Though {{his name}} {{would come to}} be {{identified}} with an enduring style of Latin alphabet, Caslon's first typefaces were what contemporary typefounders called [...] "exotics." [...] His first design was an Arabic made at the English size (14pt), commissioned by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge before 1725, followed by a Hebrew created for William Bowyer in 1726, and a Coptic for Wilkins first used in 1731. His first Latin typefaces were a <b>roman</b> and italic <b>cut</b> in the pica size (12pt), of a style that was fully realized by the publication of his foundry's specimen sheet in 1734.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} match of the championship, Rubin {{defeated}} Kuban in Krasnodar, {{with a score}} of 2-0. Goals were scored by Alan Kasaev and Christian Noboa.

In the fourth round a match against Spartak Nalchik ended in a draw. In the fifth round, Rubin suffered a major defeat by CSKA Moscow 2-0. In the sixth round Rubin played against Amkar Perm to a draw, 1-1, with the only Rubin goal scored by Alexander Ryazantsev. An Amkar player helped the Rubin Captain <b>Roman</b> Sharonov <b>cut</b> the ball into his own net. In the seventh round there was another draw in Samara playing against Krylya Sovetov, with ascore of 2-2. In the eighth round, Rubin faced Premier League newcomers FC Krasnodar at home, the score of 2-1 {{was in favor of}} Kazan: two goals for Rubin scored by Gökdeniz Karadeniz, while Roman Sharonov again scored an own goal.|$|R
50|$|The {{architect}} Jože Plečnik redesigned {{the remains}} of the <b>Roman</b> walls: he <b>cut</b> two new passages to create a link to Snežnik Street (Snežniška ulica) and Murnik Street (Murnikova ulica), and behind the walls he arranged a park displaying architectural elements from Antiquity, with a stone monument collection in the Emona city gate. Above the passageway to Murnik Street he set up a pyramid, which he covered with turf. After the Second World War, attempts were made to embed references to Emona grid into modern Ljubljana, with the Roman forum becoming part of the Ferant Park apartment blocks and an echo of the rotunda located along Slovenia Street (Slovenska cesta).|$|R
