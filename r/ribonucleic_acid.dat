5|$|Two {{types of}} small <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} RNA interference. RNAs are the direct {{products}} of genes, and these small RNAs can bind to other specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and either increase or decrease their activity, for example by preventing an mRNA from being translated into a protein. RNA interference has {{an important role in}} defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences– viruses and transposons. It also influences development.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (RNA) is a {{polymeric}} molecule {{essential in}} various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute {{the four major}} macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.|$|E
25|$|Living organisms {{synthesize}} proteins, {{which are}} polymers of amino acids using instructions encoded by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

25|$|Two {{different}} kinds of genetic material exist: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (RNA). Cells use DNA for their long-term information storage.

25|$|Despite these advances, it was {{not until}} Ardhendu Mukherjee and W. Beermann {{performed}} more advanced autoradiography experiments in 1965 that scientists could confirm that transcription of genes in the single male X chromosome was double that observed in the two female X chromosomes. Mukherjee and Beermann confirmed this by designing a cellular autoradiography experiment that allowed them to visualize incorporation of uridine into <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> of the X chromosomes. Their studies showed equal levels of uridine incorporation in the single male X chromosome and the two female X chromosomes. Thus, the investigators concluded that the two-fold increase in the rate of RNA synthesis in the X chromosome of the male relative to those of the female could account for Muller’s hypothesized dosage compensation.|$|E
