5|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} built for <b>Réseau</b> Ferré de France (RFF), which {{owned and operated}} the infrastructure of the French national railway network. In a government restructuring of the French railroad network, RFF was merged into SNCF on 1 January 2015 {{and is now a}} subdivision of SNCF known as SNCF <b>Réseau.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families {{moved to the}} suburbs. A suburban railway network, the RER (<b>Réseau</b> Express Régional), was built to complement the Métro, and the Périphérique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Regional {{television}} {{rights in}} French {{are held by}} <b>Réseau</b> des sports (RDS) under a 12-year deal {{that began in the}} 2014–15 NHL season. A sister to the English-language network TSN, RDS was the only French-language sports channel in Canada until the 2011 launch of TVA Sports, and was also the previous national French rightsholder of the NHL; as a result, the Canadiens forewent a separate regional contract, and allowed all of its games to be televised nationally in French as part of RDS's overall NHL rights.|$|E

5|$|The 21st {{century has}} {{brought with it}} {{a revival of the}} city's {{economic}} and cultural landscape. The construction of new residential skyscrapers, two super-hospitals (the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal and McGill University Health Centre), the creation of the Quartier des Spectacles, reconstruction of the Turcot Interchange, reconfiguration of the Decarie and Dorval interchanges, construction of the new <b>Réseau</b> électrique métropolitain, gentrification of Griffintown, subway line extensions and the purchase of new subway cars, the complete revitalization and expansion of Trudeau International Airport, the completion of Quebec Autoroute 30, the reconstruction of the Champlain Bridge, and {{the construction of a new}} toll bridge to Laval are helping Montreal continue to grow.|$|E
5|$|The CFL {{operated}} the Canadian Football Network, {{a coalition of}} private broadcasters that shared league games and the Grey Cup with the CBC, from 1987 to 1990. CBC then broadcast the championship game alone until 2007, when the CFL sold exclusive rights to all games, including the Grey Cup, to specialty channel The Sports Network (TSN) and its French-language sister station <b>Réseau</b> des sports (RDS), a deal that was criticized by Canadians without cable access. Nonetheless, TSN and RDS achieved a record audience for the 2009 Grey Cup, with 6.1 million Canadians watching the game in its entirety, and over 14 million viewing {{at least part of}} the contest. Viewership has declined in recent years, and in 2014, about 33%, of Canadians watched at least some of the game, peaking at 5.1 million viewers in the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{train was}} {{carrying}} 53 persons, including four children, ages 10–15, {{who were not}} officially authorized to be aboard. The derailment resulted in 11 deaths, which included four employees of SNCF, five technicians from the engineering firm responsible for the tests, and two guests. Ten died at the crash scene, one died the following evening, and one seriously injured person remained in hospital as of February 2016. Among the dead {{was the director of}} the LGV Est line for SNCF <b>Réseau,</b> which owns France's railroad infrastructure. Despite breaking in two pieces and the severe impact with the parapet, there were no deaths among the seven people in the front cab. The second-to-last car impacted the canal wall and was the car with the highest death toll. It was the first fatal derailment {{in the history of the}} TGV and the third derailment since the TGV entered commercial service in 1981.|$|E

5|$|At 15:05, {{the train}} {{disappeared}} from the approach zone for the Vendenheim junction on the display being monitored by staff at the signalling control center. At 15:10, the control center initiated emergency procedures {{for the loss of}} a train and closed the non-high-speed rail lines that pass through the Vendenheim junction. At approximately the same time, one of the companies involved {{in the construction of the}} line received a call from an employee aboard the train, who informed them of the derailment. Shortly before 17:45, the local mass casualty plan was enacted. Emergency medical and fire rescue services along with 100 gendarmes responded to the incident. At its height, 104 engines from three départments responded to the incident—65 from Bas-Rhin and 39 from Moselle and Haut-Rhin. Those with minor injuries were treated by responders from the French Red Cross, which operated at the school in Eckwersheim. The French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Ségolène Royal, and the Secretary of State for Transport, Alain Vidalies, travelled to the site shortly after the crash. The president of SNCF, Guillaume Pepy, and the president of SNCF <b>Réseau,</b> Jacques Rapoport, also travelled to the site in the hours after the accident.|$|E

25|$|In August 1940 La Rocque began {{actively}} {{to participate}} in the Resistance, transmitting information to the British Secret Intelligence Service via Georges Charaudeau's <b>Réseau</b> Alibi ("Alibi Network"), and forming the <b>Réseau</b> Klan ("Klan Network") in 1942 as a means of coordinating intelligence-gathering activities among PSF members. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that he could convince Pétain to abandon his collaborationist line, to which end he requested, and was granted, three meetings with the Marshal in early 1943. Two days after their last meeting, on 9 March, La Rocque was arrested by the Gestapo during a nationwide roundup of over one hundred PSF leaders. Deported first to Czechoslovakia and later to Austria, he returned to France only in May 1945.|$|E
