40|$|One of {{the tasks}} of the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, MSB (Myndigheten för Samhällsskydd och Beredskap), is to partake in relief efforts in foreign countries. Before these relief efforts, roads are {{inspected}} for accessibility to ensure that communications will work. The <b>road</b> <b>inspections</b> are currently being performed by hand {{with the use of}} pen and paper, which brings difficulties to distribution of information. During the course of this thesis project, Sweco Position Karlstad has developed a digital <b>road</b> <b>inspection</b> tool for MSB that recieves information from a road inspector and stores this information in a database. This <b>road</b> <b>inspection</b> tool may in the future replace the pen and paper inspections and ease the work of the road inspectors. In this dissertation, a prototype of a web map that displays data from a <b>road</b> <b>inspection</b> is presented. Using a web map to display the results of a <b>road</b> <b>inspection</b> offers several advantages, as it eases distribution of information and allows end users to make selections about what data they want to view...|$|R

50|$|The {{foundations}} for the <b>inspection</b> <b>services</b> were {{laid in the}} late nineteenth century when a growing demand became apparent for safeguards regarding the quality of propagating material and seed. This need resulted in several inspection initiatives. In 1919 the Central Committee for the Inspection of Plants was established, followed by the Inspection Institute for Seeds and Planting Materials. Both organisations competed in their seed inspection activities. The establishment in 1932 of the Netherlands General <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> for Agricultural Seeds and Seed Potatoes (NAK) signalled the end of the confusion. From then on, the inspection of agricultural crops was centralised. The first merger was between the then Netherlands General <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> for Arboricultural Crops (NAKB) (1941) and the Netherlands General <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> for Floricultural Crops (NAKS) (1947). This resulted in the creation of the NAKB. In 2000 the new NAKB and NAKG (the Netherlands General <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> for Vegetable and Flower Seeds, 1941) merged to form the current Naktuinbouw.|$|R
