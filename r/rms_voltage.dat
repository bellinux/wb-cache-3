25|$|Dimmers are devices used to {{vary the}} {{brightness}} of a light. By decreasing or increasing the <b>RMS</b> <b>voltage</b> and hence the mean power to the lamp {{it is possible to}} vary the intensity of the light output. Although variable-voltage devices are used for various purposes, a dimmer is specifically those devices intended to control lighting. Dimmers are popularly used in venues such as movie theatres, stages, dining rooms, restaurants, and auditoriums where the need or absence of light during activities requires constant change. The dimmer was invented in 1892 by Granville Woods.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, online calculators can be used. [...] Once the {{sensitivity}} per volt is known, the maximum volume {{for a pair}} of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage. [...] For example, for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100dB (SPL)/V, an amplifier with an output of 1 root mean square (<b>RMS)</b> <b>voltage</b> will produce a maximum volume of 100dB.|$|E
2500|$|It is also {{possible}} to put the rectified waveform into a choke-input filter. [...] The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother: current is drawn over the entire cycle, instead of being drawn in pulses at the peaks of AC voltage each half-cycle as in a capacitor input filter. [...] The disadvantage is that the voltage output is much lower – the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak; this is about 90% of the <b>RMS</b> <b>voltage</b> versus [...] times the <b>RMS</b> <b>voltage</b> (unloaded) for a capacitor input filter. [...] Offsetting this is superior voltage regulation and higher available current, which reduce peak voltage and ripple current demands on power supply components. [...] Inductors require cores of iron or other magnetic materials, and add weight and size. [...] Their use in power supplies for electronic equipment has therefore dwindled in favour of semiconductor circuits such as voltage regulators.|$|E

2500|$|The {{unit for}} {{all forms of}} power is the watt (symbol: W), but this unit is {{generally}} reserved for active power. Apparent power is conventionally expressed in volt-amperes (VA) {{since it is the}} product of <b>rms</b> <b>voltage</b> and rms current. The unit for reactive power is expressed as var, which stands for volt-ampere reactive. Since reactive power transfers no net energy to the load, it is sometimes called [...] "wattless" [...] power. It does, however, serve an important function in electrical grids and its lack has been cited as a significant factor in the Northeast Blackout of 2003. Understanding the relationship among these three quantities {{lies at the heart of}} understanding power engineering. The mathematical relationship among them can be represented by vectors or expressed using complex numbers, S=P+jQ (where j is the imaginary unit).|$|E

2500|$|Displays {{having a}} passive-matrix {{structure}} are employing super-twisted nematic STN (invented by Brown Boveri Research Center, Baden, Switzerland, in 1983; scientific details were published) or double-layer STN (DSTN) technology (the latter of which addresses a color-shifting {{problem with the}} former), and color-STN (CSTN) in which color is added by using an internal filter. STN LCDs have been optimized for passive-matrix addressing. They exhibit a sharper threshold of the contrast-vs-voltage characteristic than the original TN LCDs. This is important, because pixels are subjected to partial voltages even while not selected. Crosstalk between activated and non-activated pixels has to be handled properly by keeping the <b>RMS</b> <b>voltage</b> of non-activated pixels below the threshold voltage, while activated pixels are subjected to voltages above threshold (the voltages according to the [...] "Alt & Pleshko" [...] drive scheme) Driving such STN displays according to the Alt & Pleshko drive scheme require very high line addressing voltages. Welzen and de Vaan invented an alternative drive scheme (a non [...] "Alt & Pleshko" [...] drive scheme) requiring much lower voltages, such that the STN display could be driven using low voltage CMOS technologies. [...] STN LCDs have to be continuously refreshed by alternating pulsed voltages of one polarity during one frame and pulses of opposite polarity during the next frame. Individual pixels are addressed by the corresponding row and column circuits. This type of display is called passive-matrix addressed, because the pixel must retain its state between refreshes {{without the benefit of}} a steady electrical charge. As the number of pixels (and, correspondingly, columns and rows) increases, this type of display becomes less feasible. Slow response times and poor contrast are typical of passive-matrix addressed LCDs with too many pixels and driven according to the [...] "Alt & Pleshko" [...] drive scheme. Welzen and de Vaan also invented a non RMS drive scheme enabling to drive STN displays with video rates and enabling to show smooth moving video images on an STN display.

This is of importance when making use of low performance instrumentation where three difficulties may arise: (i) <b>rms</b> <b>voltages</b> rather than the fundamental is used; (ii) the magnitude but not the phase of line-neutral voltages are available; and (iii) voltage values are averaged over a period longer than standards require. The presence of harmonics at normal levels is shown to give negligible error on unbalance calculations. When lineneutral voltages are used, and zero sequence is present, the calculated unbalance can show significant errors under steady state conditions but the error can be much smaller under typical time-varying conditions. When line-line voltages are not available at high sampling rates, the unbalance calculated can be about 40 % too small...|$|R
