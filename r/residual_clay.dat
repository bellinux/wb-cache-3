40|$|The clay {{deposits}} of eastern Washington and northern Idaho are {{along the eastern}} edge of the Columbia River Plateau physiographic province. Three types of clay occur in the area: (a) <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> derived from the Columbia River basalt of Tertiary age; (b) residua. 1 clay derived from the Cretaceous granodiorite and related intrusive rocks of the Idaho batholith; and (c) transported clay. The two types of <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> were formed during a protracted lull in the outpouring of the Columbia River basalt, when the relief of land surface was low to moderate and the climate was warm and humid. The topography and climate during this interval were probably ideal for leaching and oxidation. The transported clay is chiefly a product of the weathered granodiorite and related intrusive rocks. Most of it accumulated in basins formed by damming of streams by basalt flows. Kaolinite and halloysite are the principal clay minerals found in the area. The <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> derived from basalt is chiefly composed of halloysite. Most of this clay is colored blue, gray or grayish black by finely disseminated flmenite and locally it is stained blown by limonite; most of it has a relict basaltic texture. The <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> derived from granodiorite and related intrusive rocks contains both kaolinite and halloysite, and the transported clay is predominantly kaolinite. Both of these clays are white and contain abundant quartz grains and mica flakes. The <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> has a relict granitic texture, and the transported clay has a well-developed bedding and is interbedded with elastic material...|$|E

40|$|Road slips {{are common}} in Northland Allochthon <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> soil, and are {{commonly}} mitigated using deep soil mixing (DSM). A deficiency in laboratory investigations on Northland Allochthon <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> and {{a need for a}} better understanding of the numerical modelling of DSM columns used to mitigate unstable slopes in this soil type is evident in literature, and has been highlighted by practitioners. This research has aimed to fill aspects of these deficiencies. Field testing and classification tests have provided insight into how the soil varies between sites and with depth, and how in situ testing methods compare to one another. Field testing has also demonstrated that soil property changes around DSM columns have been shown to exist through seismic flat plate dilatometer testing before and after column installation, which has not previously been proven using an in situ method. This is important for practitioners who use DSM to demonstrate the additional soil improvements provided by the columns. The testing of reconstituted soil is fundamental in examining soil behaviour, and this study is the first to examine the triaxial behaviour of reconstituted specimens of Northland Allochthon soil. Laboratory triaxial testing and oedometer testing have allowed for a normalized comparison of the intact strength of Northland Allochthon <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> soil to its reconstituted state. This work provides an answer to the important question regarding the role of soil structure in this soil type. It was revealed that soil structure results in increased shear strength of the soil, and that this increase is primarily cohesive in nature. The near coincidence of the post-rupture strength of intact specimens with the critical state angle of internal shearing resistance provides support for its use in examining first time slope failures in this soil type. This is an important finding for practitioners, as it demonstrates the value of testing reconstituted specimens, which are much easier to obtain than high quality intact specimens. In addition, relationships between the plasticity index (PI) of the soil and certain soil parameters (and soil behaviour) have been demonstrated to be relevant and useful for this soil type. Soil properties acquired in this study were tabulated along with those from other field sites in Northland Allochthon soil. It was found that there is significant variation between field sites, likely due to varying degrees of weathering, which is an important consideration for practitioners dealing with this soil type. A brief examination of constitutive models for representation of Northland Allochthon <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> soil have shown that several different models can sufficiently represent the behaviour of this soil. The Mohr-Coulomb model was selected for use in subsequent finite element numerical models. A case study of a road slip at a field site in Northland Allochthon <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> soil, mitigated using DSM columns, revealed that the use of a pre-existing slip surface after first time failure leads to an improved match between observed field behaviour and the behaviour of the slope as exhibited in a numerical model. This type of failure mechanism has not been previously examined in this soil type, and this case study demonstrates it is a useful approach that should be considered when dealing with second time failure in Northland Allochthon slopes. This numerical model also introduces the replacement ratio method (RRM), a technique used to represent the three dimensional (3 D) geometry of the DSM columns in the more commonly used two dimensional (2 D) analysis. Examination of laterally loaded DSM columns in plan view, which has not previously been performed in the context of DSM columns, has illustrated how installation effects and column shape influence load displacement curves, and demonstrates the effects of soil arching. This analysis provides practitioners with evidence that improved soil property changes, found to occur around DSM columns, lead to improved DSM column performance. A simplified 3 D numerical model of laterally loaded DSM columns, which builds on the ideas developed in the previous two 2 D models, has been compared to an identical 2 D model. It is shown that the commonly used RRM results in an overestimation of the resisting force provided by the columns as compared to the 3 D model. However, this does not necessarily imply that the use of the RRM in an analysis will always result in a safe slope. The degree to which its use will affect the results will depend on the slope geometry, location of the DSM columns, and the type of analysis performed (i. e. factor of safety or deformation based). A modification to the RRM has been proposed. It is recommended that when the DSM column diameter and soil properties are similar to those used in this study, the MRRM developed in this study should be utilized. In circumstances where they differ, it is recommended that practitioners perform a sensitivity analysis using the MRRM developed here as a basis for modifying the RRM in order to determine the extent to which their results are influenced. If the influence is significant, the use of a 3 D model should be considered...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} methods were tested for their {{applicability}} {{to the problem}} of determining the content of halloysite in kaolin clays. These analytical methods included the thin-section point-count technique, base-exchange d terminations, electron microscope techniques and infra-red absorption spectra differences. Base-exchange d terminations were made on a number of monodisperse fractions of pure halloysites and kaolinites. Consistent values of 12 meq/ 100 g were obtained for the halloysites and 4 meq/ 100 g for the kaolinites in the size range 1 - 0. 25 micron. Electron micrographs were taken of prepared homogenized mixtures and counts made of the two morphologically different varieties. Application of this technique to several natural halloysitic kaolins, of which the proportions were known by DTA methods, gave good correlative results.

Scanning electron microscope and EDX analyses performed on the black ferromanganese sed-iments show the material to have concentrated considerable amounts of REEs (La, Ce, Sm, Nd) in iron-rich spheres that build up botryoidal-like aggregates.

They include the Mehdiabad, Irankouh and Angouran world-class deposits, as well as the Zarigan and Haft-har deposits. These deposits were formed by supergene oxidation of primary sulfide minerals during the complex interplay of tectonic uplift, karst development, changes in the level of the water table, and weathering. Zn (Pb) carbonates, Zn-hydrosilicates and associated hydrated phases directly replace the primary ore bodies or fill cavities along fractures related to uplift tectonics. Direct replacement of primary sulfides is accompanied by distal precipitation of zinc non-sulfide minerals in cavities or internal sediments filling. The mineralogy of the non-sulfide mineralization in all six deposits is generally complex and consists of smithsonite, hydrozincite, and hemimorphite as the main economic minerals, accompanied by iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides and <b>residual</b> <b>clays.</b> Commonly, non-sulfide minerals in these deposits consist of two types of ore: red zinc ore (RZO), rich in Zn, Fe, Pb-(As) and white zinc ore (WZO), typically with very high zinc grades but low concentrations of iron and lead. Typical minerals of the RZO are Fe-oxyhydroxides, goethite, hematite, hemimorphite, smithsonite and/or hydrozincite and cerussite.

40|$|Karst-bauxite {{deposits}} form as {{a result}} of the accumulation of <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> minerals in depressions on a karst limestone surface, and their subsequent lateritic weathering. Rare earth elements (REE) become concentrated in the bauxite deposits due to crystallisation of authigenic REE-bearing minerals, accumulation of residual phases and the adsorption of ions on clays and other mineral surfaces. REE are concentrated in the red mud waste generated by alumina production from bauxite through the Bayer process. Red muds thus contain on average 900 ppm REE compared with typical values of < 100 ppm to ~ 500 ppm REE in the bauxites. Extraction of REE from red mud has been shown to be feasible although it is challenging due to the heterogeneous spatial distribution of REE in the bauxites and the need for development of appropriate processing methods. With annual European extraction of bauxite estimated to be approximately 3. 5 million tonnes per annum, resulting in approximately 1. 4 million tonnes of red mud from the production of alumina, understanding the REE resource potential of bauxites is integral to the assessment of European REE resources...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Stylolites are {{localized}} dissolution surfaces {{commonly found}} in sedimen-tary rocks. Stylolites have been extensively studied due to their important role in controlling dissolution, precipitation, deformation, and fluid transport in rocks. Field observations indicate that stylolite formation and morphology are strongly correlated both with the surrounding stress and with the distribution of clays within the host rock, yet the mechanism by which they form remains enigmatic. We present results from a newly developed two-dimensional Spring-Network Model that studies stylolite forma-tion by pressure-solution with and without the presence of clays, where clays play a role of enhancing pressure solution. We use our model to test the relative role of stress and clays in controlling the localization of dissolution into stylolites. In contrast to the common paradigm, our results suggest that pressure solution alone, {{in the absence of}} catalyzing clays, does not lead to spontaneous localization of dissolution into stylolites. Instead, we propose a new coupled clay-pressure-solution feedback to localize stylo-lites, a coupling that we observe in our model: a region with a slightly larger clay fraction will experience enhanced dissolution, and will thus accumulate more <b>residual</b> <b>clays,</b> which will act to further enhance pressure solution in that region, and accumu-late even more clays. Stress is a necessary component in this feedback as it controls the direction of stylolite propagation, and facilitates lateral propagation...|$|R

Fluctuations in groundwater chemistry coincided with temporal movement patterns. Low pore-water ion concentrations were apparent immediately before seasonal mudslide reactivation or periods of high activity.

40|$|Abstract — Some <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> soils from southwestern Nigeria {{have been}} {{investigated}} {{with a view to}} elucidating their geotechnical prop-erties and determine the possible variations in these properties in relation to the sampling distance. Eight bulk residual soil samples from two test pits separated 30 m apart at intervals of 0. 5 m up to a depth of 2. 0 m were analyzed in the la-boratory to determine specific gravity, grain size distribution, consistency limits, linear shrinkage, unconfined compressive strength and compaction characteristics. The data generated were subsequently subjected to statistical analysis. The investigations revealed that the soils are generally well graded, inorganic, with medium to high plasticity and hence compressibility and are of the same geologic origin. Statistical T-test showed no significant difference exists between the soils in terms of specific gravity, liquid limit, plastic limit, plasticity index, linear shrinkage, % clay size fraction, amount of fines, unconfined compressive strength and optimum moisture content. However the maximum dry density of the soils from both pits differed significantly. Although most of the parameters examined are not as varied and showed insignificant difference, the equations generated provide an op-tion in the estimation of properties considering the close sampling distance...|$|E

The tropical climatic onditions have caused eep weathering of sandstones and produced a highly plastic clay with low density and a natural moisture content greatly {{in excess of the}} standard compaction optimum. This clay was found to contain halloysite which was 'amorphous ' rather than crystalline. The material was used in this natural state in an 85 -m high rockfill dam at Monasavu Falls as an unusually soft core, the construction of which involved unconventionally light compaction by low-ground-pressure-tracked dozers. Its resulting behaviour in terms of three-dimensional total and effective stresses, stress paths and deformations throughout the construction, impounding and full reservoir stages was closely monitored. This behaviour is examined {{in the light of the}} clay's classification, mineralogical, compaction and engineering properties determined before and during construction. Despite its unusual properties, it is concluded that the clay is a good engineering material, behaving like others containing halloysite in the more common tubular form, and, moreover, that the high natural moisture content is of positive benefit...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{investigation}} {{of the impact of}} injected CO 2 on reservoir mineralogy was completed as part of the geochemical monitoring and modelling of the Pembina Cardium CO 2 Monitoring Project southwest of Drayton Valley, Alberta, Canada. Oil production at the pilot is primarily from the upper two of three stacked sandstone units of the Cardium Formation in the Pembina field. Core analyzed included samples from each of the three sandstone units, and encompassed three distinct time periods: pre-water flood (1955), pre- CO 2 flood (2005), and post- CO 2 flood (2007). The results of whole rock analysis (XRF, ICP, and XRD), and microscopy (polarizing and electron microprobe) suggest the three separate sandstone units are both texturally and compositionally similar regardless of when the core was recovered. Framework grains are predominately sub-angular to sub-rounded quartz/chert (up to 90. 0 wt%), and include smaller amounts of lithic fragments (shale), feldspar (k-feldspar, and albite), mica (muscovite and chlorite), and fluor-apatite. Authigenic pyrite is found as finely disseminated rhombs throughout the formation. Clay minerals present are predominantly kaolinite and illite. Kaolinite appears as fine discrete pore filling books, and is considered to be authigenic. Illite occurs as a major constituent of shale fragments, as well as fine pore bridging strands. The sandstone’s irregular pores are cemented to varying degrees by silica and/or carbonate minerals (calcite and siderite).

The Baquer?

In the low matric suction stage, matric suction mainly contribute to shear strength by affecting the cohesion, yet in the high matric suction stage by increasing both the internal friction angle and cohesion; in the transition matric suction stage, the contribution of cohesion decreases while the contribution of internal friction angle increases.

Ce, due to its redox chemistry, fractionates relative to the other REEs and precipitates as cerianite during Mn 4 + reduction. Mn mineralisation has a different Ce signature as expressed by the Ce anomaly, which varies between 0. 22 and 11. 75. A two-stage model was proposed for explaining the Ce anomaly fluctuations. Precipitation of the samples with positive Ce anomalies occurred in the first stage from organic matter-free fluids which favored the oxidation of cerium on the Mn phase surface; in the second stage, instead, Ce-depleted solutions, resulting from the first stage, were responsible for the precipitation of samples with negative Ce anomalies...|$|R
40|$|Two commercially {{available}} acid-activated montmorillonite clay catalysts, K 5 and K 10, have been characterised by ammonia adsorption microcalorimetry at 150 °C. The adsorption capacities and molar enthalpies of adsorption have been interpreted {{in terms of}} the concentration and strength of surface acid sites. Clays exchanged with Al 3 +, Fe 3 + and Na+ have been examined. Catalytic activities have also been measured, in liquid phase reactions in swelling and non-swelling solvents, and in reactions catalysed by Bronsted and by Lewis acid sites. The relationships between ammonia adsorption characteristics and catalytic activities have been determined. It has been shown that anhydrous ammonia is able to access all acid sites on the clay surface, including those in the <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> interlayer regions which would normally only be accessible {{in the presence of a}} swelling solvent. Ammonia adsorption on clays exchanged with Fe 3 +, where Lewis acidity is maximised, is more extensive and with a higher molar enthalpy of adsorption than on clays maximised for Bronsted acidity. It is concluded that ammonia can be satisfactorily used as a probe of surface acidity when Bronsted acidity dominates but, if there is significant Lewis acidity, ammonia adsorption data is difficult to interpre...|$|E
40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>clay</b> {{deposits}} overlying Precambrian Basement Complex {{situated at}} Orin, Igbara Odo, Ikere and Ado Ekiti were investigated using several analytical techniques. Field evidence supported by mineralogical and physicochemical analyses {{suggests that the}} kaolinitic clay deposits {{is a product of}} hydrothermal and in-situ weathering of aplite, and granite. Kaolinite is the predominant clay mineral of the studied clay deposits with subordinate quartz, potassium iron oxide and aluminium phosphatic minerals. There is localised occurrence of halloysite. The absence of vanadium in the EDS data of rolled into tubes kaolinite sheets of Ado Ekiti clay match up with XRF data. This result trend combined with field observation suggests that clay bodies formed from weathering of feldspar is deficient in vanadium. The study suggests that morphology of kaolinitic minerals is influenced by the kind of parent material (i. e. feldspars or micas) and degree of chemical weathering. The pH values of pore water from clay samples range from 7. 14 - 9. 08. The electrical conductivities (EC) of the clay/water slurries (S/L ratio) range from 0. 004 mS/cm – 3. 02 mS/cm. The oxidation reduction potential (ORP) values range between- 62. 4 and – 6. 8 for the solids or slurries prepared with water. The dissolved oxygen (DO...|$|E
40|$|In the paper, the {{development}} of an expansive <b>residual</b> <b>clay</b> soil profile weathering from a Permian mudstone is described. The characteristics considered include soil mineralogy, soil chemistry, soil texture and engineering parameters including expansive potential. The effects of weathering are shown to be most evident in {{the development}} of a series of texturally distinct soil horizons. It is shown that the chemical and mineralogical characteristics of the parent mudstone are very similar to those of its derived expansive clay soils, even though the expansive potential in the clay soil is almost twice as great as in the parent mudstone. The origins of an enhanced expansive potential in the B horizon are explored, and it is found that, for the weathering of a mudstone in a temperate climate, the effects of weathering on structure are more important than the effects of weathering on mineralogy. It is concluded that most of the smectite clays in the weathered clay soils were inherited from the parent mudstone (with little or no transformation) and that these clay components were likely to have been present in the sediments from which the mudstone formed. The enhanced expansive potential in the residual clays is attributed to the physical effects of weathering in breaking down structure and/or bonding in the parent rock, which reduces the potential expansiveness of the clays contained in the parent rock. This proposal is supported by experimental evidence...|$|E
40|$|Isotopic {{composition}} and concentrations of Pb {{are used to}} identify sources of anthropogenic and natural Pb and to assess Pb bioavailability in soils and native plants at a former military installation {{that served as a}} WWII era aerial gunnery range. Surficial soil and plant samples are obtained both in target practice areas where copious amounts of bullets persist and areas unaffected by target practice that are devoid of bullets. A selective sequential extraction procedure is used to determine the distribution of Pb amongst different soil components: soil carbonates and ion-exchangeable minerals, organics, oxide and hydroxide minerals, and leachate of <b>residual</b> silicate <b>clays.</b> Plants samples are obtained by sampling multiple species within 1 m square area for each soil sample location. Isotopic compositions of samples directly reflect {{the presence or absence of}} bullets in the sample area. Anthropogenic Pb in sample locations with abundant bullets display a wide range of ^(206) Pb/^(207) Pb values (1. 140 ? 1. 234), but relatively less variation in ^(206) Pb/^(208) Pb values (0. 473 ? 0. 488), which is hypothesized to be reflective of ore-mixing in the manufacture of bullets. Plant samples exhibit a distinction between anthropogenic and natural Pb similar to soil samples, but consistently display lighter ^(206) Pb/^(207) Pb values than soil samples, which is inferred to be representative of the influence of regional atmospheric deposition of contaminant Pb...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSupergene non-sulfide Zn {{deposits}} offer high mineralogical diversity including clayminerals {{that can}} incorporate {{significant amounts of}} Zn like sauconite. Although clayeymaterial is commonly observed in such ore deposits, its nature and origin have beenrarely studied, especially in carbonate-hosting environments. However the role of clayminerals is essential for mineral processing because they usually have a negative impacton zinc recovery. In this work, {{we focus on the}} Bou Arhous Zn-Pb ore deposit in Eastern High Atlas,Morocco. This deposit is located in an anticline formed by Lower Jurassic limestoneand marl, with Upper Triassic shale in the core of the anticline. Zn-rich clayey materialfills karstic cavities and two types of clay rich deposits have been identified field: 1) white to ochre granular clay (kaolinite/smectite (K/S) irregular mixed layers, smectiteand illite) and 2) red smooth clay (kaolinite, chlorite, illite). The white to ochre granularclays are closely associated with supergene willemite (zinc silicate), one of the main Znbearing mineral phases of the Bou Arhous deposit. The red smooth clays fillkarst-related cavities cutting across the non-sulfide mineralized bodies. The red smoothclays present evidence of stratification that reflects internal sedimentation processesduring karst evolution. Bulk chemical analyses reveal that the Zn content is highlyvariable in all clayey samples and even can reach several percent. This enrichment maybe due to fine inclusions of zinc silicate or carbonate in the clayey material, or to theoccurrence of Zn clay minerals (i. e. sauconite). The mineralogy of clays and associated minerals in bulk powders and separated < 2 μmoriented fractions from the two types of clay deposits and from surrounding Triassic toLower Jurassic rocks has been investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysescomplemented by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observations, have allowed usto identify the nature of the clay minerals and to characterize the textural relationshipsbetween clays and other zinc-bearing minerals like willemite. In a few samples withhigh zinc content (5 %), bulk XRD analyses do not reveal the occurrence of zincsulphides, carbonates or silicates, suggesting that zinc is associated with clay minerals. Preliminary XRD results indicate that white and ochre clays are composed ofkaolinite/smectite (K/S) irregular mixed layers with up to 20 % of smectite in somesamples; smectite, illite and chlorite are also present. On the other hand, the red clayscontain kaolinite, chlorite, illite, and illite/smectite mixed layers (goethite is commonlypresent in these samples). SEM observations demonstrated that willemite crystals arepartially dissolved and are surrounded by authigenic clay minerals. Microprobeanalyses and cation-exchange capacity on clay mineral fractions are currentlyperformed to highlight the localization of zinc within the structure of clay minerals, andto provide crucial information on Zn recovery potential of the studied deposit. All thesenew results will enable characterizing Zn speciation in these supergene deposits tocheck the following hypotheses for clay origin: 1) interactions between Zn-rich solutiondue to supergene oxidation and <b>residual</b> <b>clays</b> originated from dissolution oflimestone-dominated host rocks, 2) secondary alteration of Zn minerals like willemiteinto clay minerals, and 3) reaction between detrital clays and Zn-rich solutions...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that the <b>residual</b> {{strength}} of <b>clays</b> is, to a large extent, determined by the type of clay minerals and the chemistry of the constituent pore water. Changes in either of these factors cause corresponding alterations in residual shear strength. The findings have important implications for the seasonal reactivation of landslides and may also provide an explanation for the long-term weathering and shear strength reduction of clay slopes. Results are presented here to demonstrate the separate effects of clay mineralogy and pore water chemistry upon the residual strength of pure and natural clays. Explanations are sought to identify the controls of these factors upon residual strength based on brief reviews of the shear strength and physico-chemical behaviour of clays. The findings strongly suggest that residual strength should be considered a dynamic property, with increases or decreases in strength occurring in response to environmental change...|$|R
