2500|$|The {{company was}} founded as Binney and Smith by cousins Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith in New York City on March 31, 1885. Initial {{products}} were colorants for industrial use, including <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> pigments used in barn paint and carbon black chemicals used for making tires black and extending their useful lifespan. Binney & Smith's new {{process of creating}} inexpensive black colorants was entered into the chemistry industries competition at the 1900 Paris Exposition under the title [...] "carbon gas blacks, lamp or oil blacks, 'Peerless' black" [...] and earned the company a gold medal award in chemical and pharmaceutical arts. Also in 1900, the company added production of slate school pencils. Binney's experimentation with industrial materials, including slate waste, cement, and talc, led to {{the invention of the}} first dustless white chalk, for which the company won a gold medal at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair.|$|E
50|$|Iron is {{commonly}} used as a colorant in its <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> form as (Fe2O3). <b>Red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> {{is commonly}} used to produce earthy reds and browns. It is the metal responsible for making earthenwares red. Iron is also another tricky colorant because {{of its ability to}} yield different colors under different circumstances. At low percentages (.5-1%) and in the presence of potassium, iron will become light blue or light blue-green in reduction (as is seen in traditional celadons). In the presence of barium, iron may become yellow green. When used in combination with calcium, <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> can become pale yellow or amber in oxidation or green in reduction. Common percentages for <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> range from (4 up to 10%).|$|E

40|$|The raised {{substrates}} of gilding decorations, called lāyachīnīī in Persian, {{were widely}} {{used throughout the}} Safavid period (1501 - 1736 AD) in Iran. This paper presents the first analytical data obtained from the lāyachīnīs of three sev-enteenth century royal Safavid buildings (ʿĀlī-Qāpū, Chihil-Sutūn, and Hasht-Bihisht) in Isfahan, Iran, using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, X-ray powder diffraction, and thin layer chro-matography. According to the analytical data, different forms of calcium sulfate (dihydrate, β-hemihydrate, and anhydrite), the <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> and a proteinaceous binder (probably animal glue) are the main constituents of the raised lāyachīnī substrates. The results show that a dry mixture of the plaster of Paris and the <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> are mixed with diluted ani-mal glue to obtain a slurry to be applied in sev-eral layers, one top of the another, to achieve the raised substrates. This technique is simi-lar to those European raised pastiglia sub-strates although the method of the preparation in the Persian technique {{is different from the}} European one...|$|R

50|$|Inside cave 13B at Pinnacle Point, an archeological site {{found on}} the coast of South Africa, paleoanthropologists in 2000 found {{evidence}} that, between 170,000 and 40,000 years ago, Late Stone Age people were scraping and grinding ochre, a clay colored <b>red</b> by <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> probably with the intention of using it to color their bodies.|$|R
50|$|Heliotrope is a green {{variety of}} chalcedony, {{containing}} <b>red</b> inclusions of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> that resemble drops of blood, giving heliotrope its alternative name of bloodstone. In a similar variety, the spots are yellow instead, known as plasma.|$|R
5000|$|The first colors used by {{man were}} <b>red,</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (hematite, {{a form of}} red ochre) and black. The word hematite, the source of many iron oxide pigments, {{is derived from the}} Greek word, [...] "haima", meaning blood, and because of its {{symbolic}} and spiritual significance, early man coveted this color.|$|E
50|$|A pigment, such as <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (rust) {{is simply}} an {{oxidized}} form of iron. One could leave iron, lead, or gold in the sun for a million years and they would never change color or change into another substance. In contrast, man-made synthetic and vegetable water-soluble dyes can fade rapidly, often within one to six months.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} use of mica {{has been}} found in cave paintings created during the Upper Paleolithic period (40,000 BC to 10,000 BC). The first hues were <b>red</b> (<b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> hematite, or red ochre) and black (manganese dioxide, pyrolusite), though black from juniper or pine carbons has also been discovered. White from kaolin or mica was used occasionally.|$|E
2500|$|Terrestrial {{life in the}} Permian {{included}} diverse plants, fungi, arthropods, {{and various}} types of tetrapods. The period saw a massive desert covering the interior of Pangaea. The warm zone spread in the northern hemisphere, where extensive dry desert appeared. [...] The rocks formed at that time were stained <b>red</b> by <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> the result of intense heating by the sun of a surface devoid of vegetation cover. [...] A number of older types {{of plants and animals}} died out or became marginal elements.|$|R
30|$|For the {{characterization}} of the parchment only rFTIR spectrometry provided some information about the manufacturing process and treatment of the different folios, e.g., the identification of calcium carbonates and silicates {{on the surface of}} the parchment. CaCO 3 is an indicator for the liming or whitening of the animal skin, the silicates are due to polishing the surface with pumice. The combination of XRF and Raman spectrometry enabled {{the characterization}} of black/brown inks in the text as iron gall ink as well as vermilion and red lead as red inks in the initials of both codices. In some of the black/brown inks oxalates were detected by rFTIR, which indicates degradation of the binding media by mold fungi. The use of complementary methods allowed the identification of typical pigments in illuminations such as lead white, orpiment/realgar, red lead, vermilion and <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> as well as azurite and indigo, together with the rather rare copper chloride hydroxide. The experimental results showed as well that the same palette was used throughout the entire codex.|$|R

Brown iron oxide exhibits unusual burn rate acceleration properties under pressure.|$|E
50|$|Ceramic {{colorants}} {{are added}} to a glaze or a clay to create color. Carbonates and oxides of certain metals, characterize most colorants including the commonly used cobalt carbonate, cobalt oxide, chrome oxide, <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> and copper carbonate. These colorants can create a multitude of colors depending on other materials they interact with and to which temperature and in which atmosphere they are fired.|$|E
50|$|There was no free {{oxygen in}} earth’s {{atmosphere}} till about 2000 million years ago, {{but there were}} photosynthesizing cyanobacteria. The oxygen these microorganisms produced rapidly reacted with, amongst others, any dissolved iron compounds in the water, producing insoluble <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (rust), which precipitated out during the daylight hours. At night these reactions stopped. The result was alternating red and gray layers of mud which, when consolidated, became banded ironstones.|$|E
50|$|Dubai lies {{directly}} {{within the}} Arabian Desert. However, the topography of Dubai is {{significantly different from}} that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country. The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine, clean and white. East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as sabkha, give way to a north-south running line of dunes. Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged <b>red</b> with <b>iron</b> <b>oxide.</b>|$|R
50|$|Polyhalite is an {{evaporite}} mineral, a hydrated sulfate of potassium, {{calcium and}} magnesium with formula: K2Ca2Mg(SO4)4·2H2O. Polyhalite crystallizes in the triclinic system, although crystals are very rare. The normal habit is massive to fibrous. It is typically colorless, white to gray, {{although it may}} be brick <b>red</b> due to <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> inclusions. It has a Mohs hardness of 3.5 and a specific gravity of 2.8.|$|R

50|$|The {{heads of}} the serpents have holes for eyes, and {{remaining}} traces of beeswax and resin may have once held objects representing eyes, possibly orbs of iron pyrite (Fool's Gold). The vivid contrast of the red and white details on the head have been made from oyster shell and conch shell respectively. Cleverly, the adhesive used to attach the Spondylus shell has been colored with <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (hematite) to complete the design. The white shell used for the teeth comes from shells of the edible queen conch.|$|E
50|$|The tomb at {{the base}} of the {{succession}} contained a human skeleton, that of Chancelade man. This find differs considerably from the Cro-Magnon Man. The skeleton was resting on its left side and the knees were drawn to the torso. The left hand was covered by the skull, and the right hand touched the chin. The corpse must have been sprinkled with <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> powder (ochre), because the bones are stained red. This species of a homo sapiens sapiens is now kept in the Musée du Périgord.|$|E
5000|$|Phos-Chek fire retardants are {{manufactured}} as dry powders or as concentrated liquids and diluted with water prior to use. [...] The retardant is applied ahead of wildfires to homes and vegetation by ground crews and aerial firefighting units, either fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft. [...] It is currently produced as several colors, including an off-white color, <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> and a fugitive mixture that is colored red when dispersed but gradually fades to an earth-tone {{when exposed to}} sunlight. [...] The red color aids aircrews in targeting drops of retardant.|$|E
50|$|Red, {{black and}} white were the first colors used by artists in the Upper Paleolithic age, {{probably}} because natural pigments such as <b>red</b> ochre and <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> were readily available where early people lived. Madder, a plant whose root could {{be made into a}} red dye, grew widely in Europe, Africa and Asia. The cave of Altamira in Spain has a painting of a bison colored with red ochre that dates to between 15,000 and 16,500 BC.|$|R
50|$|Products {{coated with}} lacquer are {{recognizable}} by an extremely durable and glossy finish. Lacquer has many uses; some common applications include tableware, musical instruments, fountain pens, jewelry, and bows. There are {{various types of}} lacquerware. The cinnabar-red is highly regarded. Unpigmented lacquer is dark brown but the most common colors of urushiol finishes are black and <b>red,</b> from powdered <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> pigments of ferrous-ferric oxide (magnetite) and ferric oxide (rust), respectively. Lacquer is painted on with a brush and is cured in a warm and humid environment.|$|R
