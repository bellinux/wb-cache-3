5|$|Since {{both the}} {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a <b>reducing</b> <b>agent.</b> In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong <b>reducing</b> <b>agent,</b> the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low.|$|E

5|$|To extract plutonium, neutron-irradiated uranium is {{dissolved}} in nitric acid, and a <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> (FeSO4, or H2O2) {{is added to}} the resulting solution. This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4, while uranium remains in the form of uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2). The solution is treated with a <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> and neutralized with ammonium carbonate to pH = 8 that results in precipitation of Pu4+ compounds.|$|E
50|$|Forming {{aldehydes}} from {{carboxylic acid}} derivatives {{is often a}} challenge, because weaker <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> (NaBH4) are incapable of reducing esters and carboxylic acids, which are relatively stable, and stronger <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> (LiAlH4) immediately <b>reduce</b> the formed aldehyde to an alcohol.|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the reduction rate under irradiation can be modified by using the appropriate solvent. The <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> are the key parameters that can affect the speed of reduction and therefore the particle size and distribution. The hydrated electrons (E 0 [*]=[*]- 2.9 VNHE), produced by water radiolysis, are stronger <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> than 2 -propyl radicals. The existence of different <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> in the media varies the speed of reduction that makes a broad size distribution.|$|R
50|$|Carbonyl reduction, the net {{addition}} of H2 across a carbon-oxygen double bond, is a straightforward way to generate alcohols. Stoichiometric <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> {{to accomplish this}} task include lithium aluminium hydride, sodium borohydride, alkoxy borohydrides, alkoxy aluminium hydrides, and boranes. Initial efforts toward enantioselective ketone reductions focused {{on the development of}} chiral, non-racemic <b>reducing</b> <b>agents.</b> Although stoichiometric chiral <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> often afford products with high enantioselectivity, the necessity of a stoichiometric amount of chiral material is a disadvantage of these reagents.|$|R
5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and <b>reducing</b> <b>agent,</b> the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{americium}} {{is obtained}} by reduction from its compounds. Americium(III) fluoride {{was first used}} for this purpose. The reaction was conducted using elemental barium as <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> in a water- and oxygen-free environment inside an apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Titanium(III) and titanium(II) also form stable {{chloride}}s. A notable {{example is}} titanium(III) chloride (TiCl3), {{which is used}} as a catalyst for production of polyolefins (see Ziegler-Natta catalyst) and a <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> in organic chemistry.|$|E

40|$|The <b>reducing</b> <b>agents,</b> {{potassium}} ferrocyanide, β-mercaptoethylamine, cysteine, reduced DPN, ferrous sulfate, methyl viologen and {{ascorbic acid}} caused the expansion in darkness of disks of primary leaf tissue cut from dark-grown bean plants. The <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> interacted synergistically with low irradiances of red radiation and additively with high irradiance of red light. Exposure of disks treated with <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> to far red light repressed disk expansion and the decay in sensitivity to far red radiation showed {{the same time}} relations as sequential exposure to red and far red radiation...|$|R
5|$|H. aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of oxalic acid, a <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> and {{relatively}} strong acid. This stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, and influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.|$|E
5|$|Many metals are geologically most {{abundant}} as ionic compounds within ores. To obtain the elemental materials, these ores are processed by smelting or electrolysis, in which redox reactions occur (often with a <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> such as carbon) {{such that the}} metal ions gain electrons to become neutral atoms.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{disulfide}} {{consists of}} 8-membered rings. It has an approximate composition of SeS2, with individual rings varying in composition, such as Se4S4 and Se2S6.

5|$|From the hydride {{electron}} pair, one electron {{is transferred}} to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The midpoint potential of the NAD/NADH redox pair is −0.32volts, which makes NADH a strong <b>reducing</b> <b>agent.</b> The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD. This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD and NADH forms without being consumed.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of oxalic acid—a <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> and {{relatively}} strong acid—into the soil around its woody substrate. This chemical stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, as the organic matter in soil breaks down into smaller molecules. This influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.|$|E
5|$|Iron(II) sulfate {{is used as}} a {{precursor}} to other iron compounds. It is also used to reduce chromate in cement. It is used to fortify foods and treat iron deficiency anemia.

5|$|Many organosodium {{compounds}} {{have been}} prepared. Because {{of the high}} polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of carbanions (salts with organic anions). Some well known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide (NaC5H5) and trityl sodium ((C6H5)3CNa). Because of the large size and very low polarising power of the Na+ cation, it can stabilize large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as in sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong <b>reducing</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mercury dissolves {{many other}} metals such as {{gold and silver}} to form amalgams. Iron is an exception, and iron flasks have {{traditionally}} been used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals {{with the exception of}} manganese, copper and zinc are reluctant to form amalgams.

Sodium amalgam is a common <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps.|$|E
5|$|Samarium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolSm and atomic number62. It is a moderately hard silvery metal that readily oxidizes in air.

5|$|The hot carbon {{monoxide}} is the <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> for the iron ore and reacts with the iron oxide to produce molten iron and carbon dioxide.

5|$|Tin(II) chloride, {{also known}} as stannous chloride, is a white {{crystalline}} solid with the formula 2.
