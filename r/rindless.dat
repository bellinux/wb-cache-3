In 1949, partnering with four independent plants and with financing arranged through First National Bank, the Tillamook Cheese Factory north of Tillamook was built. The enlarged facility included a storage plant and traffic department.|$|E
5000|$|Bocconcini ( [...] ; {{singular}} Bocconcino, [...] ) {{are small}} mozzarella cheeses {{the size of}} an egg. Like other mozzarellas, they are semi-soft, white and <b>rindless</b> unripened mild cheeses which originated in Naples and were once made only from milk of water buffalo. Nowadays they are usually made from a combination of water buffalo and cow's milk. Bocconcini are packaged in whey or water, have a spongy texture and absorb flavours.|$|E
50|$|Brined cheese, also {{sometimes}} referred to as pickled cheese for some varieties, is cheese that is matured in a solution of brine in an airtight or semi-permeable container. This process gives the cheese good stability, inhibiting bacterial growth even in warmer climates. Brined cheeses may be soft or hard, varying in moisture content, and in colour and flavour, according to the type of milk used; though all will be <b>rindless,</b> and generally taste clean, salty and acidic when fresh, developing some piquancy when aged, and most will be white.|$|E
50|$|Friulano is {{the name}} of a firm cow's milk cheese made in Canada named after the Friuli region of Italy. It is <b>rindless</b> and interior-ripened with a yellow surface and interior. It is salty and tastes {{slightly}} of hazelnut. It is sometimes called Italian Cheddar, though it is not cheddared and does not taste like a Cheddar. It closely resembles Italian Montasio cheese which it strives to imitate, but has a different name since, in Canada, the name Montasio can only be used for cheeses made in the Montasio mountains of the Friuli region of Italy.|$|E

50|$|Körborn’s kermis (church consecration festival) is held on {{the last}} weekend in June. Other customs are, as in all {{surrounding}} villages, Fastnacht (Shrovetide Carnival), the raising of the Maypole and the May Day dance and the Whitsuntide Pﬁngstquack (“Whitsun” is Pﬁngsten in German). The —quack part of the custom’s name refers to a rhyme that children recite as they go door to door begging for money with their gorse-decked wagon. The rhyme generally begins with the line “Quack, Quack, Quack”. On the eve of May Day (which to some is Walpurgis Night), the municipality lays out a meal at the village community centre with Wellﬂeisch mit Sauerkraut (a boiled-meat dish containing, according to one source, <b>rindless</b> pork belly, water, salt, pepper, dried marjoram and onion) fresh from the boiling pot and original Körborn Hausmacher Schlachtplatte (the ﬁrst word means that it is “homemade”), along with the obligatory beer straight from the keg.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of ripening proces on moisture in fat-freematter and fat content of Trappist cheese has been investigated. In dairy company (Lura, Bjelovar) the natural ripening process of rind Trappist cheese occurs. Afterwards, the cheese is packaged into shrinkable plastic pouch and the <b>rindless</b> cheese is produced. The obtained results are statistically processed. The above mentioned ripening process has a significant influence on moisture content of the fat-free matter and is 5. 34 % higher for the Trappist cheese in plastic pouch in comparison to rind Trappist cheese, while the fat content is 6. 13 higher for the rind Trappist cheese...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractCrystals in cheese may be {{considered}} defects or positive features, depending on the variety and mode of production (industrial, artisanal). Powder x-ray diffractometry (PXRD) offers a simple means to identify and resolve complex combinations of crystals that contribute to cheese characteristics. The objective of the present research was to demonstrate the application of PXRD to study crystals {{from a range of}} different cheese types, specifically Cheddar, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Gouda, and soft washed-rind (smear ripened) cheeses. In studies of Parmigiano-Reggiano and long-aged Gouda, PXRD has confirmed that hard (crunchy) crystals that form abundantly within these cheeses consist of tyrosine. Furthermore, PXRD has tentatively identified the presence of an unusual form of crystalline leucine in large (up to 6  mm in diameter) spherical entities, or “pearls”, that occur abundantly in 2 -year-old Parmigiano Reggiano and long-aged Gouda cheeses, and on the surface of <b>rindless</b> hard Italian-type cheese. Ongoing investigations into the nature of these “pearls” are providing new insight into the roles that crystals play in the visual appearance and texture of long-aged cheeses. Crystals also sometimes develop profusely in the eyes of long-aged Gouda, which have been shown by PXRD to consist of tyrosine and the aforementioned presumptive form of crystalline leucine. Finally, crystals have been shown by PXRD to form in the smears of soft washed-rind cheeses. These crystals may be associated in some cheeses with gritty mouth feel and with zonal body softening that occurs during ripening. Heightened interest in artisanal cheeses highlights the need to better understand crystals and their contributions to cheese characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The {{optimization}} {{of powder}} x-ray diffraction (PXRD) {{for the study}} of cheese crystals was the focus of this study. A survey was conducted of various manifestations of calcium lactate crystals on the <b>rindless</b> surface and within mechanical openings of Cheddar cheese using PXRD. The diffraction reference card database contained a card that was entitled calcium lactate pentahydrate and corresponded to some of the crystalline material found on the cheeses. Diffractions patterns generated from other samples of crystalline material revealed the existence of an unknown crystal that resembled and behaved similarly to calcium lactate pentahydrate, but did not match the reference card. The existence of two enantiomeric variants of calcium lactate pentahydrate had been firmly established; an experiment was thus designed to determine if the unknown diffraction pattern represented one enantiomeric form, and if the ambiguously named reference card represented the other. This experiment demonstrated that the existing reference card corresponded to calcium DL-lactate pentahydrate and that the unknown diffraction pattern was generated from calcium L-lactate pentahydrate. This study resulted in the proposal of a new reference card for calcium L-lactate pentahydrate and the proposed renaming of the existing card to calcium DL-lactate pentahydrate. This discovery allows the rapid identification of both forms of calcium lactate that form in and on cheese. In order to conduct the survey and experiment that are described above, the PXRD method needed to be adjusted for use with cheese crystals. Samples of cheese crystals pose a particular challenge because they are often composed of high proportions of moisture, fat, protein, and other amorphous material; these all disrupt the efficient diffraction of crystals and thus needed to be removed or minimized. The removal of water from samples is a particular challenge because some cheese crystals contain water of hydration that may be driven off in the process, thereby destroying the crystals. A protocol for the preparation of cheese samples for PXRD was consequently developed...|$|E
