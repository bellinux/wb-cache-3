500|$|The Government Accountability Office ("GAO") {{published}} its own {{report in}} November 2005 (herein, the [...] "GAO study"). [...] The report examined {{trends in the}} use of seller-funded down-payment assistance, its impact on home prices, the performance of the FHA insured loans that had received this assistance, and the standards used by the FHA for approving and monitoring these loans. [...] Its findings generally corroborated those of the earlier government <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>studies.</b> [...] Specifically, the GAO found that (i) the percentage of FHA insured loans that had received down-payment assistance from nonprofit organizations was increasing and that, by 2004, they accounted for approximately one in every three new loans insured by the FHA, (ii) the seller-funded programs created an [...] "indirect stream" [...] of funds from sellers to buyers that caused the home buyers to pay higher prices, and (iii) loans that received down-payment assistance had higher delinquency and default rates than those that did not receive it (and that seller-funded down-payment assistance programs comprised about 95% of all FHA insured loans that received any type of down-payment assistance from a nonprofit organization). [...] Although the report did not focus on any particular program, it did identify Nehemiah as one of the three programs that accounted for most of the seller-funded down-payment assistance found in FHA insured loans.|$|E
