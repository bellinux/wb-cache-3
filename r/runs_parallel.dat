5|$|A levee, floodbank or stopbank is an {{elongated}} natural ridge or artificially constructed dirt fill wall that regulates water levels. It is usually earthen and often <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> {{to the course}} of a river in its floodplain or along low-lying coastlines.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the M-118 {{designation}} was decommissioned and {{the highway}} was renumbered M-222 to prevent confusion with 118th street which <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to the route about one mile (1.6km) {{to the north}} {{for most of the}} length.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opinion on}} the {{proposed}} project was split. Many residents supported the project, stating it would improve {{the safety of the}} highway; however, others believed that the reduction in lanes would result in increased traffic on Culver Road, which <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to NY590 through Irondequoit, and that the roundabouts would make navigating the highway difficult.|$|E
5|$|The Tombs Run and Muncy Creek Anticline <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to {{the creek}} through {{northern}} Penn Township, Lycoming County and also enters Sullivan County near the creek. The creek also has a cliff known as Picture Rock on it. An area of boulders on the creek forms a Class 2 rapid. There is a levee on Muncy Creek in Hughesville.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Rogers County, {{the next}} county along US-412 is Mayes County. South of Chouteau, the route {{provides}} access to US-69 via an interchange. Just west of US-412's crossing of the Grand River, the highway intersects SH-412B, which connects US-412 to SH-69A. After crossing the river, US-412 comes to {{a fork in the}} road; one half of the fork is the Cherokee Turnpike, which mainline US-412 follows, while the other is US-412 Alternate, which <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to the turnpike on an old alignment of US-412.|$|E
5|$|As a two-lane roadway, M-199 {{starts at}} exit119 along I-94 {{northwest}} of Albion in Sheridan Township. The highway runs southward through farm fields along 26Mile Road before curving {{to the southwest}} on Star Commonwealth Road near {{the campus of the}} Montcalm School for Boys and Girls, a private boarding school. At the end of this curves, the highway follows 25½Mile Road southward to the intersection with Michigan Avenue. There M-199 turns easterly along Michigan Avenue and passes south of Montcalm Lake. The trunkline <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to a line of the Norfolk Southern Railway until about the intersection with 26½Mile Road. At the intersection with 27Mile Road, M-199 enters the city of Albion, and the street name changes to Austin Avenue. In town, the highway follows a four-lane street through residential neighborhoods. The trunkline passes the northern edge of McAuliffe Park and <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to the Kalamazoo River. At the intersection with Eaton Street, the highway meets BL I-94, where M-199 ends while the business loop continues southeasterly on Austin Avenue at this corner.|$|E
5|$|As the {{trunkline}} heads {{away from}} Bay City, it <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to the Lake State Railway again. M-13 intersects {{the northern end}} of its connector route before Huron Road crosses the Kawkawlin River. The highway runs through the community of the same name {{on the north side of}} the river. M-13 and Huron Road continue north across mixed agricultural and forest land as they pass through the communities of Linwood and Pinconning. South of Standish in Arenac County, M-13 meets {{the northern end of}} the US23 freeway and terminates.|$|E

50|$|Natural navigation, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} pilotage, involves orienting by naturally observable phenomena, such as sunlight, water movement, bottom composition (for example, sand ripples <b>run</b> <b>parallel</b> to {{the direction of}} the wave front, which tends to <b>run</b> <b>parallel</b> to the shore), bottom contour and noise. Although natural navigation is taught on courses, developing the skills is generally more a matter of experience.|$|R

5|$|For {{the next}} several miles, NY33 <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to the Thruway and very close to it, with both roads visible from the other. Much of this section of Lancaster has {{remained}} rural in character; however, that began {{to change in the}} mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional supermarket chain headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a site near the Gunnville Road intersection for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of a traffic light and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E
5|$|From Eastham {{the canal}} <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to, {{and along the}} south side of the Mersey estuary, past Ellesmere Port. Between Rixton east of the M6 motorway's Thelwall Viaduct and Irlam, the canal joins the Mersey; {{thereafter}} it roughly follows the route the river used to take. At the confluence of the Mersey and Irwell near Irlam, the canal follows the old course of the River Irwell into Manchester.|$|E
5|$|From the {{crossing}} south of Davison, I-96 <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to Grand River Avenue southeasterly with eight lanes total. The two run together {{as far as}} the interchange with I-94 (Edsel Ford Freeway) near Bishop Park. I-96 turns more south-southeasterly there through residential neighborhoods on Detroit's southeastern side. I-96 terminates at an interchange that connects it to I-75 (Fisher Freeway) and to the Ambassador Bridge.|$|E

GateKeeper uses the Fast Lane queuing system; visitors can buy a wristband that allows them to wait in a shorter line.|$|E
5|$|I-75 takes a {{more direct}} route between Indian River and Mackinaw City. M-27 follows old US27 through Topinabee and Cheboygan. With US23 it is a scenic, if indirect, {{alternative}} to I-75 on its approach to the Mackinac Bridge. M-27 runs along the western shore of Mullett Lake and forms {{the main street of}} Topinabee. The highway intersects M-33 near the confluence of the Cheboygan and Black rivers. North of the M-33 junction, M-27 <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to the Cheboygan River on the west river bank into downtown Cheboygan.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 and 1986, {{legislation}} was proposed to restore commuter service between New Haven and New London, {{as well as}} between New Haven and Hartford. A 1986 ConnDOT study analyzed congestion on Interstate 95, which <b>runs</b> <b>parallel</b> to the line. The study showed that Old Saybrook was a better terminus for initial service, with an expected ridership of 420 riders in each direction daily.|$|E
