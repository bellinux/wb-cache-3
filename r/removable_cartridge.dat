5000|$|Optical Disc Archive is {{a storage}} {{technology}} that {{was introduced by}} the Sony Corporation. It uses <b>removable</b> <b>cartridges,</b> where each cartridge holds 12 optical discs. Each of the internal optical discs is similar to, but not compatible with, a Blu-ray disc. The latest version of the cartidge, that has a total capacity of about 3.3TB, uses discs that hold about 300GB each. The technology was publicly announced [...] on 16 April 2012 during the NAB Show with the first units shipping in February 2013.|$|R
50|$|Older drives {{typically}} rotated {{far more}} slowly and had larger heads flying higher {{above the surface}} of the medium. However, since in many cases, the medium was housed in a <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> or pack and since air filtration was comparatively crude, crashes were fairly frequent and invariably expensive.|$|E
5000|$|For {{battlefield}} surveillance, {{the tank}} no longer used simple slots, known as “broneglaz”. Initially it was {{planned to use}} [...] "stroboscopic" [...] instruments of the type used on the tank made by E.Grote (TG), but bulletproof glass of the “Simplex- triplex” type, with easily <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> clips, was used instead.|$|E
5000|$|A {{non-removable}} RK05F {{was also}} produced. By [...] "fixing" [...] the otherwise <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> in place, {{it was able}} to avoid the cartridge-to-cartridge compatibility problems that limited the capacity of the ordinary RK05. As a result, it could operate at twice the normal track density, doubling the capacity of the drive to about 5MB.|$|E
50|$|Additionally the <b>removable</b> {{hard disk}} <b>cartridges</b> {{included}} a 5-year warranty.|$|R
5000|$|Programs {{for small}} {{computers}} {{of the time}} were generally stored on cassette tapes, floppy disks, or paper tape. By the early 1970s, Hewlett-Packard manufactured desktop computers costing thousands of dollars such as the HP 9830, which packaged Read Only Memory (ROM) into <b>removable</b> <b>cartridges</b> to add special programming features, and these were being considered for use in games. At first, the design {{was not going to}} be cartridge-based, but after seeing a [...] "fake" [...] cartridge system on another machine, they realized they could place the games on cartridges essentially for the price of the connector and packaging.|$|R
40|$|The Electronic Still Camera (ESC) {{project will}} {{provide for the}} capture and {{transmission}} of high-quality images {{without the use of}} film. The image quality will be superior to video and will approach the quality of 35 mm film. The camera, which will have the same general shape and handling as a 35 mm camera, will be able to send images to earth in near real-time. Images will be stored in computer memory (RAM) in <b>removable</b> <b>cartridges</b> readable by a computer. To save storage space, the image will be compressed and reconstructed at the time of viewing. Both lossless and loss-y image compression algorithms are studied, described, and compared...|$|R
5000|$|The IBM 2310 <b>Removable</b> <b>Cartridge</b> Drive was {{announced}} in 1964 with the IBM 1800, and then in 1965 with the IBM 1130; it likely first shipped with the 1130 in late 1965. It could store 512,000 16-bit words (1,024,000 bytes) per side on an IBM 2315 cartridge. A single 14 in oxide-coated aluminum disk spun in a plastic shell with openings for the read/write arm and two heads.|$|E
50|$|The BDM and its {{variants}} utilize <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> magazines, of {{the double}} stack variety with a capacity of 15 rounds of 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition. To comply with the 1994 U.S. Assault Weapons legislation, BDM magazines were limited to 10-round capacity for civilian purchasers, although 15-round magazines were available for law enforcement use. After the 2004 expiration of the 1994 U.S. Assault Weapons legislation, 15-round magazines became legal and available in most states for civilian use.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, SyQuest {{announced}} the SQ555 and its SQ400 associated cartridge, a 44 MB 5¼-inch <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> hard disk drive, using {{the industry standard}} 130 mm disk as its medium. [...] Double capacity versions, the SQ5110 and SQ800 were introduced in 1991. This generation of products became the de facto standard in the Apple Macintosh world to store, transfer and backup large amounts of data such as generated by graphic artists, musicians and engineers.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the success}} of the Iomega Zip drive, which stored data on <b>removable</b> {{magnetic}} <b>cartridges</b> with 100MB nominal capacity, the company developed and released the Jaz drive with 1GB capacity per removable disk, increased to 2GB in 1998.|$|R
50|$|The world's {{population}} is urbanising {{at a pace}} that outstrips existing infrastructure and municipal capabilities, making society's ability to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) increasingly challenging. There is a need for an alternative sanitation option where on-site sanitation and sewerage are not feasible. Container-Based Sanitation (CBS) refers to a system where excreta is collected in sealable, <b>removable</b> <b>cartridges</b> that are transported to treatment facilities. Container-based sanitation is usually provided as a service involving provision of certain types of portable toilets, and collection of excreta at a cost borne by the users. Examples of organizations that provide this service are Loowatt in Madagascar, Clean Team in Ghana, X-Runner in Peru, and SOIL in Haiti.|$|R
50|$|The CP System (shīpī shisutemu) or CPS is an arcade {{system board}} {{developed}} by Capcom that ran game software stored on <b>removable</b> ROM <b>cartridges.</b> More {{than two dozen}} arcade titles were released for CPS-1, before Capcom shifted game development over to its successor, the CP System II.|$|R
50|$|The Mattel Intellivision {{game console}} offered the Intellivoice Voice Synthesis module in 1982. It {{included}} the SP0256 Narrator speech synthesizer chip on a <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The Narrator had 2kB of Read-Only Memory (ROM), {{and this was}} utilized to store a database of generic words that could be combined to make phrases in Intellivision games. Since the Orator chip could also accept speech data from external memory, any additional words or phrases needed could be stored inside the cartridge itself. The data consisted of strings of analog-filter coefficients to modify {{the behavior of the}} chip's synthetic vocal-tract model, rather than simple digitized samples.|$|E
50|$|For mass storage, the System/3 {{used the}} IBM 5444 single-platter disk, {{roughly the size}} of a large pizza; {{initially}} each platter held 2.5 MB of data. Standard configuration for storage was one or two fixed disks, each in a separate pull-out drawer, which typically held the operating system and user-developed programs. Additionally, each fixed disc could have a <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> disk attached; these typically contained the data-files associated with various applications, for example Payroll, and users frequently had a number of them. Thus the low-end systems could support a maximum of 10 MB of online storage (two fixed, 2 removable), although in practice this was very expensive and not common.|$|E
50|$|Most older {{samplers}} use SCSI as {{the protocol}} for getting sample data {{in and out}} of the machine. SCSI interfaces were either standard on the sampler or offered as an option. SCSI provides the ability to move large quantities of data {{in and out of}} a sampler in reasonable times. Hard drives, CDROM drives, Zip drives and <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> drives such as Syquest and Iomega Jaz drives are the most popular SCSI devices used with samplers. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, with hard drives being the fastest devices. Modern (after 2000) samplers use solid-state memory cards (such as compact Flash or SmartMedia) for sample storage and transfer.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} console, the Magnavox Odyssey, uses <b>removable</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{that are}} merely jumpers housed in cartridges, that activate the games already wired into the console. This method was soon replaced during {{the move to}} Pong consoles, where the logic for one or more games was hard-coded into microchips using discrete logic, and no additional games could be added. By the mid-1970s, cartridges returned with the move to CPU-based consoles. With games now consisting of microprocessor-based code, these games were burned onto ROM chips mounted inside plastic cartridge casings that could be plugged into slots on the console. When the cartridges were plugged in, the general-purpose microprocessors in the consoles read the cartridge memory and ran whatever program was stored there. Rather than being confined to a small selection of games included in the box, consumers could now amass libraries of game cartridges.|$|R
50|$|Firmware {{unique to}} the game being played existed as a <b>removable</b> ROM <b>cartridge</b> {{containing}} 16K memory, including the entire game node layout, vocabulary of the game (both for the speech synthesizer and speech recognizer), inventory data (both for gameplay as well as video still frames depicting items), and certain executable data sections {{to assist in the}} processing of game flow.|$|R
5000|$|Blue laser {{technology}} gives the 30 GB UDO {{more than three}} times the capacity of previous generation MO (Magneto Optical) and DVD technologies. Being <b>removable,</b> UDO <b>cartridges,</b> combined with off-line media management capabilities typical of optical storage libraries, makes UDO a much more scalable format. Rarely used data can be removed from a library, freeing up capacity yet remaining managed and accessible.|$|R
50|$|An early disk {{cartridge}} {{was a single}} hard disk platter encased in a protective plastic shell. When the <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> was inserted into the cartridge drive peripheral device, the read/write heads of the drive could access the magnetic data storage surface of the platter through holes in the shell. The {{disk cartridge}} was a direct evolution from the disk pack drive, or the early hard drive. As the storage density improved, even a single platter would provide a useful amount of data storage space, with the benefit being easier to handle than a removable disk pack. An example of a cartridge drive is the IBM 2310, used on the IBM 1130. Disk cartridges were made obsolete by floppy disks.|$|E
50|$|The first {{consumer}} {{tape recorder}} {{to employ a}} tape reel permanently housed in a small <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> was the RCA tape cartridge, which appeared in 1958 as a predecessor to the cassette format. At that time, reel to reel recorders and players were commonly used by enthusiasts, but required large individual reels and tapes {{which had to be}} threaded by hand, making them less-accessible to the casual consumer. Both RCA and Bell Sound attempted to commercialize the cartridge format, but a few factors stalled adoption, including lower-than-advertised availability of selections in the prerecorded media catalog, delays in production setup, and a stand-alone design that was not considered by audiophiles to be truly hi-fi.|$|E
5000|$|The Datapoint 2200 had a {{built-in}} full-travel keyboard, {{a built-in}} 12-line, 80-column green screen monitor, and two 47 character-per-inch cassette tape drives each with 130 kB capacity. Its size, 9+5/8 x 18+1/2 x 19+5/8 in, and shape - {{a box with}} protruding keyboard - approximated that of an IBM Selectric typewriter. Initially, a Diablo 2.5 MB 2315-type <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> hard disk drive was available, along with modems, several types of serial interface, parallel interface, printers and a punched card reader. Later, an 8-inch floppy disk drive was also made available, along with other, larger hard disk drives. An industry-compatible 7/9-track (user selectable) magnetic tape drive was available by 1975. In late 1977, Datapoint introduced ARCnet local area networking. The original Type 1 2200 shipped with 2 kilobytes of serial shift register main memory, expandable to 8K. The Type 2 2200 used denser 1 kbit RAM chips, giving it a default 4K of memory, expandable to 16K. Its starting price was around US $5,000 (...) , and a full 16K Type 2 2200 had a list price of just over $14,000.|$|E
25|$|Information {{collected}} by processing equipment is then transmitted back to Transperth by either wired LAN (for fixed processors including standalone units and faregates) or wireless LAN (For buses and other mobile forms of transport). The Wayfarer TGX150 ticket machines {{also include a}} <b>removable</b> data <b>cartridge</b> that {{is used as a}} backup information store {{that can be used in}} the event of a systems or communications failure with the central system.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{concerns the}} award {{of a contract}} for the supply, installation and maintenance of high-performance magnetic tape drives and associated cartridges. Phase 1 of the LHC Computing Grid project, as described in CERN/FC/ 2379 /Rev., {{was approved by the}} CERN Council (CERN/FC/ 4487) in 2001 and CERN is now starting the procurement process for the equipment it needs for the storage of related data on <b>removable</b> <b>cartridges.</b> A call for tenders (IT- 3117 /IT) was sent on 14 December 2001 to three firms in one Member State. By the closing date, CERN had received two tenders. The Finance Committee is invited to agree to the negotiation of a contract with STORAGETEK (CH), the lowest bidder, for the supply of high-performance magnetic tape drives and cartridges for experimental data for a total amount of 2 031 247 Swiss francs, not subject to revision, with an option for additional drives to provide 700 Megabytes/sec capacity, for a total amount of 175 316 Swiss francs, not subject to revision, bringing the total amount to 2 206 563 Swiss francs.

50|$|The SL-10 came {{equipped}} with the Technics EPS-310MC moving-coil cartridge. Due to the low output of the moving-coil cartridge, the SL-10 includes a built-in, bypassable step-up preamp {{to allow it to}} connect to standard phono inputs. The original Technics EPS-310MC moving-coil cartridge was designed to be replaced as a unit; the stylus was not <b>removable.</b> The <b>cartridge</b> has since been discontinued; the SL-10 will accept any P-mount/T4P cartridge. The SL-10 is capable of being powered by an external DC power adapter or a standard AC power supply. The motor is quartz-locked, providing accurate rotational speed.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} a Medical Informatics Workup performed by fourth year medical students working in a busy inner-city Emergency Room. These students use portable computers (Macintosh PowerBook 170 s connected to a <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> hard drive and CD-ROM drive) to do the patient workups. The PowerBook 170 contains the automated medical record entry software (IMR-E), five expert system software packages, and a program that allows the PowerBook to emulate a PC-compatible computer. With this configuration the student has a portable system that allows {{for the creation of a}} computerized medical record at the patient's bedside, along with the ability to analyze the data and generate a list of differential diagnoses...|$|E
40|$|The Space Station Prototype (SSP) Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) {{hardware}} {{was designed}} and built to be maintainable by the flight crew. To achieve this goal, subsystems were designed for ease of component removal and installation, which included accessibility to component fasteners and connectors, adequate tool clearance, minimum fluid loss during changeout, positive capture of loose parts during changeout, replacement by one crewman, and protection of adjacent parts during maintenance. During testing of this hardware, many day-to-day problems arose which allowed {{the evaluation of the}} maintenance concepts under actual maintenance conditions. This paper briefly discusses the maintenance objectives of the hardware design. Specific maintenance designs and their test evaluations are discussed. A <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> valve concept for liquid line components and threaded mechanical fittings and V-band couplings for gaseous line components are critiqued. Other maintenance devices are also evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of cells from urine provides a convenient approach to non-invasive detection of bladder cancer. The practical use of urinary cell-based tests is often hampered by difficulties in handling and analyzing large sample volumes, {{the need for}} rapid sample processing to avoid degradation of cellular content, and low sensitivity due to a high background of normal cells. We present a filtration device, designed for home or point-of-care use, which enables collection, storage and shipment of urinary cells. A special feature of this device is a <b>removable</b> <b>cartridge</b> housing a membrane filter, which after filtration of urine can be transferred to a storage unit containing an appropriate preserving solution. In spiking experiments, {{the use of this}} device provided efficient recovery of bladder cancer cells with elimination of > 99 % of excess smaller-sized cells. The performance of the device was further evaluated by DNA-based {{analysis of}} urinary cells collected from 57 patients subjected to transurethral resection following flexible cystoscopy indicating the presence of a tumor. All samples were tested for FGFR 3 mutations and seven DNA methylation markers (BCL 2, CCNA 1, EOMES, HOXA 9, POU 4 F 2, SALL 3 and VIM). In the group of patients where a transitional cell tumor was confirmed at histopathological evaluation, urine DNA was positive for one or more markers in 29 out of 31 cases (94 %), including 19 with FGFR 3 mutation (61 %). In the group of patients with benign histopathology, urine DNA was positive for methylation markers in 13 out of 26 cases (50 %). Only one patient in this group was positive for a FGFR 3 mutation. This patient had a stage Ta tumor resected 6 months later. The ability to easily collect, store and ship diagnostic cells from urine using the presented device may facilitate non-invasive testing for bladder cancer...|$|E
50|$|In 1968 - 1969 several {{television}} manufactures {{were shown}} the prototype. RCA {{was the only}} manufacture to begin to negotiate a license in 1969, however negotiations broke down. Bill Enders left RCA and become vice president of Magnavox. Bill Enders {{was part of the}} RCA team that was negotiating for the Brown Box prototype and was impressed with the technology. In 1972 Magnavox had introduced the Magnavox Odyssey game system, which had had <b>removable</b> game <b>cartridges.</b> The Odyssey game system sales were lower than expected, however, and it was discontinued shortly after it was launched.|$|R
50|$|The RK05 DECpack was {{a moving}} head {{magnetic}} disk drive manufactured by the Digital Equipment Corporation of Maynard, Massachusetts. It stored approximately 2.5 MB on a 14", single-platter IBM-2315-style front-loading <b>removable</b> disk <b>cartridge.</b> The cartridge permitted users to have relatively unlimited off-line storage {{and to have}} very fast access to such data. At the time DEC had numerous operating systems for each computer architecture so operating systems could also be changed quickly. The RK05 was the disk successor to DECtape for personal, portable, and expandable storage. While the smallest practical configuration was two drives, many systems had four or more drives.|$|R
5000|$|A Livescribe smartpen {{is about}} the size and weight of a large pen (5/8" [...] x 6 1/8"), and is {{equipped}} with a <b>removable</b> ball-point ink <b>cartridge,</b> a microphone to record audio, a speaker for playback, a small OLED display, an infra-red camera, and internal flash memory that captures handwritten notes, audio and drawings.|$|R
