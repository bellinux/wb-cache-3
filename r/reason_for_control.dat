Mehmet Ali Sahin Deputy Chair of Turkey's Justice and Development Party (AKP) criticised the Saudi organisation, and claimed that Turkey could do a better job than Saudi Arabia at organising the Hajj pilgrimage, calling for Turkey to be entrusted with its management. Nouri al-Maliki, former Prime Minister of Iraq, proposed that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) should take over administration of the Hajj. Mohammad Emami Kashani, an Iranian Ayatollah, also called for transfer of the control of the Hajj to the OIC, stating [...] "Saudi Arabia is incapable of organising the pilgrimage. The running of the Hajj must be handed over to Islamic states." [...] Hassan Nasrallah, Secretary General of Hezbollah stated that Saudi Arabia should allow Muslim countries to help the kingdom run the Hajj pilgrimage rituals, emphasising the need for the formation of a Muslim committee to [...] "supervise the management" [...] of the annual Islamic event. The Saudi government rejected such calls; Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal stated Saudi control over the Hajj was [...] "a matter of sovereignty and privilege and service".|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{control is}} getting {{increasingly}} demanded {{in water and}} wastewater treatment systems. Various case studies have shown significant savings in operating costs, including energy costs, and remarkably short payback times. It has been demonstrated that instrumentation, control and automation (ICA) may increase the capacity of biological nutrient removing wastewater treatment plants by 10 - 30 % today. With further understanding and exploitation of the mechanisms involved in biological nutrient removal the improvements due to ICA may reach another 20 - 50 % of the total system investments within the next 10 - 20 years. Disturbances are the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>control</b> of any system. In a wastewater treatment system they are mostly related to the load variations, but many disturbances are created also within the plant.

40|$|Results from {{experiments}} on laboratory scale fedbatch processes {{are presented as}} well as analysis and design of the control system. The main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>control</b> is to track the drastic growth in feed demand during a cultivation. Variations in the amount {{and quality of the}} inocculum makes precalculated dosage schemes of limited value to obtain reproducible cultivation conditions. Two processes have been studied on a laboratory scale, production of bakers' yeast, and production of the enzyme salicylate hydroxylase using a strain of bacteria. Direct measurement was used to monitor the feed demand. A regulator structure is proposed based on an observer for the exponentially growing feed demand. It {{can be viewed as a}} modified PID regulator around a dosage scheme, but it is less sensitive to errors in the dosage scheme than conventional PID control. The a priori knowledge of the feed profile is further relaxed by introduction of adaptation of the growth rate parameter. The obtained non-linear control system has a simple structure and stability is garanteed for a wide range of initial values using the technique of Liapunov function. The linearized system is analysed in the frequency domain and the adaptation is shown to have negligible influence on the loop phase margin. The adaptive regulator is tested in simulation against real feed profiles and shows good results...|$|E

Weed management systems that rely on postemergence control assume that crops can tolerate competition for certain periods of time without suffering yield losses. However, once competition between the crop and weeds begins, the magnitude of yield loss increases rapidly as weed control is delayed. Our inability to accurately predict when weeds first begin to affect yield will always create a level of risk when relying on total postemergence weed control programs. Preemergence herbicides greatly reduce this risk by reducing the populations of weeds that emerge with the crop. The objective {{of this research was}} to quantify yield losses associated with delays in controlling weeds that emerge with or shortly following corn...|$|R

Although, the localizations and polarities of rice Si transporters have been elucidated, the mechanisms that control the expression of Si transporter genes and the functional <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> expression are not well-understood. We developed a new model that simulates the dynamics of Si in the whole plant in rice by considering Si transport in the roots, distribution at the nodes, and signaling substances controlling transporter gene expression. To investigate the functional <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the diurnal variation of the expression level, we compared investment efficiencies (the amount of Si accumulated in the upper leaf divided by the total expression level of Si transporter genes) at different model settings. The model reproduced the gradual decrease and diurnal variation of the expression level of the transporter genes observed by previous experimental studies. The results of simulation experiments showed that a considerable reduction in the expression of Si transporter genes during the night increases investment efficiency. Our study suggests that rice has a system that maximizes the investment efficiency of Si uptake...|$|R

50|$|Hiking is most {{integral}} to catamaran and dinghy sailing, where the lightweight boat {{can be easily}} capsized or turtled by the wind unless the sailor counteracts the wind's pressure by hiking, or eases the sails to reduce it. The heavy keel on larger keelboats means that it is rare to capsize them due to wind alone, but keelboat racers will still hike to prevent unnecessary heeling, or leaning sideways to leeward, because the more vertical in the water the keel is, the more effective it is at keeping the boat moving in a forward direction and preventing it from drifting to leeward, slowing the boat due to drag, and potentially increasing the distance the boat must sail when beating. Improper heel creates a tendency for the boat to turn off course, necessitating a correction with the rudder, which also increases drag. Sails use wind most efficiently when they are at a proper heel, another <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> heel.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> most {{vertebrate}} pests is the role these creatures play as links in the infection chain of certain agents pathogenic to man.

Unfortunately, histories or epidemiological data of occupational infections among pest control operators are not available; perhaps this society may become a future assembly point for statistics in this field. The hazards therefore have to be approached theoretically: diseases known to be associated with vertebrate pests must be studied as to their prevalence in the animal reservoir, ease of transmission, and the particular mode in which control operators would most likely become exposed. The data on individual diseases which follow, although by no means complete, should serve as an introduction to the study of zoonoses affecting pest animals.
