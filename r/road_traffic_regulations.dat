25|$|In Taiwan, the Road Traffic Security Rules require pedicabs to be {{registered}} by their owners with the police {{before they can be}} legally driven on public roads, or risk an administrative fine of 300 new Taiwan dollars (TWD). Their drivers must carry the police registration documents or risk a fine of 180 TWD, but no driver license is required. The administrative fines are based on Articles 69 and 71 of the Act Governing the Punishment of Violation of <b>Road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>Regulations.</b> As Taiwanese road traffic is now heavily motorized, most pedicabs have been replaced by taxicabs, but they can still be found at limited places, such as Cijin District of Kaohsiung City.|$|E

Pedestrians can be fined 1200 new Taiwan dollars for a violation, drivers of non-motorized vehicles such as bicycles can be fined between 1200 and 2400 dollars, and drivers of motor vehicles can be fined up to 6000 to 12000 new Taiwan dollars for a violation.

50|$|The <b>Road</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Regulation</b> Act 1984 is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom, which {{provided}} powers to regulate or restrict <b>traffic</b> on UK <b>roads,</b> {{in the interest}} of safety.

The Act is split into 10 parts covering 147 sections, it also includes 14 schedules.|$|R
2500|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} such as fire engines, ambulances, police cars, snow-removal {{vehicles and}} tow trucks are usually equipped with intense warning lights of particular colours. These may be motorised rotating beacons, xenon strobes, or arrays of LEDs. The prescribed colours differ by jurisdiction; in most countries, {{blue and red}} special warning lamps are used on police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles. In the United States and some other jurisdictions, amber lights are for tow trucks, private security personnel, construction vehicles, and other nonofficial special-service vehicles, while volunteer firefighters use red, blue, or green, depending on jurisdiction. In the U.S. it {{is a violation of}} the D.O.T. (Department of Transportation) Uniform Vehicle Code for any non-emergency vehicle (Police/Fire/Ambulance) to operate forward-facing red lights of any kind. Cars in the U.S. only have red tail-lights, and no blue lights; a vehicle displaying a red (forward-facing) light (flashing or not) coming towards a driver, or from behind the driver (in rear view mirror) indicates that an official emergency vehicle is coming, requiring the driver to yield, pull {{off to the side of}} the road, or otherwise get out of its way. [...] Some U.S. States allow emergency vehicles to have blue lights that can be turned on to warn drivers of an emergency vehicle in action; blue and red lights can be combined, forward- and/or rear-facing, also. [...] In the UK, doctors may use green warning lamps although these do not allow the user to claim any exemption from <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>regulations</b> compared to the blue lights used by statutory emergency services when responding to calls. Special warning lights, usually amber, are also sometimes mounted on slow and/or wide vehicles such as mobile cranes, excavators, tractors, and even mobility scooters in certain conditions.|$|E
