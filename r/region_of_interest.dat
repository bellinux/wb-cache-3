25|$|A TEM {{stage is}} {{required}} {{to have the ability}} to hold a specimen and be manipulated to bring the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> into the path of the electron beam. As the TEM can operate over a wide range of magnifications, the stage must simultaneously be highly resistant to mechanical drift, with drift requirements as low as a few nm/minute while being able to move several μm/minute, with repositioning accuracy on the order of nanometers. Earlier designs of TEM accomplished this with a complex set of mechanical downgearing devices, allowing the operator to finely control the motion of the stage by several rotating rods. Modern devices may use electrical stage designs, using screw gearing in concert with stepper motors, providing the operator with a computer-based stage input, such as a joystick or trackball.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early and {{accurate}} detection of global cerebral anoxia {{is important for}} determination of prognosis and further management. We evaluated whether accuracy in early detection of global cerebral anoxia was improved by high-b-value diffusionweighted imaging (DWI) with long echo time (TE). METHODS: Routine DWI (b � 1000 s/mm 2;TE � 139 ms), high-b-value DWI (b � 3000 s/mm 2;TE � 190 ms), T 2 -weighted imaging (T 2 WI), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging were acquired in six patients who experienced cardiopulmonary arrest within 24 hours and six volunteers. <b>Region</b> <b>of</b> interest–based analysis was performed. <b>Regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> patients showing significant decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values than volunteers were considered abnormal. Three neuroradiologists independently assessed images of the patients for conspicuity <b>of</b> hyperintensity within <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed, and the area under the curve (Az) was compared among sequences and observers. Average contrast and contrast-to-noise ratios between abnormal <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> normal surrounding parenchyma were calculated...|$|R
25|$|Smoothing, or spatial filtering, is {{the idea}} of {{averaging}} the intensities of nearby voxels to produce a smooth spatial map of intensity change across the brain or <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The averaging is often done by convolution with a Gaussian filter, which, at every spatial point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following the bell curve. If the true spatial extent of activation, that is the spread of the cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the signal-to-noise ratio. It also makes the total noise for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces the bell curve as the limit case. But if the presumed spatial extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{resolution}} of fMRI is limited by: (1) the feedback mechanism {{that raises the}} blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to wait till net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Advanced techniques to improve temporal resolution address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up acquisition time in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique is to decide which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a spatial map (that is small clusters dotting the image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a high-pass filter in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford. These mechanisms assume the researcher has {{an idea of the}} expected shape of the activation image.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inserted}} into a TEM, the sample {{has to be}} manipulated to locate the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to the beam, such as in single grain diffraction, in a specific orientation. To accommodate this, the TEM stage allows movement of the sample in the XY plane, Z height adjustment, and commonly a single tilt direction parallel to the axis of side entry bolders. Sample rotation may be available on specialized diffraction holders and stages. Some modern TEMs provide the ability for two orthogonal tilt angles of movement with specialized holder designs called double-tilt sample holders. Some stage designs, such as top-entry or vertical insertion stages once common for high resolution TEM studies, may simply only have X-Y translation available. The design criteria of TEM stages are complex, owing to the simultaneous requirements of mechanical and electron-optical constraints and specialized models are available for different methods.|$|E

25|$|Most {{evaluations}} of O–A relationships do not evaluate species over their entire (global) range, but document abundance and occupancy patterns {{within a specific}} region. It is believed that species decline in abundance and become more patchily distributed towards the margin of their range. If this is true, then it can be expected that as a species expands or contracts its range within the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> it will more or less closely resemble populations {{at the core of}} its range, leading to a positive intraspecific O–A relationship. In the same manner, an assemblage of species within the study region can be expected to contain some species near the core and some near the periphery of their ranges, leading to a positive interspecific O–A relationship. Although this explanation may contribute to the understanding of O–A relationships where partial ranges are considered, it cannot explain relationships documented for entire geographic ranges.|$|E
25|$|In many LCAs, {{characterization}} concludes the LCIA analysis; this is {{also the}} last compulsory stage according to ISO 14044:2006. However, in addition to the above mandatory LCIA steps, other optional LCIA elements – normalization, grouping, and weighting – may be conducted depending on the goal and scope of the LCA study. In normalization, the results of the impact categories from the study are usually compared with the total impacts in the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> the U.S. for example. Grouping consists of sorting and possibly ranking the impact categories. During weighting, the different environmental impacts are weighted relative to each other so that they can then be summed to get a single number for the total environmental impact. ISO 14044:2006 generally advises against weighting, stating that “weighting, shall not be used in LCA studies intended to be used in comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public”. This advice is often ignored, resulting in comparisons that can reflect a high degree of subjectivity as a result of weighting.|$|E
