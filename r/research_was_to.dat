5|$|In {{the true}} ending, Junpei learns that the {{previous}} Nonary Game consisted of nine pairs of kidnapped siblings separated onto the ocean-bound Gigantic and in a mock-up in Building Q in the Nevada desert. The game was designed to explore morphic fields; the research anticipated that {{the stress of the}} game would activate the fields between siblings, allowing solutions solved by one to be sent via these fields to their counterpart at the other location. This <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> help Ace cure his prosopagnosia. This Nonary Game went awry: Akane and her brother Santa were placed at the same location instead of being separated, and Seven discovered the kidnappings and rescued the children from the ship. Ace grabbed Akane before they could escape, and forced her into the incinerator room where she faced a sudoku puzzle that she could not solve, and apparently died.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the {{institute}} {{goes back to the}} establishment of the Sindhi Academy in 1962 by the University of Sindh. The objective was to develop a facility to archive books, manuscripts, and research papers from past and present. Another objective was to promote and publish research about Sindh in the Sindhi language in addition to other languages such as Arabic, English, Persian and Urdu. The <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be promoted in all Pakistani universities.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, 1852, there {{appeared}} {{the paper on}} the composition and resolution of streams of polarised light from different sources, and in 1853 {{an investigation of the}} metallic reflection exhibited by certain non-metallic substances. The <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> highlight the phenomenon of light polarisation. About 1860 he was engaged in an inquiry on the intensity of light reflected from, or transmitted through, a pile of plates; and in 1862 he prepared for the British Association a valuable report on double refraction, a phenomenon where certain crystals show different refractive indices along different axes. Perhaps the best known crystal is Iceland spar, transparent calcite crystals.|$|E

25|$|Frederick III died about 11:00 on 15 June 1888. Once the Emperor's {{death was}} announced, {{his son and}} {{successor}} William II ordered the occupation of the imperial residence by soldiers. The chambers of Frederick and Victoria were carefully checked to find incriminating documents. However, the search was unsuccessful because all the couple's correspondence had been taken to Windsor Castle the previous year. Several years later, William II stated {{that the purpose of}} this <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> find state documents. Currently, however, many historians (as Hannah Pakula and Franz Herre) suggest that what the Emperor wanted was to recover documents that could threaten his reputation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} apocalyptic themes that exist within the Pesharim. There are several interpretations with apocalyptic themes {{found in the}} commentaries within Qumran such as Pesher Isaiah and Pesher Habakkuk that talk {{about the fate of}} the enemies of Israel and several other apocalyptic events. Eventually, the primary {{objective}} of the existent <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> explore the creed of the apocalyptic war which is shown in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Moreover, when trying to get {{a better understanding of the}} origin of the apocalyptic war and of the characteristics of the Qumran community, it is often that a question raises up which mentions the identification of the enemy in the apocalyptic war.|$|E
25|$|An initial {{focus of}} <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the possible {{existence of the}} Higgs boson, {{a key part of}} the Standard Model of physics which is predicted by theory but had not yet been observed before due to its high mass and elusive nature. CERN scientists estimated that, if the Standard Model were correct, the LHC would produce several Higgs bosons every minute, allowing physicists to finally confirm or disprove the Higgs boson's existence. In addition, the LHC allowed the search for supersymmetric particles and other hypothetical particles as possible unknown areas of physics. Some extensions of the Standard Model predict additional particles, such as the heavy W' and Z' gauge bosons, which are also estimated to be within reach of the LHC to discover.|$|E

25|$|A {{large part}} of Albert A. Bühlmann's <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} the longest half time compartments for Nitrogen and Helium, and he {{increased the number of}} compartments to 16. He investigated the implications of decompression after diving at altitude and published decompression tables that could be used at a range of altitudes. Bühlmann used a method for decompression calculation similar to that proposed by Workman, which included M-values expressing a linear relationship between maximum inert gas pressure in the tissue compartments and ambient pressure, but based on absolute pressure, which made them more easily adapted for altitude diving. Bühlmann's algorithm was used to generate the standard decompression tables for a number of sports diving associations, and is used in several personal decompression computers, sometimes in a modified form.|$|E
25|$|In December 1970 David Rigler {{procured}} a small {{grant from}} the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to conduct preliminary studies on Genie, and in May 1971 Rigler organized and headed a team of doctors and scientists who sought and obtained a three-year {{grant from the}} NIMH {{to carry out a}} full case study. The primary focus of their <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> test the hypothesis of Eric Lenneberg that humans have a critical period for language acquisition, the end of which he defined as the onset of puberty, and the innateness hypothesis of Noam Chomsky, which contended that the ability to learn language is instinctive in humans and is what separates humans from all other animals. UCLA linguistics professor Victoria Fromkin headed linguistic evaluation and organized a group of linguists to design and carry out their study. Shortly afterwards, in late May, Susan Curtiss began her work on Genie's case as a graduate student in linguistics under Fromkin.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplicity}} of the Wankel engine makes it well-suited for mini, micro, and micro-mini engine designs. The Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) Rotary Engine Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, has previously undertaken research towards the development of Wankel engines of down to 1mm in diameter, with displacements less than 0.1cc. Materials include silicon and motive power includes compressed air. The goal of such <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> eventually develop an internal combustion engine {{with the ability to}} deliver 100 milliwatts of electrical power; with the engine itself serving as the rotor of the generator, with magnets built into the engine rotor itself. Development of the miniature Wankel engine stopped at UC Berkeley {{at the end of the}} DARPA contract. Miniature Wankel engines struggled to maintain compression due to sealing problems, similar to problems observed in the large scale versions. In addition, miniature engines suffer from an adverse surface to volume ratio causing excess heat losses; the relatively large surface area of the combustion chamber walls transfers away what little heat is generated in the small combustion volume resulting in quenching and low efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, BBC News {{published}} an article stating that CSI: Miami was the world's most popular television series. The article cites a study, conducted by Informa Telecoms and published by Radio Times magazine, that had collected television viewing data in 20 countries. The study showed that CSI: Miami was featured in more top-10 viewing charts than any other series. Adam Thomas, the media research manager responsible for the study explained that [...] "The objective of our <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> find the most consistently successful programme worldwide in terms of attracting viewers. We were not therefore concerned with shows that performed extremely well in {{a relatively small number}} of markets.

A 3/8 in. wire mesh floor 1 in. above {{the bottom of the}} chamber allowed waste material to drop out of holes. The chamber had a food box and a water-bottle holder, and was covered with a pyramid top so that the monkeys were unable to escape. Harlow placed baby monkeys in the chamber alone for up to six weeks. Within a few days, they stopped moving about and remained huddled in a corner. [...] The monkeys generally exhibited marked social impairment and peer hostility when removed from the chamber; most did not recover.|$|E
