5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national <b>reconciliation.</b> First, he arranged the repatriation of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use the <b>reconciliation</b> of these historical Argentine figures {{as a metaphor for the}} <b>reconciliation</b> of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E

5|$|The Day of <b>Reconciliation</b> is {{a public}} holiday in South Africa held {{annually}} on 16 December. The holiday came into effect in 1994 {{after the end of}} apartheid, with the intention of fostering <b>reconciliation</b> and national unity for the country. The date was chosen because it was significant to both Afrikaner and African cultures. The government chose a meaningful date for both ethnic groups because they recognize the need for racial harmony. The celebration of the Day of <b>Reconciliation</b> can take the form of remembering past history, recognizing veteran's contributions, marching and other festivities.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{formulate}} and implement an algorithm that calculates the probability for two genes being orthologs, given a gene tree and a species tree. To do this, <b>reconciliations</b> between the gene tree and the species trees are used. A birth and death process is used to model the evolution, and {{used to calculate the}} orthology probability. The birth and death parameters are approximated with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A MCMC framework for probability calculations of <b>reconciliations</b> written by Arvestad et al. (2003) is used. Rules for orthologous <b>reconciliations</b> are developed and implemented to calculate the probability for the <b>reconciliations</b> that have two genes as orthologs. The rules where integrated with the Arvestad et al. (2003) framework, and the algorithm was then validated and tested...|$|R

Tshombe began negotiations {{for the end of}} the secession and the formation of a confederal Congo. Although a compromise agreement was reached, it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe. An attempted <b>reconciliation</b> in July 1961 led to the formation of a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but also failed to bring a <b>reconciliation</b> with Katanga.|$|E
5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill.

The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund in the 1990s to respond to the ongoing need for healing related to residential schools. In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice and <b>Reconciliation</b> Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established a Healing & <b>Reconciliation</b> Program.|$|E

40|$|In {{evolutionary}} biology, it {{is common}} to study how various entities evolve together, for example, how parasites coevolve with their host, or genes with their species. Coevolution is commonly modelled by considering certain maps or <b>reconciliations</b> from one evolutionary tree P to another H, all of which induce the same map ϕ between the leaf-sets of P and H (corresponding to present-day associations). Recently, there has been much interest in studying spaces of <b>reconciliations,</b> which arise by defining some metric d on the set Rec(P,H,ϕ) of all possible <b>reconciliations</b> between P and H. In this paper, we study the following question: How do we compute a geometric median for a given subset Ψ of Rec(P,H,ϕ) relative to d, i. e. an element ψ_med∈ Rec(P,H,ϕ) such that ∑_ψ' ∈Ψ d(ψ_med,ψ') <∑_ψ' ∈Ψ d(ψ,ψ') holds for all ψ∈ Rec(P,H,ϕ) ? For a model where so-called host-switches or transfers are not allowed, and for a commonly used metric d called the edit-distance, we show that although the cardinality of Rec(P,H,ϕ) can be super-exponential, it is still possible to compute a geometric median for a set Ψ in Rec(P,H,ϕ) in polynomial time. We expect that this result could be useful for computing a summary or consensus for a set of <b>reconciliations</b> (e. g. for a set of suboptimal <b>reconciliations).</b> Comment: 12 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
