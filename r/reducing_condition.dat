40|$|ABSTRACT. To {{evaluate}} the possible solubilization of barium sulfate in soils under <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions</b> {{and its effects}} on barium bioavailability, an Oryza sativa pot trial was established. Increasing barium doses and two redox potential conditions were evaluated. The geochemical fractionation data demonstrated that <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions</b> led to an increase in the levels of more labile forms of barium and a reduction in more stable forms. Furthermore, higher doses of barium were found to {{have a negative impact on}} grain production. The highest levels of barium accumulation in the leaves, roots, and grains were observed with the highest barium dose under <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions.</b> These results demonstrate that <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions</b> increased barium bioavailability and absorption by rice plants...|$|R

5000|$|Coffinite {{was first}} {{discovered}} in sedimentary uranium deposits in the Colorado Plateau region, but {{has also been}} discovered in sedimentary uranium deposits and hydrothermal veins in many other locations. [...] Samples of coffinite from the Colorado Plateau were found with black fine-grained low-valence vanadium minerals, uraninite and finely dispersed black organic material. [...] Other materials associated with later finds from the same region were clay and quartz. [...] In vein deposits of the Copper King Mine in Colorado, coffinite was also found to occur with uraninite and pitchblende. [...] Coffinite is metastable compared to uraninite and quartz, thus formation of coffinite requires a uranium source in reducing conditions, {{as evidenced by the}} associated presence of low-valence vanadium minerals. [...] Silica-rich solution provides such a <b>reducing</b> <b>condition</b> in cases where coffinite results as an alteration product of uraninite. [...] Hansley and Fitzpatrick also noted that the brownish color of their coffinite samples was caused by organic material, leading them to conclude that coffinite can also form in low temperature conditions if organic carbon is present. [...] This finding is consistent with the coffinite samples of the Colorado Plateau, which included fossilized wood. [...] In China, coffinite can be found in granite in addition to sandstone. [...] Hansley and Fitzpatrick concluded that coarse-grained coffinite most likely forms in high temperature environments. [...] Coffinite and uraninite precipitate inside brecciated and fractured regions of altered granite at pressures between 500 and 800 bars and temperatures at 126 to 178 °C.|$|E

40|$|A Study {{was done}} on the {{influence}} of redox potential on the mobility and availability of the various arsenic chemical forms in a Mollisol soil from central Chile amended with biosolid. Arsenic availability was strongly dependent on the applied redox potential. As expected, under <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions</b> (- 200 mV vs Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2) arsenic availability increased significantly, and arsenic was found mainly as arsenite. On the contrary under oxidizing conditions (200 mV vs Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2) arsenic solubility decreased markedly and was governed by the presence of arsenate. The greatest concentration of organic arsenic species was found under <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions,</b> which would indicate that methylated species may participate in the transformation of arsenate to arsenite. In biosolid-amended soils the concentrations of methylated species increased is a function of time under <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions,</b> which {{can be attributed to the}} greater microbial activity resulting from the organic matter supply from the biosolid to soil.

The respective denitrifying, sulfidogenic, and methanogenic enrichment cultures were established {{on each of the}} monochlorinated phenol and monochlorinated benzoic acid isomers, using sediment from the upper (freshwater) and lower (estuarine) Hudson River and the East River (estuarine) as source materials. Utilization of each chlorophenol and chlorobenzoate isomer was observed under at least one reducing condition; however, no single <b>reducing</b> <b>condition</b> permitted the metabolism of all six compounds tested. The anaerobic biodegradation of the chlorophenols and chlorobenzoates depended on the electron acceptor available and on the position of the chlorine substituent. In general, similar activities were observed under the different reducing conditions in both the freshwater and estuarine sediments. Under denitrifying conditions, degradation of 3 - and 4 -chlorobenzoate was accompanied by nitrate loss corresponding reasonably to the stoichiometric values expected for complete oxidation of the chlorobenzoate to CO 2. Under sulfidogenic conditions, 3 - and 4 -chlorobenzoate, but not 2 -chlorobenzoate, and all three monochlorophenol isomers were utilized, while under methanogenic conditions all compounds except 4 -chlorobenzoate were metabolized. Given that the pattern of activity appears different for these chlorinated compounds under each <b>reducing</b> <b>condition,</b> their biodegradability appears to be more a function of the presence of competent microbial populations than one of inherent molecular structure...|$|E

40|$|A model {{treating}} the sulphur capture and sulphur release reaction is in fluidised-bed boilers under alternating oxidising and <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions</b> has been developed. The model involves two overall rate constants, {{one for the}} sulphur capture {{and the other for}} reductive decomposition (sulphur release), as well as the temperature dependence of these constants. The constants were determined using experimental data from a fluidised-bed boiler. The values of the constants were used to derive a theoretical maximum sulphation, which is the ratio of end conversion under the conditions in the boiler to the end conversion under oxidising conditions, where "end" means at infinite residence time. The theoretical maximum sulphation gives an indication of the reduction in sulphur capture performance imposed by the effect of <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The results show that <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions</b> give a lower sorbent utilisation at increased sulphur capture as well as at increased temperature.
