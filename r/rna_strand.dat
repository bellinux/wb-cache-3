5|$|RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a {{specialized}} class of polymerases that copy {{the sequence of}} an <b>RNA</b> <b>strand</b> into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which {{is required for the}} replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{basis for}} binding of RNA to the argonaute protein was examined by X-ray crystallography of the binding domain of an RNA-bound argonaute protein. Here, the phosphorylated 5' {{end of the}} <b>RNA</b> <b>strand</b> enters a conserved basic surface pocket and makes contacts through a divalent cation (an atom with two positive charges) such as magnesium and by aromatic stacking (a process that allows more than one atom to share an electron by passing it back and forth) between the 5' nucleotide in the siRNA and a conserved tyrosine residue. This site is thought to form a nucleation site for the binding of the siRNA to its mRNA target. Analysis of the inhibitory effect of mismatches in either the 5’ or 3’ end of the guide strand has demonstrated that the 5’ end of the guide strand is likely responsible for matching and binding the target mRNA, while the 3’ end is responsible for physically arranging target mRNA into a cleavage-favorable RISC region.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{bonds of}} the RNA–DNA helix break, freeing the newly {{synthesized}} <b>RNA</b> <b>strand.</b>|$|E
25|$|The RNA {{segments}} of the viral genome have complementary base sequences at the terminal ends, allowing them to bond to each other with hydrogen bonds. After transcription from negative-sense to positive-sense RNA takes place, the positive-sense <b>RNA</b> <b>strands</b> are capped on the 5’ end by a process called cap snatching. This involves the viral protein NS1 binding to the host cell’s early messenger RNA transcripts. A second viral protein, PA, cleaves the cap from the host’s RNA. The short cap is then added to the influenza positive-sense <b>RNA</b> <b>strands,</b> allowing it to be processed by ribosomes and translated into its protein products. The positive-sense <b>RNA</b> <b>strands</b> also serve for synthesis of negative-sense <b>RNA</b> <b>strands</b> for new virions.|$|R

25|$|Transcription is {{the process}} where genetic {{information}} in DNA is used to produce a complementary <b>RNA</b> <b>strand.</b> This <b>RNA</b> <b>strand</b> is then processed to give messenger RNA (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called ribosomes located in the cytosol, where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates {{the formation of a}} polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to transfer RNA (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.|$|E
25|$|Termination is {{the process}} of {{breaking}} up the polymerase complex and ending the <b>RNA</b> <b>strand.</b> In eukaryotes using RNA Pol II, this termination is very variable (up to 2000 bases), relying on post transcriptional modification. See: Messenger RNA and Polyadenylation.|$|E
25|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are therefore anti-parallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. Under the genetic code, <b>RNA</b> <b>strands</b> are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins. These <b>RNA</b> <b>strands</b> are initially created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription.|$|R

25|$|Of {{particular}} interest are DNA ligases. These molecules have demonstrated remarkable chemoselectivity in RNA branching reactions. Although each repeating unit in a <b>RNA</b> <b>strand</b> owns a free hydroxyl group, the DNA ligase takes {{just one of}} them as a branching starting point. An accomplishment unattainable with traditional organic chemistry.|$|E
25|$|An {{antisense}} oligonucleotide drug, oblimersen (G3139), {{was developed by}} Genta Incorporated to target Bcl-2. An antisense DNA or <b>RNA</b> <b>strand</b> is non-coding and complementary to the coding strand (which is the template for producing respectively RNA or protein). An antisense drug is a short sequence of RNA that hybridises with and inactivates mRNA, preventing the protein from being formed.|$|E
25|$|RNAP can {{initiate}} transcription {{at specific}} DNA sequences known as promoters. It then produces an RNA chain, which is complementary to the template DNA strand.

25|$|Two common motifs {{involving}} coaxial stacking are kissing {{loops and}} pseudoknots. In kissing loop interactions, the single-stranded loop regions of two hairpins interact through base pairing, forming a composite, coaxially stacked helix. Notably, this structure allows {{all of the}} nucleotides in each loop to participate in base-pairing and stacking interactions. This motif was visualized and studied using NMR analysis by Lee and Crothers. The pseudoknot motif occurs when a single stranded region of a hairpin loop basepairs with an upstream or downstream sequence within the same <b>RNA</b> <b>strand.</b> The two resulting duplex regions often stack upon one another, forming a stable coaxially stacked composite helix. One example of a pseudoknot motif is the highly stable Hepatitis Delta virus ribozyme, in which the backbone shows an overall double pseudoknot topology.|$|E
25|$|The NS5B protein (65 kDa) is the viral RNA {{dependent}} RNA polymerase. NS5B has the key {{function of}} replicating the HCV’s viral RNA {{by using the}} viral positive <b>RNA</b> <b>strand</b> as its template and catalyzes the polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTP) during RNA replication. Several crystal structures of NS5B polymerase in several crystalline forms have been determined {{based on the same}} consensus sequence BK (HCV-BK, genotype 1). The structure can be represented by a right hand shape with fingers, palm, and thumb. The encircled active site, unique to NS5B, is contained within the palm structure of the protein. Recent studies on NS5B protein genotype 1b strain J4’s (HC-J4) structure indicate a presence of an active site where possible control of nucleotide binding occurs and initiation of de-novo RNA synthesis. De-novo adds necessary primers for initiation of RNA replication. Current research attempts to bind structures to this active site to alter its functionality in order to prevent further viral RNA replication.|$|E

RNA1 {{is required in}} replication as it encodes for RNA replicase components. This RNA contains structural elements within the 3’ and 5’ UTR that bring about cap independent translation. Unlike RNA1, RNA2 encodes for a movement protein (MP) and the mRNA of RNA2 contains no structural elements within the UTRs that can bring about cap independent translation. The translation of the mRNA of RNA2 is linked with RNA2 replication.|$|R

2500|$|Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, {{which use}} base pairs of {{nucleotides}} as a complementary language. [...] During transcription, a DNA sequence is read by an RNA polymerase, which produces a complementary, antiparallel <b>RNA</b> <b>strand</b> called a primary transcript.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of the RNA copy of the DNA is called transcription, and is performed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase, which adds one RNA nucleotide {{at a time to}} a growing <b>RNA</b> <b>strand</b> as per the complementarity law of the bases. This RNA is complementary to the template 3' → 5' DNA strand, which is itself complementary to the coding 5' → 3' DNA strand.

2500|$|DNA polymerases are {{a family}} of enzymes that carry out all forms of DNA replication. [...] DNA polymerases in general cannot {{initiate}} synthesis of new strands, but can only extend an existing DNA or <b>RNA</b> <b>strand</b> paired with a template strand.

2500|$|In {{the case}} of HIV, reverse {{transcriptase}} is responsible for synthesizing a complementary DNA strand (cDNA) to the viral RNA genome. The enzyme ribonuclease H then digests the <b>RNA</b> <b>strand,</b> and reverse transcriptase synthesises a complementary strand of DNA to form a double helix DNA structure ("cDNA"). The cDNA is integrated into the host cell's genome by the enzyme integrase, which causes the host cell to generate viral proteins that reassemble into new viral particles. [...] In HIV, subsequent to this, the host cell undergoes programmed cell death, or apoptosis of T cells. [...] However, in other retroviruses, the host cell remains intact as the virus buds out of the cell.|$|E
2500|$|Stem-loops {{can vary}} greatly {{in size and}} sequence, but tetraloops of four {{nucleotides}} are very common and they usually belong {{to one of three}} categories, based on sequence. These three families are the CUYG, UNCG and GNRA (see figure on the right) tetraloops. In each of these tetraloop families, the second and third nucleotides form a turn in the <b>RNA</b> <b>strand</b> and a base-pair between the first and fourth nucleotides stabilizes the stemloop structure. It has been determined, in general, that the stability of the tetraloop depends on the composition of bases within the loop and on the composition of this [...] "closing base pair". The GNRA family of tetraloops is the most commonly observed within Tetraloop-receptor interactions.|$|E
40|$|Research {{concerning}} oligonucleotide-directed {{triple helix}} formation has mainly {{focused on the}} binding of DNA oligonucleotides to duplex DNA. The participation of <b>RNA</b> <b>strands</b> in triple helices is also of interest. For the pyrimidine motif (pyrimidine. purine. pyrimidine triplets), systematic substitution of RNA for DNA in one, two, or all three triplex strands has previously been reported. For the purine motif (purine. purine. pyrimidine triplets), studies have shown only that RNA cannot bind to duplex DNA. To extend this result, we created a DNA triple helix in the purine motif and systematically replaced one, two, or all three <b>strands</b> with <b>RNA.</b> In dramatic contrast to the general accommodation of <b>RNA</b> <b>strands</b> in the pyrimidine triple helix motif, a stable triplex forms in the purine motif only when {{all three of the}} substituent strands are DNA. The lack of triplex formation among any of the other seven possible <b>strand</b> combinations involving <b>RNA</b> suggests that: (i) duplex structures containing RNA cannot be targeted by DNA oligonucleotides in the purine motif; (ii) <b>RNA</b> <b>strands</b> cannot be employed to recognize duplex DNA in the purine motif; and (iii) RNA tertiary structures are likely to contain only isolated base triplets in the purine motif...|$|R
