40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a better {{understanding}} of organic <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> aquaculture production in Greece, in particular its consequences for fish growth, health and body composition, and to propose and update standards for sustainable organic <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> farming. Gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were kept in sea cages at densities of 4 kg m (3) (organic) and 15 kg m (3) (conventional), and were fed organically produced feed (45 % crude protein, 14 % fat) or conventional feed (46 % crude protein, 17 % fat). The amino acid profile of the conventional diet, particularly the lysine content, which is one of most important dietary amino acids for <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> appeared to be unsatisfactory. "Organic" <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> stored less fat content in their white muscle than the conventional <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The liver lipid content was lower and the hepatosomatic index was higher for the organic <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The microbiological analysis showed that both Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli on the skin were below the enumeration detection limit in both the organic and conventional <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Total viable counts on the skin and muscle of both the organically and conventionally cultured <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were approximately 3 log cfu g(- 1), which is well below the acceptable limit (7 log cfu g(- 1)) for marine species. The results showed that the combination of a low stocking density and feed with a different ingredient composition but similar nutritional value resulted in similar growth rates and nutrient profiles of the final product.

40|$|Cultured {{and wild}} <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were {{compared}} {{for differences in}} their volatile components over a 23 day storage period in ice. A total of 60 compounds in cultured and 78 compounds in wild <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were tentatively identified (in addition to this, there were 23 unknowns in cultured and 29 unknowns in wild <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> volatiles). These included aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, aromatics, terpenes, furans, sulfur-containing compounds, an acid, and miscellaneous compounds.

40|$|With {{average annual}} growth at 38 %, <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> {{production}} is the main growth factor in Israel's fish- eries industry. It is estimated that cultured <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> constituted over 10 % of the volume and 20 % {{of the value of}} domestic fisheries in 2000. Per capita consumption of <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> grew from 0. 11 kg in 1995 to an estimated 0. 39 kg in 2000.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{antioxidant}} systems in juvenile marine fish of commercial importance in European aquaculture, namely turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) and gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Sparus aurata). The present dietary trial was specifically designed to investigate the antioxidant effects of vitamin E under moderate oxidising conditions, including high dietary levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids and the feeding of oxidised oils. The objective was to induce a stressful pro-oxidant status to enable characterisation of the biochemical responses to peroxidative stress without causing unnecessary suffering to the experimental animals or high mortalities during the trials. Both <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot showed excellent growth, whereas growth was poorer in halibut. Dietary oxidised oil significantly reduced growth in turbot and especially in halibut, but not in <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Vitamin E improved growth in <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> fed oxidised oil but not in turbot or halibut. However, vitamin E supplementation appeared to improve survival in all three species. In <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot, liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were generally increased by feeding peroxidised oil and reduced by vitamin E. Conversely, in halibut, the liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were not increased by feeding peroxidised oil and only superoxide dismutase was reduced by feeding vitamin E. Consistent with these data, feeding oxidised oil increased lipid peroxidation products in halibut, but generally not in <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> or turbot. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation products were generally reduced by dietary vitamin E in both <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot, but not in halibut. Therefore, halibut liver antioxidant defence enzymes did not respond to dietary oxidised oil or vitamin E as occurred in turbot and, especially <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> This resulted in increased levels of lipid peroxides in halibut compared to turbot and <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> in fish given dietary oxidised oil. In addition, supplemental vitamin E did not reduce lipid peroxides in halibut as it did in turbot and <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The increased peroxidation stress in halibut may account for their poorer growth and survival in comparison to turbot and especially <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Halibut were reared at a lower temperature, although relatively high for halibut, than either turbot or <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> but they were also slightly younger/smaller fish and possibly, therefore, more developmentally immature, and either or all of these factors may be important in the lack of response of the liver enzymes in halibut...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-range}} {{studies on}} the ecology and dynamics of various organisms, chiefly including larvae and juveniles of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> and on the environmental conditions of the ecosystem, have been performed at Shijiki Bay, Hirado Island, Nagasaki Prefecture. An ecosystem model of Shijiki Bay was developed mainly {{with regard to the}} dynamics of 0 -age <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and verification of the model was carried out. The following summarizes the results. (1) Basic concept for the development of an ecosystem model of Shijiki Bay, its boundary conditions and state variables and parameters to be introduced into the model were determined by rearranging available information on the bay such as non-biological elements in the bay, ecology, dynamics and production process of zooplankton, phytoplankton and feed benthos, life form of 0 -age <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> stock variations, and carrying capacity. (2) Spatial range of the model was decided to be central and inner parts of the bay where the <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> settles and grows, and time range of the model was decided to be four months from May 5 which is the normal settling time of the fish to September 5 when the fish starts to migrate toward the open sea. (3) The model system is divided into seven parts: Copepoda, Gammaridea and Mysidacea which in turn are used as feed by the <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> as it grows, wild <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> reared <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> competitors of the fish for feed and their predators. (4) A total of 37 parameters were used and the relationship among these components and changes in the individual numbers were expressed by a differential equation. (5) Individual numbers of feed organisms were expressed using a logistic model by incorporating predation pressure into the basal model. As parameters, intrinsic rate of increase, carrying capacity and the number of feed organisms preyed on by the <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and other fish were introduced. (6) Change in the individual numbers of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> competitors and predators were expressed using certain parameters such as the decreasing coefficient, feed richness-depending increasing rate and the number of prey. (7) Initial values of the variables and parameters were determined after analyzing the information obtained mainly from Shijiki Bay and analyzing the results of various sensitivity tests of provisional variables and parameters. (8) When conditions of Shijiki Bay from 1976 to 1977, a period during which individual numbers of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> juveniles and their changes thereafter had been well detected, were simulated, the results coincided to the most part with the actually examined results. Simulation using the ecosystem model confirmed a generally considered view that the limit of the carrying capacity for <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> is about two million individuals. (9) Simulation of a releasing experiment of artificial <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> performed in 1984 showed slight differences from the results of an actual tracing examination. It is necessary to re-examine some parameters such as the survival rate of released fishes. 長崎県平戸島志々伎湾において長期間実施されてきた マダイの幼稚魚を中心とする各種生物の生態・動態なら びにそれらをとりまく環境に関する研究成果を整理し， マダイ当歳魚の動態を主軸にした志々伎湾の生態系モデ ルを開発し，モデルの検証を行った。得られた結果は以 下のようである。 （ 1 ）志々伎湾の非生物的要素や動・植物プランクトン， 餌料ベントスの生態・動態・生産過程・マダイ当歳魚 の生活様式，資源変動，環境収容力などに関する既往 の知見を整理し，志々伎湾の生態系モデルの基本的な 考え方，境界条件，導入する状態変数やパラメタの決 定を行った。 （ 2 ）モデルの空間的範囲は，マダイが着底・成長する湾 中央部と湾奥部で，時間的範囲は，標準的な着底時期 の 5 月 5 日から湾外に移出し始める 9 月 5 日までの 4 ヵ月間とした。 （ 3 ）系の構成要素は，マダイの発育につれて順次餌料と なるカイアシ類，ヨコエビ類，アミ類，マダイ天然魚， マダイ放流種苗，餌の面でのマダイとの競合者ならび にそれらに対する捕食者の 7 つである。 （ 4 ）合計 37 個のパラメタを用い，これらの構成要素間の 関係と個体数の変動は微分方程式をもって表現した。 （ 5 ）餌生物の個体数はロジスティックモデルを基本とし， それに捕食圧を組み込んで表現した。パラメタとして は内的増加率，環境収容力，マダイなどによる捕食尾 数を導入した。 （ 6 ）マダイ，競合者，捕食者の個体数の変動には減耗係 数，餌の豊度による増加率あるいは被捕食尾数などの パラメタを用いて表現した。 （ 7 ）各変数の初期値やパラメタは志々伎湾を主体とした 既往の知見を参考にしたり，仮りに与えた幾多の感度 試験の後に確定した。 （ 8 ）志々伎湾へのマダイ稚魚の来遊数とその後の個体数 変化が把握されている 1976 年と 1977 年の状態をシミュ レーションし，実際の調査とほぼ一致した結果を得た。 マダイの環境収容力の限界は，約 200 方尾の来遊であ るとするこれまでの見解を本モデルでのシミュレー ションは追認した。 （ 9 ） 1984 年に実施したマダイ人工種苗の放流実験をシ ミュレーションしたところ，実際の追跡調査結果とは 若干の相違がみられた。放流種苗の生残率などのパラ メタを再検討する必繋が示唆された...|$|E

40|$|Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain {{reaction}} and in situ hybridization, {{the expression of}} the prolactin (PRL) gene was determined during development in gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Sparus aurata) for the first time. The mRNA for PRL was detected from {{the second day of the}} larval stage onwards. This transcript was also located in the adenohypophysial cells, starting at four days post-hatching and was found to be pituitary-specific. Moreover, the possible involvement of PRL in asynchronous growth in the cultivation of gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> was also examined. No differences in the distribution of PRL cells were observed in the three sizes of juvenile gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> studied. These results suggest that the transcription of PRL is involved in the early development stages of <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and that the asynchronous growth-related changes are not due to distinct distribution of PRL cells...|$|R
