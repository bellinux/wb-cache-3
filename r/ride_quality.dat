5|$|The new Holden WB {{commercial}} vehicles and the Statesman WB limousines {{were introduced in}} 1980. However, the designs, based on the HQ and updated HJ, HX and HZ models from the 1970s were less competitive than similar models in Ford's lineup. Thus, Holden abandoned those vehicle classes altogether in 1984. Sales of the Commodore also fell, {{with the effects of}} the 1979 energy crisis lessening, {{and for the first time}} the Commodore lost ground to the Ford Falcon. Sales in other segments also suffered when competition from Ford intensified, and other Australian manufacturers: Mitsubishi, Nissan and Toyota gained market share. When released in 1982, the Camira initially generated good sales, which later declined because buyers considered the 1.6-litre engine underpowered, and the car's build and <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> below-average. The Camira lasted just seven years, and contributed to Holden's accumulated losses of over A$500million by the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, <b>ride</b> <b>quality,</b> handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{arguments}} for maintaining <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> of pavement are expanded {{in this paper}} {{to examine the effects}} of deteriorating <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> on vehicle operating costs, freight damage and logistics. The objectives of this paper are to analyse the effects of different levels of <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> on a truck and its freight, and to discuss potential applications of the analysis in terms of effectiveness of the freight transport system. The paper discusses needs and drivers influencing freight transport costs, vehicle-pavement interaction concepts, and the potential physical effects and costs from roads with deteriorating <b>riding</b> <b>quality.</b> A case study is presented analysing vehicle-pavement interaction for selected roadways in California. It is concluded that investments in pavement and freight transport industry improvements can be investigated by applying vehicle-pavement interaction analysis to evaluate damage to pavement, vehicle and freight that would result from alternative levels of pavement <b>riding</b> <b>quality.</b> The paper recommends that existing concepts, tools and resources such as dedicated truck lanes and vehicle-pavement interaction analysis can help to improve the freight transport system. A framework is proposed to better understand the scale of potential impacts of <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> from localised effects to larger-scale influences, including costs to customers and global competitiveness.

40|$|The Namibian Roads Authority (RA) {{has had a}} {{structured}} method for measuring <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> on the paved road network since 1978. In the beginning the frequency was ad-hoc, but since 1993 the <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> has been measured regularly at about three-yearly intervals. Initially calibrated response type roughness measuring devices were used, but since 2001 measurements were taken with high-speed laser profilometers. The <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> measurements since 2001 have shown an unexpected improvement in <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> although no significant reconstruction work has taken place and the roads are visibly in a poorer condition than in 2001. Careful calibration procedures using Class I instruments were in place. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present the results of an extensive study to identify the source of the discrepancy, and formulating a procedure for adjusting the historical measurements to ensure continuity. The paper discusses the original calibration procedures that were based on precise rod and level measurements, the inherent variability and the current procedures that use a Dipstick. Furthermore, historically the response type roughness measuring devices were calibrated whereas profilometers measure the actual road profile from which the riding qualit...|$|R

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} pavement performance {{is important for}} efficient management of the surface transportation infrastructure. By reducing the error of the pavement deterioration prediction, agencies can obtain significant budget savings through timely intervention and accurate planning. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop a methodology for developing accurate pavement deterioration models to be used primarily for the management of the road infrastructure. The loss of the <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> of the pavement was selected as the performance indicator. Two measures of <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> were used: serviceability (Present Serviceability Index, PSI) and roughness (International Roughness Index, IRI). An acceptable <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> is important for both the road user and the goods being transported. <b>Riding</b> <b>quality</b> affects the comfort of the user for whom the road is provided, and the smoothness with which goods are moved from one point to another. The vehicle operating costs and the costs of transporting goods increase as the road <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> deteriorates. These costs are often one order of magnitude more important than the cost of maintaining the road to an acceptable level of service. The initial incremental models developed in this dissertation predict serviceability as a function of material properties, pavement structural characteristics, traffic axle configuration, axle load, and environmental variables. These models were developed applying nonlinear estimation techniques using an experimental unbalanced panel data set (AASHO Road Test). The unobserved heterogeneity among the pavement sections was accounted for by using the random effects approach. The serviceability models were updated using joint estimation with a field panel data set (MnRoad Project). The updated model estimates <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> in terms of roughness. This was possible by applying a measurement error model to combine both data sources. The main contribution of this research is not the development of a deterioration model itself, but rather the demonstration of the feasibility of using joint estimation and its many advantages, such as: (i) identification and quantification of new variables, (ii) efficient parameter estimates, (iii) bias identification and correction, and (iv) use of a measurement error model to combine apparently incompatible data sources...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{operation of}} a country’s economy depends, among other things, on an efficient logistical system to ensure that goods can be transported efficiently between producers and users. The costs of logistics include aspects such as transport, storage, inventory, and management. Of these, the transport costs are directly influenced by {{the condition of the}} transport infrastructure. The effects of road <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> on the costs of logistics were evaluated through analysis of data on actual truck costs (specifically, vehicle damage and maintenance) obtained from a logistics service provider as well as data on road <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> for the routes used by the company. Analysis of the data indicated that the vehicle operating costs increased with decreasing <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> (as would be expected). Spending adequate resources on the maintenance of routes in a country decreased vehicle fleet operating costs and ultimately the logistics costs of the country. It is recommended that the study be broadened to incorporate a larger sample of vehicles and road conditions. Imperial Logistics[URL]...|$|R

25|$|Among 787 flight systems, a key {{change from}} {{traditional}} airliners is the electrical architecture. The architecture is bleedless and replaces bleed air and hydraulic power sources with electrically powered compressors and pumps, while completely eliminating pneumatics and hydraulics from some subsystems, e.g., engine starters or brakes. Boeing says this system extracts 35 percent less {{power from the}} engines, allowing increased thrust and improved fuel economy. The total available on-board electrical power is 1.45 megawatts, which is five times the power available on conventional pneumatic airliners; the most notable electrically powered systems include engine start, cabin pressurization, horizontal stabilizer trim, and wheel brakes. Wing ice protection is another new system; it uses electro-thermal heater mats on the wing slats instead of traditional hot bleed air.
