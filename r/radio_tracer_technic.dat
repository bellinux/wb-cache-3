In the present thesis, both experimental and numerical approaches were applied to investigate the behavior of biomass gasification at high temperature and high heating rate conditions. Devolatilization of biomass and conversion of solid char are two most important steps in the gasification process. In order to assess the behavior of the rapid devolatilization of biomass, biomass particles (forest residue, torrefied forest residue, Norwegian spruce, and torrefied Norwegian spruce) were subjected to devolatilization experiments at 1073 K and 1473 K in an electrical heated drop tube reactor (DTR). A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation with a proposed two-competing rate devolatilization model was also performed and compared to the experimental results. The conversion behavior of forest residue char and torrefied forest residue char were further examined under oxidation and gasification conditions at 1473 K and 1573 K in the same DTR. The morphological analysis of the parent biomass and corresponding char were showed. In addition, time-resolved data on compositional transformation of the biomass and char were presented based on the metal <b>tracer</b> <b>technics.</b> In parallel, Eulerian–Lagrangian CFD models were developed to study the overall gasification process in two types of reactors: entrained-flow reactor (EFR) and fluidized-bed reactor (FBR). Comprehensive CFD simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of biomass gasification in an EFR operating at 1273 - 1673 K. The model was validated against a wide range of experimental data. Several influential factors including reactor temperature, steam/carbon molar ratio, excess air ratio, biomass type, and particle size were discussed. Regarding the FBR, particle flow pattern, bed expansion, bed pressure drop and fluctuation frequency were compared by using three different well-known inter-phase drag force correlations in a non-reactive condition. Steam gasification in FBRs was analyzed by the CFD model developed from a non-reactive study. Both qualitative and quantitative results were presented to reveal the effects of reactor temperature, steam/biomass ratio, and biomass injection position on gasification of biomass...|$|R

Removal of Na+ from the bath solution under voltage clamp conditions {{led to a}} decrease in the clamp current indicating the existence of native Na+ conductances. The observed current was voltage dependent but showed no marked rectification. Amiloride (10 μM) blocked this Na+ current reversibly. However, amiloride analogues such as benzamil and phenamil had no effect on this Na+ conductance. The Na+/H+-exchanger blocker EIPA (5 -(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride), another amiloride analogue, also had no effect thereby excluding a possible involvement of the Na+/H+ exchanger. The Na+ mediated current had a reversal potential of about 50 mV suggesting high selectivity of these Na+ conductances for Na+ over other monovalent cations. When Na+ was replaced by K+ in the bath solution, amiloride had no effect on the clamp current over the whole potential range demonstrating that only Na+ but not K+ can enter the cell via the investigated conductances. In <b>radio</b> <b>tracer</b> experiments 22 Na+ influx into oocytes was nearly halved in presence of amiloride (10 μM), whereas benzamil and phenamil again failed to influence 22 Na+ influx.

An in vitro model of catheter-directed venous thrombolysis {{was used to compare}} the three agents. Methods: Retracted iodine 125 – radiolabeled clots that simulate those observed in the venous system were infused with thrombolytic agents at doses analogous to those used clinically. Perfusion with heparinized, whole human blood was undertaken for 60 minutes, measuring the efficacy of thrombolysis through serial quantification of <b>radio</b> <b>tracer</b> released into the circuit. Fibrinolytic specificity was determined by following decrements in perfusate fibrinogen concentration. Results: Streptokinase was the agent associated with the slowest rate of clot lysis (p = 0. 01 vs urokinase and rt-PA). Urokinase was associated with an intermediate rate of lysis but appeared to be the agent with the greatest degree of fibrinolytic specificity (p = 0. 02 vs streptokinase, p = 0. 05 vs rt-PA). Although rt-PA was associated with improved efficacy early in the perfusions, the differences between rt-PA and urokinase dissipated after 30 minutes. Conclusions: These laboratory observations suggest that urokinase may be the most appropriate agent for catheter-directed venous thrombolysis, offering an advantageous compromise between fibrinolytic specificity and thrombolytic speed.

We model these regions in two ways: a simple model consisting of uniform gas radiating in spontaneous emission, or as a collection of many compact HII regions in non-LTE. The multiple HII region model provides a better fit to the data and predicts many dense (ne ~ 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 5 cm- 3), compact (< 0. 1 pc) HII regions.

In order to assess the methanotrophic activity, three treatments were used: (i) only 14 CH 4 added, (ii) 14 CH 4 and O 2 (a final concentration of 40  μM O 2) added, and (iii) 14 CH 4 and Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 S (final concentrations of 10  mM and 0.5  mM, respectively) added. The additional O 2 or Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 S were introduced either as a gas or as a solution sealed in a glass ampoule. The final concentrations of 14 C-labeled tracers in the bottles were estimated to be about 0.1  mM, 0.4  mM, 0.4  mM, 0.1  mM, 0.1  mM, and 0.1  mM for bicarbonate, methane, carbon monoxide, formate, acetate, and leucine, respectively. After placing the <b>radio</b> isotope <b>tracer</b> into the bottle with three stainless-steel balls, the bottle was evacuated with a vacuum pump. The bottle was then sealed and shaken, which resulted in the stainless-steel balls rapturing the glass ampoules containing the radio-isotope-tracers and formaldehyde. At the seafloor, the sampling nozzle of the radio-isotope-tracer sampler was placed in the discharging CORK fluid and sufficiently flushed. Fluid sample was collected by opening and closing the valve with the ROV manipulator. Immediately after recovery of the ROV, sample bottles were incubated at 4  °C for 49 – 123  days until measurement in a shore-based laboratory. The bottles containing 4 % formaldehyde were used as negative controls (i.e., with no microbial activity).|$|R

Bacteriol. 91 : 134 – 142. 1966. —Exposure of Staphylococcus aureus MF 31 to {{sublethal}} temperatures produced a temporary {{change in the}} salt tolerance and growth of the organism. After sublethal heat treatment at 55 C for 15 min, more than 99 % of the viable population was unable to reproduce on media containing 7. 5 % NaCl. The data presented demonstrate that thermal injury, in part, occurred owing {{to changes in the}} cell membrane, which allowed soluble cellular components to leak into the heating menstruum. When the cells were placed in a limiting medium, complete recovery did not occur, regardless of the incubation time. The temperature and the pH which produced the optimal rate of recovery were similar to those described previously for the multiplication of uninjured cells. However, the rate of recovery as well as the unchanging total count during recovery indicated that cell multiplication was not a factor during the recovery process. The nutrient requirements for the complete recovery of injured cells consisted of a solution containing an energy source, such as glucose, a mixture of amino acids, and phosphate. The use of the metabolic inhibitors, penicillin, cycloserine, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, and chloramphenicol, did not inhibit recovery. Actinomycin D, however, completely suppressed recovery. This result implied that ribonucleic acid synthesis was particularly involved; this inference was substantiated by <b>radio</b> <b>tracer</b> experiments. The rate at which label was incorporated in the nucleic acid fraction paralleled that of recovery and the return of salt tolerance...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{spectral}} energy distribution (SED) {{of the radio}} continuum emission from the KINGFISH sample of nearby galaxies to understand the energetics and origin of this emission. Effelsberg multi-wavelength observations at 1. 4 GHz, 4. 8 GHz, 8. 5 GHz, and 10. 5 GHz combined with archive data allow us, for the first time, to determine the mid-radio continuum (1 - 10 GHz, MRC) bolometric luminosities and further present calibration relations vs. the monochromatic radio luminosities. The 1 - 10 GHz radio SED is fitted using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique leading to measurements for the nonthermal spectral index and the thermal fraction f_th with mean values of alpha_nt= 0. 97 +- 0. 16 (0. 79 +- 0. 15 for the total spectral index) and f_th= 10 % +- 9 % at 1. 4 GHz. The MRC luminosity changes over ~ 3 orders of magnitude in the sample. The thermal emission is responsible for ~ 23 % of the MRC on average. We also compare the extinction-corrected diagnostics of star formation rate with the thermal and nonthermal <b>radio</b> <b>tracers</b> and derive the first star formation calibration relations using the MRC radio luminosity. The nonthermal spectral index flattens with increasing star formation rate surface density, indicating {{the effect of the}} star formation feedback on the cosmic ray electron population in galaxies. Comparing the radio and IR SEDs, we find that the FIR-to-MRC ratio could decrease with star formation rate, due to the amplification of the magnetic fields in star forming regions. This particularly implies a decrease in the ratio at high redshifts, where mostly luminous/star forming galaxies are detected.

40|$|Nuclear starbursts and AGN {{activity}} {{are the main}} heating processes in luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and their relationship is fundamental to understand galaxy evolution. In this paper, we study the star-formation and AGN activity of a sample of 11 local LIRGs imaged with subarcsecond angular resolution at radio (8. 4 GHz) and near-infrared (2. 2 μm) wavelengths. This allows us to characterize the central kpc of these galaxies with a spatial resolution of ≃ 100 pc. In general, we find a good spatial correlation between the radio and the near-IR emission, although radio emission {{tends to be more}} concentrated in the nuclear regions. Additionally, we use an MCMC code to model their multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) using template libraries of starburst, AGN and spheroidal/cirrus models, determining the luminosity contribution of each component, and finding that all sources in our sample are starburst-dominated, except for NGC 6926 with an AGN contribution of ≃ 64 %. Our sources show high star formation rates (40 to 167 M_yr^- 1), supernova rates (0. 4 to 2. 0 SNyr^- 1), and similar starburst ages (13 to 29 Myr), except for the young starburst (9 Myr) in NGC 6926. A comparison of our derived star-forming parameters with estimates obtained from different IR and <b>radio</b> <b>tracers</b> shows an overall consistency among the different star formation tracers. AGN tracers based on mid-IR, high-ionization line ratios also show an overall agreement with our SED model fit estimates for the AGN. Finally, we use our wide-band VLA observations to determine pixel-by-pixel radio spectral indices for all galaxies in our sample, finding a typical median value (α≃- 0. 8) for synchrotron-powered LIRGs.

40|$|Two Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of iron status and iron source on iron bioavailability using the rat model. Beef was proportionally mixed with spinach (Experiment I) or soy protein isolate (Experiment II) to test if meat enhances the absorption of iron from spinach or SPI. Five diets with the iron from meat:spinach (or SPI) ratios of 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75 and 0 : 100 were prepared and fed to rats. FeS 04 {{was used as a}} reference. Two trials of rats were used in Experiment I. In trial I, half of the rats were made severely iron deficient (Hb 6. 3 g/dl) and the other half mildly iron deficient (Hb 8. 8 g/dl). In trial II, half of the rats were depleted to severe iron deficiency and the remainder were not depleted (Hb 11. 3 g/dl). Hemoglobin regeneration efficiency (HRE), apparent absorption and 59 Fe absorption were compared. The HREs were 41, 53 and 36 % (spinach); 42, 51,and 44 % (beef) and 73, 66 and 46 % (FeS 04) in severely, mildly iron-depleted and healthy rats and 56 and 42 % (SPI) in iron-depleted and healthy rats, respectively. Iron depletion stimulated iron absorption. This effect was very significant for rats fed a FeS 04 supplemented diet and lessened for rats fed diets containing beef, spinach or SPI as the iron source. Spinach and soy protein isolate were good iron sources both having similar iron bioavailabilities as beef. Beef ~as a good iron source, as noted in other reports; however, enhancement of meat on absorption of iron from spinach and SPI did not occur. Hemoglobin regeneration efficiency is a simple, accurate and definitive method for measuring effects of iron source and iron status on iron bioavailability. Apparent absorption gives similar values to HRE. However, it requires meticulous iron analysis and has more potential for errors. Extrinsic radioisotope tagging is an easy method, but there is evidence of possible incomplete exchange of <b>radio</b> <b>tracer</b> with iron in food. The different absorption pattern between FeS 04 and food iron suggests a third iron pool, highly soluble iron salt, in addition to heme and nonheme iron complex pools...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 A {{study was}} made {{on the effect of}} CCC (2 -chloroethyl) -trimethyl-ammonium chloride), a plant growth retardant, on the RNA (ribonucleic acid) content of wheat plants, It was found that the RNA content of wheat leaves {{generally}} decreased with increasing levels of CCC up to 1 x 10 ⁻⁵M. Thereafter, the RNA content again increased until the threshold of toxicity to wheat for this compound was reached. Very low levels, 1 x 10 ⁻⁸M., of CCC tended to slightly increase the RNA content of the same tissue. There was a qualitative difference in the RNA of treated plants as compared to the non-treated check. This qualitative difference was demonstrated by an alteration of the maximum absorbing wave length in the ultra-violet region of the spectrum. The non-treated material had the greatest optical density at 256. 1 mμ, treatments of 1 x 10 ⁻⁸M. and 1 x 10 ⁻⁷M. CCC had a maximum optical density at 257 mμ, while the treatments of 1 x 10 ⁻⁶M. to 1 x 10 ⁻⁴M. CCC had an absorption peak at 257. 75 mμ. The <b>radio</b> <b>tracer</b> data suggested there was less RNA-C¹⁴ present in the leaves of the plants treated at 1 x 10 ⁻⁵M. CCC compared to those of the non-treated in the period of thirty to thirty-three hours after the initial exposure to C¹⁴O₂. Thereafter, the labeled RNA appeared in nearly equal amounts in both tissues. The RNA-C¹⁴ level of the non-treated plants was almost constant in all of the harvests after the thirty-six hour period, whereas that of the treated material was quite variable. This data is interpreted as evidence of a cyclic synthesis and degradation of RNA, the periodicity of the cycle is a multiple of eight hours (the period between harvests). The CCC treated material also appeared to have a cycle. However, this cycle was out of phase with that of the normal plant. The cyclic nature of the RNA content was also determined spectrophotometrically. It was also apparent that the rate of RNA degradation was greatest in the plants treated with CCC. The RNA content data presented here were considered with that of the 2, 4 -D and other CCC work, the hypothesis that CCC increases the diffusible auxin content of treated tissue is supported...|$|R
