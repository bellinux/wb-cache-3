5000|$|The {{turbine blades}} expanded, however, {{contacting}} the honeycomb labyrinth seals {{and allowing the}} metal to scrape together when the engine overheated, with zero core rotation. When the engine is shut down at altitude, the core begins to cool, and the stator, including the static interstage static seal (ISS), contracts {{at a faster rate}} than the adjacent rotating parts in both the radial and axial direction because of its smaller thermal time constant. The relative rate of cooling of the stator and rotor results in an alignment of the rotating-seal knife edges aft of the normal operating groove in the static seal. If the clearances are tight enough and the relative cooling rates are right, contact can occur between the static and <b>rotating</b> <b>seal</b> elements. The resulting stiction can temporarily prevent the rotor from turning when only the force of ram air is applied to the core. Air turbine starter (ATS) torque has been shown adequate to overcome this restriction. Thus, when the engine cooled, the assembly did not match anymore, and the blades could not rotate freely. The crew ended the descent when they had reached 230 kn but neither engine core (N2) ever indicated any rotation during the entire descent. Since they were too high for an APU start, the ram air turbine (known as an [...] "air-driven generator" [...] on Bombardier products) was deployed to provide electric power for the aircraft, and the crew donned oxygen masks, as the cabin slowly depressurized due to loss of pressurization air from the engines.|$|E

40|$|The {{pressure}} wave generator {{is a critical}} component of a pulse tube refrigerator. Conventionally either a solenoid operated electromagnetic valve or a rotary valve driven by a hermetically sealed motor is used for this. In this article, we present a novel {{pressure wave}} generator design based on cam operated valves for use with pulse tube refrigerators. This, when coupled with an inverter drive (variable frequency drive), forms a versatile pressure wave generator in the range between 1 and 10 Hz.

A problem also encountered in fossil feed pump applications using similar electrically low conductive feed water, referred to as Combined Water Treated (CWT) feed water operation. After a short number of operating hours, <b>rotating</b> <b>seal</b> faces made from various kinds of silicon- or tungsten carbide materials show severe forms of edge chipping and crater type damages, while the opposing carbon graphite seal faces, may display a significant loss of seal face binder material, which inevitably results {{in the formation of}} uncontrolled radial flow channels across the seal face gap.

This tutorial discusses the pragmatic approach, which was applied to investigate what major contributing factors {{play a role in the}} development of seal face generated electro corrosion and how it can be avoided. While satisfactorily results are achieved for applications with a water purity down to 0, 5 ?S/cm using more traditional seal face materials, research shows that for the very purest of water qualities (i. e. electrical conductivities 0, 055 < X < 0, 5 ?S/cm), a new development step is required to suppress seal face generated electro corrosion.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 136 - 142) In view {{of their}} greatly increased sample capacity and optimized internal geometry, zonal rotors have become increasingly popular instruments for quantitative centrifugal fractionations of animal and plant tissues on density gradients. Nearly all zonal rotors presently in use require a rotating- seal assembly which necessitates dynamic loading and unloading of the rotor. As a consequence of certain disadvantages which accompany dynamic unloading and numerous difficulties encountered {{in the use of}} a <b>rotating</b> <b>seal,</b> the possibility of employing simpler, seal-less zonal rotors to effect similar quantitative biological separations was investigated. Three seal-less zonal rotors were tested which were loaded either statically or dynamically but were always statically unloaded. The rotors were designed so that the liquid density gradient underwent a stable reorientation between a vertical and radial array during acceleration and deceleration. Rotor performance was evaluated using variety of techniques and the rotors then applied to a series of quantitative tissue fractionations. These included: (l) the separation of whole homogenates of liver into fractions containing nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, rnicrosomes and soluble constituents; (2) the separation of discrete populations of liver nuclei on the basis of size differences; (3) the separation of lysosomes and peroxisomes using a replenished gradient technique; (4) the isolation of protein bodies from seeds and (5) the separation of intact and broken chloroplasts from plant leaves. In addition to providing a simpler means for separating cellular components by zonal centrifugation, the reorienting gradient rotors were found to provide a number of interesting and important advantages over zonal rotors with rotating seals...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Vehicles used in military, agricultural, forestry, or {{construction}} applications often encounter different road surfaces {{during a}} single journey. In order to optimise {{the mobility of}} these vehicles, different tyre pressures are required for different types of terrain (sand, mud, cross country, tar road, etc.). An in-motion tyre pressure control system will enable the vehicle's operator to change the tyre pressures without leaving the vehicle. Such a system will not only allow optimum surface contact between the tyres and the terrain - thus improving vehicletraction, {{but it can also}} increase the lifespan of the tyres and reduce fuel consumption. The key design criteria for such a system are: quick reaction times, an effective operator interface, and reliability. In case of system failure, the operator must be able to override the control, and the tyres should be inflated to a pre-set default pressure. When the fault had been corrected, the system can be restarted from within the cabin, to inflate or deflate the tyres as required. The focus of this thesis is on the design criteria of a tyre pressure control system, receiving inputs from the driver and from onboard vehicle sensors; and then adjusting individual tyre pressures if necessary, while the vehicle is on the move. Based on the inputs to the control system, the optimum setting for the tyre pressure is determined from a look-up table stored in memory of an onboard computer. This table contains the pressure-speed and pressure-axle load relationship. A unique relation is programmed into the microprocessor for each different vehicle. To install a tyre pressure control system on a vehicle, a computer program is used to control the following hardware which are necessary to inflate or deflate tyres: An air compressor and storage tank. Pneumatic valve. <b>Rotating</b> <b>seal.</b> Pressure and speed sensing elements. Electronic control unit.
