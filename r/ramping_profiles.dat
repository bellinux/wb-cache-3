40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} dynamic response of convectively heated buildings and their respective space heating peak demands for different room temperature set point profiles and thermal mass levels, {{with a focus on}} the impact of thermal model resolution on the peak demand calculation. Experiments were conducted at two identical and highly instrumented houses. One house is modified with different oor coverings, while the other is kept unchanged and used for reference. Through experimentation and simulation, peak power (due to space heating) reduction strategies are investigated. Twelve equivalent RC thermal network models of varying model resolution are developed for a north zone of the houses. Modelling approximations including linearization of the heat transfer, spatial and/or temporal discretization and approximations for reduction in model complexity are implemented into the models and their effects are investigated. The focus is on simple and physically meaningful building thermal models suited for model-based control. The models are used to study the impact of set point ramping lengths and-optimal" transition curves between two temperatures on peak demand reductions for a very cold day. Alterations to walls and ceilings in the models were done to hypothetically modify their properties in the zone and the effects in combination with <b>ramping</b> <b>profiles</b> were analyzed. This work can inform the development of new building materials. A commercial building is also considered and two low order RC thermal network are compared. The first model excludes the mass of the interior partitions, while the second model incorporates them. An advantage of the model with interior partitions is it can be used for retrofit studies...|$|E

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2010. This study explores {{the application of}} multibody modeling techniques {{in an attempt to}} capture the flexible behavior of biological tissues inside of a rigid body mechanics software. To accomplish this, segmented multibody models of canine menisci were created and the parameters governing the interaction of adjacent segments were tuned to create an overall physiological meniscus behavior. To this extent an experiment was designed to determine whole meniscus deformation under a semi-physiological loading. Additionally, indentation testing of articular cartilage of the canine stifle was performed with the intent of calibrating a cartilage multibody model. The meniscus testing included both sinusoidal and linear <b>ramp</b> loading <b>profiles</b> as well as two separate boundary conditions. Design of Experiments was then used to minimize the error in the model relative to the sinusoidal trials and the <b>ramp</b> <b>profiles</b> were used for validation.

40|$|The {{underlying}} principle behind most {{optical flow}} algorithms {{is that the}} brightness of a pixel remains {{the same as it}} flows from one frame to the next. The first order Taylor approximation used in formulating this brightness constancy principle may not be accurate when intensity profiles change non-linearly. In this paper, we propose a method of alleviating the effect of this approximation. Instead of computing image gradients using conventional horizontal and vertical filters of fixed coefficients and sizes, we propose to obtain the gradient information by an explicit examination of <b>ramp</b> <b>profiles</b> at a given location, in all directions. The gradient information obtained using the proposed analysis is more robust under non-linear changes in intensity profiles. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating the ramp structure information as proposed, we are able to improve existing optical flow algorithms. 1...|$|R

40|$|Spot size {{converters}} (waveguide tapers) are {{key elements}} for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) since they {{significantly reduce the}} effort and cost of the device packaging. In comparison to other technologies like micro lenses or lensed fibres the implementation of spot size converters can also reduce the optical insertion loss of the devices. The basic technological challenge is the fabrication of a vertical ramp with a maximum height of around 1 mu m and a length of 500 - 1000 mu m. Several approaches to form this ramp have been reported including shadow mask etching, shadow mask epitaxy and selective area growth. All this methods have in common that they require special processes which are rather complicated, expensive and inflexible in terms of tailoring of the <b>ramp</b> <b>profile.</b> In this paper, we present a novel method for the fabrication of spot size converters which can produce almost arbitrary taper profiles and requires only standard lithography and etching processes and can therefore easily be implemented into standard waveguide processes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} {{evolution}} of the gravity flow sedimentary within a large shelf-edge delta (Eastern Niger delta) over the last 2, 5 Myr taking into account the influence of the contemporaneous gravity driven deformation and sedimentary supply. To do this, we mapped (i) the shoreline geometry and (ii) the associated turbiditic systems for 9 intervals using a classification based on three morphological end-members: erosive, constructive and depositional modes. We characterized the depositional profile of the passive margin delta from the littoral domain to the abyssal plain and its spatial and temporal variability. We showed that, at the scale of the delta, the depositional profile varied from (i) a shelf edge delta profile with a slope break at the location of the shoreline during progradation to (ii) a <b>ramp</b> <b>profile</b> characteristic of a mid-shelf delta during retrogradation. Thus, during a stratigraphic cycle, the delta front evolved from a prograding slope break during the development of the HST, to steepening clinoforms during the development of the LST that progressively flattened out during the TST to reach a <b>ramp</b> <b>profile</b> at the MFS. The turbiditic systems (including MTC) initiate near the shoreline, at the toe of the delta front. Also, they form preferentially down slope synthetic faults or within antithetic fault relays. They are initially erosive, becoming constructive further down slope and eventually depositional. They may become erosive again as they cut through the compressional structures. We showed that the stratigraphic state (progradation/retrogradation) controls the amount of sediment reaching the platform and strongly impacts the density of gravity flow sedimentary systems (low density during progradation and high density during progradation). On the other hand, the gravity driven deformation controls the slope of the sea-floor and, in doing so, their morphology (erosive/constructive/depositional). Within this framework, lateral migrations of the delta impact both the spatial distribution of gravity driven deformation and gravity flow sedimentary systems. We think these results may be extrapolated to many shelf-edge deltas affected by gravity-driven deformation. Also, these results provide us with a tool to predict the spatial distribution of the domains in erosion/transit/sedimentation of the gravity flow sedimentary systems as well as their expected lithologies...|$|R

We were interested in determining whether a reverse <b>ramp</b> <b>profile</b> would yield the same response dynamics. Ten healthy males performed a maximum incremental -ramp (15 - 30 WÂ·min- 1, depending on fitness). On another day, the work rate (WR) was increased abruptly to the incremental maximum and then decremented at the same rate of 15 - 30 W. min- 1 (step-decremental ramp). Five subjects also performed a sub-maximal ramp-decremental test from 90 % of Ó¨L. VO 2 was determined breath-by-breath from continuous monitoring of respired volumes (turbine) and gas concentrations (mass spectrometer). The incremental-ramp VO 2 -WR slope was 10. 3 Â± 0. 7 mlÂ·min- 1 Â·W- 1, whereas that of the descending limb of the decremental ramp was 14. 2 Â± 1. 1 mlÂ·min- 1 Â·W- 1 (p < 0. 005). The sub-maximal decremental-ramp slope, however, was only 9. 8 Â± 0. 9 mlÂ·min- 1 Â·W- 1 : not significantly {{different from that of the}} incremental-ramp.

40|$|Successful {{operation}} of the APS storage ring (SR) in top-off mode requires a reliable injector system that efficiently delivers up to 10 nC of charge at 7 GeV to the SR. One way to possibly improve injector reliability is to inject the linac beam directly into the booster and bypass the PAR. Direct injection into the booster imposes several requirements on the booster rf system. First, the rf must capture the complete linac beam {{or at least a}} large fraction of it. Second, bunch purity must be preserved. Third, the whole acceleration process from injection to extraction at 7 GeV must be as efficient (as measured by particle loss) as possible at up to 10 nC of extracted charge. Finally, the rf system parameters should be chosen to preserve the present linear <b>ramp</b> <b>profile</b> used in the booster (0. 325 to 7 GeV in 223 ms). The last requirement minimizes the required recommissiong effort since the magnet ramps are left unchanged. These requirements can be achieved by adding a subharmonic rf system at the appropriate frequency and gap voltage in the booster. The subharmonic system in combination with the present booster 352 -MHz rf system act together to accelerate the beam to 7 GeV while minimizing beam loss and preserving bunch purity.

The outlier is completely composed of volcanic trap rock, the Ladentown basalt, which covers a considerable area, running at or beneath the surface for a length of about two miles with a width of about a mile. [...] Originally, because of its close proximity to the Palisades, the Ladentown basalt was thought to be an extension of the intrusive sill. It is now known from magnetic and gravity measurements that the Ladentown basalt is linked to the Palisades by a significant subsurface volcanic dike, but it is definitely an extrusive feature, displaying Orange Mountain Basalt characteristic of First Watchung Mountain. [...] This makes the Ladentown basalt unique among the Watchung basalts in that it appears to be rooted to an intrusive feature.

It represents a carbonate platform initiation in a hostile environment. This work is mainly based on the stratotype, corresponding to two stratigraphic sections located in Couvin, along the southern border of the Dinant Synclinorium. These sections are the Eau Noire and Falaise de l'Abime sections. Unfortunately, they are discontinuous. To allow {{a better understanding of}} the sedimentary dynamics, the data are complemented by a shorter but continuous section located in Villers-la-Tour (3. 5 km West of Chimay). Petrographic study leads to the definition of 14 microfacies which are integrated in a palaeogeographical model. It corresponds to a platform setting where the reef complex is mainly constituted by an accumulation of crinoids, stromatoporoids and tabulate corals. The microfacies evolution is interpreted in terms of bathymetrical variations. It shows a general shallowing-upward trend encompassing the vertical succession of fore-reef settings, reef development, back-reef and then lagoon environment. This interpretation is supported by trends in mean magnetic susceptibility data, providing {{a better understanding of the}} sedimentary dynamics. Moreover, these data show positive correlation with concentrations of detritic minerals, but an inverse relationship with well washed skeletal limestones.

40|$|International audienceIt {{is usually}} very {{difficult}} to identify and quantify the relative influence of tectonics, eustasy and climateon carbonate system evolution from sedimentary records. In order to improve our understanding of these mechanisms, we have traced for the first time, {{the evolution of the}} eastern Paris Basin platform throughout the entire Jurassic period. This carbonate platform underwent eight successive growth and demise phases, with different depositional <b>profiles</b> ranging from <b>ramps</b> to flat-topped geometries. The eight carbonate growth periods are compared with the standard sea-level curves, local tectonic regimes and recently published oxygen-isotope and/or clay mineralogy databases. Prograding heterozoan facies along <b>ramp</b> <b>profiles</b> mark periods dominated by second-order eustatic sea-level rise, relatively cool sea surface temperatures, and mesotrophic and humid conditions (Hettangian, Pliensbachian, late Oxfordian, Tithonian). During these periods, variable detrital contents in the sedimentary succession hampered the efficiency of shallow-marine carbonate factories. Higher sea surface temperatures, oligotrophic and humid conditions associated with either eustatic sea-level rise or very high local subsidence occurred during the early Bajocian and the mid-Oxfordian. These seawater properties seem to have favoured the aggradation of scleractinian corals forming dome-shaped bioherm buildups. An oolitic and lime-mud carbonate system, deposited during the Bathonian second-order eustatic sea-level fall, is characterised by miliolid-rich micritic facies on a rimmed-ramp under stable, cooler and drier conditions. The secondorder maximum flooding associated with a sea surface temperature decline and/or a seawater eutrophication caused at least five carbonate demise periods (i. e.

Birds were exposed to a <b>ramped</b> <b>profile</b> of progressively increasing Ta, with continuous monitoring of behaviour and Tb used to identify the onset of severe hyperthermia. The maximum Ta birds tolerated ranged from 48 Â°C to 54 Â°C, and was positively related to Mb. Values of Tb associated with severe heat stress were in the range of 44 to 45 Â°C. Rates of evaporative water loss (EWL) increased rapidly when Ta exceeded Tb, and maximum evaporative heat dissipation was equivalent to 141 â 222 % of metabolic heat production. Fractional increases in EWL between Ta< 40 Â°C and the highest Ta reached by each species were 10. 8 (S. squamifrons), 18. 4 (P. socius) and 16. 0 (P. mahali).

40|$|Dopamine modulatory {{activity}} critically supports motivated behavior. This modulation {{operates at}} multiple timescales, but the functional roles of these distinct dynamics on cognition {{are still being}} characterized. Reward processing has been robustly linked to dopamine activity; thus, examining behavioral effects of reward anticipation at different timing intervals, corresponding to different putative dopaminergic dynamics, may help in characterizing the functional role of these dynamics. Towards this end we present two research studies investigating reward motivation effects on cognitive control and episodic memory, converging in their manipulation of rapid versus multi-second reward anticipation (consistent with timing profiles of phasic versus ramping dopamine, respectively) on performance. Under prolonged reward anticipation, both control and memory performances were enhanced, specifically when combined with other experimental factors: task-informative cues (control task) and reward uncertainty (memory task). Given observations of ramping dopamine under uncertainty (Fiorillo et al., 2003) and arguments that uncertainty may act as a control signal increasing environmental monitoring (Mushtaq et al., 2011), we suggest that task information and reward uncertainty can both serve as âneed for controlâ signals that facilitate learning via enhanced monitoring, and that this activity may be supported by a <b>ramping</b> <b>profile</b> of dopaminergic activity. Observations of rapid (i. e., phasic) reward on control and memory performance can be interpreted in line with prior evidence, but review indicates that contributions of different dopaminergic timescales in these processes are not well-understood.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to show how changes in surface electromyographic {{activity}} (sEMG) during a repetitive, non-constant force contraction can be detected and interpreted {{on the basis of}} the amplitude distribution provided by high-density sEMG techniques. Twelve healthy male subjects performed isometric shoulder elevations, repeating five times a force <b>ramp</b> <b>profile</b> up to 25 % of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). A 64 -electrode matrix was used to detect sEMG from the trapezius muscle. The sEMG amplitude distribution was obtained for the force levels in the range 5 - 25 % MVC with steps of 5 % MVC. The effect of force level, subject, electrode position and ramp repetition on the sEMG amplitude distribution was tested. The sEMG amplitude was significantly smaller in the columns of the electrode grid over the tendons (repeated measures ANOVA, p < 0. 01). The barycentre of the distribution of sEMG amplitude was subject-specific (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0. 01), and shifted caudally with the increase of force levels and cranially with the repetition of the motor task (both p < 0. 01, repeated measures ANOVA). The results are discussed in terms of motor unit recruitment in different muscle sub-portions. It is concluded that the sEMG amplitude distribution obtained by multichannel techniques provides useful information in the study of muscle activity, and that changes in the spatial distribution of the recruited motor units during a force varying isometric contraction might partially explain the variability observed in the activation pattern of the upper trapezius muscl...|$|R

The ramp displays facies gradients involving updip grainstones which pass downdip into broad, spatially extensive tracts of microbial laminites and finely laminated mudstones deposited above and below storm wave base. Trough cross-bedded, coarse grainstones are shown to transit downdip into finer-grained calcarenites, irregular microbial laminites and mottled laminites. Siliciclastic siltstones and shales were deposited further downdip. Platform growth was terminated through smothering by orogen-derived siliciclastic deposits. Ramp morphology was controlled by several different processes which acted across many orders of magnitude (millimetres to kilometres), including in situ growth of mats and reefs, scouring by wave-produced currents, and transport and infilling of coarse-grained carbonates and fine-grained carbonates and clastics. At the smallest scale, ârougheningâ of the sea-floor through heterogeneous trapping and binding by microbial mats was balanced by smoothing of the sea-floor through accumulation of loose sediment to fill the topographic lows within the upward-propagating mat. At the next scale up, parasequence development involved roughening of the sea-floor through shoal growth and grainstone progradation, balanced by sea-floor smoothing through shale infilling of resulting downdip accommodation, {{as well as the}} metre-scale topographic depressions within the mosaic of shoal-water facies. At even larger (sequence/platform) scales, roughening of the sea-floor occurred through aggradation and progradation of thick carbonates, balanced by infilling of the foreland basin with orogen-derived siliciclastic sediments.

We investigated seasonal (summer versus winter) {{variation in}} heat tolerance and evaporative cooling in an Afrotropical ploceid passerine, the white-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali; â¼ 47 g) at three sites along a climatic gradient {{with more than}} 10 Â°C variation in mid-summer maximum air temperature (Ta). We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) using open flow-through respirometry, and core body temperature (Tb) using passive integrated transponder tags. Sparrow-weavers were exposed to a <b>ramped</b> <b>profile</b> of progressively higher Ta between 30 and 52 Â°C to elicit maximum evaporative cooling capacity (N= 10 per site per season); the maximum Ta birds tolerated {{before the onset of}} severe hyperthermia (Tb â 44 Â°C) was considered to be their hyperthermia threshold Ta (Ta,HT). Our data reveal significant seasonal acclimatisation of heat tolerance, with a desert population of sparrow-weavers reaching significantly higher Ta in summer (49. 5 Â± 1. 4 Â°C, i. e. higher Ta,HT) than in winter (46. 8 Â± 0. 9 Â°C), reflecting enhanced evaporative cooling during summer. Moreover, desert sparrow-weavers had significantly higher heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity during summer compared with populations from more mesic sites (Ta,HT= 47. 3 Â± 1. 5 and 47. 6 Â± 1. 3 Â°C). A better understanding of the contributions of local adaptation versus phenotypic plasticity to intraspecific variation in avian heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity is needed for modelling species' responses to changing climates.

40|$|In Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) {{the clutch}} control {{strategies}} {{to manage the}} engagement operation and clutch vibrational behaviour are mutual interdependent and only an optimized mechatronic design could lead to an effective target from several points of view: passengers' comfort, fuel economy, system reliability, performance, driving feeling, etc. In fact, noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) phenomena are crucial subjects in the modern automotive industry. In passenger car equipped with automatic transmissions the electronic management of the coupling between engine and transmission couldnât provide sensible improvement of comfort and overall vehicle performance during gearshifts without the availability of dependable models of the flywheel, clutch and driveline as powerful tools for vehicle design engineers. In this paper, simulations of driveline vibrational behaviour have been performed by implementing a high-order multi-body model for the dry clutch mechanism {{with the purpose of}} studying the excitation of torsional vibration caused by frictional actions during the slip phase of the clutch engagement in manual or automated manual transmissions. The analysis aims at deepen about the coupling between pressure plate wobbling and torsional motions in order to improve the current understanding of the excitation mechanisms in the frequency region of the so-called âeek noiseâ, 250 - 500 Hz. The results of this work substantiate that enhancing of torsional motion in the characteristic frequency range of the eek effect occurs in vehicle launch and gear shifting operations regardless of the rigid wobbling motion of the pressure plate. Such outcomes underline the need to include the non-linear characteristic of the clutch cushion spring in the simulation frictional induced vibration originated at clutch level. Simulations of gear-shifting operations have been carried out by applying <b>ramp</b> <b>profiles</b> to the clutch throwout bearing according to the requirements of typical manoeuvres in passenger cars...|$|R
40|$|This work {{details for}} the first time the {{sedimentology}} of the Marenne quarry. It exposes a remarkable succession of strata from the Trois-Fontaines Formation and the base of the Terres dâHaurs Formation. Two sections (Marenne East and Marenne Centre) are investigated within the quarry. The first one (115 metres) covers both formations and is characterized by a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic succession replacing the classical base of the Trois-Fontaines Formation. We propose here to include these particular facies into a new member of the Trois-Fontaines Formation, the Marenne Member. The second one (48 metres) exposes a reefal lens also attributed to this new Marenne Member. Magnetic susceptibility was used to confirm geometric correlations previously obtained between these two sections. Petrographic study leads to the definition of 14 microfacies which are integrated into three palaeoenvironmental models. The first model (six microfacies) is proposed for the Marenne Member. In this ramp model, terrigenous inputs are particularly important. The mid-ramp is composed of four microfacies more or less influenced by storm events. The inner ramp (limited to the FWWB vicinity) is characterized by the development of the reefal lens and by peloidal microfacies. The upper part of Trois-Fontaines Formation is depicted by a back-reef model (three microfacies) which is mainly dominated by lagoons. However, intermittent agitation and non-restricted settings allow the local development and the reworking of branching organisms. The last model proposed (five microfacies) concerns the Terres dâHaurs Formation and corresponds to a <b>ramp</b> <b>profile</b> with the development of shoals. Those shoals locally protect semi-restricted lagoons. Algal mats are also observed. The last part of the work concerns the sedimentary dynamics and proposes sea level variations as the key parameter probably responsible for the succession of these three depositional settings.

40|$|Propagation of a Gaussian x-ray {{laser beam}} has been {{analyzed}} in collisionless thermal quantum plasma with considering a <b>ramped</b> density <b>profile.</b> In this density profile {{due to the}} increase in the plasma density, an earlier and stronger self-focusing effect is noticed where the beam width oscillates with higher frequency and less amplitude. Moreover, the effect of the density profile slope and the initial plasma density on the laser propagation has been studied. It is found that, by increasing the initial density and the ramp slope, the laser beam focuses faster with less oscillation amplitude, smaller laser spot size and more oscillations. Furthermore, a comparison is made among the laser self-focusing in thermal quantum plasma, cold quantum plasma and classical plasma. It is realized that the laser self-focusing in the quantum plasma becomes stronger in comparison with the classical regime...|$|R
40|$|Laser-driven shockless {{compression}} of matter to study material properties under dynamic conditions {{has been reported}} elsewhere [1]. In this case the process consists of three distinct phases: First a strong laser driven shock is launched into a reservoir which turns the material into a weakly ionized plasma. After the shock breaks through the rear side of the sample, the plasma moves towards a sample situated some distance away across a vacuum. gap. In the final phase, the plasma piles up slowly against the sample that generates a smoothly increasing applied pressure as it converts its kinetic energy into thermal pressure (<b>ramp</b> shaped <b>profile)</b> that drives a shockless {{compression of}} the sample material. This scheme is very useful to study the material properties under dynamic conditions. We propose that using an intense ion beam one can desig...|$|R
