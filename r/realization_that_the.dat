5|$|During the TGS afterparty, new {{cast member}} Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson) admits to his boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{that he has}} been having an office romance but will not {{disclose}} the woman's name. While in attendance at a New York Knicks game, Jack asks more about the woman Danny is seeing and Danny reveals details, such as she has never let a man see her feet. This results in Jack's <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> woman is the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), and he is displeased.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's staff drew up {{detailed}} {{plans for}} a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election that he considered, but with his family opposed and his <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Senate was a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 {{he decided not to}} run. Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.|$|E
5|$|The small fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington, {{has been}} {{shocked by the}} murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the {{attempted}} murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has {{been sent to the}} town to investigate, and has come to the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> killer was possessed by a demonic entity—Killer BOB (Frank Silva). MIKE (Al Strobel), a similar spirit, has spoken to Cooper and his FBI superior, Regional Bureau Chief Gordon Cole (David Lynch), explaining the nature of their existence.|$|E
5000|$|Roderick Long writes {{similarly}} {{that state}} and corporate power have a symbiotic relationship. Long writes about the alleged realizations of corporate liberalism during <b>the</b> 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> business class was hardly a [...] "persecuted minority" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state hardly a [...] "bulwark of the poor against the plutocracy".|$|R
50|$|Missouri is {{a nuclear}} wasteland after leakage of stored {{radioactive}} waste, {{off limits to}} all but the very rich. Eight of them, referred to as 'Owners', visit this O-Zone as their personal playground. Some of them come to <b>the</b> disturbing <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> life-forms outside of their walled in cities, assumed to be just 'things', seem as human as the Owners themselves.|$|R
50|$|Forced {{displacement}} has accompanied persecution, {{as well as}} war, {{throughout human}} history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention {{is the result of}} greater ease of travel, allowing displaced persons to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> destabilizing effects of forced immigration, especially in parts of Africa, the Middle East, south and central Asia, ripple out well beyond the immediate region.|$|R
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> National Park Service {{does not represent}} the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E
5|$|Dax confides in Sisko {{that she}} knows she {{is in love with}} her former wife. He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never be joined with a new host, but that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock Hoax is {{a detective}} who has little respect {{in the small}} {{tropical}} town where he lives, {{despite the fact that}} he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers a shred of cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. Hoax then comes to a <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves. The crowd has a laugh at Hoax's expense while the two boys are punished.|$|E
25|$|Discrete-time high-pass filters {{can also}} be designed. Discrete-time filter design {{is beyond the scope}} of this article; however, a simple example comes from the {{conversion}} of the continuous-time high-pass filter above to a discrete-time <b>realization.</b> <b>That</b> is, <b>the</b> continuous-time behavior can be discretized.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with state-space realizations of the adjoints of the variationals of Hamiltonian control systems. It will be shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> variational systems of a class of Hamiltonian systems have self-adjoint state-space <b>realizations,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>the</b> variational system and its adjoint have the same state-space <b>realizations.</b> This implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inputoutput mapping of the adjoint of the variational system of a given Hamiltonian system can be calculated by only using the input-output mapping of the original system. Furthermore, this property is applied to adjoint based iterative learning control with optimal control type cost functions...|$|R
5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} {{unusual for the}} time, being long on keel and narrow of beam (width) and {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design called for a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. Humphreys' design was based on his <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states {{in the size of}} their navies. This being so, the frigates were designed to overpower other frigates with the ability to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Senate grew {{increasingly}} alarmed at the slave-army's depredations and continued military successes. Eventually Rome fielded {{an army of}} eight legions under the harsh but effective leadership of Marcus Licinius Crassus. The war ended in 71 BC when, after a long and bitter fighting retreat before the legions of Crassus, and the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legions of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus were moving in to entrap them, the armies of Spartacus launched their full strength against Crassus' legions and were utterly defeated. Of the survivors, some 6,000 were crucified along the Appian way.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary reason}} Wood gave for {{changing}} her findings was her <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> microscopic slides of the popliteal vein and {{the photographs of}} muscle tissue in the surrounding area provided evidence of trauma which could explain the thrombus formation. She could not explain why {{she had not seen}} this before.|$|E
5000|$|Kyla {{made her}} big debut in 2000 with Way To Your Heart with its hit carrier single, [...] "Bring It On."

Comparisons to R&B super stars Brandy and Aaliyah began to surface.|$|R
5000|$|Billy Joel {{captured}} the major images, events, and personalities of this half-century in a three-minute song....

As a Shrek 2 spin-off, it was initially planned for release in 2008 as a direct-to-video film, then titled Puss in Boots: The Story of an Ogre Killer. By October 2006, the film was re-slated as a theatrical release due to market conditions, and due to DreamWorks Animation's <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Puss character deserved more.|$|E
25|$|Commercial wine {{production}} in the province began in the 1860s with an aristocrat from France, Count Justin McCarthy De Courtenay in County Peel. His success followed the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> right grapes could grow in the cold climate, producing an inexpensive good wine that could reach a commercial market. He gained government support and raised the capital for a commercial-scale vineyard and winery. His financial success encouraged others to enter the business.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Hiroshi Yamauchi, {{grandson}} of Fusajiro Yamauchi, visited the U.S. {{to talk with}} the United States Playing Card Company, the dominant playing card manufacturer there. He found that the biggest playing card company in the world was using only a small office. Yamauchi's <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> playing card business had limited potential was a turning point. He then acquired the license to use Disney characters on playing cards to drive sales.|$|E

25|$|Villard's {{fall was}} swifter than his ascendancy. Like Jay Cooke, {{he was now}} {{consumed}} by the enormous costs of constructing the railroad. Wall Street bears attacked the stock shortly after the Golden Spike, after the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Northern Pacific was a very long road with very little business. Villard himself suffered a nervous breakdown {{in the days after}} the driving of the Golden Spike, and he left the presidency of the Northern Pacific in January 1884.|$|E
25|$|Resolution of {{the tension}} causing this type of {{neurosis}} involves a careful constructive study of the fantasies. The seriousness with which the individual (ego) must take the mythological aspects of the fantasies may compare with the regard that devoted believers have toward their religion. It is not merely an intellectual exercise, but requires {{the commitment of the}} whole person and <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> unconscious has a connection to life-giving spiritual forces. Only a belief founded on direct experience with this process is sufficient to oppose, balance, and otherwise adjust the attitude of the ego.|$|E
25|$|Ugyen Wangchuck's {{emergence}} {{as the national}} leader coincided with the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dual political system was obsolete and ineffective. He had removed his chief rival, the ponlop of Paro, and installed a supporter and relative, {{a member of the}} pro-British Dorji family, in his place. When the last Zhabdrung died in 1903 and a reincarnation had not appeared by 1906, civil administration came under the control of Ugyen Wangchuck. Finally, in 1907, the fifty-fourth and last Druk Desi was forced to retire, and despite recognitions of subsequent reincarnations of Ngawang Namgyal, the Zhabdrung system came to an end.|$|E
50|$|In 1930, while Miller {{was living}} in Paris, the Moloch {{manuscript}} was being read by Edward Titus, owner of Black Mannikin Press.

40|$|This essay {{argues that}} {{scholars}} have invariably misrepresented Spenser's religious views by concentrating only on his doctrinal and confessional allegiances. Spenser's religion {{needs to be}} seen as a response to the Reformation and <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> marriage was now the institution in which everyone had to live. Using the work of John Calvin in particular, <b>the</b> essay argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first edition of The Faerie Queene charts the transformation of religious values after <b>the</b> Reformation, showing <b>that</b> Holiness could no longer be seen as a virtue isolated from all others, a <b>realization</b> <b>that,</b> as <b>the</b> poem demonstrates, had far-reaching consequence...|$|R

25|$|With {{increases}} in fuel capacity as the type was refined, {{the range of}} escort missions over Europe steadily increased until the P-47 was able to accompany bombers in raids {{all the way into}} Germany. On the way back from the raids, pilots shot up ground targets of opportunity, and also used belly shackles to carry bombs on short-range missions, which led to the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> P-47 could perform a dual-function on escort missions as a fighter-bomber. Even with its complicated turbosupercharger system, its sturdy airframe and tough radial engine could absorb a lot of damage and still return home.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of hostilities in Europe in 1939, along with the growing <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States might soon be drawn into World War II, resulted {{in the formation of}} the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP). The Piper J-3 Cub became the primary trainer aircraft of the CPTP and played an integral role in its success, achieving legendary status. About 75% of all new pilots in the CPTP (from a total of 435,165 graduates) were trained in Cubs. By war's end, 80% of all United States military pilots had received their initial flight training in Piper Cubs.|$|E
25|$|Though {{scholars}} {{may differ}} in their interpretation of text, the central idea {{seems to be very}} clear. Sonnet 126 deals with a marked lapse of time and leads the reader to the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relationship between author and subject has continued on for years but has now begun to wane or fizzle out. Ramsey too believes that the central idea rests in the reality of the natural relation that must be paid and the truth that must be faced by the author. Through these words, it is divulged that love changes; beauty passes; and men die.|$|E
