5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was dismayed by the lack of unity among the reformers. He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell's time at King's was {{probably}} the most productive of his career. He was awarded the Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861. This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as dimensional analysis. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, where he came into regular contact with Michael Faraday. The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of senility. They nevertheless maintained a strong <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> other's talents.|$|E
5|$|Playford, used to {{cooperating}} with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting {{that one day}} Dunstan {{would be at the}} helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} original Mono inverter Multi parallel Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) system. To obtain the stability of such a system, each of the motor synchronisms should always be respected regardless of their load torque.

Although the story, as told by Waltrip, is most likely fokelore, Waltrip drove his final race for Junior Johnson on November 16, 1986, in a Chevrolet sponsored by Budweiser, finishing 4th, at that year's Winston Western 500 at Riverside International Raceway in Riverside, California, completing {{one of the most}} successful owner/driver partnerships in all of motorsports history.

40|$|The synchrophasor Standard IEEE C 37. 118. 1, {{along with}} its amendment, defines two {{compliance}} classes for phasor measurement units (PMUs), the different test signals to be adopted for verification and the limits that should be <b>respected</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> test condition. In recent years, many synchrophasor estimation algorithms have been proposed {{to deal with the}} operative conditions identified by the standard, that can be both steady state and dynamic. The research has shown that some disturbances, such as interharmonic interfering signals, can seriously degrade synchrophasor measurement accuracy. In this work, a new two-stage approach, relying on Compressive Sensing (CS) and Taylor Fourier Transform (TFT), is proposed to identify the most relevant interfering components in the signal spectrum and to limit their impact on synchrophasor estimation. Simulation results are reported to confirm the algorithm efficiency...|$|R

But these taxes continued as customs duties until, with the growing hostility of the free cities, and with the frequent expulsion from vast territories which became the rule in the fifteenth century, those rulers who had expelled the Jews from their domains determined on the adoption of a policy of keeping them away from their borders. International relations, however, would not permit of the disregard of a passport granted by a foreign ruler to one of his subjects, so when Jews visited a territory in which no Jew was permitted to settle they were subjected to the payment of a toll.|$|R
25|$|After the fight, Lewis {{decided he}} needed a new trainer to replace Pepe Correa, who had become {{increasingly}} difficult to work with. Correa denounced Lewis in public after being fired. Renowned trainer Emanuel Steward, who had been McCall's trainer during their fight, was Lewis' choice. Even before the fight with McCall, Steward had seen much potential in Lewis and immediately {{expressed a desire to}} work with him. He corrected several of Lewis' technical flaws, which included maintaining a more balanced stance, less reliance on his straight right hand, and a focus on using a strong, authoritative jab; the latter of which would become a hallmark of Lewis' style throughout the rest of his career. Their partnership lasted until Lewis' retirement, both having mutual praise and <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> other to this day.|$|E
25|$|The Bills and Jets both {{represent}} {{the state of}} New York, though the Jets actually play their games in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The rivalry started as the Bills and Jets were both original teams in the AFL. Though the rivalry represents the differences between New York City and Upstate New York, {{it is not as}} intense as the Bills' rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots, and the teams' fanbases usually have a begrudging <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> other when not playing one another. Often times the rivalry has become beset with ugly games and mediocrity, but the rivalry briefly heated up when former Jets head coach Rex Ryan became head coach of the Bills for two seasons.

25|$|Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser): A young, ambitious account {{executive}} {{from an old}} New York family with connections and a privileged background. Often displaying recurring lapses in experience and judgement, Campbell's ruthless {{climb to the top}} causes him to attempt to blackmail Don Draper with the Dick Whitman information he has learned, but it does not work. He and Don are antagonistic some of the time, but later develop a grudging <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> other, culminating in Don's approaching Pete over Ken Cosgrove when forming a new agency. Campbell and his wife, Trudy, were unable to conceive a child early in their marriage, and he only learned of his child with Olson at the Season 2 finale. He and Trudy do conceive a daughter, Tammy, late in Season 4. At the end of Season 3, dissatisfied with his treatment at Sterling Cooper regarding a promotion, he secretly plans to leave the firm. Unaware of this, Don Draper approaches Campbell with an offer to join his new firm as long as Pete brings accounts worth $8 million of cash flow. Campbell decides to join Draper, with the condition that he be made a partner, though his surname does not appear in the new firm's name (Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce). Campbell {{is one of the few}} characters in the show who does not smoke cigarettes, though he is seen smoking marijuana on one occasion. He looks up to Don in many ways. Campbell is often shown cheating on his wife, and is not above manipulating and blackmailing women to get them to sleep with him. While Pete and Trudy separate in Season 6 after another one of his affairs, the two reconcile at the end of the series as Pete takes a lucrative offer with Learjet in Wichita, Kansas.|$|E

Williams' aggressive style had Aerts backtracking {{for much of the}} fight, but he was still able to show his class and take victory in the deciding round. He picked up another win over Mighty Mo at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2005 in Osaka - Final Elimination on September 23, 2005 to ensure his place at the 2005 World Grand Prix. Mo showed signs of damage from Aerts' kicks {{towards the end of the}} first round, and Aerts was able to finish him with a low kick in round two. In the quarter-finals of the K-1 World Grand Prix 2005 in Tokyo Final on November 19, 2005, he faced Jérôme Le Banner for the fourth time. The fight started slowly, with both men showing <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> other's power, but went on to be an exciting and close match. The judges scored it a draw after three rounds and it went into an extra round to decide the winner. All three judges agreed that Aerts was the winner (10-9, 10-9, 10-9). Injury would hinder him once again, however, and he was forced to pull out of the Grand Prix as he could not fight again that night. Having made his debut in mixed martial arts on July 6, 2005 when he knocked out former sumo wrestler Wakashoyo at Hero's 2, Aerts returned for his second and last MMA bout against judoka Shungo Oyama at K-1 PREMIUM 2005 Dynamite!! on December 31, 2005.
