The STAR-AQEM method requires the sub-sampling and taxonomic identification of at least one-sixth of the sample and at least 700 individuals. Replicate sub-samples were also taken at most of these sites. Sub-sampling effects caused more than 50 % of the overall variance between replicate samples values for 12 of the 27 macroinvertebrate metrics analysed and was generally greatest for metrics that depend {{on the number of}} taxa present. The sampling precision of each metric was estimated by the overall <b>replicate</b> <b>sampling</b> variance as a percentage Psamp of the total variance in metric values within a stream type. Average over all stream types, the three Saprobic indices had the lowest percentage sampling variances with median values of only 3 – 6 %. Most of the metrics had typical <b>replicate</b> <b>sampling</b> variances of 8 – 18 % of the total variability within a stream type; this gives rise to estimated rates of mis-classifying sites to ecological status class of between 22 and 55 % with an average of about 40 %. This suggests that the precision of such metrics based on the STAR-AQEM method is only sufficient to indicate gross changes in the ecological status of sites, but there will be considerable uncertainty in the assignment of sites to adjacent status classes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Replicate</b> <b>sampling</b> along stratigraphic horizons in one outcrop of Ordovician limestones of the Nashville Dome reveals {{considerable}} {{variation in}} d 13 C, d 18 O, and Sr concentration among seemingly identical samples. Ten vertical transects were sampled, each consisting of samples taken at 10 cm intervals from 2 m below to 1 m above the M 4 –M 5 sequence boundary of Holland and Patzkowsky (1997, 1998). The 10 transects were each 2 m apart. The resulting 10 replicate and thus seemingly interchangeable samples from each horizon have ranges of d 13 C {{as great as}} 2. 4 % and ranges of d 18 O as great as 2. 8 %, and Sr concentrations that vary {{by as much as}} a factor of four. Variance is great both just below and just above surfaces of subaerial exposure. As a result, maxima in variance in d 13 C, as well as or (in some cases) instead of minima in mean d 13 C, can be used to test such surfaces for exposure. Maxima in variance and minima in mean d 13 C may be found either below a surface of subaerial exposure in the meteorically altered sediment, or above that surface in the transgressive lag where reworked pre-exposure sediment is mixed with unaltered post-exposure sediment. The large variances and ranges found in this study, and the dissimilarity of geochemical profiles from the 10 vertical transects, indicate that single samples of stratigraphic horizons, and thus single vertical transects, can yield misleading characterizations of stratigraphic variation of geochemical parameters. Instead, <b>replicate</b> <b>sampling</b> along horizons better characterizes isotopic and elemental variation through stratigraphic sections than does existing single-sample strategies, and it will be more useful in future testing of surfaces of subaerial exposure.

40|$|Biological {{monitoring}} {{is essential}} to describing and protecting biological resources. Chemical measurements, or habitat assessments are useful to aquatic resource management, but the primary sentinels and objects requiring protection are organisms living in the stream. The merits of using benthic invertebrate measures as cumulative effects indicators are many. Foremost is that biological condition of the streams is being directly assessed. Benthic invertebrates are useful integrators of various stressors and are acknowledged as useful cumulative effects indicators. Secondly, the ranking of stream condition using a benthic invertebrate index or metric, is a defensible objective statement describing stream health, which may be more readily understood by resource managers and the public, than chemical concentrations or habitat statements. Lastly, this process of regional correlation or calibration of benthic health to watershed condition factors can provide opportunities to collaborate across disciplines and integrate and strengthen cumulative effects assessments of aquatic ecosystem condition in the Okanagan.

A new concept of sample ‘coherence’ is used to measure the relative strength of within-site, within-season and within-method similarity and to determine their importance on variability in community composition. Site-coherence (i. e., highest similarity to another sample from the same site) was much higher where <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> were available.

Some of the ancient stromatolites contained streaks and clots of kerogen, pyrite grains, remnants of microbial cells, and filaments that represented various stages of preservation, while others appeared to lack fossils. A set of physical criteria was established for evaluating the biogenicity of these Archean discoveries: (1) rocks of unquestionable Archean age; (2) microfossils indigenous to Archean sediments; and (3) microfossils occurring in clasts that are syngenetic with deposition of the sedimentary unit.

Polychaetes and amphipods served as better indicators of the impact of tuna farming compared with molluscs and decapods. Lower number and Shannon–Wiener diversity of polychaete and amphipod taxa were recorded over time at the impacted plots compared with the control plots, while the polychaete/amphipod index indicated that the Ecological Quality Status at the impacted plots changed from “Poor”/”Moderate” to “Good” during the study period. Results of the multivariate analyses indicated significantly higher dispersion of samples of the polychaete and amphipod assemblages over time at the impacted plots compared with the control plots, indicative of stressed assemblages. Differences in the macroinvertebrate assemblages between impacted and control plots were consistent across faunal groups except for molluscs, which showed no response.

Month, year, and station were statistically significant factors affecting abundance estimates as were all interactions. Month was the largest source of variance either as a main effect or interaction. Smallest coefficients of variation were associated with subsampling (mean 6. 1 %) and <b>replicate</b> <b>sampling</b> (mean 15. 1 %).

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{importance}} of spatial scales on nematode species distribution and patterns of biodiversity and turnover in cold seeps was investigated. Therefore it was identified how nematode assemblages differ in densities and composition at different spatial scales within and between three geographically separated cold seeps, the Central pockmark area, the Amon and the Amsterdam, all located in the Eastern Mediterranean area. The replicated sampling of several reduced habitats at each seep allowed to elucidate the most important scale of turnover. The spatial scales included here range within habitat (centimeters, micro-scale), within a cold seep (10 s to 100 's of meters, meso-scale) and between different seeps (10 to 100 s of kilometers, macro-scale). The results show that a typical cold seep fauna was found in all reduced samples. Compared to the reference samples, nematode densities were generally higher, with a low genus diversity, and a high dominance {{of only a few}} species, some of them being present in all three seep areas. When determining the scale of turnover using relative genera proportions, it appeared that the highest turnover rate was present between seeps (macro-scale). However, calculating the turnover based on presence/absence transformed nematode genera data showed the highest turnover rate between replicate samples (micro-scale) and habitats of the same seep (meso-scale). This shows that nematode assemblages are patchily distributed, even in a single habitat, and implicates that the sampling effort during sampling campaigns should be focused on <b>replicate</b> <b>sampling</b> and multiple habitats of the same seep.

We conducted mist-netting in eight forest strips connected to continuous forest (four of each forest type), {{with a total of}} 24 <b>replicate</b> <b>sampling</b> sites located near to (< 1 km), far from (2. 5 - 9 km), and within undisturbed forest controls (i. e. 16 samples within the strips, and 8 in controls). Bird communities in both strip types changed with increasing distance along forest remnants into the plantation matrix. Matrix-embedded samples were characterised by a higher representation of birds typical of secondary growth forest but not those typical of the Eucalyptus-dominated matrix. While the long-term viability of the bird populations in these remnants remains unclear, our data demonstrate that forest strips can provide important habitat for many bird species that are otherwise rarely found outside primary forest. Forest strips therefore provide an important tool to enhance biodiversity conservation in plantation landscapes. The relative practical ease with which these areas can be selected and maintained means that the protection of forest strips as part of a wider conservation strategy is likely to have particular appeal to policy makers and landscape managers working in the human-dominated tropics.

While such work is common in terrestrial systems, fewer examples exist in marine applications. This disparity likely exists because the <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> required by these models to account for imperfect detection are often impractical to obtain when surveying aquatic organisms, particularly fishes. We employ simultaneous sampling using fish traps and novel underwater camera observations to generate the requisite <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> for occupancy models of red snapper, a reef fish species.

We found that detection probabilities tended to be higher for camera traps than traditional fish traps. Furthermore, camera trap detections were influenced by the current direction and turbidity of the water, indicating that collecting data on these variables is important for future monitoring.

Cross-validation of the extraction and assay method was performed by comparison with methanolysis of samples followed by 3 -hydroxy fatty acid (3 -OHFA) analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Direct methanolysis of filter samples and methanolysis of buffer extracts of the filters yielded similar 3 -OHFA content (P = 0. 72); the average difference was 2. 1 %. Analysis of buffer extracts for endotoxin content by the KLARE method and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for 3 -OHFA content produced similar results (P = 0. 23); the average difference was 0. 88 %. The source of endotoxin was gram-negative bacteria growing in recycled washwater used to clean the insulation-manufacturing equipment. The endotoxin and bacteria become airborne during spray cleaning operations. The types of 3 -OHFAs in bacteria cultured from the washwater, present in the washwater and in the air, were similar.

A direct spike approach as well {{the use of a}} dynamic airflow device were the two approaches used for the {{collection of}} the selected volatile organic mix. The direct spike experiment showed how natural, cellulosic fibers such as viscose rayon showed an enhanced ability to release a reproducible volatile odor profile. Rayon demonstrated to be the fabric type with the highest recovered scent mass amounts, followed by wool and polyester. As was expected cotton showed the lowest recovered amounts, possibly due to its complex fiber morphology which enhances the possibility of chemicals to be retained in higher rates within the structure of the cotton fiber. Samples collected on the same fabric substrate showed a reproducible odor profile as measured via hierarchical clustering which corroborates previous live human odor studies and which can be pivotal in forensic biometric measurements. The introduction of an airflow variable to volatile collection decreased the amounts recovered for all fiber types.

40|$|Reliable {{descriptions}} {{of the status of}} offshore seabed habitats usually require substantial investment in field data collection and sample analysis. While assessment of, for example, biogenic reef habitat can often include simple physical parameters (e. g. spatial extent), comparative measures for soft sediment habitats generally rely on the distribution and relative abundance of species, with a description of the associated sedimentary environment. To investigate the power of surveys to detect significant trends in assemblage structure, samples of meiofauna, macroinfauna and megafauna (i. e. representing ecological components from nematodes to demersal fish), were collected from four offshore mud and sand habitat sites in western UK shelf seas during July 2004 and 2005. Spatial arrays of samples within these sites, up to 23 km apart, were designed to optimise {{descriptions of}} assemblage structure and the patterns of spatial distribution at a local scale. Analyses of species abundance, biomass and taxonomic relatedness of the species complement at each site suggested that most assemblages represented relatively unimpacted regional conditions. The power of the sampling programme to detect a significant change in univariate community attributes was assessed. The variability in many of the community attributes indicated that intensive <b>replicate</b> <b>sampling</b> would be required to detect ecologically important changes. Improving the power of such benthic surveys to detect trends would therefore require substantial additional time and effort to be invested in sample collection and analysis. Resource analysis showed that the time from gear deployment to complete sample identification was gear-dependent, lowest per sample for meiofauna (10 h) and megafauna (6 - 12 h), and highest for macroinfauna (12 - 22 h).
