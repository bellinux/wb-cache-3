The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids.

40|$|Winged morphs of aphids are {{essential}} for their dispersal and survival. We discovered that {{the production of the}} winged morph in asexual clones of the <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid,</b> Dysaphis plantaginea, is dependent on their infection with a DNA virus, Dysaphis plantaginea densovirus (DplDNV). Virus-free clones of the <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid,</b> or clones infected singly with an RNA virus, <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> virus (RAAV), did not produce the winged morph in response to crowding and poor plant quality. DplDNV infection results in a significant reduction in aphid reproduction rate, but such aphids can produce the winged morph, even at low insect density, which can fly and colonize neighboring plants. Aphids infected with DplDNV produce a proportion of virus-free aphids, which enables production of virus-free clonal lines after colonization of a new plant. Our data suggest that a mutualistic relationship exists between the <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> and its viruses. Despite the negative impact of DplDNV on <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> reproduction, this virus contributes to their survival by inducing wing development and promoting dispersal...|$|E

40|$|ReportThis {{study showed}} that {{resistance}} to organophosphates remained relatively stable in the field populations of OBLR during the 3 years of the study, {{despite the absence of}} sprays of these materials. The control of OBLR in the soft pesticide programs was generally better than that obtained by growers in their standard pesticide treatments. However, adequate control of plum curculio was not obtained in most of the blocks {{and at the end of}} the study, damage was observed even in blocks that were completely free of this pest during the first season. These results showed that adequate control of the curculio cannot be maintained for multiple seasons without using special control sprays even in blocks that would not be considered to be at risk from this pest. This soft insecticide program did not provide adequate control of internal lepidoptera in some of the blocks for multiple seasons, although control of apple maggots was acceptable. Foliar pests such as tentiform leafminers, green <b>apple</b> <b>aphids,</b> white <b>apple</b> leafhoppers, and mites were not serious problems in the soft pesticide blocks. Tarnished plant bug damage was generally similar in grower's standard programs and the soft pesticide blocks.

40|$|The <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> Dysaphis plantaginea {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} leaf sucking pests in pome fruit. As damage, caused by an infestation of a relatively small number of fundatrices in spring, easily exceeds the economic threshold level, pest management is crucial. Besides the use of IPM-compatible pesticides, natural enemies (ladybird beetles, parasitic wasps, saw fliesâ€¦) can play an additional role in controlling aphids. In Europe, the solitary endoparasitoid Ephedrus persicae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae, Aphidiinae) is the dominant parasitic wasp attacking <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid.</b> As this parasi-toid develops later than its host, control is determined by the population density and the parasitising efficiency of the wasp. The population increase within a season is determined by generation turnover and parasitizing capacity, a factor poorly under-stood in E. persicae. To be able to estimate the number of wasps required for success-ful control the parasitic behaviour was studied in semi-field circumstances. Artificially infested colonies of <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> on apple trees grown in a greenhouse, were cov-ered with cages of gauze in which young, mated female parasitic wasps were released. The number of aphids (alatae, apterae and mummies) as well as the number of adult parasitic wasps were recorded weekly until the end of infestation or parasitation. This test method allowed a comparison of the parasitizing efficacy of Ephedrus with that of the well-studied parasitoid Aphelinus mali (Haldeman), that efficiently controls the woolly aphid Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann) ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini) (Homoptera: Aphididae) is {{the most}} serious pest apple aphid in view of the scale of damages inflicted to the fruits by a small number of individuals. Although {{numerous}} natural enemies have been associated with D. plantaginea, they are unable to halt infestations soon enough in most commercial apple orchards obliging fruit growers to control it chemically to prevent severe economic losses. In order to reinforce the contribution of indigenous aphidophaga in regulating rosy apple aphids, the use of insectary plants selected to support two groups of specialist aphid antagonists, notably aphid parasitoids and aphidophagous monovoltine syrphids, was investigated. 1. A first step consisted in selecting appropriate plant species. The rowan tree Sorbus aucuparia L. and the common elder Sambucus nigra L. were selected for their ability to support substitute aphids for the <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> parasitoid E. persicae Froggatt (Hymenoptera: Braconidae, Aphidiinae) and monovotine syrphids (Diptera: Syrphidae) respectively. 2. Next, trials were conducted to induce substitute aphid infestations on their host plants by introducing eggs of Dysaphis sorbi Kaltenbach on rowan and small colonies of Aphis sambuci L. on elder. The resulting aphid populations which developed on their respective host plants in spring proved to be exploited by the natural enemies expected, i. e. E. persicae and monovoltine syrphids of the genus Epistrophe. Besides, diapause mummies of E. persicae and diapausing last-instar Epistrophe larvac were recorded on rowan and in the elder litter respectively, indicating the successful settlement of the antagonists in the orchard environment. A complementary investigation devoted to syrphid adults indicated that females of all species recorded ovipositing on the eider shrubs, including Epistrophe spp. had consumed a large majority of apple pollen grains as a protein source required for egg maturation. 3. To comfort our choice in the two groups of aphidophaga considered, a study dedicated to their respective phenology versus the one of D. plantaginea showed that they could both potentially halt <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> infestations by attacking the aphids while the latter still occupied the primary, fundatrix-induced rosette leaf colonies, i. e. a critical moment in <b>rosy</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> control. 4. Finally, marking methods were tested to label E. persicae internally and the egg load of gravid syrphids. These trials were intended to pave the way towards future mark-release-recapture experiments aimed to evaluate the antagonistsâ€™ activity range and thus strategically position the insectary plants for optimal aphid biological control in the whole orchard. The first step of new approach in the biological control of D. plantaginea has been set with this study. Its originality lies in the induction of economically indifferent aphid infestations on selected plants introduced in the orchard to encourage well-targeted groups of specialist aphid antagonists. Further trials are still needed to validate the field efficacy of the insectary plant systems developed and evaluate their possible integration within the whole array of pest management tools in both organic and integrated apple production.

Insecticide {{applications}} of to reduce damages are usually a need and are based on pre- and / or post-flowering treatments. The secondary host of this aphid has no agricultural interest so, differently from other species like Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Aphis gossypii Glover the summer generations are not treated. This lower selection pressure is certainly {{the main reason for}} the quite rare reports of resistance in D. plantaginea. However, following specific control failure reports, it was considered wise to make a preliminary survey on the activity of enzymatic systems of D. plantaginea, that in other aphid species are known to be involved in insecticide resistance. In spring 2008 two populations of D. plantaginea were collected: the first in a commercial orchard with insecticide control failures, the second from an apple tree in an untreated garden far away from commercial fruit orchards. Spectrophotometric and fluorimetric techniques have been used to measure the activity of the following enzymatic systems: esterases, glutathione S-transferases, monooxygenases and acetylcholinesterases. Preliminary results indicate that between the two populations: â€¢ there are no significant differences in the activity total esterase; â€¢ also the activity of glutathione S-transferase is very similar; â€¢ acetylcholinesterase is inhibited equally {{in the presence of a}} dimethycarmabate diagnostic concentration that in M. persicae can distinguish among resistant than sensitive specimens; â€¢ there are differences in monooxygenase activity: such activity is higher in the specimens from the population that survived the treatments.
