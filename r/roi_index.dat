40|$|Producing a {{cost-benefit}} {{analyses of}} security solutions {{has always been}} hard, because the benefits are difficult to assess and often {{only a part of}} the overall cost is clear. Despite this, today the provision of economic evaluations of security technology investments is a requirement that more and more customers ask vendors to satisfy. In this paper, we consider the typical calculation of a ReturnOn -Investment (<b>ROI)</b> <b>index</b> based on the evaluation of the Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE), as the one provided usually by vendors of IT security. Our motivating assumption is that such classical index, the ROI, provides a partial characterization of investments in information security technology, because it lacks to explicitly consider attackers' behavior. We suggest that to better evaluate security technology investments, the <b>ROI</b> <b>index</b> should be coupled with a corresponding index aimed at measuring the convenience of attacks, the Return-On-Attack (ROA) expecially in situation where different technologies are combined or where the possible degradation of a security solution's efficiency over time must be taken into account...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a resource allocation problem, where a rational agent {{has to decide}} how to share a limited amount of resources among different companies that might be facing financial difficulties. The objective is to minimize the total long term cost incurred by the economy due to default events. Using the framework of multi-armed restless bandits and, assuming a two-state evolution of the default risk, the optimal dynamic resource sharing policy is determined. This policy assigns an index value to each company, which orders its priority to be funded. We obtain an analytical expression for this index, which generalizes the return-on-investment (<b>ROI)</b> <b>index</b> under the static setting, and we analyse the influence of the future events on the optimal dynamic policy. A discussion about the structure of the optimal dynamic policy is provided, as well as some extensions of the model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A typical {{data-driven}} {{visualization of}} electroencephalography (EEG) coherence is a graph layout, with vertices representing electrodes and edges representing significant coherences between electrode signals. A drawback of this layout is its visual clutter for multichannel EEG. To reduce clutter, we define a functional unit (FU) as a data-driven {{region of interest}} (ROI). An FU is a spatially connected set of electrodes recording pairwise significantly coherent signals, represented in the coherence graph by a spatially connected clique. Earlier, we presented two methods to detect FUs: a maximal clique-based (MCB) method (time complexity Oð 3 n= 3 Þ, with n being the number of vertices) and a more efficient watershed-based (WB) method (time complexity Oðn 2 lognÞ). To reduce the potential oversegmentation of the WB method, we introduce an improved WB (IWB) method (time complexity Oðn 2 lognÞ). The IWB method merges basins representing FUs during the segmentation if they are spatially connected and if their union is a clique. The WB and IWB methods are both up to a factor of 100, 000 faster than the MCB method for a typical multichannel setting with 128 EEG channels, thus making interactive visualization of multichannel EEG coherence possible. Results show that considering the MCB method as the gold standard, the difference between IWB and MCB FU maps is smaller than between WB and MCB FU maps. We also introduce two novel group maps for data-driven group analysis as extensions of the IWB method. First, the group mean coherence map preserves dominant features from a collection of individual FU maps. Second, the group FU size map visualizes the average FU size per electrode across a collection of individual FU maps. Finally, we employ an extensive case study to evaluate the IWB FU map and the two new group maps for data-driven group analysis. Results, in accordance with conventional findings, indicate differences in EEG coherence between younger and older adults. However, they also suggest that an initial selection of hypothesis-driven ROIs could be extended with additional data-driven <b>ROIs.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Information visualization, graphs and networks, applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Production {{activities}} {{depend on}} a number of important parameters, one being the personnel's productivity. This parameter affects considerably the risk (technical and/or financial risk) of the whole activity. For the computation of the risk, a simple but comprehensive computer model has been created allowing the time simulation of the production process for a number of possible expected returns (scenarios), as well as the computation of the (well known) financial <b>indices</b> <b>ROI,</b> IRR and NPV. For the risk minimization the 'min-max strategy' for determining optimal strategies has been applied. The ""min-max strategy"" guarantees a worst-case risk/return tradeoff in terms of the above financial indices, whichever of the specified scenarios occurs. The above method is described in the following and corresponding results are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Prostate cancer (PCa) {{diagnosis}} {{relies on}} clinical suspicion leading to systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSGB). Multiparametric {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (mpMRI) allows for targeted biopsy of suspicious areas of the prostate instead of random 12 -core biopsy. This method {{has been shown to}} be more accurate in detecting significant PCa. However, the precise spatial accuracy of cognitive targeting is unknown. Consecutive patients undergoing mpMRI-targeted TRUSGB with cognitive registration (MRTB-COG) followed by robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were included in the present analysis. The regions of interest (ROIs) involved by the index lesion reported on mpMRI were subsequently targeted by two experienced urologists using the cognitive approach. The 27 ROIs were used as spatial reference. Mapping on radical prostatectomy specimen was used as reference to determine true-positive mpMRI findings. Per core correlation analysis was performed. Forty patients were included. Overall, 40 index lesions involving 137 ROIs (mean <b>ROIs</b> per <b>index</b> lesion 3. 43) were identified on MRI. After correlating these findings with final pathology, 117 ROIs (85  %) were considered as true-positive lesions. A total of 102 biopsy cores directed toward such true-positive ROIs were available for final analysis. Cognitive targeted biopsy hit the target in 82  % of the cases (84 / 102). The only identified risk factor for missing the target was an anterior situated ROI (p =  0. 01). In experienced hands, cognitive MRTB-COG allows for an accuracy of 82  % in hitting the correct target, given that it is a true-positive lesion. Anterior tumors are less likely to be successfully targeted...|$|R
40|$|Combined {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} and computed tomography (PET-CT) scans have become a critical tool for the diagnosis, localisation, and staging of most cancers. This {{has led to a}} rapid expansion in the volume of PET-CT data that is archived in clinical environments. The ability to search these vast imaging collections has potential clinical applications in evidence-based diagnosis, physician training, and biomedical research that may lead to the discovery of new knowledge. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is an image search technique that complements conventional text-based retrieval by the use of image features as search criteria. Graph-based CBIR approaches {{have been found to be}} exemplary methods for medical CBIR as they provide the ability to consider disease localisation during the similarity measurement. However, the majority of graph-based CBIR studies have been based on 2 D key slice approaches and did not exploit the rich volumetric data that is inherent to modern medical images, such as multi-modal PET-CT. In this paper, we present a graph-based CBIR method that exploits 3 D spatial features extracted from volumetric regions of interest (<b>ROIs).</b> We <b>index</b> these features as attributes of a graph representation and use a graph-edit distance to measure the similarity of PET-CT images based on the spatial arrangement of tumours and organs in a 3 D space. Our study aims to explore the capability of these graphs in 3 D PET-CT CBIR. We show that our method achieves promising precision when retrieving clinical PET-CT images of patients with lung tumours.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of public policies aims {{to assess the}} usefulness and goodness of public intervention. The evaluation is usually done with indicators that measure the degree of achievement of the objectives planned, and the cultural management processes carried out by {{both public and private}} agents. For an indicator system to be effective, it is necessary to establish a strategic choice that meets two requirements: it should faithfully represent all the criteria of the decision maker and the number of indicators should not be very high. However, in many practical applications the number of indicators with which we work is usually high, thus it is not very operational. Therefore, {{to reduce the number of}} indicators is necessary to rank them so that choosing the first ones guarantees greater success according to different criteria. In this paper, we use TOPSIS method to sort out to cultural indicators defined to facilitate monitoring of the Strategy of Culture and Development (AECID).

To do so, the Revealed Comparative Advantage Index (RCAI), and the Regional Orientation <b>Index</b> (<b>ROI)</b> were used. The findings show that Brazil has been presenting a positive Revealed Comparative Advantage Indexes on the considered period and these were increasing except {{during the years of}} 1995, 1996, 1999 and 2003. The reason of these drops off {{may be related to the}} high exchange rates between 1995 and 1998 and, due to variations in the Brazilian and World soybean exportations. The ROI result concerning the European Union indicates that the exports are concentrated to the block. Although, this rate was falling during the analyzed period, the soybean exports are increasing to the block. This may indicate that the soybean exports to other markets are proportionally increasing, more the to the European Union. The ROI analyses to APEC indicated that the exports are extra APEC orientated; however, countries like China and Japan, that are members of the block, are great importers of Brazilian soybean nowadays.

40|$|The {{performance}} of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in boreholes is studied numerically regarding changes induced by CO 2 sequestration in deep saline reservoirs. The new optimization approach {{is applied to}} generate an optimized data set of only 4 % of the comprehensive set but of almost similar best possible resolution. Diverse electrode configurations (mainly tripotential α and β) are investigated with current flows and potential measurements in different directions. An extensive 2. 5 D modeling (> 100, 000 models) is conducted systematically {{as a function of}} multiparameters related to hydrogeology, CO 2 plume, data acquisition and methodology. ERT techniques generally are capable to resolve storage targets (CO 2 plume, saline host reservoir, and impermeable cap rock), however with the common smearing effects and artefacts. Reconstructed tomograms show that the optimized and multiply oriented configurations have a better-spatial resolution than the lateral arrays with splitting of potential and current electrode pairs between boreholes. The later arrays are also more susceptible to telluric noise but have a lower level of measurement errors. The resolution advance of optimized and multiply oriented configurations is confirmed by lower values for <b>ROI</b> (region of <b>index)</b> and residual (relative model difference). The technique acceptably resolves targets with an aspect ratio down to 0. 5...|$|R

Aim of this study is firstly to evaluate interobserver variation of partial and whole sacroiliac indicis, secondly investigation of clinical importance of these indicis in the diagnosis of sacroiliitis. Methods: Fourty-six subjects (24 female: 35. 4 ± 11. 9; 22 male: 43. 1 ± 12. 4) without sacroiliitis 45 subjects with low back pain (33 female: 43. 3 ± 11. 5, 11 male: 35. 5 ± 17. 2) were included in the study. For right (R) and left (L) whole indices (WSI) irregular region of interest (<b>ROI),</b> for partial <b>indices</b> superior (S) and inferior (I) rectangular ROI were used. For background activity, rectangular ROI was drawn from the sacral region. Indices were calculated from ratio of average counts of sacroiliac and background regions. Two independent observers calculated sacroiliac indices. Interobserver agreement was evaluated by Pearson analysis. Results: There was no significant interobserver difference (p> 0. 05). Significant correlation existed between all calculated indices. Among 45 patients with suspicion of sacroiliitis 15 had final diagnosis of sacroiliitis and all of the Tc- 99 m methilenediphosphonate planar and SPECT bone scintigraphy results of these patients were concordant with sacroiliitis. There were 8 false positive results in other 30 patients. Seven of these eight patients had normal index values.

Ninety-one thyroid follicular nodules, {{for which the}} pathological diagnosis had been established, were examined (60 benign, 31 malignant). After 74 MBq of Tl- 201 chloride was injected intra-venously, Tl- 201 scintigrams were obtained at 10, 20, 30, and 120 min. For the quantitative evaluation, the area with the greatest accumulation in the nodule and a comparative region in the contralateral thyroid and the soft tissues in the cervical region were manually selected as the region of interest (ROI) referring to Tc- 99 m pertechnetate scintigrams and ultrasonographic findings as a guide by two radiologists, and the T/N ratio (tumor/normal tissue ratio) and T/S ratio (tumor/soft tissue ratio) were calculated.

40|$|The Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) is a {{globally}} vulnerable species, {{and habitat}} loss {{is the primary}} cause of its decline. To date, little is known regarding the specific habitat needs, and stopover habitat selection in particular, of the Hooded Crane. In this study we used stochastic gradient boosting (TreeNet) to develop three specific habitat selection models for roosting, daytime resting, and feeding site selection. In addition, we used a geographic information system (GIS) combined with TreeNet to develop a species distribution model. We also generated a digital map of the relative occurrence <b>index</b> (<b>ROI)</b> of this species at daytime resting sites in the study area. Our study indicated that the water depth, distance to village, coverage of deciduous leaves, open water area, and density of plants were the major predictors of roosting site selection. For daytime resting site selection, the distance to wetland, distance to farmland, and distance to road were the primary predictors. For feeding site selection, the distance to road, quantity of food, plant coverage, distance to village, plant density, distance to wetland, and distance to river were contributing factors, and the distance to road and quantity of food were the most important predictors. The predictive map showed that there were two consistent multi-year daytime resting sites in our study area. Our field work in 2013 using systematic ground-truthing confirmed that this prediction was accurate.

30|$|At {{first we}} {{introduce}} briefly the approach for optimized electrode arrays in boreholes applied here. Like surface surveys, ERT data acquisition between two borehole electrode arrays can {{be conducted in}} the tripotential quadrupole configurations α (CPPC, C[*]=[*]current electrode, P[*]=[*]potential electrode), β (CCPP) and γ (CPCP). For an N collinear multi-electrode array, a whole comprehensive data set consists of [N(N[*]−[*] 1)(N[*]−[*] 2)(N[*]−[*] 3)/ 8] independent non-reciprocal quadrupole configurations (Noel and Xu 1991). The effective comprehensive data set results from excluding the redundant configurations of less stable inversions from the whole set, i.e., γ configurations and those of very large geometric factors (Loke et al. 2010). Resulting comprehensive data set is still huge, e.g., a pair of 32 borehole electrodes yield > 106 data points. It can map subsurface targets with the highest possible resolution but at very long acquisition times (i.e., poor temporal resolution) and at high costs. Therefore, an optimization approach {{is based on the}} model resolution matrix and searches for electrode configurations that maximize the resolution of survey results (e.g., Stummer et al. 2004; Wilkinson et al. 2006). An optimized borehole data sets of practical sizes (15, 000 data points) of only 1.5 % of the comprehensive data set but with almost the same spatial resolution is generated in this study (e.g., al Hagrey 2012 a). Comparative applications of diverse configurations (standard and non-standard) show the superiority of the optimized array results (al Hagrey 2012 b). Moreover, assessing our optimized array by the technique of region of investigation <b>index</b> (<b>ROI)</b> showed that its inverted tomograms are best constrained by the data coverage in comparison to that of the other configurations (Oldenburg and Li 1999). All these confirm the effectiveness of our optimization approach applied here to generate a practical optimized data set of high resolution.|$|R

Background noise was determined by placing the ROI in the air outside the patient’s body. In each structure, efforts were made to place the ROI in as homogeneous an area as possible, away from blood vessels, fat planes, etc. Mean attenuation in HU and standard deviation of the mean attenuation in the ROI were recorded on CD-CT and LD-CT images reconstructed with FBP, ASiR- 40, ASiR- 70 and ASiR- 90 including 2  mm, 5  mm and 5  mm MIP reformats. The standard deviation of the mean attenuation in the ROI served as an objective measure of noise [34]. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within each ROI was calculated by dividing the mean HU by its standard deviation [35]. It was not possible to accurately place the ROIs within the required anatomical structures in two patients (both with BMI[*]>[*] 40) because of severe degradation of image quality in the LD-CT series; therefore quantitative analysis of image noise was performed in 31 of 33 patients equating to a total of 11, 160 data points for analysis (31 patients; 4 LD reconstructions; 3 reformat types; 10 ROIs; 3 values per <b>ROI).</b> Objective noise <b>indices</b> were statistically compared by deriving the mean objective noise (SD of HU within ROI) at the ten measured levels for each data set.|$|R
40|$|Intra-seasonal drought episodes (extreme dry spells) are {{strongly}} linked to crop yield {{loss in the}} West African Sahel, especially when they occur at crop critical stages such as juvenile or flowering stage. This paper seeks to expose potentially predictable features in the sub-seasonal to inter-annual occurrence of ''extreme dry spells'' (extDS) through their links to sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs). We consider two kinds of extreme dry spells: more than 2 weeks of consecutive dry days following a rain event (often found {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season, after the first rain events) and more than a week (observed towards the end of the rainy season, before the last rain events). We extract dry spells from daily rainfall data at 43 stations (31 stations in Senegal over 1950 - 2010 and 12 stations in Niger over 1960 - 2000) to identify the intra-seasonal distribution of extDS and their significant correlation with local rainfall deficits. Seasonality of distribution and high spatial coherence are found in the timing and the frequency of occurrence of extDS in different rainfall regions over Niger and Senegal. The correlation between the regional occurrence <b>index</b> (<b>ROI),</b> necessary to capture the spatial extent of extDS, and observed global sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) sheds light on the influence of the external factors on the decadal, interannual and sub-seasonal variability of extDS over the West African Sahel. When the global tropics and the Atlantic are warmer than normal, more coherent and delayed June-July extDS are observed after onset of rainy season, as well as early cessation type in August-September. When the Indo-Pacific is cooler and the equatorial south Atlantic is warmer than normal little to no extDS are found in the onset sub-period of the monsoon season. Mostly late types of extDS occur in October as a result of late cessation. These results show potential predictability of extreme dry spells after onset and before cessation of monsoonal rain based on global patterns of sea surface temperature anomalies.
