5000|$|BASEC's main {{approval}} {{service is}} Product Certification which applies to individual cable types. All products are rigorously tested to meet necessary and appropriate standards through detailed examination of manufacturers production processes and controls. Product samples are retrieved from the client manufactures on which BASEC then carries out tests at its accredited laboratories in Milton Keynes. BASEC also verifies that products fully {{comply with the}} <b>relevant</b> <b>specification</b> by full type testing at independent laboratories or by witnessing tests at the client factory. Manufacturers may apply for a license to display the BASEC mark on their products only when BASEC is satisfied that their manufacturing systems are capable of consistently producing cable products. After having attained a BASEC Product Marking License they are subjected to regular factory audits and products surveillance testing. BASEC issues certificates to unique, specific products when they have passed thorough testing and the manufacturer can demonstrate ongoing conformity.|$|E

We evaluate the assumptions of synchronicity and of a unique initial state, which have been proposed in the con-text of Interpreted Systems. Also, we consider satisfiability at an initial state as opposed to any state in the system. We in-troduce a tableau-based decision procedure for each of these combinations.

Based on studies to 30 the drawing specimens of concrete,get bond strength of same GFRP diameter,same concrete strength, different concrete cover thinkness. Through the analysis of test data,it is concluded {{the relationship of the}} bond strength and the concrete cover thinkness. And basis on the relationship,it is determine the suggestive values on concrete cover thinkness of GFRP. Experimental data and suggestion can provide reference and theoretical basis for the GFRP engineering application and the establishment of the <b>relevant</b> <b>specification.</b> Preface The concrete cover thinkness {{is one of the main}} reasons for GFRP and concrete bond strength[1]. Code f or design of concrete st ruct ures (GB 50010 — 2010) also puts forward the requirements of the minimum concrete cover thinkness of reinforced concrete structures[2]. GFRP compared with ordinary steel possesses the advantages of light weight, high strength, good corrosion resistance, electromagnetic by good insulation and closing to the temperature coefficient of linear expansion of concrete. In recent years at home and abroad, GFRP and concrete structure has been launched in the field of civil engineering applications[3]. At present, there is no concrete cover thickness requirements and Suggestions of GFRP and concrete structure are put forward at home.

40|$|Weakly continuation-closed abstractions {{are known}} to {{preserve}} properties satisfied up to liveness, i. e. linear-time temporal properties under an abstract notion of fairness. Being defined on the complete behaviour of a concurrent system, weakly continuation-closed abstractions require, in principle, an exhaustive state-space construction prior to abstraction. Constructing the state-space of a practically <b>relevant</b> <b>specification</b> exhaustively, however, is usually unfeasible. Based {{on the notion of}} traces, i. e. certain equivalence classes of behaviours, we define trace reductions. We show that a trace reduction can be used on behalf of the complete behaviour of a concurrent system in order to compute abstractions as well as to check whether the abstractions are weakly continuation-closed. So trace reductions allow us to overcome the requirement of an exhaustive state-space construction prior to abstraction...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{desirable}} {{to describe the}} interface of an implementation system at a different (usually more detailed) level of abstraction to the interface of the <b>relevant</b> <b>specification.</b> This calls for a relation aimed at formalising {{the notion that a}} process is an acceptable implementation of another target process in the event that they possess different interfaces. We conduct our investigation in the standard failures-divergences CSP process model, formulating a suitable implementation relation between the observable behaviours of the implementation and the target process. Interface difference and bridging is modelled by endowing the implementation relation with parameters, called extraction patterns, instrumental to interpreting implementation behaviour as target behaviour. Reasonable notions of implementation and extraction patterns should result in a relation satisfying the realisability and compositionality properties. The former means that, if target and implementation in fact have the same interface, then th...|$|E

Previous studies have yielded mixed evidence but have used potentially inadequate measures to account for the simultaneity between drug consumption and labor supply.

Results indicate a substantial negative relationship between drug use and both employment and hours worked in both 1984 and 1988 that is always significant for males and sometimes significant for females.

We extend the results of our previous work and replace implementation relations previously presented by a single, improved scheme. We also remove all the restrictions previously placed upon target processes. Two basic kinds of results are obtained: realisability and compositionality. The latter means that a target composed of several connected systems may be implemented by connecting their respective implementations. The former means that, if target and implementation have the same interface, then the implementation relation they should satisfy collapses into the standard implementation pre-order. We also show how to represent processes and necessary formal structures in a manner amenable to computer implementation, and detail a graph-theoretic restatement of the conditions defining the implementation relation, whence we derive algorithms for its automatic verification...|$|E
