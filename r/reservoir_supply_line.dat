40|$|Transactions of AIJ. Journal of {{environmental}} engineeringIn {{order to the}} evaluate heat loss from hot water <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> in a residential building, hot water demand {{in a house in}} Chiba prefecture was measured and analyzed. The following results were obtained. 1. The heat loss of the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> was about 132 kJ for the shower and 110 kJ for the bathtub in winter. Since the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> is small, the measured heat loss from the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> sometimes becomes negative. 2. In order to estimate the heat loss under various conditions, a thermal model was proposed. 3. The calculated daily heat loss of the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> was 122 kJ for the shower and 689 kJ for the bathtub in winter. The average daily heat loss from the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> during use and after use was 1774. 7 KJ in winter. This heat loss amounts to 4. 7 % of the total daily energy use for hot water supply. 4. For reducing the heat loss, thermal insulation of the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> and the use of thinner pipes are effective...|$|R
