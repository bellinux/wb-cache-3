Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was jacked up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was jacked down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails and then they were bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was jacked down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to guide the carriage wagon into position and the carriage was jacked up while the wagon was removed and it was then jacked down and bolted to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the barrel clamp. The crew pulled on the ropes and slid the barrel into the cradle.

2500|$|The 40-caliber barrel was {{constructed}} of twelve parts, notably the inner tube and various {{inner and outer}} jacket pieces. The hydro-pneumatic recoil system was mounted on the cradle above the gun. It used the same horizontal sliding block breech as the 38 cm Belagerungshaubitze M 16. The gun carriage rested on a base box or bedding platform which measured [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high. The base box incorporated a turntable resting on a ball race capable of 360° traverse. At {{the rear of the}} turntable was a [...] tilting crane used to move ammunition from the shell cart to the <b>roller</b> <b>race</b> and to help assemble the <b>roller</b> <b>race</b> and to remove the breech. The <b>roller</b> <b>race</b> was mounted directly behind the gun on four tilting arms. When the gun returned to the prescribed loading angle of 6° the <b>roller</b> <b>race</b> was raised so that it met the rear end of the breech, a shell was placed on <b>roller</b> <b>race</b> by the crane and it was hand-rammed with the shell sliding forward on the rollers. It was followed by a cartridge case containing the propellant.

50|$|In August of that year, Seltzer {{organized}} his own Transcontinental Roller Derby, {{an event}} {{more than a}} month long. Staged at the Chicago Coliseum, it was a simulation of a cross-country roller skating race in which 25 two-person (male-female) teams circled a wooden, oval, banked track thousands of times, skating 11½ hours a day, to cover 3,000 miles, the distance between Los Angeles and New York City. Team standings were indicated by multicolored lights tracking their imaginary progress on a large map of the United States. Teams were disqualified if both members were off the track during skating times. Sixteen teams dropped out due to injuries or exhaustion, but nine teams finished, and the winning team, Clarice Martin and Bernie McKay, held the lead for the last 11 days of the event. Although Seltzer's spectacle had elements of originality, a U.S. District Court, ruling against Seltzer when he sued a competitor in 1938, found that the marathon <b>roller</b> <b>race</b> concept had long been in the public domain, so Seltzer couldn't claim copyright violation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{incorporates}} {{an array}} of Contact Potential Difference (CPD) sensors to measure and monitor the degree of skew in the rolling elements of a spherical roller bearing. Skewing is the motion of a roller as it turns about an axis normal to the <b>roller</b> <b>race</b> interface. Roller skew is generated {{as part of the}} kinematic effects of roller bearings. Skew monitoring is important for bearing design as it is an indirect measure of bearing life. 	For the purpose of this thesis, roller skew was measured utilizing multiple pairs of CPD probes located around the bearings outer raceway at varying points of the loading zone. These CPD probes are not in direct contact with the rollers, but in close proximity to their surface (through the bearing outer ring). The skew angle measured is related to different operating conditions such as applied load, shaft speed, and lubrication. 	The pair of CPD probes detected a signal as the roller surface passed by and the phase difference between the two distinct signals measured the skew angles in the range of 0. 016 to 1. 10. The shaft is rotated both clockwise and counterclockwise to capture any probe misalignment which was in the range of 0. 5 up to 2. 0. This thesis also provides a model for the probe signal as a spherical roller surface passes the probe surface. M. S.

5000|$|In normal operation, a {{rolling-element bearing}} has the <b>rollers</b> and <b>races</b> {{separated}} by {{a thin layer of}} lubricant such as grease or oil. [...] Although these lubricants normally appear liquid (not solid), under high pressure they act as solids and keep the bearing and race from touching.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} usual {{limits to the}} {{lifetime}} or load capacity of a bearing: abrasion, fatigue and pressure-induced welding. Abrasion occurs when the surface is eroded by hard contaminants scraping at the bearing materials. Fatigue results when a material becomes brittle after being repeatedly loaded and released. Where the ball or <b>roller</b> touches the <b>race</b> there is always some deformation, and hence a risk of fatigue. Smaller balls or rollers deform more sharply, and so tend to fatigue faster. Pressure-induced welding can occur when two metal pieces are pressed together at very high pressure and they become one. Although balls, <b>rollers</b> and <b>races</b> may look smooth, they are microscopically rough. Thus, there are high-pressure spots which push away the bearing lubricant. Sometimes, the resulting metal-to-metal contact welds a microscopic part of the ball or <b>roller</b> to the <b>race.</b> As the bearing continues to rotate, the weld is then torn apart, but it may leave race welded to bearing or bearing welded to race.|$|R
