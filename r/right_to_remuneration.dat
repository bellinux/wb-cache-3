25|$|The {{copyright}} {{term was}} extended from 25 years to generally 50 years p.m.a. {{for all kinds}} of works, and the law for the first time made explicit that no formalities were required for a work to be copyrighted. Anonymous or pseudonymous works were copyrighted for 50 years since their initial publication, unless the real identity of the author became known during that time and thus 50 years p.m.a. applied. The moral rights to authorship, name, and integrity of the work were perpetual; and authors could only transfer usage rights on a work (but not their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> for such uses, which always remained a personal right of the author).|$|E
25|$|The law {{recognized}} the exclusive {{right of the}} author to publish, reproduce, and distribute his work, and also his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remuneration,</b> i.e., the right to receive royalties for uses of a work. The law included provisions enabling authors to transfer copyrights for a limited time (five years) to a publisher by contract; only publishing contracts with state, trade union, or Party publishing houses could be of unlimited duration. The contract had to specify precisely the intended use of the work, the number of copies printed, the royalties to be paid, etc. The allowed range {{of the amount of}} royalties was prescribed in governmental remuneration schedules.|$|E
25|$|Performers {{are granted}} the {{exclusive}} rights to their performance, including a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> for any uses of a performance or a recording thereof. Besides the right to perform a performance and to deny others to perform it, these exclusive rights cover also the live broadcasting of a performance, and the video or audio recording of a previously unfixed performance. As in article 7(1)(c) of the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations, performers' rights also cover the reproduction of non-authorized recordings, and also the reproduction of recordings for purposes other than those agreed upon, including the broadcast of a recording made for non-commercial purposes only. For broadcasts of records made for commercial purposes, the performers, together with the phonogram producer, have only a remuneration right on this secondary use of phonograms.|$|E

5000|$|Constitution of the Russian Federation (1993), mainly article 19.2-3, which {{among other}} things advocates equal <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> {{both men and women}} and equal {{opportunities}} to exercise them as well as article 37.3, which sets out the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> labor <b>remuneration</b> without any discrimination and not lower than minimum wages and salaries established by federal law.|$|R
25|$|The {{copyright}} law of 1993 also contained, {{similar to other}} European {{copyright law}}s, contract provisions regulating the transfer of copyrights. Contracts {{have to be in}} writing, except for contracts about the use of a work in a periodical, which may be concluded orally. Shrink-wrap licenses for software are allowed. The law distinguishes between exclusive and non-exclusive transfers of rights. Only patrimonial rights can be transferred, but not moral rights, the resale right, or the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> for home-copying. In any contract, only those rights explicitly mentioned are transferred, and a transfer is only considered exclusive if the contract explicitly says so. Any contract must specify for which uses the rights on a work are transferred, for which term this transfer is valid, for which territory it applies, and it must define the remuneration the author receives. If no term is specified, an author may revoke the contract after five years with six months notice. If the territory in unspecified, the contract applies only to the territory of the Russian Federation. The remuneration must in general be given {{as a percentage of the}} gross income (sale price) generated by the use of the work, if the contract does not contain a remuneration clause, government-defined minimum schedules apply. The law prohibits the transfer of rights on future works or for future methods of exploitations. Unless the contract explicitly includes a sub-licensing permission, a licensee may not transfer some or all of the licensed rights to a third party.|$|E
2500|$|The {{author of}} a work again was granted a set of {{exclusive}} rights: the personal (or moral) rights to authorship, name, {{and the integrity of}} the work, and the property (or economic) rights to the work: the right to publish or use the work, and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> for use of the work or for granting permission to use the work. A [...] "use" [...] of a work was defined by a non-exhaustive list that included broadcasting, performance, modification, adaptation, recording, and distribution. [...] "Publication" [...] was clearly defined to be subject to the author's permission.|$|E
2500|$|Movies {{are treated}} {{separately}} {{by the law}} {{as part of the}} category [...] "audiovisual works". Russian law does not require [...] "moving images": according to Elst, a slide show may be a [...] "audiovisual work" [...] if its internal consistency amongst the images is high enough. The law does, however, require that the images be recorded somehow: a live television broadcast is not an audiovisual work (but is covered by the broadcaster's neighbouring rights). For movies, the law exhaustively enumerates all the initial copyright holders: the director, the author of the script, and the composer of the film music, if any. The law stipulates a transfer of the economic rights relating to publishing the film (including the rights to subtitling and redubbing) to the producer, unless the contract specifies otherwise. Although not considered authors, other individuals such as the camera director or the set designer do have a copyright on their individual works. They may exploit their works independently of the film: a set designer may authorize the use of the set design for a theatre production, and a composer retains his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> if the music is performed. If the authors or other co-creators of a movie are employed by the producer, their works are subject to the rules for employee-created works. In this case, all economic rights are transferred by default to the producer.|$|E

2500|$|Copyright was {{automatic}} and {{not subject to}} registration; in fact, a long-ignored registration paragraph of the 1928 law had been abolished already in 1959. Copyright arose {{with the creation of}} the work. As before, the only requirements for a copyright were that the work was creative and existed in an objective form on the territory of the USSR. If a work met these two conditions, it was copyrighted regardless of the nationality of the author. Works of Soviet authors were copyrighted in all cases, even if they existed only abroad or were first published outside of the Soviet Union. The list of copyrightable works in the law was only indicative, but included explicitly for the first time also sound recordings ("mechanical or magnetic recording"). Oral works such as speeches were copyrightable works, although such copyrights were virtually unenforceable in practice and largely nullified anyway by a [...] "free use" [...] provision allowing their free reproduction. Architectural works were also copyrighted, but that copyright extended only to the plans, blueprints, and models, not to the actual building itself. Photographs still were subject to the rule from the 1928 Fundamentals that they needed to be marked with the name of the studio, its address, and the year in order to be copyrighted. Employees for the first time were granted a copyright on works they created as part of their duties, but their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> was limited to their salary. Legal documents and in general works created by civil servants in their line of duty were not subject to copyright.|$|E

40|$|The {{tensions}} between {{human rights and}} globalization can beread in the parallel historical development of an international humanrights regime with a so-called “free trade” regime. These twointernational regimes have developed without entering any real dialogue until very recently, although they are both claiming to {{serve the interests of}} humanity. The true goals of each of these movements, I argue, are contradictory and cannot be resolved – least of all by a movement such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), which originates in the corporate sector. Even though the human rights regime and the global economic regime had a similar normative ambition of advancing human welfare, rights and opportunities, the paradox of this ambition was that the structure of the global economic order made the achievement of these rights impossible. Whereas the primary responsibility for the enforcementof human rights standards lies with national governments, there is agrowing acceptance that corporations also have an important role to play. Instruments of the human <b>rights</b> regime attempt <b>to</b> share or complement states responsibilities with private actors’ responsibility. Indeed, the human rights regime affirms explicitly the prevalence of the human <b>right</b> <b>to</b> fair <b>remuneration</b> over wealth creation, rationale of the free trade regime. The contradiction is apparent and the human <b>right</b> <b>to</b> fair <b>remuneration</b> highlights the incompatibility of the two regimes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the optimal design of gender pay equity regulation in Australian labour law. The examination is {{framed by a}} weakening in Australia’s gender pay equity performance since the industrial breakthroughs of 1969 and 1972, an outcome at odds with a policy apparatus that directs {{more attention to the}} needs of women in waged labour. This inquiry is advanced by a case study examination of industrial proceedings that provide a unique opportunity to assess three stages of pay equity reform: the adoption of federal equal pay principles in 1969 and 1972; a legislative entitlement <b>to</b> equal <b>remuneration,</b> introduced <b>to</b> federal labour law in 1993; and distinct initiatives developed in two state industrial jurisdictions. The project of gender pay equity reform in Australia, following the end of the long post-war boom, has been accompanied by a series of competing discourses. This has comprised both a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> equal <b>remuneration</b> and a series of institutional arrangements and relationships that compromise this right. The basis of Australia’s class settlement has been recast in favour of capital {{in a way that is}} prejudicial to gender pay equity being achieved. In this brave new world capital remains resistant to revaluing the price of feminised labour. Thus this recast settlement has gendered consequences which are evident also in the masculinist construction of labour law institutions and their processes. It is these dimensions that underpin the resistance to redressing the institutional and cultural determinants of rates of pay and the weakness of measures directed nominally to this task. If federal labour law is to be effective, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> equal <b>remuneration</b> for work of equal value is a key starting point and remains an important foundation in capturing feminist claims on the state and the market. It requires accompanying institutional measures that enable examination and remedy of the undervaluation of women’s waged labour and which do not necessarily test the validity of those rates of pay through reference to embedded, masculinised norms and practices. It was measures akin to these that emerged from developments in state jurisdictions, developments that were swept away by the latest phase of neo-liberal reform. To enable collective and aggregate reform the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> equal <b>remuneration</b> needs <b>to</b> be conjoined to wage determination in industry settlements...|$|R

5000|$|For {{more than}} four decades, Thommessen has been an {{advocate}} for artists’ rights and has frequently partaken in public debate; in particular defending the composers’ <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> rightful <b>remuneration</b> for performances of new works.

In addition public debate, his stance on this matter has also led to compositional output by third parties: a 2006 letter he wrote to the composer Marcus Paus was later utilized as the libretto for Paus’ opera monologue [...] The Teacher Who Was Not To Be [...] (2013). Thommessen was later identified by Paus as the previously anonymous librettist.|$|R
