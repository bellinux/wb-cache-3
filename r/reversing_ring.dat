40|$|The perceptual load {{theory of}} {{attention}} proposes {{that the degree}} to which visual distractors are processed {{is a function of the}} attentional demands of a task – greater demands increase filtering of irrelevant distractors. The spatial configuration of such filtering is unknown. Here, we used steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in conjunction with time-domain event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the distribution of load-induced distractor suppression and task-relevant enhancement in the visual field. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while subjects performed a foveal go/no-go task that varied in perceptual load. Load-dependent distractor suppression was assessed by presenting a contrast <b>reversing</b> <b>ring</b> at one of three eccentricities (2 &# 176;, 6 &# 176;, or 11 &# 176;) during performance of the go/no-go task. Rings contrast reversed at 8. 3 Hz, allowing load-dependent changes in distractor processing to be tracked in the frequency-domain. ERPs were calculated to the onset of stimuli in the load task to examine load-dependent modulation of task-relevant processing. Results showed that the amplitude of the distractor SSVEP (8. 3 Hz) was attenuated under high perceptual load (relative to low load) at the most proximal (2 &# 176;) eccentricity but not at more eccentric locations (6 ˚ or 11 ˚). Task-relevant ERPs revealed a significant increase in N 1 amplitude under high load. These results are consistent with a center-surround configuration of load-induced enhancement and suppression in the visual field...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a reverse integration approach for {{the exploration of}} low-dimensional effective potential landscapes. Coarse reverse integration initialized on a ring of coarse states enables efficient "navigation" on the landscape terrain: escape from local effective potential wells, detection of saddle points, and identification of significant transition paths between wells. We consider several distinct ring evolution modes: backward stepping in time, solution arc [...] length, and effective potential. The performance of these approaches is illustrated for a deterministic problem where the energy landscape is known explicitly. <b>Reverse</b> <b>ring</b> integration is then applied to "noisy" problems where the ring integration routine serves as an outer "wrapper" around a forward-in-time inner simulator.

40|$|A {{number of}} new {{analogue}} models studying caldera architecture and development have been recently performed under different conditions (apparatus, materials, scaling parameters, stress conditions). An overview of the experiments reveals a consistent scenario for caldera structure and development, regardless of any imposed boundary condition. In fact, a complete collapse can be summarized through four main stages, proportional {{to the amount of}} subsidence, progressively characterized by a: 1) downsag, 2) <b>reverse</b> <b>ring</b> fault; 3) peripheral downsag, 4) peripheral normal ring fault.

The four evolutionary stages adequately explain the architecture and development of the established caldera end-members (downsag, piston, funnel, piecemeal, trapdoor) along a continuum, where one or more end-members may correspond to a specific stage. While such a continuum is controlled by progressive subsidence, specific collapse geometries result from secondary contributory factors (roof aspect ratio, collapse symmetry, pre-existing faults).

With the engine off, this brake band acting on the rear unit ring gear had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear unit ring gear with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the <b>reverse</b> unit <b>ring</b> gear were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn.

We used dry sand to simulate the brittle crust and silicone to simulate the intruding magma. Resurgence always occurs through the formation of a discrete number of differentially displaced blocks.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the role of an asymmetrically shaped magma chamber on the resurgence-related deformation of a caldera collapsed in a previously deformed crustal sector, a set of analogue models has been carried out. The obtained results have been compared with those of similar experiments, previously performed imposing a symmetrical magma chamber. Two lines of experiments were performed to simulate: a) resurgence in an area with a simple graben-like structure; b) resurgence in a caldera collapsed within the previously generated graben-like structure. On the basis of commonly accepted scaling laws, we used dry-quartz sand to simulate the brittle behaviour of the crust and newtonian siliconee to simulate the ductile behaviour of the intruding magma. An asymmetrical shape of the magma chamber has been simulated moulding handily only the upper surface of the siliconee. The resulting empty space has been then filled with sand. The results of the experiments are similar to those obtained with simmetrically shaped silicone. In the sample with a simple graben-like structure, resurgence occurs through the formation of a discrete number of differentially displaced blocks. The most uplifted portion of the deformed caldera floor is affected by newly formed, high-angle, inward dipping reverse faults. The least uplifted portion of the caldera is affected by normal faults with similar orientation, either newly formed or resulting from reactivation of the pre-existent graben faults. This asymmetric block resurgence has been also observed in the experiments performed with a previous caldera collapse. In this case the caldera collapse-related <b>reverse</b> <b>ring</b> fault is completely erased along the shortened side, and enhances the effect of the extensional faults on the opposite side, facilitating the intrusion of the siliconee.

40|$|Understanding the {{structure}} and development of calderas is crucial for predicting their behaviour during periods of unrest and to plan geothermal and ore exploitation. Geological data, including that from analysis of deeply eroded examples, allow the overall surface setting of calderas to be defined, whereas deep drillings and geophysical investigations provide insights on their subsurface structure. Collation of this information from calderas worldwide {{has resulted in the}} recent literature in five main caldera types (downsag, piston, funnel, piecemeal, trapdoor), being viewed as end-members. Despite its importance, such a classification does not adequately examine a) {{the structure}} of calderas (particularly the nature of the caldera’s bounding faults) and (b) how this is achieved (including the genetic relationships among the five caldera types). Various sets of analogue models, specifically devoted to study caldera architecture and development, have been recently performed, under different conditions (apparatus, materials, scaling parameters, stress conditions). The first part of this study reviews these experiments, which induce collapse as a result of underpressure or overpressure within the chamber analogue. The experiments simulating overpressure display consistent results, but the experimental depressions require an exceptional amount of doming, seldom observed in nature, to form; therefore, these experiments are not appropriate to understand {{the structure and}} formation of most natural calderas. The experiments simulating underpressure reveal a consistent scenario for caldera structure and development, regardless of their different boundary conditions. These show that complete collapse proceeds through four main stages, proportional to the amount of subsidence, progressively characterized by: 1) downsag, 2) <b>reverse</b> <b>ring</b> fault; 3) peripheral downsag, 4) peripheral normal ring fault. The second part of this study verifies the possibility that these latter calderas constitute a suitable analogue to nature and consists of a comprehensive comparison of the underpressure experiments to natural calderas. This shows that all the experimental structures, as well as their progressive development, are commonly observed at natural calderas, highlighting a consistency between models and nature. As the shallow structure of experimental calderas corresponds to a precise architecture at depth, it provides a unique key to infer the deeper structure of natural calderas: recognizing diagnostic surface features within a caldera will thus allow it to be categorized within a precise structural and evolutionary context. The general relationship between the evolutionary stage of a caldera and its d/s (diameter/subsidence) ratio allows such a quantification, with stage 1 calderas characterized by d/s> 40, stage 2 by 18 <d/s< 40, stage 3 by 14 <d/s< 18 and stage 4 by d/s< 14. The consistency between experiments and nature suggests that, in principle, the d/s ratio may permit to evaluate the overall structure and evolutionary stage of a caldera even when its surface structure is poorly known. The volume of erupted magma associated with caldera collapse is poorly dependent on the d/s ratio or evolutionary stage; however, the location of sin- and post-collapse volcanism may depend not only upon the amount of collapse, but also on the roof aspect ratio. As the regional tectonic control is concerned, the experiments explain the ellipticity of a part of natural calderas elongated parallel to the regional extension; the control of pre-existing structures may explain the elongation of elliptic calderas oblique or parallel to the regional structures. The four stages adequately explain the architecture and development of the established caldera end-members along a continuum, where one or more end-members (downsag, piston, funnel, piecemeal, trapdoor) may correspond to a specific stage. While such a continuum is controlled by progressive subsidence, specific collapse geometries will result from secondary contributory factors (roof aspect ratio, collapse symmetry, pre-existing faults). These considerations allow proposing an original classification of calderas, incorporating their structural and genetic features...|$|R

We hypothesized that ceramide accumulation was from an age-related loss of endothelial glutathione (GSH) and subsequent activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase), an enzyme whose activity increases when GSH is limited. Experimental approach: Old (30 - 32 mo) F 344 xBN rats were given (R) -alpha-lipoic acid (LA), an agent known to induce GSH synthesis. Vasorelaxation was measured in aortic rings; GSH and ceramide levels, activity of nSMase and eNOS phosphorylation (by Western blot) was measured in aortic endothelial cells, isolated from the same aortas. Key results: In old animals, endothelium-dependent relaxation in aortic rings was decreased, GSH levels and its redox state in aortic endothelia were over 30 % lower and nSMase activity and endothelial ceramide levels were three-fold increased, relative to young (2 - 4 mo) rats. LA treatment of old animals improved relaxation in aortic <b>rings,</b> <b>reversed</b> the changes in endothelial GSH, in nSMase activities and in ceramide levels.
