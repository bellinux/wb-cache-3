Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you <b>really</b> <b>look</b> at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
500|$|The series {{opening of}} The City premiered to 1.6 million viewers, {{significantly}} less than the 2.6 million viewers attracted by the fourth-season finale of The Hills. The {{second half of the}} season premiered with 2 million viewers, a 43% increase from its debut. The remainder of the season maintained an average 1.9 million viewers, with the finale peaking at 2.3 million. Upon the conclusion of the second season in July 2010, rumors were widespread that The City would be cancelled. In October 2010, Port commented that [...] "it doesn't <b>really</b> <b>look</b> like we're doing it anymore", with MTV later adding that the series would not be renewed for a third season.|$|E
500|$|Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, an American nuclear {{physicist}} assisting Bond in his mission. Richards {{stated that}} she liked the role because it was [...] "brainy", [...] "athletic", and had [...] "depth of character, in contrast to Bond girls from previous decades". Richards stated {{that a lot of}} viewers [...] "made fun of" [...] the character's attire but that [...] "These Bond girls are so outrageous and if I did <b>really</b> <b>look</b> like a scientist, the Bond fans would have been disappointed." [...] Writer Ben Bussey stated in a Yahoo! Movies article that [...] "it's clear that Eon were never aiming especially high with this character" [...] since the company [...] "reportedly" [...] auditioned Geri Halliwell and Tiffani Thiessen for the role.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Jak 3 was being {{developed}} by Naughty Dog, a company closely tied with Insomniac. Naughty Dog's Jak & Daxter series and the Ratchet & Clank series are in similar genres; each game in both series' has been released at a similar time and both contain references to each other. Ryan Schneider, an employee of Insomniac, said, [...] "The analogy that I like to use is that at Insomniac we {{like to look at}} it as how Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant act {{when it comes to their}} professions. We don't <b>really</b> <b>look</b> at it as how we compare to other athletes or other games, we just try to do the best that we can and elevate the sport." ...|$|E
500|$|Wired {{reported}} that the iPhone 5 design, carried on in the iPhone 5S and iPhone SE, was regarded as [...] "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general", while the succeeding iPhone 6/6S design was less critically acclaimed as it [...] "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". Wired described the iPhone 5 as [...] "elegance rooted {{in the way the}} aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from the iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, the iPhone 5 didn’t <b>really</b> <b>look</b> like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5's design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{started his}} {{motorsport}} career in motorcycle racing in 1981. He {{used the same}} simple, easily identifiable helmet design as his father: eight white oar blades arranged vertically around the upper surface of a dark blue helmet. The device and colours represent the London Rowing Club for which Graham Hill rowed in the early 1950s. Although he won a 350cc clubman's championship at the Brands Hatch circuit, his racing budget came from working as a building labourer and he [...] "didn't <b>really</b> <b>look</b> destined for great things" [...] according to Motorcycle News reporter Rob McDonnell. His mother, who {{was concerned about the}} dangers of racing motorcycles, persuaded him to take a racing car course at the Winfield Racing School in France in 1983. Although he showed [...] "above-average aptitude", Hill had only sporadic single-seater races until the end of 1984. He graduated through British Formula Ford, winning six races driving a Van Diemen for Manadient Racing in 1985, his first full season in cars, and finishing third and fifth in the two UK national championships. He also took third place in the final of the 1985 Formula Ford Festival, helping the UK to win the team prize.|$|E

500|$|For {{the final}} twelve episodes of the season, Marvel once again ran the [...] "Art of..." [...] initiative, {{in which a}} {{different}} image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being [...] "The Art of Evolution". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, [...] "maybe we'll show [...] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. And {{then we have a}} conversation with them about how we'd like to portray that, and then we try to lean into the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's one of the things [...] <b>really</b> <b>look</b> forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation." [...] The art once again appeared as variant covers to select titles published by Marvel Comics in June 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} Superunknown {{captured}} the metal influences of the band's previous works while showcasing the group's newly evolving style. Steve Huey of AllMusic {{said that the}} band's [...] "earlier punk influences are rarely detectable, replaced by surprisingly effective appropriations of pop and psychedelia." [...] Cornell labeled the album as more [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "versatile" [...] than the band's previous releases. The songs on the album are more experimental and diverse than the band's previous recordings, with some songs having a Middle-Eastern or Indian flavor (for example [...] "Half", sung by Shepherd). Some songs also show a Beatles influence, such as [...] "Head Down" [...] and [...] "Black Hole Sun". In a 1994 interview with Guitar World, Thayil explained, [...] "We looked deep down inside {{the very core of}} our souls and there was a little Ringo sitting there. Oh sure, we like telling people it's John Lennon or George Harrison; but when you <b>really</b> <b>look</b> deep inside of Soundgarden, there's a little Ringo wanting to get out." [...] Drummer Matt Cameron said that the experimentation on the album was [...] "just a matter of refinement." [...] According to The A.V. Club, the album [...] "both redefined and transcended grunge". Michael Beinhorn stated that to achieve the intensity of Superunknown, he sought influence from European electronic music, such as the British Aphex Twin and the Dutch genre of Gabber, described by him as [...] "some of the rawest music made".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Matsoukas {{said that she was}} surprised with the professional standard of Rihanna's acting. The inspiration for Rihanna acting in the video came from when Matsoukas saw the clip for [...] "Man Down" [...] in April 2011; the director stated that she was taken aback at how Rihanna realistically re-enacted a rape scenario. Matsoukas described the process for choosing O'Shaughnessy as the male love interest, stating that Rihanna had asked her to find a man she could [...] "fake fuck" [...] while filming. The director said that she telephoned a boxer her friend had told her about, and asked him to make a tape of himself using the description of how the male love interest should act. When asked if any of the video was improvised, Matsoukas revealed that she would create a scenario and then it was left to Rihanna and O'Shaughnessy to elaborate upon what the director had given them. Matsoukas jokingly said that the scene in which O'Shaughnessy draws a tattoo on Rihanna's buttock cheek {{was not part of the}} video's treatment, and that O'Shaughnessy improvised it. Upon the video's release, multiple media outlets and music critics compared the content of the video to a reenactment of Rihanna and Brown's physical altercation. When asked about this, Matsoukas clarified that the video was not linked to Brown in any circumstance, and said, [...] " [...] doesn't even <b>really</b> <b>look</b> like Chris Brown to me." ...|$|E

500|$|As of 2015–16, {{there were}} still a {{significant}} number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as [...] "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general" [...] (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it [...] "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". The iPhone 5 was described as [...] "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone.

However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to <b>really</b> <b>look</b> at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, [...] "Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool." [...] Fortunately, it went my way." ...|$|E
