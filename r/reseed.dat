However, sportswriter Peter King wrote that he believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games {{and how it will}} impact the postseason, and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{the ropes}} {{were allowed to}} <b>reseed</b> naturally, after harvest, from the spat already present in coastal waters. However, this method was unreliable. In 1974 a marine {{scientist}} discovered mussel spat encrusted on drift kelp on Ninety Mile Beach. Locals collected the seaweed and air freighted it to mussel farmers. Kaitaia spat, as it became known, is now the prime source of seed mussels. There are some experimental hatcheries.|$|E
40|$|A {{new form}} of LFSR <b>reseeding</b> &at {{provides}} higher encoding efficiency and hence greater reduction in test data storage requirements is described. Previous forms of LFSR <b>reseeding</b> have been static (i. e., test generation is stopped and the seed is loaded at one time) and have required full <b>reseeding</b> (i. e., n=r bits are used for an r-bit LFSR). The {{new form of}} LFSR <b>reseeding</b> proposed here is dynamic (i. e., the seed is incrementally modified while test generation proceeds) and allows partial <b>reseeding</b> (i. e. n<r bits can be used). Full static forms of LFSR <b>reseeding</b> are {{shown to be a}} aecial case of the new partial dynamic form of LFSR <b>reseeding.</b> In addition to providing better encoding efficiency, partial dynamic LFSR <b>reseeding</b> has a simpler hardware implementation than previous schemes based on multiple-polynomial LFSR& and can generate each test vector in fewer clock cycles.

Although the success of postfire remediation is critical, few efforts {{have been made to}} leverage existing geospatial technologies to develop methodologies to assess <b>reseeding</b> success following a fire. In this study, Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data were used to improve the capacity to assess postfire <b>reseeding</b> rehabilitation efforts, with particular emphasis on the semiarid rangelands of Idaho.

25|$|The {{domestication}} {{of wheat}} provides an example. Wild wheat shatters and {{falls to the}} ground to <b>reseed</b> itself when ripe, but domesticated wheat stays on the stem for easier harvesting. This change was possible because of a random mutation in the wild populations at the beginning of wheat's cultivation. Wheat with this mutation was harvested more frequently and became the seed for the next crop. Therefore, without realizing, early farmers selected for this mutation. The result is domesticated wheat, which relies on farmers for its reproduction and dissemination.|$|E

50|$|The <b>reseed</b> control {{component}} is leveraging between frequent reseeding, which is desirable but might allow iterative guessing attacks, and infrequent reseeding, which compromises more information for an attacker {{who has the}} key. Yarrow uses the fast pool to <b>reseed</b> whenever the source passes some threshold values, and uses the slow pool to <b>reseed</b> whenever {{at least two of}} its sources pass some other threshold value. The specific threshold values are mentioned in the Yarrow-160 section.|$|E
40|$|<b>Reseeding</b> sites {{should be}} {{selected}} with care. 'Rather level land with deep, fertile, medium-textured soils responds most readily to <b>reseeding.</b> No <b>reseeding</b> is recommended where average annual rain-fall {{is less than}} 11 inches. Ranges {{that are to be}} <b>reseeded</b> should not support more than scat-tered stands of mesquite, burroweed, cactus, annual weeds, or other competitive species. If these are abundant, they should be con-trolled prior to seeding operations. <b>Reseeded</b> areas should be readily subject to managed grazing and should fit in well with the over-all ranch management plan. The best sites for <b>reseeding</b> are those with productive, medium-textured soils, above 4, 000 feet in elevation, and that receive 14 inches or more rainfall annually. On these sites, Lehmann and Boer love-grass are the best species to use. Lehmann is the easier to establish, but Boer is more palatable and longer lived. Cotton top, black grama...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reseeding</b> is used {{to improve}} fault {{coverage}} in BIST pseudorandom testing. Most of the work done on <b>reseeding</b> is based on storing the seeds in an external tester. Besides its high cost, testing using automatic test equipment (ATE) {{makes it hard to}} test the circuit while in the system. In this paper, we present a technique for built-in <b>reseeding.</b> Our technique requires no storage for the seeds. The seeds are encoded in hardware. The seeds we use are deterministic so 100 % fault coverage can be achieved. Our technique causes no performance overhead and does not change the original circuit under test. Also, the technique we present is applicable for transition faults as well as single-stuck-at faults. Built-in <b>reseeding</b> is based on expanding every seed to as many ATPG patterns as possible. This is different from many existing <b>reseeding</b> techniques that expand every seed into a single ATPG pattern. This paper presents the built-in <b>reseeding</b> algorithm together with a hardware synthesis algorithm and implementation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Herbage {{production}} and utilization on Irish dairy farms is well below its potential. A {{number of factors}} influence herbage {{production and}} utilization, not least the level of annual <b>reseeding</b> (introduction of a new grass ley) on the farm. The potential farm performance is reduced by old permanent pasture due to the combined effects of reduced out-of-season herbage production and lower overall herbage yield when compared to perennial ryegrass. Based on the sales of grass seed, {{it is estimated that}} approximately 2 % of the land area on dairy farms in Ireland is <b>reseeded</b> annually. This has created a situation where the overall percentage of perennial ryegrass in sward is low. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the economic benefits of <b>reseeding</b> through simulating the consequences of <b>reseeding</b> different proportions of the farm on an annual basis. Four levels of an annual <b>reseeding</b> programme were evaluated: 1 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 % of the farm <b>reseeded</b> annually; evaluated at three milk prices (20 c/L, 27 c/L and 33 c/L). Increasing the level of <b>reseeding</b> resulted in an increase in total and seasonal herbage production and, when accompanied by an increased stocking rate, increased herbage utilization. At a milk price of 27 c/L, farm profitability was € 20 764, € 24 794, € 30 073 and € 33 515 on a 40 ha farm when 1 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 %, respectively, of the farm was <b>reseeded</b> annually. Irrespective of milk price, increasing the level of <b>reseeding</b> had a positive effect on profitability and the highest gain was achieved at the highest milk price. Sensitivity analysis showed that sward persistency and, to a lesser extent, herbage utilization had significant effects on the benefit from <b>reseeding.</b> peer-reviewe...|$|R

50|$|The <b>reseed</b> {{mechanism}} {{connects the}} entropy accumulator to the generating mechanism. Reseeding from the fast pool uses the current key and the hash of all inputs to the fast pool since startup {{to generate a}} new key; reseeding from the slow pool behaves similarly, except it also uses the hash of all inputs to the slow pool to generate a new key. Both of the reseedings reset the entropy estimation of the fast pool to zero, but the last one also sets the estimation of the slow pool to zero. The reseeding mechanism updates the key constantly, so {{that even if the}} key of pool information is known to the attacker before the <b>reseed,</b> they will be unknown to the attacker after the <b>reseed.</b>|$|E
