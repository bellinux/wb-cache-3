5|$|The {{low level}} station {{remained}} open, although passenger numbers at that station also fell {{after the fire}} of 1936 and many services were diverted to serve London–Croydon routes instead of the Victoria–London Bridge route. <b>Rail</b> <b>travel</b> was in decline across the UK in the 1960s and 1970s when the Beeching Axe was imposed. During the 1970s, two outer platforms used by terminating trains were abandoned and the third rail was removed.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{international}} <b>rail</b> <b>travel</b> was liberalised by new European Union directives, {{designed to}} break up monopolies {{in order to encourage}} competition for services between countries. This sparked interest among other companies in providing services in competition to Eurostar and new services to destinations beyond Paris and Brussels. The only rail carrier to formally propose and secure permission for such a service up to now is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands. The sale of High Speed One by the British Government having effectively nationalised LCR in June 2009 is also likely to stimulate competition on the line.|$|E

5|$|Though Lancashire was a {{football}} stronghold {{in the early}} years of the professional game, providing a large proportion of Football League teams, the cup final had never been contested between two Lancashire clubs until the 1904 final. 30,000 supporters from the region travelled to London, sparking press reports of records for North-South <b>rail</b> <b>travel.</b> Lacking alternative accommodation, several thousand slept on the platforms at Euston and St Pancras. A jovial atmosphere built up, with the Manchester Industrial Boys Band playing Hiawatha. However, in London itself, the match received less attention than a final featuring a southern team would have done. Tickets in an uncovered stand cost 5s.|$|E

5|$|US2/US141 re-enters Michigan {{where it}} crosses the Menominee River and {{subsequently}} meets M‑95 in Breitung Township north of Iron Mountain and Kingsford. The highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on Stephenson Avenue into Iron Mountain {{along the west}} side of Lake Antoine, parallel to a branch line of the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad (ELS Railroad). The road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the Chapin Mine. In downtown Iron Mountain at Ludington Street, M‑95 turns west off Stephenson Avenue to run across town to Kingsford. US2/US141 exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the Midtown Mall. The highway re-enters Breitung Township where US141 separates to the south to re-enter Wisconsin. US2 continues eastward parallel to a branch of the Canadian National Railway (CN Railway). Both road and <b>rail</b> <b>travel</b> through the community of Quinnesec, where they pass near the largest paper mill in the UP. The trunkline runs along the main street of Norway, where the highway meets the eastern terminus of US8. Then US2 continues east through rural Dickinson County to Vulcan, passing north of Hanbury Lake through the Copper Country State Forest, before crossing the Sturgeon River in Loretto and passing into Menominee County.|$|E
