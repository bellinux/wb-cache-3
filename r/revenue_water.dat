In order to manage this scarce supply of water, we need to value it. This study focuses on the value of water in the agricultural sector, in particular the marginal <b>revenue</b> of <b>water</b> for six irrigation commodities namely avocados, bananas, grapefruit, mangoes, oranges and sugarcane. A quadratic production function was fitted with an SUR model specification in a panel data study from 1975 to 2002 to obtain marginal revenue functions for each of the six commodities. We found that mangoes are the most efficient commodity in its water use relative to revenue generated (marginal <b>revenue</b> of <b>water</b> equals R 25. 43 /m 3 in 2002) and sugarcane the least efficient (marginal <b>revenue</b> of <b>water</b> equals R 1. 67 /m 3 in 2002). The marginal <b>revenue</b> of <b>water</b> is not an indication of the true "market" price. Neither is it an indication what the administered price should be.

40|$|Abstract: The {{measure of}} {{performance}} of any water utility {{is based on}} the efficiency of the water distribution systems in place. Lately, performance indicators and benchmarking methodologies are the most important approaches used in assessing water distribution systems efficiency. This paper reviews water distribution systems assessment indictors and assesses their application to developing countries. The main indicators in use world over are either financial or operational. It was discovered that many utilities in developing countries do not adequately use these assessment indicators in their water loss management strategies. In a case study of the City of Harare, Zimbabwe, it was established that the city has 53 % Non <b>Revenue</b> <b>Water</b> Management systems efficiency after applying non <b>revenue</b> <b>water</b> assessment indicators...|$|E
40|$|Many reasons {{have been}} {{identified}} as contributing to or causing high level of non-revenue water such as poor organizational structures in the responsible agency, insufficient funds, poor water network implementation and low profile of actions addressing optimization of services including leakage control, inadequate tariff and collection systems. This paper describes a simulation system that was developed to predict the supply and demand of treated water as well as non <b>revenue</b> <b>water</b> source and magnitude for a case study of a public treated water distribution system. The system can also be used in assisting the management of the water department in simulating future development such as demand and new construction of water distribution. In conclusion, the developed system has increased the knowledge of the distribution system and understanding of consumption patterns and non <b>revenue</b> <b>water</b> zones, which has allowed the water authority to optimize its distribution system. 1...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{principal}} concerns today for the deteriorating quality of {{water supply and sanitation}} services in India is the high levels of non <b>revenue</b> <b>water</b> (NRW) -the difference between the amount of water put into the distribution system and the amount of water billed to consumers. High levels of NRW result from huge volumes of water lost through leaks or water not invoiced to customers or both, and this seriously affects financial viability of water providers through lost revenues, increased operational costs and, eventually, increased capital costs. Reducing non <b>revenue</b> <b>water</b> levels does not necessarily compromise on a service provider's ability to subsidize services for the poorer sections of the population; rather, it allows for improved transparency and accountability, and for ensuring better targeting of subsidies such that they are more equitable and actually reach poor people. The approach to reducing NRW includes a set of activities aimed at the optimization of water supply through improved operations, maintenance, and sound management practices of distribution networks as well as governance and management reforms through specific operational and commercial strategies. However, if NRW programs are to remain sustainable in the long run, they must target institutional and organizational reform while encouraging efficiencies through technical and managerial improvements and enhancing human resource capacity. This field note captures the core principles for the effective implementation of non <b>revenue</b> <b>water</b> programs through real world examples of service providers implementing such programs in India and Vietnam. The case studies demonstrate that successful leakage reduction and its effective and sustainable implementation has not been a result of erratic and irregular technical exercises to reduce physical losses.

40|$|Many water {{distribution}} systems (WDS) have {{high percentage of}} non <b>revenue</b> <b>water</b> (NRW). In order to decrease the volume of NRW, district metered areas (DMAs) are introduced, where hydraulic parameters such as pressure and flow are measured. Knowing the volume of inlet water into the DMA and the volume of <b>revenue</b> <b>water</b> at the demand nodes, {{it is easy to}} calculate the volume of NRW. Dividing WDS into different DMAs enables the water management utilities faster identification of water losses and effective control over the whole system. However, there are also some negative effects such as lower pressure and problems related to water quality. The objective is to divide WDS into DMAs in such way that the hydraulic conditions don’t get worse. Many of known methods are limited to small or skeletioned WDS. Therefore our aim is to find a fast and effective algorithm for partitioning complex networks. Among several algorithms the algorithm for spectral partitioning was selected. Some hydraulic parameters are included in the method as input data in order to generate hydraulically suitable solutions. Numerous solutions are obtained, among which the optimal is selected. All of them are tested with program EPANET 2. 0 and MATLAB 2015 using the EPANET Programmer Toolkit. The proposed method was also tested on a real case study...|$|E
40|$|All {{across the}} world there are {{concerns}} about water availability that invite utilities to perform better as water stewards. One {{of the ways to}} get a better performance, both operational and financial, is to reduce water losses. In fact, the utilities should not just compare water produced to water sold, but they {{should be aware of the}} importance of implementing water loss reduction programs as clean water is becoming a scarce resource and conservation is needed. This is why water industries are now recognizing the need to minimize water loss. The objective of this work is to provide methodological elements to analyse commercial water losses in Colombian Water Utilities based on a system dynamics approach. A model will be developed to study the impacts coming from different policies which are created to reduce water losses (measured by an index called Non <b>Revenue</b> <b>Water</b> 1) in the residential sector. In the context of this research, the System Dynamics model can ease the understanding of interactions and causal relations underlying the water loss problem among the clients, the company and the surrounding environment.
