50|$|If {{not stated}} otherwise, the {{contractor}} or supplier {{with the lowest}} bid is awarded the contract, provided that they meet the minimum criteria for the bid. This {{is in contrast to}} a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> proposal (RFP), in which case other reasons (technology used, quality) might cause or allow choice of the second best offer. An RFP is a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a <b>price</b> from a buyer but the buyer would also expect suggestions and ideas on how the project work should be done. RFPs are thus focused on more than just pricing/cost, they entail a bit of consulting from the contractor or vendor.|$|R

25|$|The philosopher Hans Albert {{has argued}} that the ceteris paribus {{conditions}} of the marginalist theory rendered the theory itself an empty tautology and completely closed to experimental testing.

5000|$|An RFP {{typically}} {{involves more}} than a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> the <b>price.</b> Other <b>requested</b> information may include basic corporate information and history, financial information (can the company deliver without risk of bankruptcy), technical capability (used on major procurements of services, where the item has not previously been made or where the requirement could be met by varying technical means), product information such as stock availability and estimated completion period, and customer references that can be checked to determine a company's suitability (including educational and military background of its employees on the project --- college graduates and those with advanced college degrees may add [...] "value" [...] from the bidder).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s brokers had become {{accustomed}} to several problems doing business with their customers. To make a trade, an investor had to know the current <b>price</b> <b>for</b> the stock. The investor got this from a broker who could find it on his board. If the last trade (or the stock itself) hadn't {{made it to the}} board (or there was no board) the broker telegraphed a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> the <b>price</b> to that firm's [...] "wire room" [...] in New York. There, such requests would be forwarded {{to the floor of the}} appropriate exchange, where messengers could copy down prices at the locations where those stocks were traded, and telephone answers back to the wire room. Typical elapsed times were between 15 and 30 minutes just to inform the broker.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{advances}} {{were made in}} the safety features available for the Lincoln Town Car, with ABS becoming an optional feature in 1990. Following the return of 4-wheel disc brakes to the Town Car in 1991 (for the first time since 1979), ABS became standard in 1992. As {{with the rest of the}} Panther-platform vehicles, the Town Car was fitted with a driver's side airbag in 1990, although the Town Car was technically designed to be fitted with dual airbags (the first American-produced luxury vehicle to be fitted with them). However, due to supply problems with the passenger airbag module, the passenger airbag essentially became a delete option, with a credit on the window sticker issued <b>for</b> the <b>price</b> of the missing airbag. Upon owner <b>request,</b> <b>for</b> the <b>price</b> of the issued credit, the passenger airbag would be installed. By the beginning of the 1992 model year, all Town Cars come equipped with dual airbags from the factory.|$|R

5000|$|Cambridge {{economist}} Joan Robinson famously criticized utility {{for being}} a circular concept: [...] "Utility is the quality in commodities that makes individuals want to buy them, {{and the fact that}} individuals want to buy commodities shows that they have utility" [...] Robinson also pointed out that because the theory assumes that preferences are fixed this means that utility is not a testable assumption. This is so because if we take changes in peoples' behavior in relation to a change in prices or a change in the underlying budget constraint we can never be sure to what extent the change in behavior was due to the change in price or budget constraint and how much was due to a change in preferences. This criticism {{is similar to that of}} the philosopher Hans Albert who argued that the ceteris paribus conditions on which the marginalist theory of demand rested rendered the theory itself an empty tautology and completely closed to experimental testing. In essence, demand and supply curve (theoretical line of quantity of a product which would have been offered or <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> given <b>price)</b> is purely ontological and could never been demonstrated empirically.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} opportunity {{came when}} a large collection of Etruscan antiquities was offered for sale. The collection {{was known as the}} Museo Corazzi, and consisted of over 500 artifacts. Most of these were bronzes and Etruscan. Reuvens was interested in the Corazzi collection, because the study of the relatively unknown Etruscans could push Italian history back considerably. Taxating the group proved difficult though, since there were no masterpieces but Etruscan art was rare. The <b>requested</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> the collection had dropped from 60.000 guilders to 38.000, but this was still a huge amount of money and Etruscan antiquities lay outside the scope of the expedition which was supposed to be in Tunisia.|$|R
50|$|Scantlin Electronics reacted {{immediately}} to the Ultronic threat. In early 1962 they began work on their own computer-based system {{and put it into}} service in December, 1962. It used four Control Data CDC 160A computers in New York which recorded trading data in magnetic core memory. Major cities hosted Central Office equipment connected to newly designed Quotron II desk units in brokerage offices on which a broker could <b>request,</b> <b>for</b> any stock, <b>price</b> and net change from the opening, or a summary which included highs, lows, and volumes (later SEI added other features like dividends and earnings). The requests went to a Central Office, which condensed and forwarded them to the New York computer. Replies followed the sequence in reverse. The data was transmitted on AT&T's Dataphone high-speed telephone service. In 1963 the new system was accepted by many brokers, and was installed in hundreds of their offices.|$|R
5000|$|Every November, {{starting}} in 1993, WAAF has held its popular annual charity event [...] "Walk and Rock for Change". During this event, the DJs (Greg Hill 1993-2003, LB and Spaz 2004-present) {{from the station}} walk across Massachusetts, asking for change from the people as they stop in each town. The station will often air interviews with people as they come across interesting events.Starting in 2003, while this event is proceeding, the DJs at the station will play <b>requested</b> songs, <b>for</b> a <b>price.</b> While the station will play any song requested, obnoxious or unpopular songs, such as the SpongeBob SquarePants theme, will have a higher price than the station's standard fare.

30|$|The above {{experiment}} {{may involve}} {{a number of}} biases and limitations which we refer to here. The NYC yellow taxi data corresponded to year 2013 whereas our API <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> Uber X <b>prices</b> were made in September 2014. However, one should note that the <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> yellow taxis in the city had last changed in 2012 after 8 years [13]. <b>For</b> this reason, <b>prices</b> in 2013 are expected to offer a good approximation of today’s prices as, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, there has been no increase since 2012. Further, there was no control for time of the day/week for the API query, an additional dimension which should be incorporated when available. In particular, temporal information is expected to help predict variations of traffic, but also of offer and demand, and therefore of prices. Let us note, however, that surge pricing does not seem to be purely periodic, in terms of daily or weekly cycles, as we show in Section  5. As more and more data is acquired, this temporal information could be incorporated into the analysis. Preliminary analysis shows that repeating the same experiment at different time windows yields only minor changes in the numerical estimates presented above.|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} Javanese in Semarang traditional {{markets to}} see to what extent it is prevalently used as a lingua franca {{in the capital city}} of Central Java, especially the traditional markets where it is assumed that Javanese is still used in transactions. It also proposed a challenge to Sneddon’ study (2003 : 203) stating that in reality, speakers of many vernaculars in Indonesia are getting less and less as caused by lingua franca and language shift The data were obtained through a short and simple questionnaire to be administered to traditional vendors at three traditional markets. Field note-taking on overheard use of Javanese was undertaken to support the findings. Frequency counts (percentage) were used in the data analysis to investigate the prevalence of use of Javanese, especially during transaction, the results of which were tabulated for ease of interpretation. The current study revealed that, in traditional markets in Semarang, Javanese is still prevalently used in transaction with respect to language functions, such as offering, <b>requesting</b> <b>for</b> increased <b>prices,</b> final deals. However, code-switching was dominantly used during the process of transaction. Javanese significantly was also overheard for different functional purposes as recorded in the field note. Therefore the study concludes that Javanese is prevalently used in traditional markets in Semarang. The study therefore somehow supports Sneddon’s (2003 : 203) with respect to code-switching. Further studies are still encouraged especially the employment of ethnographic investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cloud Federation is {{a recent}} {{paradigm}} that helps Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers to overcome resource limitation during spikes in demand for Virtual Machines (VMs) by outsourcing requests to other federation members. IaaS providers also {{have the option of}} terminating spot VMs, i. e, cheaper VMs that can be canceled to free resources for more profitable VM requests. By both approaches, providers can expect to reject less profitable <b>requests.</b> <b>For</b> IaaS providers, <b>pricing</b> and profit are two important factors, in addition to maintaining a high Quality of Service (QoS) and utilization of their resources to remain in the business. For this, a clear understanding of the usage pattern, types of requests, and infrastructure costs are necessary while making decisions to terminate spot VMs, outsourcing or contributing to the federation. In this paper, we propose policies that help in the decision-making process to increase resources utilization and profit. Simulation results indicate that the proposed policies enhance the profit, utilization, and QoS (smaller number of rejected VM requests) in a Cloud federation environment. I...|$|R

40|$|Medicines {{have made}} an appreciable {{contribution}} to improving health. However, even high-income countries are struggling to fund new premium-priced medicines. This will grow necessitating {{the development of new}} models to optimize their use. The objective is to review case histories among health authorities to improve the utilization and expenditure on new medicines. Subsequently, use these to develop exemplar models and outline their implications. A number of issues and challenges were identified from the case histories. These included the low number of new medicines seen as innovative alongside increasing <b>requested</b> <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> their reimbursement, especially for oncology, orphan diseases, diabetes and HCV. Proposed models center on the three pillars of pre-, peri- and post-launch including critical drug evaluation, as well as multi-criteria models for valuing medicines for orphan diseases alongside potentially capping pharmaceutical expenditure. In conclusion, the proposed models involving all key stakeholder groups are critical for the sustainability of healthcare systems or enhancing universal access. The models should help stimulate debate as well as restore trust between key stakeholder groups...|$|R
