40|$|Recalcitrant wastes {{including}} dyes, pesticides, explosives, heavy metals, polyalcohols, furan derivatives and phenolic substances, are {{of special}} concern owing to their recalcitrance and persistence in the environment. Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) including microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), integrate three important wastewater treatment options, namely, biological treatment, electrolytic dissociation and electrochemical oxidation/reduction, and {{are regarded as}} a new sustainable and effective strategy for treatment of these wastes. The simultaneous and cooperative roles of these multiple units running in parallel in BESs contribute to the efficiency of recalcitrant waste treatment, while substrate metabolism {{is considered to be}} a key step triggering different unit operations. An up-to-date review is provided on recent research and development in BESs-based recalcitrant wastes treatment.

40|$|To reduce excess sludge, a Tubificidae reactor was {{combined}} with an integrated oxidation ditch with vertical circle (IODVC), and a new integrated system was developed for wastewater treatment. A pilot-scale of this integrated system was tested to investigate the sludge reduction with Tubificidae and the impact on effluent quality and sludge production. The dominant worm was Branchnria Sowerbyi in the Tubificidae reactor after inoculation of Branchnria Sowerbyi and Limnodrilns sp., and the maximal volume density of wet Tubificidae in vessels of the Tubificidae reactor was 17600 g/m(3). Two operational modes, treating the excess sludge (first mode) and the returned sludge (second mode) of IODVC by the Tubificidae reactor, were used in this experiment. The {{results showed that the}} excess sludge reduction rate was 46. 4 % in the first mode, and the average sludge yield of the integrated system was 6. 19 x 10 (- 5) kg SS/kg COD in the second mode. Though the sludge returned to IODVC via the Tubificidae reactor, it had little impact on the effluent quality and the sludge characteristics of the IODVC. No new type of <b>recalcitrant</b> <b>substance</b> in the supernatant was discharged into the environment when the sludge was treated by Tubificidae.

Process of degradation of daunomycin post-production wastes in soil was described. Experiments were conducted in model systems. Degradation process proceeded the most efficiently in soil samples inoculated with Bjerkandera adusta R 59 fungal strain, capable of decolorization of that cytostatic xenobiotic.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 100 - 114. 2, 4, 6 -Trinitrotoluene (TNT) {{has been}} used extensively for military purposes since its invention in the late 19 th century. TNT is a highly toxic and <b>recalcitrant</b> <b>substance</b> due to its multiple nitrated molecular configuration. TNT residues can enter biological systems and constitute a significant risk to human health. To this end, biological approaches promise great potential for removal of TNT in both aqueous and terrestrial environments by the usage of microorganisms. However, remediation capabilities of these organisms are limited due to their inadequate survival and degradation capacity in the environment. To address these issues, we investigated and demonstrated high degradation performance of novel bacterial strains isolated from TNT-contaminated sites, Citrobacter murliniae STE 10, Achromobacter spanius STE 11, Kluyvera cryocrescens STE 12, and Enterobacter amnigenus STE 13, for an enhanced remediation process. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, we developed a novel HPLC method on a Diol-functionalized chromatography column for accurate, rapid, economic, and environmentally friendly detection of nitroaromatic compounds. Data obtained from chromatography measurements clearly verified that the minimum limit of detection values for TNT and TNT metabolites (0. 78 - 1. 17 µg/L) were lower than the values obtained by previous reports and the widely used EPA method.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this contribution is to review and discuss two important classes of simultaneous electron acceptor (SEA) bioreactor configuration, the methanogenic-aereated systems (M-A) and methanogenic-denitrification (M-D) reactors, {{as well as their}} application to the removal of chlorinated organic and <b>recalcitrant</b> <b>substances</b> carried out by the Environmental Biotechnology R&D Group of CINVESTAV, Mexico. Biological treatment of waste in reactors possessing several electron acceptors in the same vessel, has attracted considerable attention in the last 12 years. The simultaneous electron acceptor approach in bioreactors may have several advantages: it provides an integrated treatment to the effluents and problematic substances, it might result in a more cost-effective treatment than several reactors in series and a more simple operation and control due to more simple hardware. In some cases, it may be the only treatment alternative for some chemical and petrochemical wastes which contain organic compounds which cannot be mineralized or are hardly mineralized completely under one sole electron acceptor condition and require the succession of steps operating under different electron acceptors.

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of plants and}} the soil microflora has to be regarded in both ways leading to a selective stimulation of the rhizosphere microflora {{on one hand and}} the root with a physiology under the influence of this microbial community on the other hand. Microbes, which manage to colonize the rhizoplane or even the endorhizosphere profit from the roots, because of the availability of nutrients and specific habitat conditions of the root environments. This stimulation of microbial activity enable the microbes to degrade otherwise <b>recalcitrant</b> <b>substances</b> in a cometabolic fashion. The root itself recognizes the soil environment through “microbial glasses”: nutrients are either transformed by the metabolic activities of the microbes excreting enzymes and/or substances mobilizing nutrients or xenobiotics. Through this activity, nutrient sources can be reached, which are otherwise very difficult to be exploited. Multiple organismic interactions occur frequently, which include fungi (e. g. ecto- or endomycorrhizae) and associated bacteria. The bacteria colonizing the mycorhizosphere definitely contribute to xenobiotic metabolism. Interestingly, not only surface-colonizing bacteria, but also bacteria inside fungal cells were discovered; their physiological contribution is not known until now...|$|R

The leachate is a effluent with a low degradability, composed by high organic matter concentrations, inorganic, <b>recalcitrant</b> <b>substances,</b> toxic metals and other products with high potential harmful. One of the emerging techniques of treatment is evaporation, which is the transformation of the leachate liquid fraction in gas and solid, whose operation is based, fundamentally, in the use of three climate parameters (wind, relative humidity and temperature). A pilot-field was build, composed by a number of tanks, sprinklers and a high evaporative specific area panel, where the leachate was sprayed. Have been identified possible emissions of volatile organic compounds from the leachate evaporation, and the microorganisms dispersal around the pilot. For the leachate treatment, the evaporator efficiency was evaluated in physical, chemical and biological terms. The probability of finding volatile organcic compound was higher in pilot field against the samples collected at 15 metres from the pilot.

Hence about 90 % of MSW is disposed in the open dumps and landfill unscientifically, creating problem to public health and the environment. The leachate generated from the municipal landfill contains organic and inorganic pollutants, which make it unsuitable for discharge in natural bodies without any prior treatment. Advanced oxidation process (AOPs) are promising methods to treat effectively the <b>recalcitrant</b> <b>substances</b> present in landfill leachate.

This compared favorably to batches containing only non-acclimated fungus or previously published removal rates with non-acclimated bacterial cultures.

Biodegradation is the ability of microorganisms to metabolize pollutants in soil, sediment and water environment. There is great awareness in the positive impact that microorganisms play in protecting environmental and human health. A large number of pre treatment systems are employed to remove these pollutants to prevent a host of problems that may arise in the biological process thereby reducing the efficiency of the treatment plant. Pharmaceutical effluent collected was characterized for their pollution characteristic and resultant analysis showed that the total suspended solid (TSS) and total dissolve solid (TDS) were 150. 4 and 120. 7 mg/l respectively while biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and Chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 1720 and 5680 mg/l respectively. These values are high when compared to World Health Organization maximum permissible limits (Chikogu et al., 2012). Initial treatment of this effluent with selected organisms yielded slight reduction in the solid concentration, BOD and COD, hence optimization of biodegradation of the selected organisms. Optimization of biodegradation with 2 % carbon source and nitrogen respectively showed IJSER improved biodegradation of pharmaceutical effluent with maltose showing 78. 5 % TDS reduction, cassava starch 95. 8 % BOD and 97 % COD reduction respectively in Saccharamyces cerevisea treated pharmaceutical effluent. Similarly yeast extract was best utilized by Saccharamyces cerevisea with 99 % BOD, 82 % TDS reduction and 90. 5 % growth in the treated effluent while it reduced COD to 98. 2 % in Pseudomonas aeruginosa treated pharmaceutical effluent.

40|$|Microbial biofilms in rivers {{contribute}} to the decomposition of the available organic matter which typically shows changes in composition and bioavailability due to their origin, seasonality, and watershed characteristics. In the context of global warming, enhanced biofilm organic matter decomposition would be expected but this effect could be specific when either a labile or a recalcitrant organic matter source would be available. A laboratory experiment was performed to mimic {{the effect of the}} predicted increase in river water temperature (+ 4 °C above an ambient temperature) on the microbial biofilm under differential organic matter sources. The biofilm microbial community responded to higher water temperature by increasing bacterial cell number, respiratory activity (electron transport system) and microbial extracellular enzymes (extracellular enzyme activity). At higher temperature, the phenol oxidase enzyme explained a large fraction of respiratory activity variation suggesting an enhanced microbial use of degradation products from humic substances. The decomposition of hemicellulose (β-xylosidase activity) seemed to be also favored by warmer conditions. However, at ambient temperature, the enzymes highly responsible for respiration activity variation were β-glucosidase and leu-aminopeptidase, suggesting an enhanced microbial use of polysaccharides and peptides degradation products. The addition of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC; dipeptide plus cellobiose) caused a further augmentation of heterotrophic biomass and respiratory activity. The changes in the fluorescence index and the ratio Abs 250 /total DOC indicated that higher temperature accelerated the rates of DOC degradation. The experiment showed that the more bioavailable organic matter was rapidly cycled irrespective of higher temperature while degradation of <b>recalcitrant</b> <b>substances</b> was enhanced by warming.

Removing contaminants from wastewater can be performed using physical and chemical methods for primary treatment while, secondary wastewater treatment is accomplished by biological activity, {{which is designed to}} remove the biodegradable portion of organic constituents. Removal of <b>recalcitrant</b> <b>substances</b> often needs advanced treatments, such as ultrafiltration, ion exchange, adsorption and reverse osmosis. In this work we reported how a filter based on a micelle-clay complex can be incorporated in a multi-stage procedure of wastewater cleaning to remove organic persistent pollutants. Al-Quds University plant for wastewater treatment includes biological decontamination, two ultra-filtration (UF) hollow fibre modules with cut-off of 100 and 20 kDa, respectively, an activated carbon filter, and finally a reverse osmosis membrane (RO) [1]. The treated water is suitable for non-restricted irrigation. In this paper we report a relatively novel method for the removal diclofenac potassium (2 -[(2, 6 -dichlorophenyl) amino]benzeneacetic acid) a polar acidic pharmaceuticals compound presents in river waters and wastewater plants, by using filters which include micelle-clay complexes. The micelle-clay composites, which we used, are positively charged, have large surface area and include large hydrophobic domains. It was shown by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and adsorption experiments that the characteristics of the micelle-clay complexes are different from those of organo-clay complexes, which are formed by adsorption of the same organic cation ODTMA (Octadecyl-trimethylammonium) as monomers [2]. The current study investigated the purification capability of two filters (20 x 5 cm) prepared mixing a clay-micelle complex (CMC) with different excess of quartz sand (1 : 100, or 1 : 50, w/w). The filtration capacity of 1 : 100 and 1 : 50 CMC-sand columns was tested using water passed through the first UF filter (cut-off 100 kDa) forgoing the 20 kDa membrane, the activated carbon filter, and the RO stage. The micelle-clay complex was prepared as suggested by Polubesova et al. (2005; 2006) using SWY- 2 Wyoming Na-montmorillonite and octadecyltrimetylammonium bromide (ODTMA). Diclofenac potassium was obtained as a gift from Beit Jalah Pharmaceutical Company (Palestine). The CMC-sand columns were saturated with the solution permeated from the UF filter and spiked with varying concentration of diclofenac. Fractions were collected for assay of diclofenac potassium content and analyzed by LC/MS. Analysis of the Langmuir isotherms revealed that GAC had a somewhat larger number of adsorption sites than the composite, but the latter had a significantly stronger binding affinity for diclofenac. Filtration experiments of a solution that included 300 ppm diclofenac demonstrated a very efficient removal by clay-micelle filters. Filtration of diclofenac solutions at concentrations of 8 or 80 ppb yielded almost complete removal at flow rates of 30 and 60 mL/min.

After saturation the columns were eluted with the same effluent (not containing the two chemicals). Total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) were determined before and after elution in each collected 100 ml fraction using APHA standard procedures (American Public Health Association, 2006). Pesticide residues were determined by LC/MS as Chiola et al. (2010). The values of COD and BOD were reduced by an order of magnitude and 5 -fold in 1 : 50 and 1 : 100 sand excess filters, respectively. In both cases, TSS and turbidity were completely removed and TDS was slightly detectable after filtration. Figure 1 shows the effect of filtration on the values of COD and BOD using the 1 : 50 CMC-sand filter. Tribenuron-methyl (Figure 2) was retained at 95 % of added amount on the 1 : 100 CMC-sand filter and totally retained on the 1 : 50 CMC-sand column. Due to its lower molecular weigh and higher charge availability for the adsorption process, the pesticide degradation product (Figure 2) was completely removed in both cases. Table 1 reports the amounts of TM and MMMT found during the filtration process in the 100 ml fractions collected using the 1 : 50 CMC-sand filter. In conclusion, results indicate that the introduction in the waste water treatment system of a filter filled with a mixture of a micelle-clay complex in a sequence of purification steps could be able to achieve a high quality water avoiding further treatment stages also in the presence of pesticide residues...|$|R
40|$|Palsa peats {{are unique}} {{northern}} ecosystems formed under an arctic climate and {{characterized by a}} high biodiversity and sensitive ecology. The stability of the palsas are seriously threatened by climate warming which will change the permafrost dynamic and induce a degradation of the mires. We used stable carbon isotope depth profiles in two palsa mires of Northern Sweden to track environmental change during {{the formation of the}} mires. Soils dominated by aerobic degradation can be expected to have a clear increase of carbon isotopes (&delta; 13 C) with depth, due to preferential release of 12 C during aerobic mineralization. In soils with suppressed degradation due to anoxic conditions, stable carbon isotope depth profiles are either more or less uniform indicating no or very low degradation or depth profiles turn to lighter values due to an enrichment of <b>recalcitrant</b> organic <b>substances</b> during anaerobic mineralisation which are depleted in 13 C. The isotope depth profile of the peat in the water saturated depressions (hollows) at the yet undisturbed mire Storflaket indicated very low to no degradation but increased rates of anaerobic degradation at the Stordalen site. The latter might be induced by degradation of the permafrost cores in the uplifted areas (hummocks) and subsequent breaking and submerging of the hummock peat into the hollows due to climate warming. Carbon isotope depth profiles of hummocks indicated a turn from aerobic mineralisation to anaerobic degradation at a peat depth between 4 and 25 cm. The age of these turning points was 14 C dated between 150 and 670 yr and could thus not be caused by anthropogenically induced climate change. We found the uplifting of the hummocks due to permafrost heave the most likely explanation for our findings. We thus concluded that differences in carbon isotope profiles of the hollows might point to the disturbance of the mires due to climate warming or due to differences in hydrology. The characteristic profiles of the hummocks are indicators for micro-geomorphic change during permafrost up heaving...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, the {{selective}} preservation of certain recalcitrant organic compounds {{and the formation}} of <b>recalcitrant</b> humic <b>substances</b> have been regarded as an important mechanism for soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization. Based on a critical overview of available methods and on results from a cooperative research program, this paper evaluates how relevant recalcitrance is for the long-term stabilization of SOM or its fractions. Methodologically, recalcitrance is difficult to assess, since the persistence of certain SOM fractions or specific compounds may also be caused by other stabilization mechanisms, such as physical protection or chemical interactions with mineral surfaces. If only free particulate SOM obtained from density fractionation is considered, it rarely reaches ages exceeding 50 y. Older light particles have often been identified as charred plant residues or as fossil C. The degradability of the readily bioavailable dissolved or water-extractable OM fraction is often negatively correlated with its content in aromatic compounds, which therefore has been associated with recalcitrance. But in subsoils, dissolved organic matter aromaticity and biodegradability both are very low, indicating that other factors or compounds limit its degradation. Among the investigated specific compounds, lignin, lipids, and their derivatives have mean turnover times faster or similar as that of bulk SOM. Only {{a small fraction of the}} lignin inputs seems to persist in soils and is mainly found in the fine textural size fraction (3 -C 4 crop changes revealed no compounds with mean residence times of > 40 - 50 y, unless fossil C was present in substantial amounts, as at a site exposed to lignite inputs in the past. Here, turnover of pyrolysis products seemed to be much longer, even for those attributed to carbohydrates or proteins. Apparently, fossil C from lignite coal is also utilized by soil organisms, which is further evidenced by low C- 14 concentrations in microbial phospholipid fatty acids from this site. Also, black C from charred plant materials was susceptible to microbial degradation in a short-term (60 d) and a long-term (2 y) incubation experiment. This degradation was enhanced, when glucose was supplied as an easily available microbial substrate. Similarly, SOM mineralization in many soils generally increased after addition of carbohydrates, amino acids, or simple organic acids, thus indicating that stability may also be caused by substrate limitations. It is concluded that the presented results do not provide much evidence that {{the selective}} preservation of recalcitrant primary biogenic compounds is a major SOM-stabilization mechanism. Old SOM fractions with slow turnover rates were generally only found in association with soil minerals. The only not mineral-associated SOM components that may be persistent in soils appear to be black and fossil C...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{classes and}} types of chemicals, which {{contaminate}} soil, complicate the removal of many toxic compounds from the environment. For example, many soils are contaminated {{with one or more}} metals, radioactive and inorganic compounds. Large areas are polluted with <b>recalcitrant</b> organic <b>substances</b> that pose environmental problems due to their toxicity and tendency to disperse through wind and water errosion. Polycyclic aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous pollutants found in soil at wood preservation plants and gasworks. PAHs are chemical compounds that persist in the environment and thus cause pollution worldwide. Their persistence in the environment is due to their low water solubility. The major source of PAHs is from the combustion of organic material such as coal, tar, wood and rubber. PAHs have been detected {{in a wide variety of}} environmental samples including air, soil, sediments, water, oils, tars and foodstuff. Most people are exposed to PAHs when they breathe smoke, autoemissions or industrial fumes. Because PAHs are toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic to humans and animals, their elimination from the environment is of paramount importance. The estimated costs for the clean up of PAHs contaminated sites with conventional techniques such as incineration and landfilling are enormous. The search for alternative methods to restore polluted sites in a less expensive, less labour intensive, safe and environmentally friendly way is required. Such an alternative method is rhizoremediation, which is defined as the use of plants in association with microorganisms to degrade environmental pollutants such as PAHs. Microbial communities exposed to hydrocarbons become adapted, exhibiting selective enrichment and genetic changes resulting in an increased proportion of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and bacteria plasmid encoding hydrocarbon catabolic genes. Adapted microbial communities have higher proportions of hydrocarbon degraders that can respond to the presence of hydrocarbon pollutants. The aim of this study was to identify bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of Elusine coracana, Biddens pilosa, Brantha serratia and Cyperus esculentus grown in polluted and unpolluted soil and to evaluate the potential of bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of these plants grown in polluted soil for their ability to bioremediate Polycyclic aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). Different concentrations (1 %, 3 % and 5 %) of naphthalene and acenaphthene (PAHs) were made and added to 500 ml Bacteriological agar. 1000 µl of bacterial suspensions were spread onto the surface of naphthalene and acenaphthene-based agar plates and incubated for 48 h at 37 OC. Results showed that Brevibacillus brevis, Brevindimonas versicularis, Vibrio vulnificus, Chryseo indologenes, Micrococcus spp, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas spinosa showed excellent growth in all concentrations in naphthalene based agar medium. However, Micrococcus spp and Pseudomonas spinosa showed limited growth in acenaphthene based agar medium. Amongst all these bacteria tested for their potential in utilizing PAHs, B. brevis, V. vulnificus, C. indologenes, B. stearothermophilus, and P. putida were the most promising for biodegradation of PAHs, since none of them were affected by any change in concentration either in naphthalene or acenaphthene.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, many {{research}} groups have focused {{their attention on}} the innovative chemical processes adopted {{for the treatment of}} water effluents polluted by <b>recalcitrant</b> organic <b>substances,</b> i. e., substances resistant to biological treatment. The electrochemical oxidation {{is one of the most}} studied technologies because it presents high versatility and low cost, it is realized under mild conditions of pressure and temperature and generally it does not involve the use of toxic substances [1]. In this work, the comparative performance of different electrochemical approaches such as direct oxidation processes, oxidation by means of electrogenerated chlorine and electro-Fenton was investigated. The influence of numerous parameters, such as the nature of the electrodic material and of the organic pollutant, the pH, the flow dynamic regime, the current density, the pollutant concentration and the temperature, on the electrochemical incineration of some carboxylic acids and aliphatic chlorides, chosen as model organic compounds, was studied in detail. Two very different anodes were used: Ti/IrO 2 -Ta 2 O 5, which presents a quite low oxygen overpotential, and boron-doped diamond (BDD), which certainly is one of the most promising materials for the electrochemical incineration [2, 3]. Incineration of carboxylic acids was favored by high flow rate and low current density, i. e., when the oxidation process was mainly under kinetic control. Moreover, the process resulted to be favored by high initial concentrations of the organic substrate and low pH but it did not depend, under the adopted operative conditions, on the nature of the supporting electrolyte. The effect of sodium chloride on the electrochemical oxidation of oxalic acid was observed to depend on the nature of the anode as well as on the pH. The best results were achieved by using IrO 2 -Ta 2 O 5 electrode, with addition of sodium chloride at acid pH. Furthermore, in the presence of high amounts of sodium chloride, a higher abatement of oxalic acid was obtained when high current densities and low flow rates were imposed. Comparing the performance of electro-Fenton process coupled with anodic oxidation at BDD anode and that of simple anodic oxidation, higher abatements of 1, 2 -dichloroethane and 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane were obtained in the first case thanks to the presence of Fe 2 + in the solution. Higher applied currents led to a faster electrogeneration of H 2 O 2 and regeneration of Fe 2 +, thus giving rise to a faster degradation of the starting compounds. The time course of the concentration of the main intermediates accumulated in the electrochemical cell during the treatments, particularly short-chain carboxylic acids and chlorinated ions, was also reported.

40|$|Chlorophenolic {{pollutants}} {{are considered}} as toxic and hazardous substances {{due to their}} chemical properties and widespread use. These pollutants and their derivatives are mutagenic, carcinogenic and immunogenic for humans and other organisms, indicating the necessity to degrade them before disposal. Advanced Oxidation Processes are considered an appropriate tool {{in the treatment of}} such pollutants. However, a complete mineralization is often not economically feasible. In this PhD research, the application of the combined chemical and biological degradation of chlorophenlic pollutants present in wastewater is investigated. The main objective is to study the ozone pre-treatment of chlorophenolic pollutants in order to enhance their potential for further biodegradation. The influence of some simple matrix components on the ozonation efficiency was investigated. Since the disappearance of the toxic pollutant alone is insufficient as an indicator of a successful treatment, also respirometric measurements were performed to observe biomass activity and toxic effects. The biocompatibility of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol was investigated by determining its inhibitory effect on biomass, i. e., toxicity, and its potential for biodegradation. A long lag phase, which significantly increased at higher concentrations, and a low maximum biomass activity were identified as major effects. The biodegradation of the pollutant was observed for a concentration as high as 100 mg/L. However, a long residence time was necessary. At 200 mg/L 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, the biomass was completely inhibited. Furthermore, the ozonation of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol in the presence of readily biodegradable organics indicated a preferred degradation of the pollutant prior to the other substances. Moreover, the complete dechlorination was considered as an important reaction step of the degradation of 2, 4 #dichlorophenol. Respirometric measurements showed a significantly reduced lag phase and an increased maximum biomass activity after pre-treatment with ozone. The biodegradable COD fraction increased, pointing out the enhancement of the biodegradability. Finally, two case studies were performed to verify the effectiveness of ozone-based processes for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants and the enhancement of the biodegradability of (industrial) wastewater.

40|$|In the 19 th and 20 th century, {{thousands}} of coal gasification plants were operating {{all over the}} world. Pipeline {{distribution of natural gas}} following World War II replaced manufactured gas as a major fuel; as a result manufactured gas production came to an end and determined widespread shutdown of gas plants. Soil and groundwater contamination by coal tars, very complex oganic mixtures resulted as a byproduct of the dry distillation of coal, potentially exists at all former gasworks sites because of prior process operations and residual management practices. This lasted now up to more than one century and the contaminant release persists as the sources are still present. The complexity of groundwater contamination at former gasworks arises from the complex original composition of tars, but also from the biotic transformations undergone by organic componds in the subsurface environment. This work focuses on 'Testfeld Süd', a former gas manufacturing plant located in the Neckar Valley in S-W Germany, which has been operating between 1870 and 1970. The main objective was the qualitative and quantitative assessment of groundwater contamination by site-specific organic chemicals. This included both investigations of the NAPL source(s) and of the plume(s) of dissolved contaminants. First the composition of coal tars from different locations in the field was determined. The three main compouns classes assessed were monocyclic aromatic hydocarbons (MAHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic compounds. Some of them are known to be of serious toxicologic concern, but for the majority, possible health effects have not yet been assessed. Two main types of NAPLs have been spilled in the subsurface at the site: coal tarsltar oils {{in the area of the}} former tar distilleries and ligther distillation fractions in the area of the former benzene distileries located further downstream. The initial composition of NAPLs was variable, but also contamination events occured over almost one century at different points in time. The composition of the sources has changed during decades, mainly due to faster release of easy soluble compounds into the groundwater and enrichment of the less soluble ones in the organic mixtures. Compounds recalcitrant to biodegradation, such as acenaphthene, which persist in high concentrations in the aqueous phase, were found to be also enriched in aged NAPLs, probably by partitioning from the groundwater into the leached organic phase. Dissolution out of residual NAPL phase and desorption out of contaminated aquifer material or low permeability zones were identified as the most important release mechanisms of coal tar constituents into the groundwater. The maximum concentrations for dissolution out of residual phase monitored in column experiments in the laboratory were equal to the saturation concentrations and depend on the composition of the mixture. In most cases, dissolution out of residual phase takes place only within a short domain relative to the entire volume containing residual NAPL, explaining the extremely long periods of time needed for complete dissolution. Mass transfer zones longer than the contaminated domain are more asvantageous for remediation purposes, as they allow higher mass fluxes for dissolution. Even if saturation is reached, measured concentrations depend on the observation scale. In small, homogeneous columns in the laboratory or locally in the field - e. g. individual sampling ports in multilevel wells - the measured concentration equals saturation. Average concentrations in multilevel wells were indeed in very good accordance with saturation concentrations for the organic mixture from the same location. In larger columns or in conventional, depth averaged groundwater samples, the observed concentration would be lower due to dillution effects, although saturation is locally attained. For desorption, the maximum concentrations in column experiments were much lower than for dissolution out of residual phase. For a given contaminated volume, diffusion limited desorption plays a secondary role, as long as residual NAPL is present. However, release rates measured in column experiments cannot be extrapolated to field conditions without knowledge of the contamination history and the exact volume and geometry of the source. Field investigations (concentrations in multilevel wells, pumping tests) showed that, at least close to the source area, there are several different plumes. Sharp vertical concentration profiles may attenuate with increasing distance from the source. A further objective of this work was to characterise the behaviour of the most relevant compound classes in the contaminant plume, with Special emphasis on <b>substances</b> <b>recalcitrant</b> to biodegradation. Over the entire distance assessed (ca 130 m from the source area), the plume is entirely anaerobic. Due to poor biodegradation, as the distance from the source area increases, there is as an enrichment of 0 - and N-heterocyclic compounds in the plume relative to usually assessed tar constituants (PAHs and MAHs). Most of the investigated compounds undergo a first order decay process (linear decrease of concentration with distance in a semi-logarithmic plot). The half-life distance varied between 30 m for benzene and up to 200 m for alkyl-naphthalenes. With an estimated decay rate of only 0. 1 % per day, dimethyl-benzofurans were the most recalcitrant of all compounds that could be identified with the available analytical method. Acenaphthene is degraded only within about 50 m downstream from the source area, then its concentration remains almost constant and very high (ca 180 µg/l) over a long distance. This behaviour of acenaphthene has been observed at numerous other former gasworks sites. 1 s supports earlier findings that the biodegradation of acenaphthene under anaerobic conditions takes place only by cometabolism, e. g. with naphtahlene, and Comes to a standstill if the concentration of the easily biodegradable naphthalene drops under a certain threshold. It is not known how far the plume extends downstream at 'Testfeld Süd'. Freisetzung und Verhalten spezifischer organischer Schadstoffe an einem ehemaligen Gaswerkstandort An ehemaligen Gaswerkstandorten entstand über Jahrzehnte eine massive Verunreinigung vor allem durch Teer und Teerdestillate, sehr komplexe organische Gemische, die bis heute noch in erheblichen Mengen in den Untergrund vorliegen. Die Komplexität der Grundwasserkontamination beruht sowohl auf die toxischen, zum Teil kanzerogenen und mutagenen ursprünglichen Teerbestandteilen, als auch auf die komplizierten Umwandlungen dieser Stoffe infolge biologischer Abbauprozessen im Grundwasser. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war die Identifizierung und Quantifizierung standortrelevanter organischer Schadstoffe im Grundwasser des 'Testfeld Süd', ein ehemaliger Gaswerkstandort im Neckartal. Im Schadensherd am 'Testfeld Süd' liegt eine in ihrer Zusammensetzung sehr komplexe, heterogen verteilte residuale Teerphase vor. Es handelt sich um Gemische organischer Stoffe, hauptsächlich monozyklische aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (MAK), polyzykilsche aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (PAK) und hetrozyklische aromatische Verbindungen. Viele dieser Verbindungen (vor allem die Heterozyklen) sind in Routineanalysen an ähnlichen Standorten noch nicht untersucht worden. Aufgrund ihrer hohen Konzentrationen und Toxizität, sowie ihrer oft geringen Bioabbaubarkeit, stellen sie ein erhebliches Gefährdungspotential für das Grundwasser im Abstrom dar. Im Gelände wurden Teerphasenkörper identifiziert, die unterschiedliche Alterungsgrade aufweisen. Dieses ist sowohl durch technologisch bedingte unterschiedliche Zusammensetzung, aber auch durch zeitlich versetze Versickerung, also unterschiedliche Verweilzeiten im Untergrund zurückzuführen. Nicht oder sehr schwer abbaubare Stoffe, wie zum Beispiel Acenaphthen, die im Grundwasser in konstant hohen Konzentrationen vorliegen, sind zum Teil auch in gealterten Teerphasen angereichert. Langzeit-Säulenversuche zur Bestimmung der lösungs- und desorptionsbedingten Emission aus kontaminiertem Aquifermaterial zeigten, daß die Lösung aus residualer Phase für die sich im Grundwasser einstellenden Konzentrationen maßgeblich ist. Die Desorption von Teerinhaltstoffen aus kontaminiertem Aquifermaterial bzw. der Eintrag aus Zonen geringer Durchlässigkeit werden von der Lösung aus residualer Teerphase vollständig überlagert. Die im Schadensherd im Multilevelmeßstellen ermittelten lokalen Konzentrationsmaxima stimmen mit den im Sduleneluat bei homogener Schadstoffverteilung bestimmten Sättigungskonzentrationen überein. Eine Übertragung der im Labor gemessenen Freisetzungsraten auf Feldmaßstab zur Grundwasser-Gefährdungsabschätzung ist nur möglich, wenn die Lage und Größe des kontaminierten Bereichs, die Kontaktoberfläche TeerIWasser und die Grundwassergeschwindigkeit bekannt sind. Felduntersuchungen (tiefenhorizontierte Konzentrationsprofile, Immissionspumpversuche) deuten darauf hin, daß nahe am Schadensherd mehrere Schadstoffahnen vorhanden sind. Im Abstrom vom Schadensherd wurde das Verhalten einzelner Schadstoffklassen in der 'Hauptfahne' untersucht. Die Schadstoffahne am 'Testfeld Süd' ist im gesamten untersuchten Bereich (ca 130 m vom Schadensherd in Grundwasserfließrichtung) anaerob. Es wurde eine Anreicherung von 0 - und N-Heterozyklen im Vergleich zu routinenmäßig quantifizierten Teerinhaltsstoffen (PAK und BTEX) festgestellt, was auf ihre geringe Bioabbaubarkeit zurückzuführen ist. Der Bioabbau der meisten Verbindungen in der Fahne verläuft als Reaktion erster Ordnung. Die Halbwärtsstrecke lag zwischen ca 30 m für Benzol und 200 m für Alkyl-Naphtaline. Die Konzentrationen der Alkyl-Benzofurane blieben praktisch unverändert mit zunehmender Entfernung vom Schadensherd. Die Acenaphthen-Konzentration nimmt nur innerhalb der ersten 50 m vom Schadensherd geringfügig ab und bleibt dann im Ubrigen, bisher erfassten Verlauf der Fahne, konstant hoch (ca 180 µg/l). Dadurch werden neueste Untersuchungen zum Bioabbau vom Acenaphthen aus Kreosot bestätigt die belegen, daß dieses nur durch Kometabolismus in Gegenwart von Naphthalin oder Phenanthren abgebaut werden kann; selbst dann sind die Abbauraten nur gering. Damit könnte die auch an anderen Gaswerkstandorten festgestellte Persistenz von Acenaphthen im Grundwasser erklärt werden. Weil Naphthalin von allen PAK aufgrund der hohen Wasserlöslichkeit sehr schnell im Teer abgereichert und biologisch abgebaut wird, kommt wahrscheinlich auch der Acenaphthenabbau rasch zum Erliegen. Die tatsächliche Länge der Schadstoffahne am 'Testfeld Süd' ist bisher noch nicht bekannt...|$|R
