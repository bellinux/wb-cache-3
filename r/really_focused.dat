500|$|The {{documentary}} crew put wireless microphones {{on several}} of the actors and crew and followed them through the conception, pre-production, filming, editing, screening and reception of [...] "Subway".

Fleder, who agreed to interviews for the documentary but refused to wear a microphone on the set, said of the crew, [...] "To pull off a show like this, a seven-day shoot with this much dialogue and this many shots per day, {{you have to be}} really, <b>really</b> <b>focused,</b> and for me the thing with the documentary crew kept pulling away from the focus." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{results of}} Gay's first 2004 US Olympic Trials {{confirmed}} {{his status as}} a rising contender in the 100m and 200m events. Although he did not reach the final of either event, he reached the semis of the highly competitive 100m and posted a 200m personal best of 20.07s in the qualifying stages. A hamstring injury due to dehydration prevented Gay from competing in the 200m final, but he did not see the trials as a missed opportunity, rather a springboard for future events: [...] "I was <b>really</b> <b>focused</b> upon the team, had a great shot, but it was a learning experience—how {{to take care of my}} body." [...] The end of year Track and Field News rankings for United States sprinters showed him to be the eighth fastest 100m runner and the fourth fastest sprinter over 200m that year—indicative of his potential, he was younger than all those ranked ahead of him.|$|E

50|$|I {{like the}} more character-driven stuff, and Paper Moon brought that {{home to me}} in a way that I had not seen in live action, <b>really</b> <b>focusing</b> on the whole story just about characters.

After I experienced my first heartbreak and I thought the world was going to end, the natural way to console my tattered heart was to write a song. Of course my parents, being the supportive and loving caretakers they are, showered me with much undeserved praise and encouraged me to keep writing. My sister and I heeded their advice and began writing and playing original songs together." [...] – Meg ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{was born}} (with his twin sister Cassandra) in San Diego, California, to 19-year-old Sandy Williams and her husband, 18-year-old Errick Williams. He was born inside of Jack Murphy Stadium, also {{referred}} to as [...] "the Murph" [...] by San Diegans. Growing up middle class, his parents divorced in 1983 and Williams, at the age of five, was taking care of his sisters by putting them to bed and even cooking for them. Perhaps due to his broken home and the fact that his father was gone at such an early age, Williams suffered from anger issues that eventually led his mother to send him to counseling. He also struggled academically, despite a test he took as a six-year-old which revealed that he had the intelligence of someone twice his age. Williams himself once said, [...] "I was always very bright, but not necessarily a hard worker. I think I was in eighth grade when I became <b>really</b> <b>focused</b> as a student and started getting good grades." [...] By high school Williams was an honor roll student and was named to the San Diego Union-Tribune All-Academic team.|$|E

It was {{sometimes}} hard for me to tell the difference as the editor, it was so close." [...] Lane further reiterated the point that prior to the Oscar ceremony, she gave an interview with Glamour for an article titled The Real Black Swan. After this interview, a Black Swan producer contacted her: [...] "He asked if I would please not do any more interviews until after the Oscars because it was bad for Natalie's image ... They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half." [...] Lane also emphasized that her criticism was not directed at Portman's acting: [...] "I think she is a really beautiful actress ... I loved working with her. And she was <b>really</b> <b>focused</b> on her character every day. I definitely think she deserves all the credit that she got with the Oscar." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{advantages}} of automatic image annotation versus content-based image retrieval (CBIR) are that queries {{can be more}} naturally specified by the user.

The traditional methods of image retrieval such as those used by libraries have relied on manually annotated images, which is expensive and time-consuming, especially given the large and constantly growing image databases in existence.|$|R
