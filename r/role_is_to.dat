5|$|Benzoquinone is {{actually}} not a necessary component for this reaction; its <b>role</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> regenerate palladium(II) from its reduced form palladium(0), {{so that a}} smaller amount of expensive palladium(II) acetate is required at the beginning. The reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by just using excess of palladium(II) acetate without benzoquinone, while {{at a much higher}} cost. Since the reaction typically employs near-stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too expensive for industrial usage, some {{progress has been made in}} the development of catalytic variants. Despite this shortcoming, the Saegusa oxidation has been used in a number of syntheses as a mild, late-stage method for introduction of functionality in complex molecules.|$|E
