5|$|GoldenEye was edited to be {{guaranteed}} a PG-13 <b>rating</b> <b>from</b> the MPAA and a 12 <b>rating</b> <b>from</b> the BBFC. The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head {{when he is}} shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her a rabbit punch in the car. In 2006, the film was re-mastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15.

5|$|Dayton's {{economy is}} {{relatively}} diversified and {{vital to the}} overall economy {{of the state of}} Ohio. In 2008 and 2009, Site Selection magazine ranked Dayton the #1 medium-sized metropolitan area in the U.S. for economic development.

40|$|This paper formulates {{and tests}} the {{hypothesis}} that the categories unemployed and out of the labor force are behaviorally distinct labor force states. Our empirical results indicate that they are. In the empirically relevant range the exit <b>rate</b> <b>from</b> unemployment to employment exceeds the exit <b>rate</b> <b>from</b> out of the labor force to employment. This evidence is shown to be consistent with a simple job search model of productive unemployment with log concave wage offer distributions. We prove that if unemployed workers receive job offers more frequently than workers out of the labor force, and if wage offer distributions are log concave, the exit <b>rate</b> <b>from</b> unemployment to employment exceeds the exit <b>rate</b> <b>from</b> out of the labor force to employment. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increases in deaths due to liver-related disease (LRD) among HIV-infected {{individuals}} {{have been reported}} although the influence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on LRD is controversial. AIMS: To determine changes over time in the death <b>rate</b> <b>from</b> LRD and if longer exposure to cART was {{associated with an increased}} death <b>rate</b> <b>from</b> LRD in 10 937 patients from EuroSIDA, an observational longitudinal cohort study. RESULTS: A total of 184 (1. 7 %) died from LRD during 52 236 person-years of follow-up (PYFU). The death <b>rate</b> <b>from</b> LRD declined from 6. 9 per 1000 PYFU before 1995 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 3. 9 - 9. 9] to 2. 6 at/after 2004 (95 % CI, 1. 6 - 4. 0). When the current CD 4 cell count and other factors were taken into account, there was a 13 % increase in the death <b>rate</b> <b>from</b> LRD per year (95 % CI, 5 - 20 %, P = 0. 0008). In patients who had started cART, there was a 12 % increase in the death <b>rate</b> <b>from</b> LRD per additional year exposure to cART (95 % CI, 4 - 20 %, P = 0. 022) after adjustment for current CD 4 cell count and other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Death <b>rates</b> <b>from</b> LRD appeared to decrease across Europe. However after adjustment for the current CD 4 cell count, and therefore increases in CD 4 cell counts in patients taking cART, there was a significant increase over time in death <b>rates</b> <b>from</b> LRD. In patients with similar CD 4 cell counts, longer exposure to cART was associated with an increased death <b>rate</b> <b>from</b> LRD. This may be due to direct liver toxicity of antiretrovirals, progression of liver disease due to hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus over time as patients survive longer, or some other facto...|$|R
