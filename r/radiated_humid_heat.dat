40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of dry and <b>humid</b> <b>heat</b> curing on the physical and drug release properties of polyvinyl acetate–polyvinyl pyrrolidone matrices. Both conditions resulted in increased tablet hardness; tablets stored under humid conditions showed high plasticity and deformed during hardness testing. Release from the matrices was dependent on the filler's type and level. Release profiles showed significant changes, {{as a result of}} exposure to thermal stress, none of the fillers used stabilized matrices against these changes. Density of neat polymeric compacts increased upon exposure to heat; the effect of <b>humid</b> <b>heat</b> was more evident than dry heat. Thermograms of samples cured under dry heat did not show changes, while those of samples stored under high humidity showed significant enlargement of the dehydration endotherm masking the glass transition of polyvinyl acetate. The change of the physical and release properties of matrices could be explained by the hygroscopic nature of polyvinyl pyrrolidone causing water uptake; absorbed water then acts as a plasticizer of polyvinyl acetate promoting plastic flow, deformation, and coalescence of particles, and altering the matrices internal structure. Results suggest that <b>humid</b> <b>heat</b> is more effective as a curing environment than dry heat for polyvinyl acetate–polyvinyl pyrrolidone matrices...|$|R
40|$|Older adults may be {{at greater}} risk for {{occupational}} injuries given their reduced capacity to dissipate heat, leading to greater thermal strain and potentially cognitive decrements. Purpose. To examine the effects of age and increased air velocity, during exercise in <b>humid</b> <b>heat,</b> on information processing and attention. Methods. Nine young (24 ± 1 years) and 9 older (59 ± 1 years) males cycled 4 × 15 [*]min (separated by 15 [*]min rest) at a fixed rate of heat production (400 [*]W) in <b>humid</b> <b>heat</b> (35 °C, 60 % relative humidity) under 0. 5 (low) and 3. 0 (high) m·s− 1 air velocity wearing coveralls. At rest, immediately following exercise (end exercise), and after the final recovery, participants performed an abbreviated paced auditory serial addition task (PASAT, 2 [*]sec pace). Results. PASAT numbers of correct responses at end exercise were similar for young (low = 49 ± 3; high = 51 ± 3) and older (low = 46 ± 5; high = 47 ± 4) males and across air velocity conditions, and when scored relative to age norms. Psychological sweating, or an increased sweat rate with the administration of the PASAT, was observed in both age groups in the high condition. Conclusion.

40|$|Older adults may be {{at greater}} risk for {{occupational}} injuries given their reduced evaporative heat loss when full sweat evaporation is permitted, leading to greater thermal strain and potentially cognitive decrements. However, age-related differences in heat loss capacity may not be as evident under conditions which restrict evaporative heat loss (i. e., humidity, clothing), subsequently increasing the risk in all workers. Although industries increase air circulation in attempts to reduce thermal strain, the effectiveness in reducing physiological strain and cognitive function impairments are unknown.
