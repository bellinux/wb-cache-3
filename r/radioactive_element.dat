The most stable known isotope, copernicium-285, has a half-life of approximately 29seconds. Copernicium was first created in 1996 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>element</b> to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the <b>radioactive</b> <b>element</b> was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E

The multitracer solution was intravenously injected into rats 14 days after intrahippocampal injection of C 6 glioma. Brain distribution and blood level of <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements</b> were determined 1 h after injection of the multitracer solution. Fifteen <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements</b> were detected in the brain and/or blood. 65 Zn, 83 Rb, and 54 Mn were preferentially taken up in the tumor, compared to other <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements.</b> The uptake rates of 65 Zn, 83 Rb, and 54 Mn in the tumor {{were significantly higher than}} in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, the rest of the brain and in the blood.

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, americium is located {{to the right}} of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide europium, with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly <b>radioactive</b> <b>element.</b> When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12g/cm3, americium is less dense than both curium (13.52g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8g/cm3); but has a higher density than europium (5.264g/cm3)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and europium (826°C), but lower than for curium (1340°C).|$|E
5|$|This {{proved that}} the unknown {{radioactive}} source originated from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements, proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in a paper entitled <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Element</b> 93 in the Physical Review on May 27, 1940. They did not propose {{a name for the}} element in the paper, but they soon decided on the name neptunium since Neptune is the next planet beyond Uranus in our solar system. McMillan and Abelson's success compared to Nishina and Kimura's near miss {{can be attributed to the}} favorable half-life of 239Np for radiochemical analysis and quick decay of 239U, in contrast to the slower decay of 237U and extremely long half-life of 237Np.|$|E
5|$|Actinium was {{discovered}} in 1899 by André-Louis Debierne, an assistant of Marie Curie, in the pitchblende waste left after removal of radium and polonium. He described the substance (in 1899) as similar to titanium and (in 1900) as similar to thorium. The discovery of actinium by Debierne was however questioned in 1971 and 2000, arguing that Debierne's publications in 1904 contradicted his earlier work of 1899–1900. This view instead credits the 1902 work of Friedrich Oskar Giesel, who discovered a <b>radioactive</b> <b>element</b> named emanium that behaved similarly to lanthanum. The name actinium comes from the Greek aktis, aktinos (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. This metal {{was discovered}} not by its own radiation but by the radiation of the daughter products. Owing to the close similarity of actinium and lanthanum and low abundance, pure actinium could only be produced in 1950. The term actinide was probably introduced by Victor Goldschmidt in 1937.|$|E

5|$|Livermorium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lv and atomic number 116. It {{is an extremely}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>element</b> that has only been created in the laboratory {{and has not been}} observed in nature. The element is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, which collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia to discover livermorium during experiments made between 2000 and 2006. The name of the laboratory refers to the city of Livermore, California where it is located, which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner Robert Livermore. The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012. Four isotopes of livermorium are known, with mass numbers between 290 and 293 inclusive; the longest-lived among them is livermorium-293 with a half-life of about 60milliseconds. A fifth isotope with mass number 294 has been reported but not yet confirmed.|$|E
5|$|A synthetic, <b>radioactive</b> <b>element,</b> curium is a hard, dense metal with a silvery-white {{appearance}} and {{physical and chemical}} properties resembling those of gadolinium. Its melting point of 1340°C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637°C), plutonium (639°C) and americium (1173°C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312°C. The boiling point of curium is 3110°C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm3, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm3), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters a = 365 pm and c = 1182 pm, and four formula units per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum. At pressures above 23 GPa, at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a face-centered cubic symmetry, space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 493 pm. Upon further compression to 43 GPa, curium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa. These three curium phases are also referred to as Cm I, II and III.|$|E

With this in mind, and also to improve his knowledge of English, he took up a post at University College London in 1904, working under Sir William Ramsay, known for having discovered the inert gases.

In early 1905, {{in the course of}} his work with salts of radium, Hahn discovered a new substance he called radiothorium (thorium-228), which at that time was believed to be a new <b>radioactive</b> <b>element.</b> (In fact, it was a still undiscovered isotope of the known element thorium.

25|$|Americium-241 is {{an alpha}} emitter with a {{half-life}} of 432.6 years. Alpha particle radiation, {{as opposed to}} beta (electron) and gamma (electromagnetic) radiation, is used for two additional reasons: alpha particles have high ionization, so sufficient air particles will be ionized for the current to exist, and they have low penetrative power, meaning they will be stopped, safely, by the plastic of the smoke detector or the air. About {{one percent of the}} emitted radioactive energy of 241Am is gamma radiation. The amount of elemental americium-241 is small enough to be exempt from the regulations applied to larger sources. It includes about 37kBq or 1µCi of <b>radioactive</b> <b>element</b> americium-241 (241Am), corresponding to about 0.3µg of the isotope. This provides sufficient ion current to detect smoke, while producing a very low level of radiation outside the device.|$|E
