40|$|All jurisdictions - whether common {{or civil}} law - punish repeat {{offenders}} more severely. In this sense, the Recidivist Sentencing Premium is as universal as {{the principle of}} proportionality. Retributive sentencing theorists fall into two camps: one group rejects the use <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> at sentencing while the second assigns a very limited role for criminal antecedents. This article explores the issue and proposes a culpability-based justification for considering <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> at sentencing. According to this proposal, <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> justify more severe treatment {{in the way that}} premeditation is used as an aggravating circumstance.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effect of birth cohort {{membership}} on the risk of criminal conviction. The data used are taken from the England andWales Offenders Index and include official conviction histories of six birth cohorts of offenders.

A Poisson log-linear model approach is taken. Including data on <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> can help explain heterogeneity. An interaction <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> with yearwas found to be important, indicating that additional <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> have a greater effect on the conviction rate for more recent years.

40|$|WHILST studies {{investigating}} {{the problem of}} recidivism among offenders have adequately demonstrated the predictive power of criminological variables, such as the number <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> (Shapland, 1969; Payne, McCabe and Walker, 1974), the equivalent ability of psychological variables is much more open to question. For example, evidence relating {{to the relationship between}} personality variables and reconviction is on the whole negative. In the case of extraversion, Eysenck and Eysenck (1974) reported a positive relationship with recidivism, but Blum and Chagon (1967) and Francis (1970) were unable to find a similar relationship between these variables...|$|R

40|$|Personality characteristics, {{particularly}} impulsive tendencies, {{have long}} been conceived as the primary culprit in delinquent behavior. One crucial question to emerge from {{this line of work}} is whether impulsivity has a biological basis. To test this possibility, 44 male offenders and 46 nonoffenders completed the Eysenck Impulsivity Questionnaire, and had their 2 D: 4 D ratio measured. Offenders exhibited smaller right hand digit ratio measurements compared to non-offenders, but higher impulsivity scores. Both impulsivity and 2 D: 4 D ratio measurements significantly predicted criminality (offenders vs. nonoffenders). Controlling for education level, the 2 D: 4 D ratio measurements had remained a significant predictor of criminality, while impulsivity scores no longer predicted criminality significantly. Our data, thus, indicates that impulsivity but not 2 D: 4 D ratio measurements relate to educational attainment. As offenders varied in their number <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> and the nature of their individual crimes, we also tested for differences in 2 D: 4 D ratio and impulsivity among offenders. Number <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> did not correlate significantly with the 2 D: 4 D ratio measurements or impulsivity scores. Our study established a link between a biological marker and impulsivity among offenders (and lack thereof among non-offenders), which emphasise the importance of studying the relationship between biological markers, impulsivity and criminal behavior.

40|$|Background: The {{argument}} for financing therapeutic community-based drug rehabilitation programs for inmates is compelling. Numerous studies have established {{the positive effect of}} such treatment on reducing recidivism, especially treatment {{based on the}} therapeutic community model. Methods: This quasiexperimental retrospective cohort study examined the impact of therapeutic community-based drug rehabilitation programs on recidivism amongst drug inmates released from the national prison of Malta between 2005 and 2008 (i. e. âthe reference periodâ). An experimental group consisting in all drug inmates who participated in at least one program during the time spent in prison for a conviction that ended during the reference period was compared to two comparison groups of inmates who did not attend such a program or who had attended in the past. Chi-square tests and ANOVA were employed in the analysis. Results: There was no statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the three groups with regard to sex, age on admission and occupation but there was a highly significant difference with regard to the number <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>convictions,</b> prison-basedopioid substitution treatment (given to all inmatesconvicted for heroin-related offences) and prison-based psychiatric treatment. On fitting a generalized linear model with a logit link function to control for opioid substitution treatment and the number <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> it emerged that the difference between groups was not significant and thus the null hypothesis was not rejected. Conclusion: Participation of inmates in therapeutic community-based drug rehabilitation programs did not in itself emerge as a significant predictor of recidivism. In this regard, possible limitations that {{may have contributed to the}} lack of significant results were discussed. Inmates who were not administered any opioid substitution treatment (i. e. corresponding to all those who were incarcerated for drug offences other than heroin) were 74...|$|R
