The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Prevention and Control were among top active institutions/organizations.

Top cited articles focused on three poverty-related health issues, mainly, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and child development/psychology.

We divided the <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> into two different periods (1982 – 1996 and 1997 – 2012) in order to allow for comparative analysis.

40|$|We {{present a}} study on {{applying}} text analytics methods to historical text and data to uncover aspects of event structure. First, we associate primary historical resources, newspaper articles, to a secondary resource, a database of labor conflicts in the Netherlands, detecting newspaper stories denoting labor conflicts. For the task of <b>retrieving</b> newspaper <b>articles</b> based on database record information, we construct a query model exploiting the database record fields. We consider labor conflicts as historical events referred to in sequences of newspaper article narratives, of which the climax, i. e., the strike, {{may or may not}} have occured. We analyse documents preceding a strike by considering them as a sub-narrative class of “strike threat ” articles, and we then attempt to <b>retrieve</b> <b>articles</b> referring to conflicts which were about to burst into strike, but for some reason never did: strikes that never happened...|$|R

30|$|The {{fourth step}} in the {{methodology}} {{of this study was}} to limit retrieved data to articles under subject area “Medicine”. Scopus classifies <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> into different subject areas, one of which is “Medicine”. For the purpose of this study, only articles categorized under subject area ‘Medicine” were analyzed. Therefore, articles under “Medicine” subject area in which poverty was the main theme were retrieved and analyzed.|$|E
30|$|Titles and abstracts of all <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> were {{independently}} {{analyzed by}} two reviewers who excluded any obviously irrelevant studies.

Studies were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) they were RCTs, (2) they involved patients with MI, and (3) they involved CsA treatment.|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} and exhibit the {{transformation}} of China's hospitality research published from 1978 to 2012. Drawing on a systematic review of 80 related <b>articles</b> <b>retrieved</b> from three leading English language hospitality journals, a dramatic growth of China's hospitality research in the recent five years(2008 - 2012) was found. The growing diversifications of research foci, affiliated sectors, research approaches, data collection methods, and regional contribution are evident, whilst an increasing rigor of China's hospitality research is concluded. While regional contribution is mainly made by countries in the Asia Pacific region, more research collaborations across continents are suggested. Further work may <b>retrieve</b> <b>articles</b> from {{a wider range of}} journals, perform cross tabulation analyses, and incorporate additional analysis criteria. A more holistic overview of hospitality studies on China can then be drawn. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R
