The aim {{of this study is to}} determine if short-term CR alters bone mass and metabolism in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) <b>rats,</b> an animal model of type 2 diabetes. MethodsFour groups (n= 5) were created: OLETF <b>rats</b> with food ad libitum (AL), OLETF <b>rats</b> with CR, Long-Evans Tokusima Otsuka (LETO) <b>rats</b> with food AL, and LETO <b>rats</b> with CR. The CR condition was imposed on 24 -week-old male <b>rats</b> using a 40 % calorie reduction for 4 weeks. The effect of CR on femoral bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Serum markers were measured by immunoassay. ResultsAfter 4 weeks of CR, body weight decreased in both strains. The BMD decreased in LETO <b>rats</b> and was maintained in OLETF <b>rats.</b> After adjustment for body weight, BMD remained lower in LETO <b>rats</b> (P= 0. 017) but not OLETF <b>rats</b> (P= 0. 410). Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels decreased in LETO <b>rats</b> (P= 0. 025) but not in OLEFT <b>rats</b> (P= 0. 347). Serum leptin levels were reduced after CR in both strains, but hyperleptinemia remained in OLETF <b>rats</b> (P= 0. 009). CR increased 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels in OLETF <b>rats</b> (P= 0. 009) but not in LETO <b>rats</b> (P= 0. 117). Additionally, interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-α levels decreased only in OLETF <b>rats</b> (P= 0. 009).
