5|$|Chartjackers {{garnered}} a viewing figures peak {{of almost}} half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers. Some commentators felt that the programme's concept was <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> doomed from the start, others felt that the series showed a contempt for music and the general public, and other critics questioned whether {{the point of the}} project was to raise money for charity or for the four bloggers to promote themselves. The show was nominated for a 2010 Broadcast Digital Award in the Best Multi-Platform Project category, but lost out to The Operation...Surgery Live.|$|E
25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the northern areas was a marked programme for modernization. In Finnmark, modern houses were built, and the Norwegian way of life was promoted as the way towards progress and modernity. Sami culture was seen as old, <b>ridiculous,</b> <b>and</b> best left behind.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century {{started with}} yet {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} Norwegian side of the border. In the name of progress, Norwegian language and culture was promoted, and Sami language and culture were dismissed as backward, uncultured, downright <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> even {{the product of an}} inferior race. Land that previously belonged to no one, and was used according to age-old principles, was considered state property. Settlers had to prove they could speak Norwegian well before they could claim new land for agriculture.|$|E

25|$|Deslys {{had many}} admirers among royalty, most notably King Manuel II of Portugal, and her origins became {{the subject of}} dispute. A private detective claimed her true name was Hadiwga Nawrati, or Hedvika Navrátilová, and that she was a Czech peasant girl, born in the village of Horní Moštěnice, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The {{investigator}} reported that Deslys had denied her alleged mother's claim to kinship when he brought her to see the dancer, paying her a large amount of money to leave. Deslys replied the story was <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> that she was French, not Czech.|$|E
25|$|The Biography of Early Australia dismisses Macarthur's {{complaints}} as <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> quotes Evatt {{as saying}} that legally Macarthur was guilty of two out of the three charges brought against him including sedition. Both consider that Bligh was wholly justified in his actions {{because he was the}} legitimate authority. However, imprisoning people and threatening to do the same to the court when they failed to yield to the will of said authority would seem to be legally problematic. Duffy states that had Johnston arrived when summoned on 25 January the Rum Rebellion probably would never have happened.|$|E
25|$|The {{followers}} of the confession of the “Dashi” (the Arabs) have a means to denote the degrees of family relations, but it is degenerated and they don’t bother about it. They don’t eat the meat of pigs, dogs, donkeys and horses, they don’t respect neither {{the king of the}} country, neither their parents, they don’t believe in supernatural powers, they perform sacrifice to heaven and to no one else. According their customs every seventh day is a holiday, on which no trade and no cash transactions are done, whereas when they drink alcohol, they are behaving in a <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> undisciplined way during the whole day.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bounderby, {{under the}} {{influence}} of this difficult adjuration, backed up by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> manner, <b>and</b> afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning.|$|R

25|$|With {{his wife}} {{he had three}} sons and a {{daughter}} whose filial piety made her devote her entire life to serving her genius father. Though he lived happily, one event embittered Lesage for years. His eldest son had been educated for the bar, but insisted going on stage. Lesage, who had often painted {{the life of the}} actor in the most <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> hateful aspect, was pained by his son's career choice, especially when his son joined the Théâtre Français, against which Lesage had long waged a satirical war. Probably out of deference to his father, the son took the name Montménil, and by the merit of his talents and private character, soon entered the upper society of Paris. Lesage was reconciled with his son many years later and became so devoted to Montménil that he could barely leave his side.|$|E
25|$|Schofield's {{advance guard}} arrived in Franklin at about 4:30a.m. on November 30. Jacob Cox, a {{division}} commander temporarily commanding the XXIII Corps, immediately began preparing strong defensive positions around the deteriorated entrenchments originally constructed for a previous engagement in 1863. Schofield decided to defend at Franklin {{with his back}} to the river because he had no pontoon bridges available that would enable his men to cross the river. Schofield needed time to repair the permanent bridges spanning the river, but by mid-afternoon, nearly all the supply wagons were across the Harpeth and on the road to Nashville. By noon the Union works formed an approximate semicircle around the town. A gap in the line occurred where the Columbia Pike entered the outskirts of the town, left open to allow passage of the wagons. Just behind the center of the formidable line stood the Carter House, appropriated as Cox's headquarters. Two Union brigades from Wagner's division were positioned about a half mile forward of the main line. Wagner, perhaps misunderstanding his orders, ordered his three brigades to stop halfway to the Union line and dig in as best they could on the flat ground. Col. Emerson Opdycke considered Wagner's order to be <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> refused to obey it; he marched his brigade through the Union line and into a reserve position behind the gap through which the Columbia Pike passed, leaving the brigades of Cols. John Q. Lane, and Joseph Conrad in front.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Patrick Melady {{recommended}} that the United States reduce its presence in Uganda. Melady described Amin's regime as [...] "racist, erratic and unpredictable, brutal, inept, bellicose, irrational, <b>ridiculous,</b> <b>and</b> militaristic". Accordingly, the United States closed its embassy in Kampala.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{the usual}} bikini-clad cast, random singing, silly plot line, musical guests, <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> chases <b>and</b> fight scenes, the {{continuity}} linking {{this to the}} other beach films is the Rat Pack motorcycle gang led by Eric Von Zipper (Harvey Lembeck), {{as well as the}} appearance of previous beach party alumni Tommy Kirk, Deborah Walley, Bobbi Shaw, Jesse White, Aron Kincaid, Quinn O'Hara and Boris Karloff.|$|R

500|$|Later {{that month}} {{he was ordered}} to the North African theater, where he served as {{chief of staff of the}} Mediterranean Air Command. Under Carl Andrew Spaatz, Saville argued against the plans for Operation Tidal Wave in August, the air attack on oil {{refineries}} in Ploieşti. After the operation resulted in heavy American casualties with little effect on oil production, Saville described it as a [...] "goddamned thing... <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> suicidal." ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Rimmer, senior {{lecturer}} at Australian National University, commented upon {{the legality of}} the innovative ways Internet users like Marcotte chose to publicize the secret HD DVD code: [...] "I don't think it's necessarily designed to stay within the bounds of the law. It's just a fun way to comment on what's happened. I think that it's designed to show that the law is absurd or <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> should be abolished." ...|$|E

5000|$|During Foggy's first stint Compo {{frequently}} {{argued with}} him in a similar manner. This was largely due to Foggy's military background and like the previous third man, Foggy often made insults of disgust over Compo's attire and frequently referred to him as [...] "that man". As a part of his schemes Foggy also made Compo volunteer for often dangerous <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> situations <b>and</b> as a result he was regularly harmed (though rarely injured) or humiliated.|$|R
500|$|Wilde managed both {{to engage}} with and to mock the genre, while {{providing}} social commentary and offering reform. The men follow traditional matrimonial rites, whereby suitors admit their weaknesses to their prospective brides, but the foibles they excuse are <b>ridiculous,</b> <b>and</b> the farce is built on an absurd confusion of a book and a baby. When Jack apologises to Gwendolen during his marriage proposal it is for not being wicked: ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Matt Mitovich of TV Guide wrote, [...] "I must be honest... This A-story was <b>ridiculous,</b> <b>and</b> {{not in the}} hysterical way. When I {{first read}} the logline about Drew 'getting by on his good looks,' I thought we'd witness the {{occasional}} favoritism. But horrid doctor skills and flailing at the very public sport of tennis, and his obliviousness to it all? Hamm got a turkey of an exit story, sorry." ...|$|E
500|$|Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry {{speculated that}} after several episodes of a [...] "semi-normal" [...] Michael, the writers [...] "were aching {{to bring back}} cringe worthy Michael." [...] She criticized the decision, calling his {{behavior}} [...] "borderline <b>ridiculous</b> (<b>and</b> not in a good way). It just seems implausible that someone could be so very clueless that they would act like that in public." [...] Skerry however did find high points, such as the opening sequence and any scene with Dwight and Angela. Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A".|$|E
60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} the object of this {{singular}} and characteristic procession. The tenants of the Lagunes, with the fickleness with which extreme ignorance acts on human passions, had suddenly experienced a violent revolution in their feelings towards their ancient comrade. He who, an hour before, had been derided as a vain <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> pretender, <b>and</b> on whose head bitter imprecations had been so lavishly poured, was now lauded with cries of triumph.|$|R

500|$|As {{a result}} of his unique style, Scott and ESPN {{received}} a lot of hate mail from people who resented his color, his hip-hop style, or his generation. In a 2003 USA Today survey, Scott finished first in the question of which anchor should be voted off SportsCenter, but he also was second to Dan Patrick in the 'definitely keep him' voting. Jason Whitlock criticized Scott's use of Jay-Z's alternate nickname, [...] "Jigga", at halftime of Monday Night Football as <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> offensive. Scott never changed his style and ESPN stuck with him.|$|E
500|$|Josh Ralske from AllMovie {{gave the}} film 1½ out of 5 stars, {{saying it was}} [...] "a flawed docudrama" [...] though due to Eberhardt being such a {{fascinating}} character the film was still interesting. He concluded [...] "unfortunately, the film is not quite good enough to recommend to those who aren't familiar with Isabelle Eberhardt's life and work, {{and those who are}} familiar with her are likely to be disappointed." [...] Fabienne Pascaud from Télérama gave a scathing review, advising fans of Eberhardt to avoid the film, saying it was flat and silly and filled with <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> unbelievable scenes.|$|E
500|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy complimented the video, commenting that it managed [...] "to be both <b>ridiculous</b> <b>and</b> {{a little}} bit moving - quite an achievement." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Michael Slezak {{described}} Carey's boots as [...] "hot", and considered the cinematography of the music video [...] "gorgeous". He also complimented several aspects of the video, saying, [...] "Mariah’s bod looks totally smokin’, even if her entire wardrobe should be donated to a charity benefiting teenage strumpets and/or truck-stop hookers. Also: That Wentworth Miller 2.0 ain’t hard on the eyes, either (in reference {{to the man who}} played her love interest in [...] "We Belong Together").|$|E
5000|$|Bennett was {{initially}} inspired {{to write the}} book by a chance encounter in a Parisian restaurant. In the introduction to the book, he says ...an old woman came into the restaurant to dine. She was fat, shapeless, ugly, and grotesque.
