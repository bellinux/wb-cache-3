5000|$|Bond {{insurance}} {{of residential}} mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) commenced in the 1980s but expanded at an accelerated pace in the 2000s, {{leading up to}} the 2008 financial crisis. As the housing bubble grew in the mid-2000s, bond insurers generally increased the collateral protection required for RMBS. However, both the bond insurers and the rating agencies that evaluated their credit did not anticipate the collapse of the real estate market that precipitated the financial crisis and the magnitude of the disruption to the residential mortgage market that accompanied the financial crisis. In addition, following the crisis, the bond insurers became aware that many RMBS they had insured included large percentages of loans that were ineligible for securitization and were subject to repurchase by, or [...] "putback" [...] obligations of, the RMBS sponsors, in originating the securitizations due to a breach of applicable <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranties</b> ("R&W") regarding the securitized mortgage loans.|$|E

In the course of so doing D negligently misrepresented that there was a special one off expense of GBP 120,000 in accounts produced, and that those accounts spread the bi-annual expense of producing pattern books over two years instead of immediately writing it off. The sale contract included a provision stating that P acknowledged it had not been induced to enter into the agreement by any <b>representation</b> or <b>warranty,</b> <b>and</b> a contractual limitation clause that D was not liable for a breach of the agreement unless written notice was given by January 1, 1992.

5000|$|Unlike {{mortgage}} insurance, {{bond insurance}} generally provides for unconditional payment of claims, although the insurer reserves {{the right to}} pursue contractual or other available remedies. As a result, the bond insurers were faced with {{billions of dollars of}} claims to insured security holders associated with their exposure to RMBS following the financial crisis, with uncertain prospects for recoveries from the sponsors of the securitizations giving rise to those claims. One indication of the extent of loan quality misrepresentation was the settlement in 2011 between Assured Guaranty and Bank of America, which had purchased mortgage originator Countrywide. Under the terms of the settlement, Bank of America made a $1.1 billion payment to Assured Guaranty and agreed to cover 80% of up to $6.6 billion of Assured Guaranty’s future paid losses from breaches of <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranties</b> on 21 insured RMBS transactions. [...] Subsequently, in 2013, in the first R&W trial to reach a judgment, Flagstar Bank was required to compensate Assured Guaranty in full for past and future claims. The amounts that Assured Guaranty caused R&W providers to pay or commit to pay through putbacks and settlements plus the amount of future projected losses that Assured Guaranty avoided through negotiated terminations totaled approximately $4.2 billion as of March 31, 2015. While the widespread misrepresentations caused bond insurers to experience considerable losses on insured securities backed by residential mortgage loans (including first lien loans, second lien loans, and home equity lines of credit), the most severe losses were experienced by those monolines that insured CDOs backed by mezzanine RMBS. Although the bond insurers generally insured such CDOs at very high attachment points or collateral levels (with underlying ratings of triple-A), those bond insurers and the rating agencies failed to anticipate the correlation of performance of the underlying securities. Specifically, these bond insurers and rating agencies relied upon historical data that did not prove predictive of residential mortgage loan performance following the 2008 crisis, which witnessed the first-ever nationwide decline in housing prices. Notably, AGM and AGC did not insure such CDOs, which has allowed Assured Guaranty to continue writing business throughout the financial crisis and ensuing recession and recovery.|$|E

40|$|A typical {{sale and}} {{purchase}} agreement in an M&A transaction {{will include a}} variety of <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranties</b> that the seller, {{and to some extent}} the buyer, will make as a result of extensive negotiations between the parties. The purpose of seller's <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranties</b> when they are combined with indemnification provisions is to provide the buyer additional information about the target of the transaction and a mechanism whereby the buyer can be compensated for damages that are suffered as a result of untrue or inaccurate seller's <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranties,</b> i. e. {{in the event of a}} breach. Representation and warranty insurance ("R&W Insurance") is a relatively new product in a sense that its use has increased more significantly only in recent years. There are a number of other risk management and allocation tools that parties frequently use, either in lieu of or in connection with the use of R&W Insurance. These other tools include, without limitation, 1) providing security to buyer's ability to recover losses from the seller due to breach of (<b>representations</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranties</b> or) contract by withholding some of the seller's proceeds e. g. via an escrow or other holdback mechanism, 2) providing other security for compensation of buyer's losses with the use of guarantees or sureties, e. g. provided by a third party or a parent company, and 3) providing an incentive for the seller to ensure that certain post-closing actions occur and/or potential post-closing risks do not realize by delaying the payment of a portion of the seller's proceeds with purchase price adjustment, earn-out and/or contingency payment mechanisms. This thesis evaluates some of the alternative risk management and allocation tools, including their relative strengths and weaknesses as compared to R&W Insurance, and identifies the circumstances wherein R&W Insurance may potentially address the parties' needs better or more appropriately. The two different types of R&W Insurance policies, i. e. buy-side and sell-side policies, are also evaluated with respect to the coverage and benefits that they provide in order to determine whether it is advantageous for the parties' to choose one type of policy over another type. With respect to the use of R&W Insurance, this thesis evaluates the ways in which a decision to use R&W Insurance can alter or change the parties' behavior or other aspects of the M&A transaction thereby increasing risk and/or undesirable effects. For example, does the use of a buy-side R&W Insurance policy cause the seller to engage, or provide an opportunity to engage, in riskier behavior since R&W Insurance transfers seller's liability for breach of seller's <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranties</b> to a third-party insurer, thereby potentially causing the seller to become less engaged or more dishonest in the negotiation phase with respect to the content of the <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranties</b> given by the seller? If yes, what are the potential strategies the buyer can use to deter undesirable behavior by the seller? This thesis also looks at certain qualifiers that parties often use, or at least discuss using during contract negotiations, such as knowledge. Since R&W Insurance is intended to cover unknown risks, parties' knowledge precludes coverage under R&W Insurance policy. In this regard, among other questions, the discussion in this thesis evaluates what the knowledge exclusion means, whether it impacts the buyer' behavior by potentially discouraging continued due diligence efforts by the buyer after signing and before closing, and how concepts such as sandbagging fit into a transaction wherein parties are contemplating the use of R&W Insurance...|$|E
40|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranties</b> (contractual statements enforceable through legal action) may have given investors false assurance that mortgage loans were being properly underwritten. This assurance in turn may have contributed to overinvestment in mortgage-backed securities in two ways. First, the assumption that legally enforceable penalties associated with reps and warranties would deter lax underwriting may have led to less monitoring of these contracts than would otherwise have occurred. In turn, the lack of monitoring of actual underwriting practices enabled the spread of lax lending practices. The existence of these reps and warranties and the potential penalties associated with them did not deter lax underwriting. Paradoxically, after the fact, the reps and warranties were enforced and this enforcement contributed to a tightening of credit beyond historic norms. Post-crisis, lenders’ fears over put-back exposure caused them to scale back, particularly on government lending to creditworthy borrowers. The reps and warranties as used in mortgage lending in {{the run-up to}} the crisis were part of the procyclicality of lending, both in the easing and tightening phases of the lending cycle. We suggest reforms to add to the deterrent value of reps and warranties. Particularly we suggest a shift to the countercyclical techniques including dynamic provisioning to increase the in terrorem effect of <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranties.</b> Nonetheless such changes would be useless unless they were adopted throughout the lending industry, otherwise, just those entities with risky practices would increase their market share. And next time such entities are more likely to be thinly capitalized, as the lesson of capital exposure to legal risk has been learned, thus further reducing the deterrence effect of reps and warranties, going forward...|$|E

Because a seller generally {{will not be}} able to transfer statutory responsibility for environmental problems, it is advisable for the seller to investigate and remedy environmental problems prior to transferring the property.

Information gained from environmental investigations can be useful during negotiations for sale and for contractual allocation of environmental responsibility. Where a site cleanup is required, information gained from an environmental investigation can serve as the basis for a remediation plan. As a result of an environmental investigation and site remediation, the seller will be in a stronger position to negotiate limitations on indemnity provisions requested by the buyer.
