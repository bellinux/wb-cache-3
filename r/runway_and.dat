5|$|Airport runways {{are also}} de-iced by {{sprayers}} fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are {{wide enough to}} cross the entire <b>runway,</b> <b>and</b> allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1996, a NATO E-3A, LX-N90457, overran the <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> {{dipped into}} the sea on takeoff from Preveza AB, Preveza, Greece. The {{fuselage}} broke into two, destroying the aircraft, {{but there were no}} casualties among the 16 crew members on board. It allegedly suffered a birdstrike during take off, but no evidence of a birdstrike was found.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 2003, a Cessna {{aircraft}} overshot the <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> {{landed in}} the sea after an emergency landing caused by loss of power immediately after take-off. Two {{of the people on}} board were uninjured and the third injured only slightly.|$|E
50|$|The airport has two {{parallel}} <b>runways</b> <b>and</b> one concrete helipad. The two concrete <b>runways</b> (08R/26L <b>and</b> 26R/08L) are each 4000 m long and 60 m wide.|$|R

5|$|In April 2007, {{acting on}} a {{recommendation}} made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) during its investigation of Comair 5191, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off <b>runway,</b> <b>and</b> again when initiating takeoff. And in May, {{acting on a}}nother NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take-off at night.|$|E
5|$|London Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, is {{the busiest}} {{airport in the}} world for {{international}} traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways. In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened. There were plans for a third <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> a sixth terminal; however, these were cancelled by the Coalition Government on 12 May 2010.|$|E
5000|$|After the Navy {{declared}} the airfield excess property, the <b>runways</b> <b>and</b> taxiways {{were used for}} automobile drag racing from 1957 to 1972.

5|$|Some locals {{wanted to}} keep Fornebu as a {{regional}} airport for the Oslo and Bærum area. The proposal was to keep part of the <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> terminals and allow aircraft such as the Bombardier Dash 8, Fokker 50 and British Aerospace 146 to use the airport. Proponents argued that a similar role was filled by Stockholm-Bromma Airport and Chicago's Midway Airport.|$|E
5|$|The first airline {{to operate}} to Båtsfjord was Varangfly, later renamed Norving, who flew {{seaplane}} taxi and ambulance flights {{in the early}} 1960s. Construction of an airfield in Båtsfjorddalen was started by the aviation club Båtsfjord Flyklubb in 1972 and completed in May1973. It consisted of an gravel <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> was served with regular flights by Norving. The municipality took over ownership of the airport in 1976. Norving remained the sole operator until 1990, when the routes were taken over by Widerøe using the Twin Otter.|$|E
5|$|While {{entering}} the landing pattern, crash trucks would {{travel to the}} <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> await landing. This was standard procedure for all Head Start landings. After landing, the crew was interrogated prior to being released, so that maintenance, intelligence, and other crews could be alerted {{to the performance of}} the plane and other items that the crew might have noticed during their flight. After release, they would typically go to the Physical Conditioning room for a steam bath and rubdown.|$|E

5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire <b>runway,</b> <b>and</b> allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> {{came to rest on}} the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{activities}} {{were taken in}} hand by the US Navy Seabees of the 18th Construction Regiment, which consisted of the 27th, 61st and 63rd Construction Battalions and the 17th Special Battalion, which arrived between 25 and 30 March, and the 77th Construction Battalion which arrived on 14 April. The 27th built a PT boat base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, a <b>runway,</b> <b>and</b> some of the buildings at the PT boat base. It also handled sawmill operations. The 63rd assisted at the sawmill and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and avgas dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the avgas tank farm. The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at {{the eastern end of}} the island.|$|E

5|$|However, by 2009, {{the airport}} terminal, <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> {{navigation}} aids were upgraded with about $25million, which {{was funded by}} the British Columbia government, who gave $4million, the Canadian government, who gave $6.6million and the airport itself for the remaining money and announced in 2007; $13million was used to upgrade the runway, $3million was used to expand the navigation aid, while $4million was used for terminal improvements. The city's intention was to expand and upgrade the airport in order for the economy and tourism to expand. City mayor Peter Milobar and members of the Kamloops Indian Band praised its expansion. Its catchment area has a population of approximately 138,000residents.|$|E
5|$|In February 1953, Lympne was {{waterlogged}} {{and services}} were temporarily transferred to Southend. In September waterlogging again stopped the air ferry, which {{was transferred to}} RAF West Malling. Six Bristol Freighter Mk.32s were introduced in March 1953, {{at a cost of}} £540,000, which could each carry three cars and a service to Ostend was started with the aircraft. Skyways remained at Lympne until October 1954 when it moved to Lydd (Ferryfield). On 3 October 1954, the last Silver City flight to Le Touquet was operated by Bristol Freighter G-AIFV. Silver City moved to Lydd because the runway at Lympne was not suitable. Although it had campaigned for improvements to the <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> was Lympne's biggest customer the airfields owners, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, refused. Silver City said it would build an airport suitable for its needs at Lydd.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, located on the Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction of an airbase was carried out. However, Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> the rest a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In {{relation}} to São Paulo, the initial planning {{of the airport}} involved three <b>runways</b> <b>and</b> four passenger terminals. However, {{the first phase of}} the construction comprising two <b>runways</b> <b>and</b> two terminals started only on August 11, 1980. The airport was officially inaugurated on January 20, 1985. Quickly Guarulhos became the city's primary airport, supplanting São Paulo-Congonhas Airport.|$|R
50|$|In 1938-39 the Works Progress Administration made {{improvements}} {{including new}} <b>runways</b> <b>and</b> <b>runway</b> widening, fencing, sodding, lighting, remodeling the administration {{building and construction}} of a new restaurant.|$|R

5|$|It took {{thirty minutes}} {{to clear the}} <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> rig an arresting cable and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33 Shooting Star, but he almost landed long—and the Nellis base operations office decided that to avoid any further problems, {{it would be best}} to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.|$|E
5|$|James Polehinke, {{the first}} officer, {{suffered}} serious injuries, including multiple broken bones, a collapsed lung, and severe bleeding. Lexington-Fayette and airport police officers pulled Polehinke {{out of the}} wreckage. Polehinke underwent surgery for his injuries, including an amputation of his left leg. Doctors later determined that Polehinke had suffered brain damage and has no memory of the crash or the {{events leading up to}} it. , Polehinke was a wheelchair user. During the same month, Polehinke filed a lawsuit against the airport and the company that designed the <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> taxi lights. A January 2014 episode of Piers Morgan Live reported that Polehinke was paraplegic.|$|E
5|$|Lympne {{returned}} to civilian use on 1 January 1946. In 1948, the first air ferry service was inaugurated at Lympne by Silver City Airways. Problems with waterlogging {{of the grass}} <b>runway</b> <b>and</b> the refusal of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation to upgrade the airfield led to Silver City transferring operations to Lydd (Ferryfield) in 1954. By 1956, the airport's ownership had passed to Eric Rylands Ltd, the Skyways holding company. Skyways operated a coach-air service between London and Paris, flying passengers from Lympne to Beauvais. This service operated until 1974 (1955–1958: the original Skyways; 1958–1971: Skyways Coach-Air; 1971–1972: Skyways International; 1972–1974: Dan-Air Skyways). Following the cessation of commercial operations in October 1974, Lympne continued {{to be used as}} a General Aviation airfield until about 1984. The site is now an industrial estate.|$|E
