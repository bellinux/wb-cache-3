5|$|In 1984, the {{government}} {{decided to build}} a second railway tunnel and a second <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> to alleviate traffic congestion in the Cross Harbour Tunnel resulting in Eastern Harbour Crossing, the first railway-road tunnel in Hong Kong. The tunnel enabled Kwun Tong Line's extension to Quarry Bay, with an additional stop, Lam Tin, built in the middle. The new MTR station, opened on 8 November 1989, caused an influx of population into Lam Tin.|$|E
5|$|Back in Kristiansund, Løvold {{started working}} {{with the idea of}} {{building}} a subsea <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> from Kristiansund to the mainland. He discussed the issue in Foreningen Kristiansunderen where it received support. Løvold was an important enthusiast for the fixed link project, which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link in 1992. The local press dubbed him the fixed link general. In 1955 he organized an inspection of Freifjorden; using echo sounding it was possible to survey the depth of the fjord. Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav Oksvik and the two started working towards implementing the plans.|$|E

5|$|From 1863, part of King's Cross was an {{intermediate}} station. On the extreme {{east of the}} site, King's Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from Finsbury before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York <b>Road</b> <b>Tunnel</b> to join the City Widened Lines to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the Northern City Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1988, in the Tabernas Desert in Spain's Almería province. Spielberg originally had planned the chase to {{be a short}} sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark (because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each other. He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it. The second unit had begun filming two weeks before. After approximately ten days, the production moved to Bellas Artes to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay's palace. Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park {{was used for the}} <b>road,</b> <b>tunnel</b> and beach sequence in which birds strike the plane. The Spanish portion of location filming finished on June 2, 1988, in Guadix, Granada, with filming of Brody's capture at İskenderun train station. The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere, rather than adding it as a visual effect.|$|E

The QRA software tool is robust and flexible such that users can easily add or modify the event trees, fault trees and the consequence estimation models.

With the completion in 1986 of the A2 motorway in the Valle Leventina, the huge valley leading from Airolo down to Bellinzona, and the surmounting of the Monte Ceneri between Bellinzona and Lugano in 1983, finally a continuous motorway was established from the northern border of Switzerland in Basel to the southern border in Chiasso, or the shortest motorway route from North-German Hamburg as far as South-Italian Sicilly, bringing down the competitiveness of the railway line.|$|E

25|$|While the Lyttelton <b>road</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{was still}} under construction, the Board sought and was granted a license to operate a {{passenger}} service to Lyttelton via Ferry Road, which commenced {{as soon as the}} tunnel opened in 1964. This route competed for passengers with the Railways Department's Christchurch–Lyttelton suburban passenger trains. Though the Department had held out hope that both the Board's and the Department's services could coexist following the opening of the <b>road</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and even opened a new railway station at Lyttelton in 1963, the losses mounted due to competition from buses and private motorcars forcing the Department to terminate the passenger rail service in 1972. The Board then had its license for the Lyttelton route altered so it could run its buses roughly paralleling the railway line to collect passengers who had been using the rail service.|$|E

40|$|Radio {{propagation}} models (RPMs) {{are generally}} employed in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) to predict path loss in multiple operating environments (e. g. modern road infrastructure such as flyovers, underpasses and <b>road</b> <b>tunnels).</b> For example, different RPMs {{have been developed}} to predict propagation behaviour in <b>road</b> <b>tunnels.</b> However, most existing RPMs for <b>road</b> <b>tunnels</b> are computationally complex and are based on field measurements in frequency band not suitable for VANET deployment. Furthermore, in tunnel applications, consequences of moving radio obstacles, such as large buses and delivery trucks, are generally not considered in existing RPMs. This paper proposes a computationally inexpensive RPM with minimal set of parameters to predict path loss in an acceptable range for <b>road</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The proposed RPM utilizes geometric properties of the tunnel, such as height and width along with the distance between sender and receiver, to predict the path loss. The proposed RPM also considers the additional attenuation caused by the moving radio obstacles in <b>road</b> <b>tunnels,</b> while requiring a negligible overhead in terms of computational complexity. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed RPM, we conduct a comparative summary and evaluate its performance. Specifically, an extensive data gathering campaign is carried out in order to evaluate the proposed RPM. The field measurements use the 5 GHz frequency band, which is suitable for vehicular communication. The results demonstrate that a close match exists between the predicted values and measured values of path loss. In particular, an average accuracy of 94 % is found with R 2 = 0. 86...|$|R
