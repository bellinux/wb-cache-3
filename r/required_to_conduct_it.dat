40|$|The {{virtual reality}} {{research}} at the Naval Postgraduate School has produced a simulation environment called NPSNET. NPSNET demonstrates that a real-time, interactive three-dimensional simulation system for multiple networked participants is achievable using low-cost workstations. However, as NPSNET expands, limitations of the current testing methods have become apparent, particularly {{in the area of}} man-hours spent in detecting faults in the software. The problem addressed by this research was to improve the validation process of NPSNET by implementing an efficient code inspection. The approach taken was to develop a two-person code inspection based on Pagan's Inspections. The development of the inspection process began with the inspection checklist. The checklist is a result of studying the software development difficulties of NPSNET and other code inspection checklists. Next was the design of the inspection process, which focused on streamlining the amount of time and number of participants conducting the inspection. Finally, a trial inspection was conducted to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the software inspection process. The results of this work demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} develop a fast and effective inspection process with fewer people <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>it.</b> The trial inspection reduced the time from four to two hours to complete, produced a 35 % defects per lines of code rate, and only required two instead of four people to conduct.

40|$|Well-conducted randomizedclinical trials (RCTs) are thegold {{standard}} {{for evaluating the}} safety and efficacy of medical therapeutics. Yet most often, a single group of individuals who conducted the trial {{are the only ones}} who have access to the raw data, con-duct the analysis, and pub-lish the study results. This limited access does not typically allow others to replicate the trial findings. Given the time and expense <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> an RCT, <b>it</b> is often unlikely that others will independently repeat a similar experiment. Thus, the scientific community and the public often accept the results produced and published by the original research team without an opportunity for reanalysis.

40|$|For {{individuals}} presenting with comorbid borderline {{personality disorder}} (BPD) {{and substance use}} disorders (SUD), rates of treatment dropout from combined mental health and substance abuse treatment centers approach 80 %, rendering dropout the rule rather than the exception. Several studies indicate that utilizing a more comprehensive treatment such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) may be useful for client retention; however, given the scope and effort <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> this treatment, <b>it</b> may be more practical to determine which specific components within DBT are useful in retaining clients in substance use treatment. Thus, {{the purpose of the}} current paper is first to determine what exact deficits underlie treatment dropout among the BPD-SUD comorbidity. Second, we review and evaluate effectiveness of DBT retention-enhancing strategies by assembling work from other samples and literatures that also tests retention-enhancing strategies discussed in DBT. As a last step, the paper will conclude with a discussion on methodological limitations and potential future directions in this line of research...|$|R
40|$|It will be {{difficult}} to ever know what calling strategy works best for telephone surveys. The variety of populations and topics, varying lengths of calling periods, differences in training and experience of the interviewing staff, and independent decisions made for specific surveys make this goal problematic. However, given the increasing effort <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> telephone surveys, <b>it</b> is fruitful to create a calling method that addresses call patterns with a very low probability of making contact and/or being a valid sample unit. Reducing the number of calls made to those cases and increasing the effort for more viable call patterns for making contact and completing an interview is a useful endeavor. Current calling methods are based on calling strategy research with the focus on establishing eligibility and completing interviews within the first few call attempts. Research has not really focused on {{what to do about the}} sample beyond the first few calls. The goal of this study is to focus on the total call history rather than the first few attempts. Proportional hazards modeling will be used to assess the ability to contact residences and complete interviews. The first model addresses the ability to contact and determine eligibility and the second model addresses the likelihood for interviews and refusals...|$|R
40|$|This {{quasi-experimental}} {{study investigated}} whether {{the knowledge of}} the Enneagram system affects unconditional self-acceptance and psychological well-being of university students who have been attending university for at least a year. It also measured the correlation between the total scores on the psychological well-being instrument and unconditional self-acceptance questionnaire. A two-group design was employed, wherein a control and an experimental group completed a pre- and two post-tests on psychological well-being and unconditional self-acceptance. The randomly selected experimental group received three weekly educational sessions on the Enneagram system. Results show that {{the knowledge of the}} Enneagram personality system does not {{have a significant effect on}} psychological well-being. Due to a small sample size and violation of the assumptions <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> an ANCOVA <b>it</b> was not possible to determine if the knowledge of the Enneagram affects unconditional self-acceptance. Findings indicate also a low to moderate positive correlation between the Unconditional self-acceptance questionnaire Chamberlain and Haaga (2001 a) and Ryff Psychological Well-Being Scale (1989). Recommendations include using a larger sample, changing the number of educational sessions or their format, and using an additional test to measure irrational thoughts. Therefore, in a future study it may be favorable that the intervention be an integral part of a family and consumer sciences university course. Finally, despite the results of this study there are some indicators that suggest the Enneagram system be taught in schools and university to help prepare students to be more conscious of how marketing agencies may manipulate such knowledge to their advantage...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{development}} of a supervisor with an emphasis on the early stage of development. The supervision process is by its very nature an on-going development that never ends, yet it always has its starting point. For the supervision <b>to</b> develop <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> someone <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>it.</b> That someone is the supervisor, which means that he/she is also committed to constant development which starts from the beginning. In the theoretical part of the thesis the profession of supervisor, qualities and competencies which a supervisor has to possess and roles he/she occupies, are presented. Afterwards, the ethical guidelines of the Slovenian Association for Supervisionand the ANSE minimum standards for educational programs for supervisors are described. The development of a supervisor is presented using different models of development. Also described are the factors involved in the personal and professional development of the supervisor, how he/she acquires his/her personal and professional identity and what affects them both, the implications of self-efficacy, and how the supervisor integrates all these changes into his/her personality. The empirical part of the thesis studies the initial problems in {{the development of}} female supervisors, their transition from the first stage of development to the second one and the impact of personality traits and experience. The qualitative research involved eight female students of the Master’s degree in Supervision, personal and organisational counselling at the Faculty of Education in Ljubljana. In my research I used the analysis with the open coding technique. In the discussion the resulting categories were linked to each survey question. The results obtained following the theoretical concept that I presented in the first part. The greatest obstacles and difficulties are the initials of supervisor sensor for professionalism. These are the easiest to overcome, with the involvement of their own supervision process, with the reflection of and evaluating their own performance. Having all professional modification are the initials of supervisor recognized her personal qualities as important for their progress. The findings from all three questions are integrated into the final conceptualisation. Thus a representative framework was obtained showing the connection between initial problems of development of novice female supervisors, awareness of what had contributed to the progress, recognition of personal characteristics that had contributed to the development and, consequently, the development of professional competences of individual supervisor. In the conclusion of the thesis, I connect the content of the survey with the study’s set objectives, combining them with my personal experience in gaining knowledge of supervision, which led me to the selection of the master’s thesis theme. ...|$|R
