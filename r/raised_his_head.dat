60|$|Then, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> he {{attacked}} grumpily the steward, a lanky, anxious youth with a long, pale face and two big front teeth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot {{you doing}} here?" [...] asked the Englishman, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and {{regarding}} Mr. Wrenn as a housewife does a cockroach in the salad-bowl.|$|R
