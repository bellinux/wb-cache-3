DNA-RNA hybridization was performed with the separated DNA strands and RNA purified from R-plasmid-carrying cells. The results demonstrated that an asymmetric transcription of the <b>R-plasmid</b> DNA occurs in vivo. Hybridization was only detected with the H strand (denser strand in cesium chloride-polyuridylic acid-polyguanylic acid). By determining {{the density of the}} RNA-DNA hybrid in CsCl gradients, it was estimated that greater than 60 % of the nucleotide sequences in the <b>R-plasmid</b> DNA are transcribed in logarithmically growing E. coli cells.

40|$|International audienceThree clones of E. coli, one {{of which}} was {{harbouring}} a tetracycline resistance plasmid were inoculated together into the stomach of axenic mice. Without antibiotic selective pressure, the <b>R-Plasmid</b> bearing strain became dominant in the faeces of mice, while the <b>R-plasmid</b> free strain was eliminated. When the <b>R-plasmid</b> bearing strain was given to mice 4 days after the inoculation with the <b>R-plasmid</b> free strain, it was repressed and remained at the stable level of 10 (4. 5) organisms per g of faeces. But a rapid spread of the <b>R-plasmid</b> was observed, tetracycline resistant bacteria become dominant within one day, and replace the tetracycline sensitive E. coli. The tetracycline resistance plasmid did not disadvantage the mediating strain in the gut, {{even in the absence of}} antibiotic pressure. In contrast Lebek and Egger (1983), studying the same strains in vitro, found that in a chemostat the plasmid bearing strain was overgrown by the plasmid free strain. These results strongly suggest that in vitro interactions between E. coli strains cannot be directly extrapolated to in vivo conditions. For the determination of the no-effect level of antibiotic residue on the selection of R-factor in the gut, studies should be made in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Mutation to {{high level}} {{resistance}} to nitrofurantoin of {{a strain of}} Escherichia coli carrying an <b>R-plasmid</b> conferring resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin and other antibiotics resulted in greatly increased resistance to the two aminoglycosides but not the other antibiotics. A similar result was observed when the <b>R-plasmid</b> was transferred to high level nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants. The enhanced resistance {{was accompanied by a}} 30 % increase in 3 -. /V-acetyltransferase activity. Resistance to chloramphenicol in a strain carrying an <b>R-plasmid</b> coding for chlor-amphenicol acetyltransferase was not increased although the same strain showed increased resistance to kanamycin. These observations may have considerable significance in the development of resistance to gentamicin and other amino-glycoside antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|The conjugational {{transfer}} {{efficiency of}} 41 wild-type <b>R-plasmids</b> was studied in Escherichia coli K- 12. Type I <b>R-plasmids</b> were transferred at comparatively high and rather uniform frequencies, whereas type F <b>R-plasmids</b> showed less uniform and, on average, somewhat lower transfer frequencies. <b>R-plasmids</b> not mediating sensitivity to F-, I-, or N-specific phages showed moderate transfer frequencies, and type N <b>R-plasmids</b> showed very low transfer frequencies. Various lines of evidence {{suggest that a}} well-expressed, but functionally inefficient, conjugation apparatus {{is the cause of}} the poor transfer of type N <b>R-plasmids</b> in liquid medium. Nalidixic acid efficiently inhibited transfer of type I and particularly type F <b>R-plasmids,</b> whereas the transfer of type N plasmids was resistant to the drug. Type F and type I plasmids appear to depend on at least one host function for their transfer, namely, the nalidixic acid-sensitive reaction in vegetative chromosome replication, whereas type N plasmids are independent of this function...|$|R
40|$|The {{normal habitat}} of enteric {{bacteria}} is largely anaerobic. Expression {{of the three}} characteristic properties of <b>R-plasmids,</b> drug resistance, vegetative replication, and fertility, was therefore studied in Escherichia coli K- 12 during anaerobiosis. Replication and drug resistance functions were not altered in the 45 <b>R-plasmids</b> studies, whereas the expression of fertility varied considerably among different <b>R-plasmids</b> during anaerobiosis. The <b>R-plasmids</b> could be divided into three groups, one showing a strong, the second a moderate, and the third little or no reduction of fertility by anaerobiosis. Plasmid-determined sensitivity to F-, N-, and I-specific phage, respectively, was well, although not absolutely, correlated with each of three groups mentioned. Anaerobiosis-aerobiosis appears to change the fertility of type F <b>R-plasmids</b> by influencing the degree of repression of their fertility functions such as the formation of sex pili. Although the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline were unaltered by anaerobiosis, sulfonamide {{was found to be}} four- to eightfold less active under this condition in both resistant and sensitive strains. A surprisingly high frequency and uniformity of minimal inhibitory concentrations was observed for R-plasmid-mediated resistance to streptomycin and chloramphenicol...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that all conjugative <b>R-plasmids</b> of Clostridium perfringens are closely related to the previously characterized tetracycline resistance plasmid, pCW 3. Fourteen conjugative <b>R-plasmids</b> derived from 11 C. perfringens strains isolated in Australia, the United States, France, Belgium, and Japan were analyzed. Eleven of the plasmids encoded tetracycline resistance while three carried both tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance. Each of these plasmids was compared, by restriction analysis, to the reference plasmid, pCW 3. Seven of the tetracycline resistance plasmids had EcoRI, XbaI, and ClaI restriction profiles that were identical to those of the corresponding pCW 3 digests. The seven remaining <b>R-plasmids</b> were different from pCW 3. Comparison of partial restriction maps of these plasmids with a complete map of pCW 3 indicated that they contained at least 17 kb of DNA that also was present in pCW 3. Hybridization analysis confirmed that these plasmids shared substantial homology with pCW 3. The three tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance plasmids frequently lost a 6 -kb chloramphenicol resistance segment during conjugation. Cloning experiments showed that the chloramphenicol resistance determinant was expressed in Escherichia coli and that the chloramphenicol resistance gene of one of these plasmids, pIP 401, was contained within a 1. 5 -kb region of the 6 -kb deletion segment. Hybridization analysis indicated that the deletion segment of pIP 401 was related to those of the other two chloramphenicol resistance plasmids. During the course of this study, conjugative <b>R-plasmids</b> which appear to be identical to pCW 3 or closely related to pCW 3 were identified from C. perfringens strains from human, animal and environmental sources in five countries. It is concluded that C. perfringens strains in humans and animals throughout the world have overlapping gene pools and that all the conjugative C. perfringens <b>R-plasmids</b> examined probably evolved from a pCW 3 -like element...|$|R
40|$|Tn 1 transposes from pRO 161, a Tra- {{derivative}} of RP 1, to Pseudomonas aeruginosa sex factor FP 2. The acquisition of Tn 1 by FP 2 results {{in its ability}} to mobilize pRO 161 to other bacteria. Genetic evidence presented here suggests two sequential mechanisms. Initially, transposition of Tn 1 results in trans-diploidy for the Tra+ and Tra- plasmids. This subsequently allows mobilization of the Tra- <b>R-plasmid</b> dependent on a host recombination mechanism. Transconjugants from this mating contain either stable cointegrate R-plasmids or aggregates resulting from dissociation of the cointegrates into a Tra+ and Tra- plasmid. These aggregates have lost at least part of Tn 1 from their parent FP 2 :Tn 1 component, but now they mobilize the tra- <b>R-plasmid</b> from a recombination-deficient (Rec-) genetic background as well as from Rec+ donor strains.

Both were of {{relatively}} small size (5 × 106 to 6 × 106 daltons) and present in multiple copies within their respective bacterial hosts. N-SuSm possessed a guanine plus cytosine content of 55 %, whereas N-Tc was 49 % guanine plus cytosine. Although these plasmids were inherently nontransmissible {{they could be}} mobilized by a large variety of transfer agents including Ent, Hly, and K 88. The fi− transfer factors tested were far more likely (about 200 ×) to mobilize these nonconjugative plasmids than were the fi+ transfer factors tested. Although the mobilization phenomenon was {{not found to be}} associated with a detectable level of direct stable recombinational union between N-SuSm or N-Tc with a transfer factor, we were able to demonstrate a low level of recombination between these replicons and a transfer factor by P 1 -mediated transduction.

Methods: The antimicrobial susceptibilities and prevalence of <b>R-plasmids</b> in Salmonella Dublin iso-lated in Japan from 1976 to 2005 were investigated. To evaluate the importance of gyrA mutation and active efflux, we derived the gyrA revertants and acrAB deletion mutants, and then compared with their parental strains the MICs of quinolone antimicrobials such as nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin.

40|$|The {{resistance}} to ampicillin and nalidixic acid in Shigella sonnei isolates obtained in Korea {{during the period}} 1998 to 2000 was characterized. Recently (J. Y. Oh, H. S. Yu, S. K.

We analyzed 138 S. sonnei isolates collected during the same period. Ampicillin and nalidixic acid resistance was found in 30 and 86 % of the isolates, respectively. The ampicillin resistance was mediated by a TEM- 1 β-lactamase, and TEM- 52 extended-spectrum β-lactamase was identified in one sporadic S. sonnei isolate from 1999. blaTEM- 1 and blaTEM- 52 were located in conjugative <b>R-plasmids.</b> Tn 3 was detected in 41 % of the ampicillin-resistant isolates.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of multiple-antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections at Charing Cross Hospital, London, {{increased over the}} last 10 years, and its distribution was related to O-type. Among strains of the eight O-types most frequently causing such infections at this hospital, O 4, O 9, and O 18 had a high {{incidence of}} multiple resistance (35, 22, and 19 %, respectively); O 2 and O 6 had a intermediate incidence (14 and 11 %, respectively); and O 7, O 1, and O 75 had a low incidence (8, 6, and less than 3 %, respectively). This nonrandom distribution appears to be a consequence of unequal plasmid recipient ability. After overnight mating with antibiotic-resistant donors, <b>R-plasmid</b> infection frequencies among antibiotic-sensitive urinary tract isolates differed by up to 10 (5) -fold, and such differences were correlated with the variation in the incidence of antibiotic resistance among the O-types.

We have now shown that representatives of these plasmids were transferred between apparently nonlysogenic strains of S. aureus either in mixed culture in broth or by filter-mating on agar medium. The mechanism of transfer appeared to be conjugation. A transferable Gmr plasmid (pSH 8) mobilized or cotransferred a tetracycline <b>R-plasmid</b> and a chloramphenicol <b>R-plasmid</b> that were not independently transferable.

Restriction endonuclease digestion of pSH 8 and its deletion mutants made it possible to assign the property of self-transfer to a specific segment of the pSH 8 genome and provided the basis for a physical and genetic map of that plasmid. Similar Gmr plasmids from S. aureus strains isolated in locations remote from Michael Reese Hospital had resistance determinants and transfer properties comparable to those of pSH 8.

40|$|Background & objectives: The {{multiple}} {{drug resistance}} (MDR) is a serious health problem and major challenge to the global drug discovery programmes. Most of the genetic determinants that confer resistance to antibiotics are located on <b>R-plasmids</b> in bacteria. The present investigation was undertaken to investigate the ability of organic extract of the fruits of Helicteres isora to cure <b>R-plasmids</b> from certain clinical isolates. mMethods: Active fractions demonstrating antibacterial and antiplasmid activities were isolated from the acetone extracts of shade dried fruits of H. isora by bioassay guided fractionation. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics and organic extracts was determined by agar dilution method. Plasmid curing activity of organic fractions was determined by evaluating the ability of bacterial colonies (pre treated with organic fraction for 18 h) {{to grow in the}} presence of antibiotics. The physical loss of plasmid DNA in the cured derivatives was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: The active fraction did not inhibit the growth of either the clinical isolates or the strains harbouring reference plasmids even at a concentration of 400 mu g/ml. However, the same fraction could cure plasmids from Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and E. coli (RP 4) at curing efficiencies of 14, 26, 22 and 2 per cent respectively. The active fraction mediated plasmid curing resulted in the subsequent loss of antibiotic resistance encoded in the plasmids as revealed by antibiotic resistance profile of cured strains. The physical loss of plasmid was also confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Interpretation & conclusions: The active fraction of acetone extract of H. isora fruits cured <b>R-plasmids</b> from Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates as well as reference strains. Such plasmid loss reversed the multiple antibiotic resistance in cured derivatives making them sensitive to low concentrations of antibiotics. Acetone fractions of H. isora may be a source to develop antiplasmid agents of natural origin to contain the development and spread of plasmid borne multiple antibiotic resistance...|$|R

The majority of fecal E. coli isolates accepted the R factor at lower frequencies than K- 12 F−, varying from 10 − 2 per donor cell to undetectable levels. The frequencies with which certain fecal recipients received the <b>R-plasmid</b> were increased when its R+ transconjugant was either cured of the R 1 -plasmid and remated with the fi+ strain or backcrossed into the parental strain.

Similar mating experiments showed no evidence for the transfer of the broad-host-range <b>R-plasmid</b> pAM beta 1 to Pediococcus spp. recipients...|$|E
40|$|Over {{a period}} of 22 months, 32 {{patients}} treated in three independent intensive care units of the Innsbruck University Hospital were infected with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing {{members of the family}} Enterobacteriaceae (30 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca isolate, and 1 Escherichia coli isolate). As confirmed by sequencing of a bla gene PCR fragment, all isolates expressed the SHV- 5 -type beta-lactamase. Genomic fingerprinting of epidemic strains with XbaI and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped 20 of 21 isolates from ward A into two consecutive clusters which included 1 of 3 ward B isolates. All six K. pneumoniae isolates from ward C formed a third cluster. Stool isolates of asymptomatic patients and environmental isolates belonged to these clusters as well. Additionally, 2, 600 routine K. pneumoniae isolates from the surrounding provinces (population, 900, 000) were screened for SHV- 5 production. Only one of six nonepidemic isolates producing SHV- 5 beta-lactamase was matched with the outbreak strains by genomic fingerprinting. Plasmid fingerprinting, however, revealed the epidemic spread of a predominant <b>R-plasmid,</b> with a size of approximately 80 kb, associated with 29 of the 30 K. pneumoniae isolates. This plasmid was also present in the single K. oxytoca and E. coli isolates from ward C and in three nonepidemic isolates producing SHV- 5. Our results underline that strain typing exclusively on the genomic level can be misleading in the epidemiological investigation of plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Our evidence for multiple events of <b>R-plasmid</b> transfer between species of the family Enterobacteriaceae in this nosocomial outbreak stresses the need for plasmid typing, especially because SHV- 5 beta-lactamase seems to be regionally spread predominantly via plasmid transfer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract	 Sixty Serratia marcescens {{isolates}} {{were obtained}} from patient specimens from three different hospitals {{in the city of}} Riyadh. These were tested for their antibiotic resistance factors using eleven different antibiotics. Their ability to transfer antibiotic resistance plasmids to a sensitive E. coli strain (RR 1) was tested by transformation and conjugation experiments. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to determine the size and number of the <b>R-plasmids.</b> Southern blotting was used to assess homologies between antibiotic resistance plasmids from different isolates. Among the isolates tested, 36. 7 % contained plasmids, and all these were from strains isolated from two hospitals. No <b>R-plasmids</b> could be detected among the multiple resistant strains isolated from the third hospital. Among the strains that contained plasmids, approximately 63. 6 % transferred multiple antibiotic resistance to E. coli and the rest transferred only one antibiotic resistance marker. The majority of strains carrying out the plasmids showed similarities in band number and size. In view of the similarities this group was denoted the predominant group, and selected for further molecular investigations. Restriction endonuclease digests of plasmids from this group gave the same restriction pattern which confirmed that they were closely related. Hybridization experiments using these plasmids and nick-translated 32 p-labelled pBR- 322 DNA probe, showed that all the large bands (36 kb) are related and exhibit homology with pBR- 32...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{homology}} {{of thirteen}} <b>R-plasmids</b> of group P was examined by heteroduplex analysis and Southern blotting. Ten of these plasmids showed homology for extensive regions including all genes reported as necessary for replication and conjugational transfer. The {{differences between these}} plasmids {{could be explained by}} gain or loss of DNA sequences, many of which {{have been shown to be}} transposons. Of the other three plasmids, two showed unambiguous homology with the typical P-plasmids but this homology was imperfect, implying that these plasmids are products of lines which have evolved separately for long periods. One plasmid failed to produce heteroduplexes with the reference P plasmid...|$|R
40|$|A high {{proportion}} of nitrofuran-resistant strains {{has been found in}} a collection of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Some of the Escherichia coli carried <b>R-plasmids</b> that conferred resistance to nitrofurantoin. and nitrofurazone. The mechanism of resistance is not clear, only in lactose non-fermenting recipients was there a decrease in the nitrofuran-reducing ability of whole-cell suspensions. One of the plasmids con-ferred enhanced resistance to UV light on DNA repair defective mutants but not on repair efficient strains. In some resistant strains, the total resistance was apparently the result of a combination of chromosomal and plasmid-borne genes. The presence of the plasmid may allow the development of higher resistance levels by mutation of chromosomal genes...|$|R
