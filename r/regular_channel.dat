2500|$|On September 14, 2007 the European Space Agency {{reported}} {{ice loss}} {{had opened up}} the Northwest Passage [...] "for {{the first time since}} records began in 1978", and the extreme loss in 2007 rendered the passage [...] "fully navigable". Further exploration for petroleum reserves elsewhere in the Arctic may now become more feasible, and the passage may become a <b>regular</b> <b>channel</b> of international shipping and commerce if Canada is not able to enforce its claim to it.|$|E
60|$|London {{was but a}} heap {{of ashes}} when Beric arrived there. It had been a trading place rather than a town. Here were no Roman houses or temples with their massive stone work; it {{consisted}} only of a large collection of wooden structures, inhabited by merchants and traders. It lay upon a knoll rising above the low swampy ground covered by the sea at high water, for not till long afterwards did the Romans erect the banks that dammed back the waters and confined them within their <b>regular</b> <b>channel.</b> The opposite shore was similarly covered with water at high tide, and forests extended {{as far as the}} eye could reach. London, in fact, occupied what was at high water a peninsula, connected with the mainland only by a shoulder extending back to the hills beyond it, and separated by a deep channel on the west from a similar promontory.|$|E
60|$|Day {{after day}} they {{travelled}} on, keeping just far enough {{out to get}} {{the benefit of the}} current without allowing themselves to be drawn towards the centre of the river. Even this at times was very difficult, especially when they were passing round curves, for much of the water, instead of following the channel, made its way through the forest to the next bend in the river, and they had the greatest difficulty in preventing themselves from being drawn in among the trees by the current. At such times they were forced to launch the canoe overboard, to roll up the bottom of the raft, and to lay the great bundle of rushes across the poles now supported by the inflated skins. Only then by vigorous paddling, in which Stephen bore his part, were they able to tow this behind them across the current until they reached a point where the force of the stream was confined to the <b>regular</b> <b>channel.</b> At one point, where the river was broader than usual and the current in consequence slower, they crossed to the other bank.|$|E

60|$|An {{hour later}} I {{am in the}} pilot-house, looking down upon {{what was once the}} channel of a {{peaceful}} river. But its banks are only defined by tossing tufts of willow washed by the long swell that breaks over a vast inland sea. Stretches of tule land fertilized by its once <b>regular</b> <b>channel,</b> and dotted by nourishing ranchos, are now cleanly erased. The cultivated profile of the old landscape had faded. Dotted lines in symmetrical perspective mark orchards that are buried and chilled in the turbid flood. The roofs of a few farmhouses are visible, and here and there the smoke curling from chimneys of half-submerged tenements shows an undaunted life within. Cattle and sheep are gathered on Indian mounds, waiting the fate of their companions, whose carcases drift by us or swing in eddies with the wrecks of barns and outhouses. Wagons are stranded everywhere where the tide could carry them. As I wipe the moistened glass, I see nothing but water, pattering on the deck from the lowering clouds, dashing against the window, dripping from the willows, hissing by the wheels, everywhere washing, coiling, sapping, hurrying in rapids, or swelling at last into deeper and vaster lakes, awful in their suggestive quiet and concealment.|$|E
60|$|This House will be, as it ever {{ought to}} be, anxiously {{attentive}} to the inclinations and interests of its constituents; nor do we desire to straiten any of the avenues to the throne, or to either House of Parliament. But the ancient order in which {{the rights of the}} people have been exercised is not a restriction of these rights. It is a method providently framed in favor of those privileges which it preserves and enforces, by keeping in that course which has been found the most effectual for answering their ends. His Majesty may receive the opinions and wishes of individuals under their signatures, and of bodies corporate under their seals, as expressing their own particular sense; and he may grant such redress as the legal powers of the crown enable the crown to afford. This, and the other House of Parliament, may also receive the wishes of such corporations and individuals by petition. The collective sense of his people his Majesty is to receive from his Commons in Parliament assembled. It would destroy the whole spirit of the Constitution, if his Commons were to receive that sense from the ministers of the crown, or to admit them to be a proper or a <b>regular</b> <b>channel</b> for conveying it.|$|E

40|$|In opaque pricing certain {{characteristics}} of the product or service are hidden from the consumer until after purchase, transforming a differentiated good into somewhat of a commodity. Opaque pricing has become popular in service pricing as it allows firms to sell their differentiated products at higher prices to regular brand loyal customers while simultaneously selling to non loyal customers at discounted prices. We develop a stylized model of consumer model a monopolist selling a product via three selling channels: a <b>regular</b> full information <b>channel,</b> an opaque posted price channel and an opaque bidding channel where consumers specify the price {{they are willing to}} pay.
