40|$|Kinematic and {{electromyography}} (EMG) {{aspects of}} {{running on a}} firm surface and on soft, dry sand were studied to elucidate mechanisms contributing to the higher energy cost (EC) of <b>sand</b> <b>running.</b> Eight welltrained males (mean V_ O 2 max 64. 3 Ḯ 6 mlƫg 1 ƭin 1) performed barefoot running trials on a firm surface (wooden floor) and on a soft, dry sand surface (track dimensions 8. 8 m綰 cm; depth 13 cm) at 8 and 11 kmƨ 1. Kinematic and EMG data were collected simultaneously using an integrated six-camera 50 Hz VICON motion analysis system, an AMTI force-plate and a 10 -channel EMG system. Running at 8 kmƨ 1 on sand resulted in a greater (P< 0. 05) stance time (ts) compared with the firm surface. At 11 kmƨ 1, <b>sand</b> <b>running</b> resulted in a greater stance-to-stride ratio (P< 0. 005), a shorter stride length (SL) (P< 0. 05), and a greater cadence (P< 0. 001) compared with the firm surface values.

50|$|Bebali is {{the name}} usually {{ascribed}} to {{a small group of}} textiles that appear to have been completely sacred in function. The weave is broadly spaced giving the textile a delicate gauze like quality. According to Gittinger in 1970, What is known about them comes entirely from records in the Museum fur Volkskunde Basel, however bebali textiles can be bought today in the Kumba Sari market in Denpasar. Hauser-Schaubilin states that there are at least nine differently pattered bebali cloths, each with its own name. There is, for example, cloth with a white warp and weft broken by green, yellow and red stripes known as cenana kawi whose function is in the 3 month ritual and also are laid out in the central shrine of an ancestral temple. Bias membah (<b>running</b> <b>sand)</b> has a white warp and weft in which grey and white stripes alternate. Enkakan taluh(smashed egg) has a vivid red-and white checked pattern. It is brought to the temple as an apparel for Brahma, the god residing in the south. Two examples of bebali cloth are firstly flat cloth, for example, Kain cepuk, Kain Songket, Kain Sekordi. Secondly round cloth, where the cloth is removed from the loom and the threads not cut leaving a seamless cloth sheet., In the north and south of Bali known as Kain Wangsul meaning to ‘go round’ or to ‘return’. In the east of Bali especially Klungkung and Karangasem they are called Gedogan or ‘circle’, the circle represents zero. Ida Ayu Ngurah Puniari (Ibu Dayu) writes that the Gedogan or Wangsul is not symmetrical, this represents purusa and predana, (male and female) where the left and right hand sides will not line up, when warping on the loom a few extra threads are added so one side is uneven.These bebali cloths are now being made with natural dyes and manufactured cottons in the traditional manner with a quality that is comparable with the earlier collected pieces of the 1920s.|$|E

5000|$|One night, {{during the}} process of {{grabbing}} out the muck to enable the caisson to move, the ground below it yielded, and the entire mass plunged two feet, shaking the ground. The impact of this was so intense that the seismograph at Kidderpore registered it as an earthquake and a Hindu temple on the shore was destroyed, although it was subsequently rebuilt. While muck was being cleared, numerous varieties of objects were brought up, including anchors, grappling irons, cannons, cannonballs, brass vessels, and coins dating back to the East India Company.The job of sinking the caissons was carried out round-the-clock at a rate of a foot or more per day. [...] The caissons were sunk through soft river deposits to a stiff yellow clay 26.5 m below ground level. The accuracy of sinking the huge caissons was exceptionally precise, within 50-75 mm of the true position. After penetrating 2.1 m into clay, all shafts were plugged with concrete after individual dewatering, with some 5 m of backfilling in adjacent shafts. The main piers on the Howrah side were sunk by open wheel dredging, while those on the Kolkata side required compressed air to counter <b>running</b> <b>sand.</b> The air pressure maintained was about 40 lbs per square inch (2.8 bar), which required about 500 workers to be employed. Whenever excessively soft soil was encountered, the shafts symmetrical to the caisson axes were left unexcavated to allow strict control. In very stiff clays, a large number of the internal wells were completely undercut, allowing the whole weight of the caisson to be carried by the outside skin friction and the bearing under the external wall. Skin friction {{on the outside of the}} monolith walls was estimated at 29 kN/m2 while loads on the cutting edge in clay overlying the founding stratum reached 100 tonnes/m. The work on the foundation was completed on November 1938.|$|E
40|$|Among {{systems that}} display generic scale invariance, those whose {{asymptotic}} properties are anisotropic in space (strong anisotropy, SA) {{have received a}} relatively smaller attention, specially {{in the context of}} kinetic roughening for two-dimensional surfaces. This is in contrast with their experimental ubiquity, e. g. in the context of thin film production by diverse techniques. Based on exact results for integrable (linear) cases, here we formulate a SA Ansatz that, albeit equivalent to existing ones borrowed from equilibrium critical phenomena, is more naturally adapted to the type of observables that are measured in experiments on the dynamics of thin films, such as one and two-dimensional height structure factors. We test our Ansatz on a paradigmatic nonlinear stochastic equation displaying strong anisotropy like the Hwa-Kardar equation [Phys. Rev. Lett. 62, 1813 (1989) ], that was initially proposed to describe the interface dynamics of <b>running</b> <b>sand</b> piles. A very important role to elucidate its SA properties is played by an accurate (Gaussian) approximation through a non-local linear equation that shares the same asymptotic properties...|$|E
40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) and National Grid Transco (NGT) have {{produced}} a new GIS for the rapid assessment {{of the potential for}} a significant geohazard to adversely affect any section of the UK natural gas pipeline transmission network. NGT is responsible for the safety and maintenance of the 18 000 km long high-pressure transmission network that supplies gas to business and domestic consumers across the UK. Health and Safety Legislation in the UK requires NGT to demonstrate that the risks to individuals living and working in the vicinity of gas pipelines are adequately managed. In order to enhance its capabilities for assessing the risks due to geological ground conditions NGT required detailed information about the distribution and potential severity of geohazards across the UK. BGS, as the primary holder of national geological hazard data in the UK, were commissioned to design suitable GIS layers as part of the risk assessment methodology. Of the many geohazards that affect the UK, landsliding and the dissolution of soluble rocks were considered to pose the greatest threat to the transmission network. Other hazards, such as clay shrinkage, <b>running</b> <b>sand</b> and compressible ground, were considered to be of significance only during pipeline construction and were not thought likely to cause rupture during operation. BGS national hazard datasets for landslide and dissolution hazard were truncated to buffer zones centred upon the pipeline. These data were enhanced by detailed information from the BGS National Landslide Database and Karst Database. The result of this research was a set of continuous GIS layers that show the level of potential hazard from landsliding or dissolution of soluble rocks at any location on the pipeline network in the UK. NGT will be using this data to: improve their risk assessment methodology in this area; inform discussions on pipeline safety with their safety regulator and to improve their surveillance strategies where it is considered that geohazards represent a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline...|$|E

The results in sand deposits mirrored earlier studies that indicated that common methods used for designing drilled shafts are also appropriate for ACIP piles, although the patterns of load transfer in the tested piles suggested zones of both lower load transfer (<b>running</b> <b>sands</b> below the water table) and higher load transfer (compacted surface soils) than would be expected in drilled shafts. The action of drilling and grouting resulted in net increases in lateral effective stresses in the soil around the tested piles, near the ground surface, where such measurements were made.
