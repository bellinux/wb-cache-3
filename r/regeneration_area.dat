40|$|This article {{examines}} whether perceived neighborhood ethnic diversity {{is associated with}} a range of social outcomes in a postindustrial city undergoing regeneration. The research included a survey in 3 types of deprived area in Glasgow: those undergoing regeneration, those directly adjoining <b>regeneration</b> <b>areas,</b> and those further removed from <b>regeneration</b> <b>areas.</b> In <b>areas</b> undergoing <b>regeneration,</b> perceived diversity was positively associated with many residential, cohesion, safety, and empowerment outcomes. This was also true, although to a lesser extent, in deprived areas at some distance from <b>regeneration</b> <b>areas.</b> In areas immediately surrounding the <b>regeneration</b> <b>areas,</b> perceived diversity had mixed associations with residential and safety outcomes and few associations with cohesion and empowerment outcomes. The results suggest that the effects of perceived diversity are context dependent within a city. Moreover, regeneration processes alter neighborhood contexts and therefore enable scale, timing, and duration of diversity to mediate the relationships between perceived diversity and social outcomes...|$|R

25|$|The {{construction}} of the flood diversion channel in 2001, to discharge excess water into the Ouse Flood Relief Channel, {{was part of a}} larger scheme, which included the raising of flood banks further upstream, and the provision of a flood storage area. To allow for the drainage of surface water from the Nar Ouse <b>Regeneration</b> <b>Area,</b> the channel below the bridge on Wisbech Road has been enlarged. Part of Blubberhouse Creek has been re-excavated, to create a flood relief basin. Although it will not normally contain any water, in storm conditions where high water levels in the Ouse prevent the discharge of water from the Nar, the basin may be filled to a depth of up to , and will drain back into the river once tide levels fall, normally after 5 to 6 hours.

40|$|The Purus National Forest is a Conservation Unit (CU) of Sustainable Use, {{located in}} the {{municipality}} of Pauiní, Amazon State, Brazil. It consists of 256000 ha of highly preserved rainforest where different traditional population settlements are observed. The objective {{of this paper was}} the identification and mapping of land uses in this CU. Orbital and sub-orbital image interpretation, together with field surveys, were carried out, according to the Brazilian Methodological Itinerary for Elaboration National Forest Managements Plans (Brasil, 2003).

40|$|Silica (SiO 2) {{nanoparticles}} {{are known}} for their ability to attach different types of other particles and carry them to target destinations. Application of commercial SiO 2 nanoparticles as a carrier of ascorbic acid particles was studied. The size of SiO 2 nanoparticles was 10 - 20 nm. Ascorbic acid (AA) {{plays an important role in}} physiological processes in plants: growth, metabolism and adaptation (Y. Zhang, 2013). The role of SiO 2 nanoparticles was to attach lots of AA particles and thus ensure greater consumption of AA by a plant during its growth. Adherence of AA particles to SiO 2 nanoparticles was studied using spectrophotometry measurements. Comparison of the experimentally measured and theoretically calculated optical absorbance spectra showed that AA + SiO 2 complexes were formed when SiO 2 and AA particles were mixed in triple distilled water. The complexes remained stable at least during 24 hours. Influence of the AA + SiO 2 complexes on flax plant ('Blue di Riga') callus cell cultures was studied. Callus cultures are unorganized plant cells that grow and divide, forming clusters of cells. Callus cultures are widely used in research related to the study of the influence of various substances on the cells, as the impact of these substances on callus cells can be observed easily. Number of <b>regeneration</b> <b>areas</b> was counted after 3, 4 and 5 weeks of callus culture cultivation in the growth medium. <b>Regeneration</b> <b>areas</b> are accumulation of cells where plant regeneration occurs later. Student’s t-test showed statistically significant difference between the control groups and the groups cultivated using AA + SiO 2 complexes. Results suggest that use of SiO 2 nanoparticles in combination with ascorbic acid particles improve plant vegetation by increasing number of <b>regeneration</b> <b>areas</b> of callus tissue and increasing callus size...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: It {{has become}} {{possible}} {{to evaluate the}} conversion of soil organic matter (SOM) in pastures and arboreal crops due {{to the difference between}} the photosynthetic cycles of Eucalyptus (C 3) and most grasses (C 4). The auto analyzer method coupled to the IRMS (Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer) in the present study evaluated the 13 C content in soil profiles of Eucalyptus plantations of different ages (2, 10 and 21 years), in natural <b>regeneration</b> <b>areas</b> and natural grazing fields, and estimated the SOM conversion of each crop type of. The initial management of all sampled areas was natural pasture. The following profile layers were evaluated: 0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30, 30 - 40, 40 - 50, 50 - 70 and 70 - 90 cm, and the contribution of Eucalyptus biomass over the years of farming was estimated in the SOM conversion process. After 2 years of planting Eucalyptus, the beginning of pasture carbon conversion process occurred in the surface layer (0 - 5 cm). Ten years after planting, the process of converting organic matter by arboreal crops reached the layers up to 20 cm. After 21 years of planting and in natural <b>regeneration</b> <b>areas,</b> the entire profile has already been changed by planting Eucalyptus and native tree species...|$|R
