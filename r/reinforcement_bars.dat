40|$|A lattice {{approach}} {{is used to}} describe the mechanical interaction of a corroding <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar,</b> the surrounding concrete and the interface between steel reinforcement and concrete. The cross-section of the ribbed <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> is taken to be circular, assuming that the interaction of the ribs of the deformed <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> and the surrounding concrete can be captured by a cap-plasticity interface model. The expansive corrosion process is represented by an Eigenstrain in the lattice elements forming the interface between concrete and reinforcement. Several pull-out tests with varying degree of corrosion are analysed. The numerical results are compared with experiments reported in the literature. The influence of the properties of concrete are studied. The proposed lattice approach offers insight into corrosion induced cracking and its influence on bond strength.

25|$|Another {{important}} source of chloride ions is sea water. Sea water contains by weight approximately 3.5wt.% salts. These salts include sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and bicarbonates. In water these salts dissociate in free ions (Na+, Mg2+, Cl−, SO42−, HCO3−) and migrate with the water into the capillaries of the concrete. Chloride ions, which make up about 50% of these ions, are particularly aggressive {{as a cause of}} corrosion of carbon steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|E
25|$|Concrete can {{be damaged}} by many processes, {{such as the}} {{expansion}} of corrosion products of the steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars,</b> freezing of trapped water, fire or radiant heat, aggregate expansion, sea water effects, bacterial corrosion, leaching, erosion by fast-flowing water, physical damage and chemical damage (from carbonatation, chlorides, sulfates and distillate water). The micro fungi Aspergillus Alternaria and Cladosporium 	were able to grow on samples of concrete used as a radioactive waste barrier in the Chernobyl reactor; leaching aluminium, iron, calcium and silicon.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the larger sculptures was {{very similar to the}} temporary Hon installation at the Moderna Museet in 1966, but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the longterm weathering effects of sun and rain. The basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar. A second layer of lighter-gauge steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> was added, followed by two layers of expanded metal. A specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure. A layer of tar for waterproofing, and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy, hollow structure ready for decoration.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{involves}} the discrete modelling of corrosion induced cracking {{and its influence}} on the bond between reinforcement and concrete. A lattice approach is {{used to describe the}} mechanical interaction of a corroding <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar,</b> the surrounding concrete and the interface between steel reinforcement and concrete. The cross-section of the ribbed <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> is taken to be circular, assuming that the interaction of the ribs of the deformed <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> and the surrounding concrete is included in a cap-plasticity interface model. The expansion of the corrosion product is represented by an eigenstrain in the lattice elements forming the interface. The lattice modelling approach is applied to the analysis of corrosion induced cracking and its influence of the bond strength. The model capabilities are assessed by comparing results of analyses with those from unconfined pull-out tests reported in the literature. Future work will investigate the influence of the stiffness of interface elements and the effect of lateral confinement on corrosion induced cracking.

30|$|The bar {{buckling}} and bar fracture damage {{states were}} calculated {{according to the}} equations developed by Berry and Eberhard (2007). The equation proposed by Mackie and Stojadinovic (2007) for calculating the drift at column failure (i.e., lateral drift level beyond the peak strength that column reaches zero strength) was adopted to define the complete failure limit state. Incorporating the effect of load history on <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> buckling limit state—as shown in past studies (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 1999)—under the first seismic event may significantly alter the obtained results for the subsequent seismic event. Nevertheless, effects of seismic load-path history on <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> buckling were not considered.|$|R

Representatives for the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature stated that they were satisfied with the end result. It is the only artificially frozen bobsleigh and luge track in the Nordic Countries. The venue was completed on 1 October 1992 and cost NOK201 million.

2500|$|The {{investigation}} was criticized by some engineers and lawmakers in the U.S. It had little funding, {{no authority to}} demand evidence, and limited access to the WTC site. One major point of contention {{at the time was}} that the cleanup of the WTC site was resulting in the destruction {{of the majority of the}} buildings' steel components. Indeed, when NIST published its final report, it noted [...] "the scarcity of physical evidence" [...] that it had had at its disposal to investigate the collapses. Only a fraction of a percent of the buildings remained for analysis after the cleanup was completed: some 236 individual pieces of steel, although 95% of structural beams and plates and 50% of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> were recovered.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{misconception}} is that concrete dries as it sets, but {{the opposite}} is true - [...] damp concrete sets better than dry concrete. [...] In other words, [...] "hydraulic cement" [...] needs water to become strong. [...] Too much water is counterproductive, but too little water is deleterious. Curing allows concrete to achieve optimal strength and hardness. [...] Curing is the hydration process that occurs after the concrete has been placed. [...] In chemical terms, curing allows calcium-silicate hydrate (C-S-H) to form. [...] To gain strength and harden fully, concrete curing requires time. In around 4 weeks, typically over 90% of the final strength is reached, although strengthening may continue for decades. The conversion of calcium hydroxide in the concrete into calcium carbonate from absorption of CO2 over several decades further strengthens the concrete and makes it more resistant to damage. This carbonation reaction, however, lowers the pH of the cement pore solution and can corrode the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{spectral}} element model updating {{procedure is}} presented to identify damage in a structure using Guided wave propagation results. Two damage spectral elements (DSE 1 and DSE 2) are developed to model the local (cracks in <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar)</b> and global (debonding between <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> and concrete) damage in one-dimensional homogeneous and composite waveguide, respectively. Transfer matrix method is adopted to assemble the stiffness matrix of multiple spectral elements. In order to solve the inverse problem, clonal selection algorithm {{is used for the}} optimization calculations. Two displacement-based functions and two frequency-based functions are used as objective functions in this study. Numerical simulations of wave propagation in a bare steel bar and in a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> without and with various assumed damage scenarios are carried out. Numerically simulated data are then used to identify local and global damage of the steel rebar and the concrete-steel interface using the proposed method. Results show that local damage is easy to be identified by using any considered objective function with the proposed method while only using the wavelet energy-based objective function gives reliable identification of global damage. The method is then extended to identify multiple damages in a structure. To further verify the proposed method, experiments of wave propagation in a rectangular steel bar before and after damage are conducted. The proposed method is used to update the structural model for damage identification. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in identifying cracks in steel bars based on measured wave propagation data...|$|R
40|$|Former {{research}} indicates that the crack width close to the bar can be a better indicator for the risk for reinforcement corrosion than, as current concrete codes impose, the crack width at the concrete surface. In this paper a finite-element model is used to increase the {{understanding of how the}} crack width varies at different levels from the reinforcement and how different mechanisms control this behaviour. Concrete and reinforcement are modelled with solid elements, where nonlinear fracture mechanics is used for the concrete material and a model, which has been modified for this purpose, describes the bond between steel and concrete. The results of the finite-element calculations of the crack widths are compared to earlier experimental studies. Both the finite-element analysis and experimental studies are performed on axially loaded concrete prisms with a central 16 mm <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> and concrete covers of 30, 50 and 70 mm. The finite-element analysis verifies the results from former experimental research, where the crack widths close to the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> are affected only slightly, or not at all, by the concrete cover. This can lead to new possibilities of enlarging the concrete cover and increasing the durability of concrete structures in future...|$|R
2500|$|Along a 50-metre {{length of}} tunnel, the {{normally}} 0.4-metre thick tunnel lining {{was reduced to}} a mean depth of 0.17metres, with the thinnest area being 0.02metres. [...] The chalk marl showed no signs of failing or collapsing but colliery arches were installed as a precaution. Over a 240-metre long section (70metres towards Britain, 170metres towards France), damage to the concrete extended {{as far back as the}} first set of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars.</b> Superficial damage to the surface of the concrete segments was evident along a further 190metres of tunnel length. In the vicinity of the fire, services were destroyed, including high-voltage cables, low-voltage cables, communications, lighting systems, traction and junction boxes over a length of 800metres. Five hundred metres of track had to be replaced, as did 800metres of overhead line, 800metres of refrigeration pipe and signalling equipment over a length of 1,500metres. [...] Four escape cross-passages and five pressure relief ducts had to be refitted with new doors and dampers. The damage was in interval 3. Service through the tunnel restarted using single track working over the parallel interval 4. [...] In a phased re-opening, freight train service was restored on 29 November 1996, followed by Eurostar services on 4 December, and tourist shuttles on 10 December for cars and 6 January 1997 for coaches. Agreement had been reached on the repairs by 24 January 1997. The civil engineering work, repairing the tunnel wall, was completed by the French contractor Freyssinet in 60 days. This was followed by the replacement of the track, overhead line and signalling by Eurotunnel and, completed in less than a month, the tunnel was fully reopened on 15 May 1997.|$|E

40|$|Waste {{material}} disposal {{is considered}} as a difficult issue to adopt in current world. Waste metal, which has been recognised as {{a major problem in}} the environment and resource deficiency, could have important implications in the concrete construction industries. Waste metal utilisation in construction of reinforced cement concrete (RCC) works is immerging in recent time. Construction industries are looking for cost effective structural materials and utilisation of renewable materials. Metal waste such as chips of tin, still and other metal fragments which is abandoned and spread in the environment could be utilize as a replacement of traditional steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> in the RCC. In this experiment, three different types of waste metal have been compared with commercial 40, 60 and 72 graded steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar.</b> Compressive strength class of C 25 concrete was used in the experiment and mechanical properties of concrete incorporating different waste metal were investigated in the first stage.

50|$|Separation strain {{represents}} the strain at which adjacent elements are totally separated at the connecting face. This parameter {{is not available}} in the elastic material model. For concrete, all springs between the adjacent faces including <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> springs are cut. If the elements meet again, they will behave as two different rigid bodies that have now contacted each other. For steel, the bars are cut if the stress point reaches ultimate stress or if the concrete reaches the separation strain.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to be able to calculate how the load-carrying capacity of concrete structures is affected by environmental impacts, not only for assessment of existing structures, but also for design of new constructions. Corrosion of the reinforcement {{is one of the most}} important factors that limits the life time of reinforced concrete structures. When reinforcement corrodes, its volume increases, which in turn causes splitting forces on the surrounding concrete. This can lead to splitting cracks along the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar,</b> which has a strong effect on the bond between the reinforcement and the concrete. The aim with this project was to develop a method to analyse how the load-carrying capacity of concrete structures are affected during their life time, in varying environments. A general model describing the bond, with the effect of corrosion included, was developed and implemented in a commercial finite element program. Furthermore, available models describing shrinkage, creep, and development of strength and stiffness of the concrete were used. The models were used in analyses of several test series found in the literature. A good agreement was found. Thereafter, an overview for different cases was compiled. Furthermore, analyses of how large corrosion penetration that is needed to crack the cover depending on concrete quality, cover, and diameter of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> were carried out, and compiled in a diagram.

40|$|The {{bond between}} ribbed bars and {{concrete}} {{is influenced by}} a number of parameters, such as the strength of the surrounding structure, the occurrence of splitting cracks, and yielding of the reinforcement. A model for three-dimensional analyses was developed earlier by the author, where the splitting stresses of the bond action were included, and the bond stress depended not only on the slip but also on the radial deformation between the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> and the concrete. The bond model, however, was shown to generate energy for some special loadingunloading sequences. This undesirable effect has led to a change in the formulation of the bond model. With the modification as described here, the model becomes equivalent to the Coulomb friction, complemented with the yield function describing the upper limit. Pull-out tests were analysed, using the modified bond model and non-linear fracture mechanics for the concrete. The tests were selected to show various types of failure: pull-out failure, splitting failure, pull-out failure after yielding of the reinforcement, rupture of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar,</b> and cyclic loading. The results show that the modified model is capable of predicting splitting failures, and the loss of bond if the reinforcement is yielding, as well as simulating cyclic loading in a physically reasonable way...|$|R
