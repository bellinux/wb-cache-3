50|$|The New Delhi Railway Station (station code NDLS), {{situated}} between Ajmeri Gate and Paharganj is {{the main}} railway station in Delhi. It is the fourth busiest Railway Station {{in the country in}} terms of frequency of trains after Kanpur Central, Vijayawada Junction and Delhi Junction and most busiest Railway station in India in terms of passenger movement. Around 185 trains starts, ends, or passes through the station daily and handles 500,000 passengers daily with 16 platforms. The New Delhi railway station holds the record for the largest <b>route</b> <b>interlocking</b> system in the world along with the Kanpur Central Railway Station i.e. 48. The station is about two kilometres north of Connaught Place, in central Delhi.|$|E
50|$|Northern Railways {{implemented}} the <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocked</b> system (RRI) at New Delhi Railway Station {{which is a}} modern signaling system for enhancing efficiency and safety in the operations. This <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocked</b> system at New Delhi {{is one of the}} world's largest <b>route</b> relay <b>interlocking</b> system certified by the Guinness Book of Records. Northern Railway is equipped with 40 <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocking</b> systems including the system at Delhi Main.|$|R

5000|$|The Varanasi Cantonment Railway Station has modern <b>Route</b> <b>Interlock</b> System with {{automated}} signalling system. Varanasi {{railway station}} was ranked 14 among 75 busiest A1 category stations on cleanliness scale. The station ranks 30 in overall ranking.Varanasi railway station handles {{large number of}} passengers, with more than 250 trains daily.|$|R
50|$|Station {{has been}} {{equipped}} with new <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocking</b> (RRI) for faster train operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} {{equipped}} with <b>route</b> relay <b>interlocking</b> technology for managing tracks and signalling. The rail yard has 2 washing lines for maintenance or train rakes. It has also got a coach care facility with capacity of 2 coaches.|$|R
50|$|At the Rajendra Nagar Terminal and Patna Junction <b>route</b> relay <b>interlocking</b> (RRI) {{system were}} {{installed}} between 7 February 2012 till 12 February. The presence of RRI system allows computer operated change of tracks for running trains. The presence of RRT system improves {{the safety of}} the railway traffic in the region.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} once {{the eastern end of}} both the Outer Circle line and the Rosstown Railway. In 1975, the signal box was {{provided}} with a <b>route</b> setting power <b>interlocking</b> system, which also included the demolition of signalbox A.|$|R
50|$|Signalling {{systems are}} also being {{upgraded}} by adopting state-of-the-art technology. The semaphore signalling system is being replaced by a colour light signalling system. Use of colour light signals results in better visibility of signalling aspects to the drivers of the running trains and this makes train running safer and operationally more efficient. The interlocking system is also being changed to panel or <b>route</b> relay <b>interlocking.</b> Besides speedier movement of traffic, these up-gradation measures contribute towards increased safety.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} a {{terminal}} station; trains {{must go back}} {{the same way as}} they come. With many trains arriving at the same time platforms are not always available. In case any train is late, the other trains are stopped at Duvvada or Vizianagaram. The <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocking</b> (RRI) system, an arrangement of signal apparatus that prevents conflicting movements through an arrangement of tracks such as junctions or crossings, is reported {{to be one of the}} major causes for these trains being delayed after Duvvada Station.|$|R
30|$|With the aim {{of obtaining}} precise times of the itineraries in the installation, a {{parametric}} model of the section has been implemented using a simulation tool. This tool allows modelling line profile data and track topology as well as rolling stock and the <b>routes</b> for each <b>interlocking</b> of the line.|$|R
40|$|Now a day, {{managing}} the train movement between various stations in a railway division {{has become a}} herculean task involving manual labour and data transfer through phone calls and record entries. The train is needed to be constantly signalled at each station the train crosses by, with the flag master waving the green flag and being reciprocated by the respective guard under duty. The signalling will be {{under the control of}} respective stations but can be signalled only after proper authentication from the Signals & Telecommunication department in a divisional Railway under various Zones. The main objective of our project is to develop a system which automatically defines the signalling of the train on a particular track line automatically by establishing optical sensors at particular intervals along the track length and by taking the feedback from the sensors, the signalling will be done by the logic written in the micro controller programming and a the movement of the trains can be monitored in a display at the <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocking</b> department and the Signals & Telecommunications department. The project highlights the concepts of {{managing the}} trains between stations by developing a simulation through microcontroller with the feedback from the sensors. The project concludes with a real time simulation of the train management system on a LCD in <b>route</b> relay <b>interlocking</b> pane...|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} served by 5 {{platforms}}. Platforms 1, 2 and 3 are used for trains going towards Shoranur, Thrissur and Palakkad Town where as platforms 4 and 5 are mainly used for trains going towards Podanur side. Operational efficiency of Palakkad Railway Junction, which functions as a gateway to Kerala, has improved with the completion of yard remodeling and other modernisation works. The electronic interlocking system, which will replace the prevailing <b>route</b> relay <b>interlocking</b> system, was also completed. The train traffic in the junction will be considerably high once the trains from Pollachi Junction enter here.|$|R
50|$|The Academy has a well {{equipped}} model room displaying {{various types of}} train operating and signaling systems in use on Indian Railways. Trainee Officers get a feel of practical train operations by running working models of trains under a simulated hands-on environment. Model Room has working models of <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocking</b> (RRI), Auxiliary Warning System (AWS), Automatic Block Signaling, Train Activated Warning at Level Crossings, Block Proving by Axle Counters, 4 Aspects Automatic Signal & Data Logger etc. Souvenirs from the National Rail Museum New Delhi are displayed and are also available for sale to trainees.|$|R
50|$|Kolkata metro trains {{operate on}} typical Indian Railways {{automatic}} signalling technology. A <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocking</b> System {{has been provided}} at Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Noapara carshed and are in operation to facilitate the prompt withdrawal and injection of rakes as well as performing shunting operations inside the car shed, required for maintenance purposes. Train Protection & Warning System(TPWS) is provided on the entire stretch of the Metro Railway. This system is designed to prevent collision caused by human (operator) error. Train Describer System and Auto Train Charting have also been provided to help the operartion control centre to monitor and plan train movement on a real time basis.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, the {{signalling}} {{systems were}} rebuilt {{along the entire}} route. Automatic block signaling was established between Salzburg and Freilassing in 1963. In addition, push button relay interlockings were installed in Prien and Bad Endorf stations in 1963. An automatic block system was installed between the two stations on 28 June 1964 for 233,000 Deutsche Marks, making the signalbox at Rimstings station unnecessary. On 14 July 1969 and in the following days, the automated <b>route</b> setting <b>interlocking</b> in Traunstein, the automatic block system between Übersee and Traunstein and the automatic block system between Traunstein and Teisendorf opened. So for 2.092 million Deutsche Marks the personnel at Bergen (Oberbay) and Lauter (Oberbay) were able to be saved. On 11 December 1978, a centralised block was established between Teisendorf and Freilassing, which was controlled by an automated <b>route</b> setting <b>interlocking</b> of the SpDrS60 design. An automatic block system went into operation between Prien am Chiemsee and Übersee on 1 July 1980. Bergen (Oberbay) station was closed to passenger traffic at the same time. An automatic block system was taken into operation between Landl (Oberbay) {{and the start of}} the Rosenheim curve on 21 January 1982. The automatic block system between Landl and Bad Endorf was not opened until 26 November 1985. The entire upgrade between Rosenheim and Bad Endorf cost 4.7 million Deutsche Marks. An electronic interlocking was put into operation at Rosenheim between 19 and 23 November 2003. Electronic interlockings that are controlled from Munich have operated at Bad Endorf and Prien am Chiemsee stations since 2 March 2005.|$|R

40|$|Now a days {{managing}} {{train movement}} between stations in railways has become staggering task which involve human efforts like data transfer through phone. It {{is needed to}} be continuously monitor the trains approaching from neighboring stations, for safe train movement due to high density of trains on a track. Conventionally, station master monitor approaching /departing trains by using <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocking</b> (RRI) system which can monitor trains between station blocks. In this paper a GIS augmented automatic train monitoring (GAATM) system is proposed for station master to monitor approaching/departing trains to/from station. If station master has interest in a specific train, He/she can search and monitor that train in real time. The proposed system is developed in C # and java script using Microsof...|$|R
50|$|Critics {{point out}} that the {{reduction}} in travel time due to speed is a mere three minutes, and other manoeuvrings are largely responsible for the drastic drop. Reduction of timing largely because of shifting the train's departure point from New Delhi railway station to Hazrat Nizamuddin and doing away with the scheduled stop at Mathura reportedly account for a saving of 14 minutes, limiting the locomotive to 10 coaches - Bhopal Shatabdi has 14 - leads to a decrement of another two minutes, approximately five minutes are being saved on account of track improvements and superior infrastructure, three minutes owing to <b>route</b> relay <b>interlocking</b> at Agra, and one minute each on approval to run a passenger train on the third line at Palwal and Bhuteshwar, installation of thick web switches at four points and in putting up a track station at Chhata.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{broadcast}} communication {{in consideration of}} the refuge direction, pays its attention to direction selection in refuge early stages, and confirms experimentally influences, which broadcast has on refuge. Contents of broadcast consisted of “information without specific directions of refuge direction” and “information with specific directions of refuge direction”. Based on results of the experiments, following things became clear. Residents have an appropriate tendency to take refuge, when broadcasting contents included “information in considering of clue in decision on refuge direction”. Properly refuge was greatly related to easy to walk, safety in street environment, and good view from crease bend point. When sign guidance and <b>route</b> guidance <b>interlock,</b> {{it is easy to}} take refuge. From the above knowledge, this study clarified that “information in considering of clue in decision on refuge direction” is taken disaster prevention broadcasting into consideration on initial refuge.

50|$|Additional BCMs (data radios) {{located at}} {{interlockings}} transmit {{information relating to}} absolute Stop signal indications and any speed restrictions pertaining to the train's <b>route</b> through said <b>interlocking.</b> Speed information acquired in this fashion will be displayed on the ACSES speed readout to supplement any speed {{information provided by the}} cab signaling system. After a positive stop the data radios will also transmit information releasing the train from the stop when track conditions permit. Such information about the status of the track occupancy, switch position, signal indication, {{and a host of other}} vital inputs—is accumulated by wayside encoders, such as a Safetran VIU-ACSES (see photo to the right), before being sent to the BCMs for transmission to locomotives.|$|R
25|$|At {{switches}} {{entering into}} pocket tracks {{in a direction}} reverse to the normal operating direction, there is a “P Signal”. The P Signal is a single lunar signal that displays the letter “P” and is found {{at the entrance to}} some but not all pocket tracks and other selected main line interlockings in the reverse direction of the normal flow of traffic. Below the P signal on the same post is a punch box to allow the train operator to manually set the switch to the diverting direction (reverse) when the P Signal is lit. The P signal is only lit when a train occupies the two track circuit approaching the P Signal and all possible <b>routes</b> into the <b>interlocking</b> are not occupied.|$|R
50|$|What made CTC {{machines}} {{different from}} standard interlocking machines and ABS {{was that the}} vital interlocking hardware was located at the remote location and the CTC machine only displayed track state and sent commands to the remote locations. A command to display a signal would require the remote interlocking to set the flow of traffic and check for a clear <b>route</b> through the <b>interlocking.</b> If a command could not be carried out due to the interlocking logic, the display would not change on the CTC machine. This system provided the same degree flexibility that the manual traffic control has before it, but without the cost and complexity associated with providing a manned operator {{at the end of}} every route segment. This was especially true for lightly used lines that could never hope to justify so much overhead.|$|R

40|$|Marshalling yards {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of every railway infrastructure. Means of mechanization and automation are being built to achieve as efficient forming of freight trains as possible. Modern, fully automatic systems based on extensive utilization of computers are being implemented. Their main function is to make freight trains into unit trains and divided according to their destinations. One part of these systems is responsible for automatic routing of coupled or isolated cars through the ladder. The other part automatically regulates by retarders the speed of the cars on their way into the destination tracks in the classification bowl. The state-of-the-art marshalling systems provide not only these basic automation functions. They offer also setting <b>interlocked</b> <b>routes</b> with a level of safety integrity SIL 3.

5000|$|The {{principle}} of mixed level signalling {{is based on}} simple principles using bi-directional data exchange between the Radio Block Centre (RBC) and the interlocking systems. The operator sets a route and {{does not need to}} know if the route will be used for a Level NTC (former LSTM) only or a Level 2-equipped train. A route is locked based on the national principles by the interlocking system and the RBC is informed about the routes set. The RBC checks whether it is possible to allocate a train to the route and then informs the interlocking system that a train is allocated to the <b>route.</b> The <b>interlocking</b> system shows the ETCS white bar aspect to all signals along the route including the signal {{at the end of the}} route and sends no ATB-EG code to the track. The RBC sends a movement authority to the train if a Level 2 train is allocated to the route. Otherwise the signal shows the optical proceed aspect and the related ATB-EG code is sent to the track. As soon as a Level 2 train reports itself in rear of a route currently assigned for optical authorisation (e.g. after start of mission procedure or when the driver changes level from Level NTC to Level 2), the optical authorisation is automatically upgraded to a Level 2 movement authority. Consequently, a Level 2 movement authority is downgraded to an optical authorisation after a predefined time-out if the driver closes the cab or a fault is detected that restricts the movement authority (e.g. if the GSM-R radio coverage is unavailable.) ...|$|R
50|$|Entrance-Exit Interlocking (NX) was the {{original}} brand name {{of the first generation}} relay-based centralized traffic control (CTC) interlocking system introduced in 1936 by GRS (represented in Europe by Metropolitan-Vickers). The advent of all electric interlocking technology allowed for more automated route setting procedures as opposed to having an operator line each part of the route manually. The NX system allowed an operator looking at the diagram of a complicated junction to simply push a button on the known entrance track and another button on the desired exit track, and the logic circuitry handled all the necessary actions of commanding the underlying relay interlocking to set signals and throw switches in the proper sequence as required to provide valid <b>route</b> through the <b>interlocking</b> plant. The first NX installation was in 1937 at Brunswick on the Cheshire Lines, UK. The first US installation was on the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) at Girard Junction, Ohio in 1937. Another NYCRR installation was on the main line between Utica, New York and Rochester, New York, and this was quickly followed up by three installations on the New York City Subway's IND Fulton Street Line in 1948.|$|R
40|$|Nature {{achieves}} impressively {{strong and}} selective complexation of small molecule anions through the elaborate binding sites of sophisticated proteins. Inspired by these examples, {{we have developed}} an anion templation strategy for the synthesis of mechanically interlocked host structures for anion recognition applications. Upon removal of the discrete anionic templating species, such host systems possess unique, three-dimensional, geometrically restrained cavities containing convergent hydrogen bond donor atoms. Such structures exhibit high affinity binding selectivity toward complementary anions. This Account describes recent advances in this anion templation meth odology, demonstrating the versatility and scope of this approach, and progressing to more diverse architectures. Specifically, we have prepared an expansive range of interlocked hosts with enhanced anion recognition properties, {{such as the ability}} to operate effectively in competitive aqueous media. We have produced these structures through the utilization of a new anion templated amide condensation synthetic method and through the incorporation of a range of different anion binding motifs, such as groups capable of effective solution-phase halogen bonding interactions. Importantly, direct comparisons between halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding systems reveal impressively magnified anion recognition properties for halogen bonding interlocked host systems. We have also employed the anion templation strategy successfully to construct selective electrochemical and luminescent anion sensors, as well as architectures of increasing complexity, such as a triply interlocked capsule and a handcuff catenane. The synthesis of these latter examples presents greater challenges; however, such molecules offer additional applications in higher order recognition and sensing and in switchable molecular devices. Having established anion templation as a viable synthetic <b>route</b> to <b>interlocked</b> architectures, we have used this strategy to fabricate a multitude of innovative structures. The key principles of this approach are the ability of anionic species to template the association of carefully designed components, and of the resulting molecular framework with its interlocked host cavity to display impressive anion recognition selectivity. Mechanically interlocked structures have numerous potential applications in nanotechnology. Therefore, the continuing development of effective synthetic methods, especially those which yield functional systems, is of great interest in the broad interdisciplinary field of supramolecular chemistry...|$|R
