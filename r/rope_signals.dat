50|$|Huck {{challenged}} Steve Cunningham on December 29, 2007 for {{his first}} world title, the IBF Cruiserweight title. After eleven hard fought and exhausting rounds, the twelfth begun; Cunningham was landing hard shots as Huck kept moving forward. Following a rough clinch between the two, Cunningham landed a vicious straight right counter, the fighters clinched and Huck fell. Once he was back on his feet, Huck walked back against the <b>ropes</b> <b>signalling</b> that the shot had hurt him and Cunningham went straight in for the attack. For {{the remainder of the}} round, Cunningham chased his German counterpart across the ring hitting him with a barrage of hard shots which ended when Huck's corner threw in the towel and ended the beating.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} the trams were {{extended}} to Sk√∏yen, 1001-1005 and 1021-1023 were equipped with radios. All of the trams had a conductor, which communicated with the driver with electric bells and pulling of a <b>rope.</b> One <b>signal</b> meant [...] "clear", two means [...] "backwards" [...] and three meant [...] "stop".|$|R
25|$|There are {{emergency}} signals {{usually associated}} with wet and closed bell diving by which the surface and bellman can exchange {{a limited amount of}} information which may be critical to the safety of the divers. These signals are not generally applicable to a diver who is supplied directly by umbilical from the surface, but if the umbilical is snagged and <b>rope</b> <b>signals</b> cannot be transmitted, these signals may be provided by hat light flashes and helmet flush.|$|E
25|$|These are {{generally}} used in conditions of low visibility where a diver {{is connected to}} another person, either another diver or a tender on the surface, by a rope. These {{date back to the}} time of the use of Standard diving dress. Some of these signals, or pre-arranged variants, can be used with a surface marker buoy. The diver pulls down on the buoy line to make the buoy bob in an equivalent pattern to the rope signal. Effective <b>rope</b> <b>signals</b> need a free line without much slack, Before attempting a rope signal, the slack must be taken up, and the line pulled firmly. Most signals are acknowledged by returning the same signal, which shows that it was received accurately. Persistent failure to acknowledge may indicate a serious problem and should be resolved as a matter of urgency. There are several systems in use, and it is necessary to have agreement between diver and tender before the dive.|$|E
25|$|A {{buddy line}} is a line or strap {{physically}} tethering two scuba divers together underwater to avoid separation in low visibility conditions. A buddy line is usually a short length of about 2 meters with a floating element between the divers {{to reduce the risk}} of snagging on the bottom. A buddy {{line is a}} means of communication and does not need to be very strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads while in use. The divers may communicate by <b>rope</b> <b>signals,</b> but will more usually just use the line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a buddy line is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. The divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency which may be done by using a quick release mechanism or by cutting the line, both of which require at least one hand to be free. A velcro strap requires no tools for release and can be released under tension.|$|E
50|$|In 1775, Charles Spalding, an Edinburgh confectioner, {{improved}} on Halley's {{design by}} adding a system of balance-weights to ease the raising and lowering of the bell, along {{with a series of}} <b>ropes</b> for <b>signaling</b> the surface crew. Spalding and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson, later suffocated off the coast of Dublin in 1783 doing salvage work in a diving bell of Spalding's design.|$|R
60|$|A smaller circle, of {{some thirty}} yards in diameter, was kept round the shaft, and within this only those {{directing}} the operations {{were allowed to}} enter. Mr. Hardinge {{and one of the}} local managers took their places in the cage. The rope was held by twenty men, who at first stood at its full length from the shaft, and then advanced at a walk towards it, thus allowing the cage to descend steadily and easily, without jerks. As they came close to the shaft the <b>signal</b> <b>rope</b> was shaken; another step or two, slowly and carefully taken, and the rope was seen to sway slightly. The cage was {{at the bottom of the}} shaft. Three minutes' pause, the <b>signal</b> <b>rope</b> shook, and the men with the end of the rope, started again to walk from the shaft.|$|R

After the two thieves climbed up on the rich man's roof, Uncle Ston pa lowered the other man through the smoke hole. The thief put some treasures in a bag, tied it {{to the end of the}} <b>rope,</b> and <b>signaled</b> Uncle Ston pa by tugging the rope.

60|$|The man's {{object was}} to dive {{through the first}} wave. If he could manage this--and the second--the rest would not be beyond {{the power of a}} strong man. A third time he leaped into the rushing flood, and this time was successful. Soon he stood panting {{on the deck of the}} {{stranded}} vessel, almost unable to stand, and well he knew that there was not a moment to lose, for the ship was going to pieces! Jack Matterby, however, knew well what to do. He drew out the hawser of the rocket apparatus, fixed the various <b>ropes,</b> and <b>signalled</b> to those on shore to send out the sling life-buoy, and then the men of the coastguard began to haul the passengers and crew ashore, one at a time.|$|R

50|$|The {{prevailing}} {{diving bell}} design in 1775 {{was that of}} Dr. Edmond Halley (1656-1742), who had computed the orbit of the comet named for him. Using his background in mechanics, Spalding read every book he could find {{on the design of}} Halley's diving bell, eventually proceeding to trial dives in the port of Leith, Dunbar Bay and at Dundee. Based on these trials, Spalding determined that Halley's design had weaknesses that added unnecessary risk to the divers. To correct the deficiencies, Spalding added a system of balance-weights to ease the raising and lowering of the bell, along with a series of <b>ropes</b> for <b>signalling</b> the surface crew. The redesigned diving bell weighed 200 lb and could accommodate two divers. Spalding also added ropes inside in the bell as seats and thick glass windows to admit light.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{method of}} communication between diver and surface was by pull signals on the lifeline, and these remain a useful emergency backup system.

He was to be {{at the far end of}} the tunnel where a temporary underground hatch had been built, he was to remove the hatch and break through the earth providing the escape route. When the tunnel was found to be a little short of the tree line he is credited as the man who quickly came up with the scheme to use a length of <b>rope</b> to <b>signal</b> when the German guards were clear and men should emerge from the trap door and run to the cover of the woods.|$|R

50|$|Immunity Challenge: The two tribes would {{select a}} swimmer {{to receive a}} tanker out in the water. The catch was that the team would have to unravel a large rope that was {{connected}} to the swimmer, so that they could go out to receive the tanker. Once at the tanker, the swimmer would attach it to the tribe's <b>rope,</b> giving a <b>signal</b> for them to pull it to dry land. Once the tanker is up on dry land and pulled far enough inland, they could use it to obtain a key to unlock a lever. Pulling the lever would raise the tribe's flag. First tribe to raise their flag wins Immunity.|$|R

60|$|For {{a minute}} or two there was a sharp pain as the blood began to rush into the fingers, and when this passed off their hands were in a glow. Hector took the rope, lowered himself over the parapet, and then began to descend. When halfway down the {{darkness}} became more intense than before, and {{he knew that he was}} now below the level of the outer wall. When he reached the ground he shook the <b>rope</b> as a <b>signal,</b> and then, stretching his arms before him, crossed the lane. It was but a step, for the house stood but five feet back from the wall. He waited until Paolo joined him, then he drew on the thin rope and, to his satisfaction, he felt it yield.|$|R

5000|$|An inquest into Spalding's and Watson's deaths was {{eventually}} held. The causes reviewed during the hearings varied from the negligence of the dive ship's captain, equipment failure, including tangled <b>signal</b> <b>ropes</b> or {{the failure of}} the final cask of air reaching the divers, diver error, putrified air from the rotting cargo of the Belgioso, even sabotage and alcohol. Dive experts today think the most plausible explanation is [...] "a highly noxious effluvia entering the bell which could have come from the putrifying bodies or even the rotting cargo of ginseng plants in the cargo hold." [...] This theory is consistent with the observation that they made no apparent attempt to make an emergency ascent. The exact cause of death of Spalding and Watson is unknown.|$|R
50|$|Loss {{of voice}} {{communications}} {{is not a}} directly life-threatening situation, but the risk {{of not being able}} to deal with an emergency is greatly increased as the surface team is unable to monitor the condition of the diver effectively and the diver is severely limited in the ability to communicate a problem to the backup personnel, reducing the chances of prompt response in an emergency. The diver will generally communicate the problem to the surface by <b>rope</b> <b>signals</b> and abort the dive.|$|E

6000|$|It was gray, harsh, easterly weather, {{the swell}} ran pretty high, {{and out in}} the open there were [...] "skipper's daughters," [...] when I found myself at last on the diver's platform, twenty pounds of lead upon each foot and my whole person swollen with ply and ply of woollen underclothing. One moment, the salt wind was {{whistling}} round my night-capped head; the next, I was crushed almost double {{under the weight of the}} helmet. As that intolerable burthern was laid upon me, I could have found it in my heart (only for shame's sake) to cry off from the whole enterprise. But it was too late. The attendants began to turn the hurdy-gurdy, and the air to whistle through the tube; some one screwed in the barred window of the vizor; and I was cut off in a moment from my fellow-men; standing there in their midst, but quite divorced from intercourse: a creature deaf and dumb, pathetically looking forth upon them from a climate of his own. Except that I could move and feel, I was like a man fallen in a catalepsy.
