5|$|Vytautas became duke of Hrodna and Podlaskie; Jogaila known now by his Christian name Władysław II (Władysław II Jagiełło) {{designated}} {{his brother}} Skirgaila regent in Lithuania. Skirgaila, who also ruled Vytautas' patrimony in Trakai, was disliked by the Lithuanian nobility. Vytautas, {{on the other}} hand, became increasingly popular; Władysław II began {{to see him as}} a rival. Vytautas was supported by Lithuanians who <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> Polish interpretation of the recent Union of Krewo. These Lithuanians wished to maintain distinct legal structures and reserve official posts for Lithuanians. The Lithuanian elites also <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> changes in government that king Władysław II implemented there.|$|E
5|$|Although Operation Backstop {{was within}} the UNPROFOR mandate (since the peacekeepers were {{authorised}} {{to use force to}} prevent armed incursions into the UNPAs), Croatian authorities <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> operation. Croatia considered the UNPROFOR overzealous in defending the UNPAs and protecting the Serbs while failing to ensure the fulfilment of other aspects of the Vance plan, such as the return of refugees to their homes.|$|E
5|$|Many Cossacks {{were being}} hired to {{participate}} in wars waged by the Commonwealth. This status resulted in privileges and often constituted a form of social upward mobility; the Cossacks <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> periodic reductions in their enrollment. Cossack rebellions or uprisings typically assumed the form of huge plebeian social movements.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am no man's lackey," [...] {{answered}} <b>the</b> other hotly, <b>resenting</b> <b>the</b> imputation--and <b>resenting</b> it <b>the</b> {{more because}} of the truth in it.|$|R
5000|$|Regular {{educators}} may <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> missing of important classwork.|$|R
60|$|The child drew herself up, <b>resenting</b> <b>the</b> indignity of the address.|$|R
5|$|The decades {{running up}} to 1381 were a rebellious, troubled period. London was a {{particular}} locus of unrest, and {{the activities of the}} city's politically active guilds and fraternities often alarmed the authorities. Londoners <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> expansion of the royal legal system in the capital, in particular the increased role of the Marshalsea Court in Southwark, which had begun to compete with the city authorities for judicial power in London. The city's population also <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> presence of foreigners, Flemish weavers in particular. Londoners detested John of Gaunt because he was a supporter of the religious reformer John Wycliffe, whom the London public regarded as a heretic. John of Gaunt was also engaged in a feud with the London elite and was rumoured to be planning to replace the elected mayor with a captain, appointed by the Crown. The London elite were themselves fighting out a vicious, internal battle for political power. As a result, in 1381 the ruling classes in London were unstable and divided.|$|E
5|$|The family <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> Russian government's Russification policies. Young Józef profoundly disliked {{having to}} attend Russian Orthodox Church service and left school with an aversion {{not only for}} the Russian Tsar and the Russian Empire, but for the culture, which he knew well.|$|E
5|$|In 1529 {{the king}} summoned Parliament {{to deal with}} annulment, thus {{bringing}} together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what form it should take; it {{became known as the}} Reformation Parliament. There were Common lawyers who <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> privileges of the clergy to summon laity to their courts; there were those who had been influenced by Lutheran evangelicalism and were hostile to the theology of Rome; Thomas Cromwell was both. Henry's Chancellor, Thomas More, successor to Wolsey, also wanted reform: he wanted new laws against heresy.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not speak}} for a moment, and I thought she was <b>resenting</b> <b>the</b> question.|$|R
60|$|Dick was too {{thankful for}} {{the sound of her voice}} to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> tone of it.|$|R
5000|$|Nathan's Best Friend (Eric Wilhite) <b>resents</b> <b>the</b> {{amount of}} time Nathan spends on Alice and Andrew's project.|$|R
5|$|Jaws {{won three}} Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound (Robert Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery and John Carter). It was also {{nominated}} for Best Picture, losing to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Spielberg greatly <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that he}} was not nominated for Best Director. Along with the Oscar, John Williams's score won the Grammy Award, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music, and the Golden Globe Award. To her Academy Award, Verna Fields added the American Cinema Editors' Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young children {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> repression of Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E
5|$|McCormick {{increasingly}} <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> favours FitzRoy gave {{to assist}} Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame {{that they could}} be killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets in a second small boat. That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-Neptune, and in the morning they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.|$|E
60|$|MR. ROBERTS (unable to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> {{patronage}} of this suggestion). Well, I don't know but I will.|$|R
25|$|Those {{who stayed}} began to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> Barzani Kurds, {{as they had}} to share their {{resources}} with them.|$|R
60|$|But I did not {{outwardly}} <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> sailor's words, {{for that}} would have only made the matter worse.|$|R
5|$|The Byzantine {{emperors}} {{appealed to}} the West for help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid {{in return for a}} reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the See of Rome. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> authority of Rome and the Latin Rite. Some Western troops arrived to bolster the Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to {{also join the}} Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they {{saw no reason to}} join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so different from their own organization, which had grown over the last two hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution, Prokofiev left Russia {{with the}} {{official}} blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly Lunacharsky, and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, pianist and conductor. During that time he married a Spanish singer, Carolina Codina, {{with whom he had}} two sons. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev's ballets and operas to be staged in America and western Europe. Prokofiev, who regarded himself as composer foremost, <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> time taken by touring as a pianist, and increasingly turned to Soviet Russia for commissions of new music; in 1936 he finally returned to his homeland with his family. He enjoyed some success there – notably with Lieutenant Kijé, Peter and the Wolf, Romeo and Juliet, and perhaps above all with Alexander Nevsky.|$|E
60|$|Inez only laughed bitterly, {{but did not}} <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> words. Why should she? It was {{not worth}} while.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Labia pride {{movement}} <b>resents</b> <b>the</b> {{ideals of}} female cosmetic genital surgeries: The Muff March in London, 2011 ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come!' {{she said}} quietly to Siegmund, no longer <b>resenting</b> <b>the</b> {{completeness}} of his happiness, which left her unnecessary to him.|$|R
5|$|As {{the first}} {{settlers}} of the municipality, the Islanders {{and their descendants}} were designated hidalgos. The established settlers <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> Islanders for their new titles and exclusive privileges within the city government. The newcomers {{did not know how}} to handle horses, rendering them useless in mounted warfare against the Apaches. Unlike the established settlers, who relied on ranching, the Islanders were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage and the need for closer economic ties had helped to alleviate some of the infighting, and the original settlers were given permission to serve as magistrates and council members.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} Breckinridge had {{supported}} both Pierce and Douglas before endorsing his nomination. Relations {{between the two}} were further strained when, upon asking for a private interview with Buchanan, Breckinridge was told {{to come to the}} White House and ask for Harriet Lane, who acted as the mansion's host for the unmarried president. Feeling slighted by the response, Breckinridge refused to carry out these instructions; later, three of Buchanan's intimates informed Breckinridge that requesting to speak to Miss Lane was actually a secret instruction to White House staff to usher the requestor into a private audience with the president. They also conveyed Buchanan's apologies for the misunderstanding.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he wanted him to do so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
60|$|His Lordship smiled, bowed graciously if unsteadily to me, and did {{not appear}} to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> pleasantry. Then he sighed.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Drane {{looked a}} little anxiously at La Fleur, but the cook did not in <b>the</b> least <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> remark.|$|R
5000|$|... "Is it {{the purpose}} of the {{movement}} to try to assert sexual rights for everyone or create a political and social cult out of homosexuality?.... Persons who perform homosexual acts or other non-conforming acts are sexually free. They want others enlightened. They want hostile laws changed, but they <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> attempt to organize their lives around homosexuality just as much as they <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> centuries-old attempt to organize their lives around heterosexuality.|$|R
5|$|Dissenting {{religious}} practitioners also widely <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> treatment {{they received}} from the Lutheran State Church through the Conventicle Act. Conflicts between local worshipers and the new churches were most explosive in the countryside, where dissenting pietist groups were more active, and were more directly under the eye of local law enforcement and the parish priest. Before non-Lutheran churches were granted toleration in 1809, clampdowns on illegal forms of worship and teaching often provoked whole groups of pietists to leave together, intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land. The largest contingent of such dissenters, 1,500 followers of Eric Jansson, left in the late 1840s and founded a community in Bishop Hill, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Finucane had {{completed}} 108 fighter operations over France {{by the fourth}} week of June 1942. On 27 June, Leigh-Mallory, {{with the approval of}} Sholto Douglas, promoted Finucane to wing commander. Finucane became the youngest wing commander in the RAF, and was to lead the Hornchurch Wing. Duncan Smith later said, that though he admired Finucane, he <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> young fighter pilot's appointment and felt as an older, experienced leader, he could have led the wing himself. Duncan Smith also felt the press gave the young pilot too much attention. Nevertheless, the two maintained a cordial relationship. In his short time as wing commander of Hornchurch, Finucane made a few alterations to the formation. The most notable was to tighten flying discipline, loosen formation flying and increase low-level navigation skills.|$|E
5|$|For most of Scott's {{tenure as}} governor, {{tensions}} between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated. Sentiment {{in favor of a}} U.S. declaration of war against the British was particularly strong in Kentucky. Most Kentuckians <b>resented</b> <b>the</b> replacement of the Embargo Act of 1807 with the weaker Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 and Macon's Bill Number 2. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay became the acknowledged leader of the war hawks in Congress. During an address to the General Assembly on December 4, 1810, Scott expressed little hope of peacefully resolving U.S. grievances against Great Britain. He reminded the General Assembly, however, that France had also violated the United States' maritime rights and urged equal treatment of the two countries for their offenses.|$|E
5000|$|Many self-professed vampires {{actively}} <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> term [...] "lifestylers", as {{it tends}} to carry the connotation that vampirism is not real.|$|R
60|$|Kirk {{was far too}} {{grateful}} to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> slightly unflattering note a more spirited man might have detected in the remark.|$|R
5000|$|A French {{young woman}} <b>resents</b> <b>the</b> {{negative}} effects of urbanisation and makes up a fantastic strange creature which dwells in a forest.|$|R
