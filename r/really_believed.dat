Former congressman Voorhis dubbed himself [...] "the first victim of the Nixon-Chotiner formula for political success". Democrats labeled him a master of dirty tricks who ruthlessly destroyed Douglas's political career by intimating that she was soft on communism. Chotiner's son Kenneth later stated, [...] "I think he <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> [...] was evil... He would equate a liberal or a Democrat with a communist." [...] Chotiner himself said of the campaign against Douglas, [...] "We only stated the facts. The interpretation of the facts was the prerogative of the electorate." ...|$|E

500|$|After the 1983–84 season, Olajuwon {{debated whether}} {{to stay in}} college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time (before the NBA Draft Lottery was {{introduced}} in 1985), the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> that Houston {{was going to win}} the coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so I had to make that decision (to leave early)." [...] His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon was considered the top amateur prospect in the summer of 1984 over fellow collegians and future NBA stars Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton, and was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.|$|E

500|$|Although he lingers nostalgically on {{his memory}} of the great actress Sarah Siddons's {{performance}} as Lady Macbeth, {{and a few years}} earlier had acknowledged that Kean and John Kemble had been at least partly successful in the role of Macbeth (though each in different portions of it), on the whole he expressed doubts about the success of the staging of this play, again agreeing with Lamb. [...] By the time he composed this chapter of Characters, he could write, [...] "We can conceive [...] no one to play Macbeth properly, or to look like a man that had encountered the Weïrd Sisters." [...] Further observations follow about the witches themselves. Part of the problem was that by his day, there remained few who <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> in the supernatural, and [...] "by the force of the police and of philosophy [...] the ghosts in Shakespear will become obsolete." [...] He concludes by quoting at length a passage from an essay by Lamb on the originality of Shakespeare's portrayal of the witches.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{critical}} and commercial breakthrough of her third studio album Control (1986), Jackson was motivated {{to take a}} larger role in her album's creative process. According to Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits (2002), A Records requested she record an album similar to Control. It was rumored that label executives suggested a concept album entitled Scandal, which would have centered around her personal and family life. However, Jam later denied the claim that Scandal was ever suggested, although he confirmed there was encouragement to produce a [...] "Control II." [...] Jackson opposed the idea of a direct sequel to Control, stating [...] "that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to do something that I <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> in and that I really felt strong about." [...] She was initially criticized for choosing to dedicate the album's theme to social consciousness, but remained resolute in her commitment to the concept. Jam stated that her inspiration for the album's theme came primarily from watching CNN and other news sources. In particular, her reaction to the Stockton playground murders led to recording [...] "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)", [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] and [...] "State of the World".|$|E

500|$|Atwell {{referred}} to Carter's relationship with Jarvis as the series' comic relief, while Fazekas called their relationship [...] "the center {{relationship of the}} show". Executive producer Tara Butters compared the relationship to that of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in the early seasons of The X-Files, where [...] "you <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> they cared about each other but it wasn’t sexual. That was very refreshing." [...] Fazekas discussed giving Jarvis a major character arc in the second season, saying that he [...] "really got a taste for adventure with Peggy in the first season, so, when she comes back into his life, he's so happy because he's so bored with being Howard Stark's butler ... what that starts is a really interesting story for him, which is, how much did he really understand about what Peggy does? For him, it's like a fun diversion, even though he's in danger ... we will see in Jarvis' story how he grows to understand that and where he comes out in the end. It will have a cost for him, and it {{will have an impact}} on his relationship with Peggy".|$|E
500|$|However, several {{critics were}} more {{positive}} towards the show. A number of publications welcomed {{the show as}} [...] "guilty pleasure", including The Huffington Post, The Atlantic, and The Week. Tim Stack, writing for Entertainment Weekly, described the reality series as: [...] "my favorite little slice of reality TV spongecake." [...] Lauren Le Vine of Refinery29 appreciated {{the success of the}} family which [...] "achieved the American dream of making something out of nothing," [...] using the given platform. Libby Hill of The A.V. Club also acknowledged the show's success and said: [...] "Keeping Up With The Kardashians gives us real, joyous, ugly, unsavory, hilarious life, with all the polished sitcom trappings. And though the latter may have launched a multimedia empire, the former has made it last". Maura Kelly of The Guardian evaluated the aftermath of the failed wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries, which was documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and subsequently caused public outrage, including an online protest petition to cancel the show. [...] "Since Kim doesn't exactly seem to be an exemplar of self-awareness, I suppose it's possible that she <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> she and Humphries would live happily ever after," [...] Kelly speculated whether or not the marriage was a publicity stunt. [...] "But more likely, she and E! are laughing {{all the way to the}} bank [...] 10.5 million viewers tuned into [...] "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event", after all," [...] Kelly summarized the controversy. Josh Duboff, writing for Vanity Fair, commented on the show's long run and said that [...] "it is near impossible to argue that their continued relevance, 10 years later, is anything other than awe-inspiring and remarkable".|$|E
500|$|Cukor {{himself was}} highly {{dissatisfied}} by the film. [...] "I suspect {{the story was}} basically fraudulent," [...] he told an interviewer. Like many critics, he felt that [...] "as a piece of storytelling, the unfolding of a mystery, {{the first half of}} Keeper of the Flame is a damn good show", {{but the rest of the}} film had substantial problems. He praised Spencer Tracy's work, saying: [...] "Tracy... was at his best in the picture. Subdued, cool, he conveyed the ruthlessness of the reporter sent to investigate Forrest's death without seeming to try. He was ideally cast in the role, grimly and skeptically exploring the secret of the dead boys' club hero who was in fact a rampant fascist." [...] Hepburn, he felt, was hindered by the role and her approach to it. [...] "It was Kate's last romantic glamour-girl part, and she acted with some of that artificiality she'd supposedly left behind at RKO. That first scene, floating into a room in yards and yards of draperies with these lillies—well, it was all far, far too much. I don't think I <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> in the story, it was pure hokeypokey, and her part was phony, highfalutin." [...] He particularly disliked Hepburn's entrance in the film, with the long dress and lillies. But he felt Hepburn did her best: [...] "That's awfully tricky isn't it? And doesn't she give long, piercing looks at his portrait over the mantel? Well. I think she finally carried a slightly phony part because her humanity asserted itself, and her humor. They always did." [...] Overall, though, Cukor felt the film was leaden, and that it had [...] "a wax work quality". Even screenwriter Stewart eventually came to feel the film was [...] "tedious, wooden, and heavy-handed".|$|E

500|$|Following the {{commercial}} and critical success of her 1986 album, Control, Jackson was motivated to continue songwriting and took {{a larger role in}} the creative production of her new album. Executives at A requested that she expand on the ideas presented on Control, suggesting a concept album entitled Scandal that would have been about the Jackson family. She wrote a song titled [...] "You Need Me" [...] which was directed at her father Joseph, but was unwilling to devote an entire album to the subject and substituted her own concept for theirs. She commented that [...] " [...] lot of people wanted me to do another album like Control and that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to do something [...] that I <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> in and that I really felt strong about." [...] The concept of Rhythm Nation emerged as Jackson was a TV watcher, [...] "We would watch BET, MTV... then switched over to CNN, and there'd always be something messed-up happening. It was never good news, always bad news", producer James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris recalled. [...] "State of the World" [...] was one of these songs, influenced by TV and news. Jam recalled that with the song, they were trying to do something like Marvin Gaye's song [...] "What's Going On" [...] although we never could hope to achieve that, but still wanted to make people aware of what was happening in a way they could dance to it. Released on February 6, 1991, [...] "State of the World" [...] was the eighth and the final single of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814. The record label reckoned that they would boost album sales with a radio-only promotion.|$|E
