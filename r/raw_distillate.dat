50|$|In the DC One Million crossover, {{the year}} is 85,271. On the planet IAI, an entity known as RYDR senses a {{disturbance}} that may unravel all that is and transforms into its other, {{the sum total of}} collective unreason, shamanic avatar and <b>raw</b> <b>distillate</b> of madness known as The Creeper. The trail leads to present day Jack Ryder, who was tired of being a superhero. Jack and The Creeper became separate parts of each other, actual living beings. After The Creeper side kept splitting into bizarre and dangerous alternate Creepers each representing a different part of The Creeper's personality, Jack realized that whether he liked it or not, the Creeper was a part of him. The future Creeper ingested all the alternate Creepers, but realizing the truth of the event, he returned them to the original Creeper and told him and Jack Ryder to remerge, and The Creeper was reborn. The future Creeper returns to IAI with the last remaining alternate Creeper, the one representing self-loathing, which he disposes of before transforming back into RYDR to catalogue the event.|$|E
40|$| Material and methods. Sugar {{beet pulp}} and thick juice, as a semi product from sugar beet, were fermented. The {{efficiency}} of the process was assessed using two Saccharomyces cerevisiae preparations &ndash; Ethanol Red, Fermiol. Fermentation was run for 72 h at 30 &deg;C. Quality of produced <b>raw</b> <b>distillates</b> was evaluated using the GC method. |$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this DOE-funded effort is to develop {{continuous}} processes for solvent extraction of coal {{for the production of}} carbon products. These carbon products include materials used in metals smelting, especially in the aluminum and steel industries, as well as porous carbon structural material referred to as ''carbon foam'' and carbon fibers. The Hydrotreatment Facility is being prepared for trials with coal liquids. <b>Raw</b> coal tar <b>distillate</b> trials have been carried out by heating coal tar in the holding tank in the Hydrotreatment Facility. The liquids are centrifuged to warm the system up in preparation for the coal liquids. The coal tar distillate is then recycled to keep the centrifuge hot. In this way, the product has been distilled such that a softening point of approximately 110 C is reached. Then an ash test is conducted...|$|R
40|$|The {{separation}} in a batch {{vacuum column}} {{of the essential}} oil of common juniper berries (Juniperus communis L., from {{the southern part of}} Serbia) was analyzed. The main goal of the analyzed separation process was to isolate several fractions from the essential oil which mainly contained α-pinene, sabinene and myrcene. These compounds contain about 65 mass% of the essential oil produced by hydrodistillation from the juniper berries originated from the southern part of Serbia. The results of experimental work in a laboratory column with 36 theoretical stages under vacuum (8. 0 - 3. 35 kPa) was simulated using Aspen software, and a proposed mathematical model was used to analyze some other operating conditions for fractionation of juniper berry’s oil (number of plates: 25, 36 and 45 and reflux ratio: 2 - 10). According to the results of performed simulations, the most acceptable separation procedure which takes into account the prices of <b>raw</b> materials and <b>distillate</b> (α-pinene) as well as consumed energy was proposed...|$|R
