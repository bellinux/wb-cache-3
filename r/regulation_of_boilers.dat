40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} a method for multi-parametric output <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> a gasification <b>boiler</b> especially designed for heating or for hot water heating in buildings. A new method <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> is offered, namely more parametric regulation via proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers that are capable of controlling the calculated values of pressure, temperature and fan speed. These values of pressure, temperature and fan speed are calculated in a completely new way, and calculations of setpoints for determination of optimal parameters lead to an increase in boilers efficiency and power output. Results of measurements show that changes at the mouth of the stack draft due atmospheric influences occur in times with high intensity and high frequency, while power parameters, or boiler power output amplitudes and fan speed automatically “copy” those changes proportionally due to instantaneous fan speed changes. The proposed method <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the gasification <b>boiler</b> power output according to the technical solution enables a simple, cheap, express and continuous maintenance of high power output at low concentrations of the exhaust gases <b>of</b> the gasification <b>boilers</b> from the viewpoint <b>of</b> the <b>boiler</b> user, as well as from the perspective of development and production it allows a continuous control monitoring of these parameters...|$|R

40|$|The final master thesis {{analyzes}} the system <b>of</b> temperature <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the heat exchanger. The Simulink {{model of the}} heat transfer medium is made. The designed system consists: of condensing heat exchanger, four way valve with drive, circulation pumps, heater, regulator. The main objective of the research is to design PID and fuzzy regulators that would control {{the position of the}} four way valve in the contour <b>of</b> temperature <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the condensing heat exchanger. While applying the quality indicators <b>of</b> automated <b>regulation,</b> such as stability <b>of</b> <b>regulation,</b> re-regulation, duration <b>of</b> the transitional time, the conclusion is drawn which regulator is more suitable for this system. The objective of the designed valve regulator is to maintain the chosen, stable temperature that is transferred to the condensing heat exchanger regardless of the load <b>of</b> the <b>boiler</b> and changing temperature. The output signal directly sets the position of the four way valve. This method <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> has impact on the environmental and energy indicators <b>of</b> the <b>boiler...</b>|$|R
