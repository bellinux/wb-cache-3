5|$|All Souls {{suffered}} from low viewership, and {{was placed on}} hiatus following the broadcast of the fist two episodes. It was originally paired with the reality television show Chains of Love. All Souls was canceled after the remaining four episodes were broadcast. In later interviews, the actors had varying views on the <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> the show's cancellation.

Critical response to All Souls was primarily positive, with commentators praising its use of horror and paranormal elements.

5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E

5|$|Simone {{was created}} {{as a part of}} the show's effort to {{represent}} a complete African-American family and fully realized African-American characters on television.

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s the authorities in Eilat have considered relocating the airport, approximately 20km north of Eilat, to the Ora Well area near Be'er Ora. There were numerous <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> this idea.

Other reasons were the pure value of the land which the airport occupies, {{and the fact that the}} airport is dividing the city of Eilat into two parts with the hotels and tourist areas on one side, and the residential buildings on the other.|$|E

5|$|The nilgai is {{categorised}} as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural resources (IUCN). While it {{is common}} in India, the nilgai occurs sparsely in Nepal and Pakistan. The major <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> its decimation in these two countries and extinction in Bangladesh are rampant hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation in the 20th century. As of 2008, the feral population in Texas was nearly 37,000. Wild populations also exist in the US states of Alabama, Florida and Mississippi and the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where they have escaped from private exotic ranches. The population around the Texas-Mexico border {{is estimated to be}} around 30,000 (as of 2011).|$|E
5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One of the main <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often {{have to pay a}} dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E
