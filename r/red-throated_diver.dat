25|$|Furthermore, the {{supposed}} genus {{could well be}} paraphyletic, so that for example Dyspetornis – which is now contained therein – {{might have to be}} separated again. A leg of an undescribed small diver was found in the Late Oligocene deposits at Enspel (Germany); it too may or may not belong to Colymboides. Of the crown genus Gavia, nearly ten prehistoric species have been named to date, and about as many undescribed ones await further study. The genus is known from the Early Miocene onwards, and the oldest members them are rather small (some are smaller than the <b>red-throated</b> <b>diver).</b> Throughout the late Neogene, the genus by and large follows Cope's Rule.|$|E
500|$|Shetland has {{numerous}} seabird colonies. Birds {{found on}} the islands include Atlantic puffin, storm-petrel, <b>red-throated</b> <b>diver,</b> northern gannet and great skua (locally called the [...] "bonxie"). Numerous rarities have also been recorded including black-browed albatross and snow goose, and {{a single pair of}} snowy owls bred on Fetlar from 1967 to 1975. The Shetland wren, Fair Isle wren and Shetland starling are subspecies endemic to Shetland. There are also populations of various moorland birds such as curlew, snipe and golden plover.|$|E
500|$|In {{some respects}} the Hebrides lack {{biodiversity}} {{in comparison to}} mainland Britain; for example, there are only half as many mammalian species. However, these islands provide breeding grounds for many important seabird species including the world's largest colony of northern gannets. Avian life includes the corncrake, <b>red-throated</b> <b>diver,</b> rock dove, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye, golden eagle and white-tailed sea eagle.

50|$|Hoy is an Important Bird Area.The {{northern}} part of the island is an RSPB reserve due to its importance for birdlife, particularly great skuas and <b>red-throated</b> <b>divers.</b> It was sold to the RSPB by the Hoy Trust for a nominal amount.Anastrepta orcadensis, a liverwort also known as Orkney Notchwort, was first discovered on Ward Hill by William Jackson Hooker in 1808.|$|R
500|$|The red-throated loon (North America) or <b>red-throated</b> <b>diver</b> (Britain and Ireland) (Gavia stellata) is a migratory {{aquatic bird}} {{found in the}} {{northern}} hemisphere. The most widely distributed member of the loon or diver family, it breeds primarily in Arctic regions, and winters in northern coastal waters. Ranging from [...] in length, the red-throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loons. In winter, it is a nondescript bird, greyish above fading to white below. During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive reddish throat patch which {{is the basis for}} its common name. Fish form the bulk of its diet, though amphibians, invertebrates, and plant material are sometimes eaten as well. A monogamous species, the red-throated loon forms long-term pair bonds. Both members of the pair help to build the nest, incubate the eggs (generally two per clutch), and feed the hatched young.|$|E
500|$|In {{the modern}} era avian life {{includes}} the corncrake, <b>red-throated</b> <b>diver,</b> kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye and golden eagle. The eggs of the last breeding pair of [...] white-tailed sea eagle in the UK were taken by an egg collector on Skye in 1916 but the species has recently been re-introduced. The chough last bred on the island in 1900. Mountain hare (apparently absent in the 18th century) and rabbit are now abundant and preyed upon by wild cat and pine marten. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore the edible crab and edible oyster are also found, the latter especially in the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs and in 2012 a bed of 100 million flame shells was found during a survey of Loch Alsh. Grey Seals can be seen off the Southern coast.|$|E
50|$|Other common waterbirds {{include the}} Slavonian grebe, red-necked phalarope, great {{northern}} diver, <b>red-throated</b> <b>diver</b> and whooper swan.|$|E
50|$|A few {{pairs of}} {{peregrine}} falcons survive on coastal cliffs and merlin and buzzard {{are not uncommon}} anywhere on hill and moor. <b>red-throated</b> <b>divers</b> nest on countless small tarns and a very few black-throated divers on bigger lochs. Arctic skuas are spreading south from Lewis as far as South Uist but the great skua is still found breeding only in Lewis, St Kilda, North Rona, the Shiant Isles and Barra Head.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{the area}} {{has been used for}} {{trapping}} polar bear and walrus; remains of trapper buildings remain at Ekrollhamna. The reserve contains the most important resting places for walrus in the archipelago. The area also features a lot of reindeer, and is used as a nesting places for birds. On Thousand Islands is a core area featuring <b>red-throated</b> <b>divers,</b> brent geese and Arctic terns. The vegetation is moss tundra, formed by centuries of accumulated reindeer excrement.|$|R

50|$|About {{half of the}} 80,000 {{barnacle}} geese, which {{breed in}} Greenland, arrive on Islay for the winter, with further flocks wintering on other Scottish islands (e.g. Uists, Tiree, Colonsay) and many thousands wintering in Ireland. Tens of thousands of pink-footed geese use the Montrose Basin as a winter roost in October and November as they do Loch Strathbeg and various lochs and reservoirs in Tayside and the Lothians. The amber-listed black and <b>red-throated</b> <b>diver's</b> freshwater breeding strongholds in the British Isles are {{in the north and}} west of Scotland.|$|R
500|$|In the mid-17th century, Eday was {{described}} as being [...] "absolutely full of moorland birds" [...] and today there are <b>red-throated</b> <b>divers</b> on Mill Loch, Arctic skuas and bonxies on the moors and black guillemot offshore. Shore birds include meadow pipit, rock pipit and ringed plover. The woodland at Carrick House attracts a variety of migrants and otters can be seen around the coasts. There are colonies of harbour and grey seals on Muckle Green Holm, Little Green Holm, Faray and Holm of Faray, and white-beaked dolphin, minke whale and killer whale are occasional visitors to the area. A ranger provideds guided walks throughout the year.|$|R

50|$|The second {{series of}} Springwatch was {{broadcast}} from 29 May to 15 June 2006. Bill Oddie and Kate Humble again presented from the Fishleigh Estate farm, {{where more than}} 50 secret cameras were rigged up to film the day-to-day dramas of nesting birds including pied flycatchers, barn owls and dabchicks. The badgers only made a single live appearance in the whole three weeks. Pre-recorded films featured moles, capercaillies and earwigs. On the Shetland Islands, Simon King followed a family of otters {{and a host of}} birds: puffins, great skuas, oystercatchers, merlins and <b>red-throated</b> <b>divers.</b> Springwatch also tracked brent geese on their spring migration from Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland to their breeding grounds in Canada's Queen Elizabeth Islands, via stopovers in Iceland and Greenland.|$|R
500|$|Spring {{migrants}} including [...] little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may {{pass through}} {{on their way}} to breed elsewhere, and terns frequently visit from the colonies on Blakeney Point. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north. Some, such as whimbrels, curlew sandpipers and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter on the reserve, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. <b>Red-throated</b> <b>divers</b> are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae.

40|$|The {{cuneiform}} southernmost {{part of the}} North Sea is {{an important}} corridor for seabird migration. An estimated total of 1 - 1. 3 million seabirds may fly through the area each year. The great majority (40 - 100 %) of the flyway population of great skua and little gull use the Strait of Dover to leave the North Sea, as well as 30 - 70 % {{of the population of}} terns and lesser black-backed gulls. In addition 10 - 20 % of the <b>red-throated</b> <b>divers</b> and great crested grebes may pass through this bottleneck. Except for great skua, all other species are mainly found in inshore areas (i. e. within 20 km of the shoreline), where the first generation of wind farms will be located. At present, very {{little is known about the}} impact of offshore wind turbines on seabirds. Being k-selected species, seabirds are extremely vulnerable to human impacts that affect adult survival. Because of this, and because of a major lack of information on nocturnal migration of seabirds and their reaction towards offshore structures like clusters of wind turbines, great care must be taken. New developments that might have a detrimental impact on resident as well as migrating seabirds must be carefully investigated, especially in this bottleneck area...|$|R
