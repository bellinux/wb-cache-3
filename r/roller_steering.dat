5000|$|The S9, a model {{based on}} the 840 JL truck range cab, is powered by the F 646 Fulgur engine, a 6.8-litre six-cylinder diesel {{delivering}} [...] at 1,500 rpm and a torque of 422 Nm at 1,650 rpm. The truck has a six-speed [...] "synchromesh" [...] manual gearbox. As the other S models, the S9 has a leaf spring suspension and a gammer worm and <b>roller</b> <b>steering.</b> Its wheelbases are between 3000 mm and 4600 mm.|$|E
5000|$|The S5 {{is powered}} by the 591 engine, a 3-litre four-cylinder diesel with a maximum power output of [...] at 3,200 rpm and a torque of 180 Nm at 2,000 rpm. The S6, S7 and S8 are powered by the Perkins 6.354, a 5.8-litre six-cylinder diesel with direct {{injection}} which delivered a maximum power output of [...] at 2,800 rpm and a torque of 392 Nm at 1,600 rpm. The suspension of the four trucks have leaf springs on both axles. Brakes are hydraulic [...] (S5) and air brakes (S7 and S8).They have a five-speed [...] "synchromesh" [...] manual gearbox and a gammer worm and <b>roller</b> <b>steering</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|The revised chassis {{was again}} made of {{box section steel}} and was {{cruciform}} braced. The side members rose over the rear axle and were not underslung like the Consort. The suspension was independent at the front using coil springs but retained traditional leaf springs and live axle at the rear. Automatic chassis lubrication continued to be fitted, operating [...] "thermostatically every time the engine warm(ed) up", and the propeller-shaft centre bearing was [...] "prepacked with grease" [...] so did not require lubrication. [...] However, the propeller shaft itself was not served by the system and four grease points required [...] "attention every 1,000 miles". Worm and double <b>roller</b> <b>steering</b> was used. The Regency's hybrid Girling hydro-mechanical brakes were upgraded to fully hydraulic during production of the Regency II.|$|E

50|$|As {{the train}} is about to start its run, the police demand to be carried to Mallingford with their four prisoners. The Ministry {{inspector}} (John Rudling) refuses to adjust the starting time for the delay. Weech and Chesterford had improvised a means of connecting the engine {{to the rest of}} the train using a length of rope, but during a braking test down the line, the rope snaps. The Thunderbolt leaves the rest of the train behind, but several villagers manage to quietly push the carriages to meet up again with the engine at the water tower, with the inspector none the wiser. Then Joan Hampton (Gabrielle Brune) promises to marry Hawkins to get him to lend them the chain from his <b>roller's</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism to replace the broken rope.|$|R
5000|$|So in 1936 a {{new vehicle}} was {{imported}} from the traditional supplier, the Vickers company - Belgian experiences with ordering from competing foreign companies such as the Renault company had been very disappointing (see AMC 35). This was the Vickers-Carden-Loyd Light Dragon Mk. II B (see Light tanks of the United Kingdom) in the export version, equipped with a 88 hp Meadows 6 cylinder gasoline engine and a [...] "crash" [...] type gearbox. The general design of the vehicle was almost identical to the T-15 Light tank already in service with the Belgian armed forces, also designed and produced by the Vickers company. The suspension was made out of Horstmann suspensions resting on bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie. The drive sprocket was in the front, the idlers {{were placed in the}} rear, with three return <b>rollers.</b> <b>Steering</b> was again a combination of declutching the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn.|$|R

50|$|The two {{driving wheels}} were eight feet in {{diameter}} with three-foot-wide treads, and a four-foot diameter <b>roller,</b> used for <b>steering,</b> was sited at the front. The rear wheels were made from pressed-steel sheet, {{the same as those}} used on Holt agricultural machinery of the period. A small plate was attached to the roller to assist in crossing trenches. Each rear wheel was driven by a Doble two-cylinder 75 horsepower steam engine and a Doble kerosene-fired boiler.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays it is unthinkable {{to live in}} a {{world without}} copiers. The {{customers}} expect increasing performance of a copier. This results in a machine with complex mechanical components. The copier that is relevant for this research is an 8445 copier of Oce. This copier can be divided into three main units namely the Organic Photo Conductor unit (OPC), the Toner Transfer Fusion unit (TIF) and the Paper Feed unit. The copy of the original document appears for the first time on the OPC belt and will from there be transported via the TTF belt to the out going paper. During the transport of the image on the OPC belt arise different problems that have to be solved. The OPC unit consist of several cylinders, which cannot be placed exact parallel to each other. This causes a displacement of the ope belt in axial direction. The beltfmally can hit the copier frame l'lnd will be damaged. The installation of a <b>steering</b> <b>roller</b> solves this problem in combination with a controller. Another problem appears when the OPC belt and the TTF belt making contact with each other. Both units are driven by two different motors. It is not possible that hoth motors give exactly the same velocity to each belt, there are always small deviations. To compensate for these small errors OCE has introduced a yoke. The installation of the yoke turned out to be not necessary afterwards, when a functional controller is used. One control strategy seems to be a serious option for implementation, namely Iterative Learning Control (ILC). Because the copier is set up of cyclic components and the interaction between these components causes errors that are expected to have a cyclic behaviour. This is suitable for ILC. Therefore a case study of ILC is worked out, to illustrate how ILC can be used and implemented on the copier in future research projects...|$|R
