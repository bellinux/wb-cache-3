5000|$|Fusing joins metals {{composed}} of the same alloy {{by the use of}} heat alone. A sheet of metal of thickness near the diameter of the granules ensures an even heat distribution. The granules are positioned using a diluted flux and fine brush, after which the sheet is fired in a <b>reducing</b> <b>oven.</b> At melting temperature the granules and sheet metal fuse, leaving no flux or solder. This technique was used by the Etruscans in the first millennium B.C. Modern techniques achieve fusing by using electric current and the process is known as fusion welding. The electric current passes through each granule, generating sufficient heat to weld the granules to the base. This method may be used on finished items, even those with set stones.|$|E
40|$|Fifth Chapter "Combined Microwave and Infared Heating of Foods" is a {{collaboration}} chapter written with Srikanth Geedipalli. A quantitative, model-based understanding of heat exchange in infrared and combined infrared-microwave heating of food inside an oven is developed. The research {{is divided into}} three parts: measurement of optical properties, radiative heat transfer analysis and combined microwave-radiative heat transfer analysis. Optical properties of reflectance, absorptance and transmittance in a potato tissue are measured as a function of wavelength, using a spectroradiometer. Penetration of energy is higher for halogen lamps that emit in the near- and mid-infrared range, compared to ceramic rods that emit mostly in the far infrared range. Reflectance in the near infrared range increases with moisture content of the food, thus decreasing the energy coupled. Surface structure has significant influence on the optical properties. A 3 -D radiative heat exchange model of an oven-food system is developed using a commercial finite-element package. The air in the oven is assumed transparent to the radiation. Heat conduction is assumed in the entire oven (food and air) for the short duration. The wavelength dependence of emissivity (non-gray surface) is found to significantly affect the surface radiative flux and the use of a non-gray model is recommended for such materials, although simplification of the emissivity variation is required to keep the computation time reasonable. Lowering food surface emissivity reduces the radiative flux that is absorbed by the food surface. <b>Reducing</b> <b>oven</b> wall emissivities increase the radiative flux on the food surface. The location of the radiative heat source in the oven as well as placement of the food relative to the heat source were found to have significant influence on the radiative heat flux over the food surface. To add microwave heating, Maxwell's equations of electromagnetics were solved for the same cavity using separate finite element software and the volumetric heat generation, in the food, obtained from this model was input to the radiative heat transfer model, thus coupling them. Using measures such as mean temperature rise and the standard deviation of temperatures, it was demonstrated that combination heating leads to more uniform heating, without compromising the speed of heating...|$|E

40|$|Inefficient cookstoves {{contribute}} to deforestation and global climate change, require substantial time (usually {{of women and}} girls) or money for fuel, and lead to over 1. 5 million deaths a year from smoke exposure. We ran a randomized controlled trial in rural Senegal to measure how solar ovens affect wood usage, time spent collecting wood, carbon monoxide exposure, and respiratory illness symptoms. In the sixth month of owning the stove, women in the treatment group used their oven about 19 % of days. However, because 80 % of our respondents typically cook for more people than {{the capacity of the}} solar oven, even cooks using the solar oven always had a fire going at the same time. On average, treatment households did not have statistically significantly lower fuel consumption, time spent collecting fuel, or time spent next to the cook fire. There is no evidence solar <b>ovens</b> <b>reduce</b> exposure to carbon monoxide or self-reported respiratory symptoms such as coughs and sore throats...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{degradation}} is {{a serious}} threat to long-term use and recyclability of polymers. Successful recycling of polymeric quality products requires characterization of the polymer material after reprocessing and use. Lately, a growing awareness of the heterogeneous nature of degradation has developed in terms of physical spreading, non-uniform distribution of stabilizer, physical loss of stabilizer etc. In this thesis the issues of heterogeneous degradation and recyclability of PP are addressed mainly using imaging chemiluminescence (ICL) technique. An extensive test program was carried out on PP subjected to simulated recycling in terms of combined (re) processing and oven ageing or alternatively to repeated reprocessing steps or continuous oven ageing. For this study an ICL instrument with improved performance was developed including a multi-cell specimen chamber with up to 23 cells with excellent control of temperature and gas flow in the cells and a high sensitivity for low-mass specimens. Comparative studies with microcalorimetry (MC) showed good agreement between CL intensity-time and heat flow-time curves during oxidation of PP. From ICL images, oxidation induction time (OIT) and total luminous intensity (TLI) data as well as from data of other techniques like elongation at break, yellowness index and melt viscosity a number of conclusions were made: The total <b>oven</b> lifetime was <b>reduced</b> if <b>oven</b> ageing included an intermediate reprocessing step. A commercial stabilization system based on a low-molar mass phenolic antioxidant was inadequate for recycling due to loss by evaporation, while an antioxidant with twice the molar mass showed satisfactory performance. The effect of upgrading PP during reprocessing with virgin PP was small, while addition of extra stabilizer prolonged the oven lifetime. In mapping the heterogeneity of the degradation of PP plaques pronounced edge oxidation was discovered and explained by antioxidant loss by evaporation. Simultaneous ICL and oxygen uptake experiments showed matching OITs and supported the opinion that luminescence and oxygen uptake reflect the oxidizing area rather than the oxidation kinetics...|$|R
40|$|The 18 -electron ternary {{intermetallic}} systems TiNiSn and TiCoSb {{are promising}} for applications as high-temperature thermoelectrics and comprise earth-abundant, and relatively nontoxic elements. Heusler and half-Heusler compounds are usually prepared by conventional solid state methods involving arc-melting and annealing at high temperatures {{for an extended}} period of time. Here, we report an energy-saving preparation route using a domestic microwave <b>oven,</b> <b>reducing</b> the reaction time significantly from more than a week to one minute. A microwave susceptor material rapidly heats the elemental starting materials inside an evacuated quartz tube resulting in near single phase compounds. The initial preparation is followed by a densification step involving hot-pressing, which reduces the amount of secondary phases, as verified by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, leading to the desired half-Heusler compounds, demonstrating that hot-pressing should be treated as part of the preparative process. For TiNiSn, high thermoelectric power factors of 2 mW/mK^ 2 at temperatures in the 700 to 800 K range, and zT values of around 0. 4 are found, with the microwave-prepared sample displaying somewhat superior properties to conventionally prepared half-Heuslers due to lower thermal conductivity. The TiCoSb sample shows a lower thermoelectric figure of merit when prepared using microwave methods because of a metallic second phase...|$|R
40|$|Acacia angustissima has {{potential}} as a fodder tree, but was toxic to sheep when fed without adaptation at levels higher than 50 g per day in previous studies. In the present study {{it was determined that}} rats are sensitive to anti-nutritional factor(s) of A. angustissima and can therefore be used in bioassays to evaluate the toxicity of this legume. Weanling rats fed a diet supplemented with 7. 5 % A. angustissima had reduced intake and average daily gain (ADG) (4. 5 and - 0. 8 g/d) when compared to rats fed a diet containing 7. 5 % Medicago sativa (6. 8 and 2. 4 g/d). When A. angustissima leaves were incubated in the rumen of steers for 24 h before feeding to the rats no toxicity symptoms were observed suggesting that the anti-nutritional factors were either transformed by rumen microbial activity, solubilized out of the plant leaves or <b>reduced</b> due to <b>oven</b> drying. Variable mild lymphocytic typhlitis was observed in cecal tissues in both groups fed 7. 5 % A. angustissima, either whole or after rumen incubation. No other significant histological or gross pathological changes were observed. In order to ascertain the nature of the anti nutritional factor(s) milled A. angustissima leaf material was extracted with a variety of solvents and extracts added to rat diets to determine their effect. Intake and ADG (6. 0 and 0. 5 g/d) were significantly reduced in rats fed a diet containing a 70 % acetone extract compared to the rats fed the control diet (8. 8 and 3. 1 g/d). The rats fed the 70 % acetone extract containing diet showed an increase in cecal wet weight and/or contents, salivary gland dry weight (% of live weight), fecal nitrogen excretion and increased concentrations of proline, glycine and glutamic acid in the feces. Further fractionation of a 70 % acetone fraction was performed to yield ethyl acetate, acetone and watersoluble fractions. Again intake and ADG (6. 7 and 0. 2 g/d) were significantly reduced in rats fed a diet containing a 70 % acetone extract compared to the rats fed the control diet (10. 7 and 3. 6 g/d). In vitro incubation of the 70 % acetone fraction with rumen fluid did not result in significant microbial transformation of the anti-nutritional factors (7. 4 and 0. 1 g/d). Intake and ADG were significantly reduced when compared to the control diet in the diet containing the ethyl acetate soluble fraction (8. 6 and 2. 1 g/d), but no anti-nutritional effects were noted in the diets containing the acetone (11. 3 and 3. 8 g/d) or water-soluble fractions (11. 1 and 3. 8 g/d) of the 70 % acetone extraction. The size increase in salivary glands, increased fecal nitrogen excretion and increased concentrations of proline, glycine and glutamic acid in the feces together with decreased intake and ADG when diets are fed containing phenolics indicate that phenolics were the major component involved in the antinutritional effects of A. angustissima used in these studies. Condensed tannins, but not gallotannins, were detected in phenolic-containing plant extracts. Inhibition of intake and weight gain of condensed tannin containing diets was reversed by polyethylene glycol, which complexes with tannins...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} indoor {{experiments}} were conducted at Massey University and AgResearch Grasslands, Palmerston North, New Zealand, {{to study the}} effect of cottonseed condensed tannin (CT) upon the nutritional value of solvent extracted cottonseed meal (CSM) for ruminant and monogastric livestock. Ruminant nutrition experiments were conducted using samples suspended in situ in the rumen of fistulated sheep and by incubating samples with rumen fluid in vitro, to study effects upon solubility and degradability of cottonseed proteins. Monogastric nutrition experiments were done initially with laboratory rats {{as a model for}} production animals such as the pig, and then with pigs. In all cases half of the animals were supplemented with polyethylene glycol (PEG; MW 3500). PEG specifically binds and inactivates CT and can be used to deduce the effects of CT by comparing control animals (CT acting) with PEG supplemented animals (CT inactivated). 1. Experimental varieties of cottonseed and of industrial CSM were analysed for extractable and bound CT and free gossypol, crude protein, oil and fibre. CT was present in the hulls of all varieties, with higher concentrations recorded for high tannin and glandless selections (55 g kg- 1 and 58 g kg- 1 DM) than for the multiple host plant resistant and high gossypol selections (38 g kg- 1 DM). CT was present in trace amounts in the kernels of high tannin selections, but was not detected in the kernels of all other selections. On average for the hulls of all varieties, approximately 22, 60 and 18 % of total CT was present in the extractable, protein-bound and fibre-bound forms, respectively. Free gossypol was mainly found in the kernels, with negligible amounts being found in the hulls of the experimental varieties. Kernels of high gossypol selections contained higher concentrations of free gossypol (18 g kg- 1 DM) than kernels of multiple host plant resistant, high tannin and commercial selections (10 - 12 g kg- 1 DM), with free gossypol concentration being very low (0. 8 g kg- 1 DM) in the kernels of glandless cottonseed. A negative correlation (r = - 0. 50, P 10, 000) fraction affords an estimate of endogenous loss. Inclusion of hulls in the EHC based diet increased ileal flow of total N (1387 vs. 1623 mg kg- 1 dry matter intake; p< 0. 05), increased ileal flow of total amino acids (23 %; p< 0. 01), and significantly increased ileal flow of several individual amino acids. There was no significant effect of PEG and no PEG x diet interaction, showing that the hull effects could not be explained by action of CT. The presence of some hulls in commercial CSM will contribute to lowering apparent ileal amino acid digestibility, due to its effect in increasing endogenous loss. 5. The effect of adding cottonseed hulls to casein and to cottonseed kernel based diets on the apparent and true ileal digestibility of N and amino acids, and the proportion of this effect accounted for by CT, was determined using the growing rat. Sixty rats were allocated randomly to 10 semi-synthetic diets, containing either casein (4 diets) or purified unheated solvent-extracted cottonseed kernel (6 diets) as the sole protein sources, with chromic oxide added as an indigestible marker. Two of the casein diets contained no hulls whilst the remaining two diets contained 70 g hulls kg- 1. Two of the cottonseed kernel based diets contained no hulls, with two containing 23 g hulls kg- 1 and the remaining two containing 46 g hulls kg- 1. For each pair of diets, PEG was either included or excluded. Samples of digesta were collected at death from the terminal 15 cm of ileum. The inclusion of hulls depressed the apparent and true ileal digestibility of N and amino acids, but with the response differing between diets. With the casein based diet the mean apparent and true ileal amino acid digestibilities were significantly depressed from 0. 89 and 0. 96 to 0. 85 and 0. 92, respectively, by the inclusion of hulls in the diet, and addition of PEG then restored these to 0. 89 and 0. 95. All of the depression could be explained by the CT content of the hulls. However, with the cottonseed kernel based diet the response fell into three categories. The apparent and true ileal digestibilities of the essential amino acids cystine and methionine were not affected by hull addition, ileal digestibilities of leucine, isoleucine, lysine, threonine and valine were markedly depressed by hull addition with approximately 50 % of the depression being explained by CT, whilst the ileal digestibilities of histidine, arginine and phenylalanine were depressed by hull addition but little or none of this effect could be explained by CT. With the cottonseed kernel based diet it seems that unknown components of the hulls other than CT also depressed the apparent and true ileal digestibility of N and amino acids. 6. The effects of heat treatment, with or without the addition of cottonseed hulls, on the chemical composition of CSM and upon reactivity of the CT were studied. Heat treatment (100 °C for 2 h, in a forced draught <b>oven)</b> <b>reduced</b> the concentrations of free gossypol and fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB) available lysine by small amounts, reduced measurable total CT content by 13 %, reduced the solubility of total N, and reduced potential degradability of the 52 and 48 kDa cottonseed storage proteins by mixed rumen micro-organisms. Addition of hulls further depressed solubility of total N and ruminal degradation of the two major storage proteins in cottonseed kernel. The action of PEG in vitro indicated that only part of the depression caused by hull addition could be explained by the presence of CT in the hulls, and that the effects of CT upon N solubility and potential degradability in heated CSM were similar to that in unheated CSM. Addition of hulls also substantially reduced FDNB available lysine. Although application of heat inactivated 13 % of the total CT such that it could no longer be detected with butanol/HCl, it did not seem to change the reversible reactivity of CT with kernel proteins. Commercial CSM produced from the Brisbane mill had a lower total CT content, lower N solubility and ruminal protein degradation rate than CSM produced from the Narrabri mill, but a similar level of FDNB available lysine. 7. The effect of CT from heated and unheated cottonseed on the apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids for the growing rat and pig was determined. In Experiment 1, twenty-four rats were allocated to four semi-synthetic diets, which contained cottonseed kernel/hulls as the sole protein source. Two of the diets contained unheated solvent extracted cottonseed kernel/hulls while the remaining two diets contained similar material but which had been heat-treated by autoclaving at 110 °C for 120 min. In Experiment 2, twelve rats and twelve pigs were fed four semisynthetic diets containing commercial CSM as the sole protein source. Chromic oxide was added to all diets as an indigestible marker. For each pair of diets in both experiments, PEG was either included or excluded. Ileal contents from the terminal 15 and 45 cm of ileum were collected at slaughter for the rats and pigs, respectively. Apparent ileal amino acid digestibility for rats fed the cottonseed kernel/hulls diet was significantly depressed by the heat treatment, particularly for lysine and threonine. On average, apparent ileal amino acid digestibility in the diets without PEG was decreased from 0. 80 to 0. 70 by heat treatment. Dietary cottonseed CT depressed apparent ileal protein digestibility in the pig and in the rat. The addition of PEG to the diets significantly increased the apparent ileal digestibility of N and some amino acids for the pigs and the rats. The mean increase in apparent ileal digestibility due to PEG addition for the 14 amino acids was 2 % units in both species fed the commercial CSM diets, and 2 or 4 % units in rats fed the unheated or the heated cottonseed kernel/hull diets, respectively. The effect of PEG was similar in the heated and unheated cottonseed kernel/hulls for most amino acids, but responses to PEG for lysine, threonine and tyrosine were greater in heated than unheated CSM. For several of the amino acids there were significant animal species differences in apparent ileal digestibility. Studies into the effects of cottonseed CT should be carried out in the target animal species. The commercial CSM had a low apparent ileal amino acid digestibility overall, particularly for the essential amino acids lysine and threonine. It was concluded that effects of heating did not eliminate the reversible reactivity of cottonseed CT on amino acid digestion in rats and pigs but rather appeared to increase it for threonine, tyrosine and lysine in Experiment 1, causing large reductions in apparent ileal digestibility. It was concluded that CT in CSM are mainly in the protein- and fibre-bound forms (80 %), with only 10 - 20 % of CT being extractable. In the absence of heat, adding graded levels of hulls reduced both the solubility and degradability of protein by rumen microorganisms, giving a rumen 'by-pass' effect. However, the magnitude of these effects was small and they are not regarded as being nutritionally significant under practical conditions of ruminant nutrition. Adding hulls significantly depressed the digestion of amino acids in the small intestine of the monogastric animals. This effect is considered large, and {{is probably one of the}} factors responsible for the generally low levels of amino acid availability found for commercially produced CSM. Approximately half of the 'hull effect' is due to their content of CT and the cause of the other 50 % is unknown. As there is no CT in cottonseed kernels, this explains the lack of response to PEG when the diet does not contain cottonseed hulls. The study has also shown that the large amount of heat applied during normal commercial CSM processing reduces the digestion of amino acids by monogastric animals. A combination of heat and CT from hulls is especially damaging for lowing ileal amino acid digestion in monogastric species, particularly for the limiting essential amino acids lysine and threonine...|$|R
