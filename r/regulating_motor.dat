50|$|Dopaminergic neurons are {{the most}} {{abundant}} type of neuron in the substantia nigra, {{a part of the}} brain <b>regulating</b> <b>motor</b> control and learning. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which activates motor neurons in the central nervous system. The activated motor neurons then transmit their signals, via action potential, to motor neurons in the legs. However, when a significant percentage of the motor neurons die (about 50-60%), this decreases dopamine levels by up to 80%. This inhibits the ability for neurons to generate and transmit a signal. This transmission inhibition ultimately causes the characteristic Parkinsonian gait with symptoms such as hunched and slowed walking or tremors.|$|E

These can result in dysfunction, or failure of: the motor or somatosensory cortex of the brain, corticobulbar pathways, the cerebellum, basal nuclei (consisting of the putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, substantia nigra etc.), brainstem (from which the cranial nerves originate), or the neuro-muscular junction (in diseases such as myasthenia gravis) which block the nervous system's ability to activate motor units and effect correct range and strength of movements.|$|E

50|$|Vestibulocerebellar {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} a failure in the function of the flocculus of the vestibulocerebellum, one of the three main divisions of the cerebellum. Generally, the cerebellum is responsible for <b>regulating</b> <b>motor</b> commands. The main function of the vestibulocerebellum is to receive sensory input from the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and to regulate equilibrium, balance, and the vestibulo-ocular reflex accordingly. The vestibulo-ocular reflex, one of the primary areas affected by vestibulocerebellar syndrome, is responsible for counterrotating the eyes in response to head movements. This allows gaze to stay fixed on a specific point. A failure in this reflex results in a variety of eye movement abnormalities, such as those exhibited in vestibulocerebellar syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|On September 8, 2003, EPA {{denied the}} ICTA {{petition}} {{on the ground}} that it did not have authority under the CAA to promulgate regulations to address global climate change and that CO2 and other GHGs therefore could not be considered air pollutants under the provisions of the CAA, including section 202.

The agency maintained that <b>regulating</b> <b>motor</b> vehicle GHG emissions would neither address the global problem effectively, nor be consistent with President Bush's policies for addressing climate change, which centered on non-regulatory efforts such as voluntary reductions in GHGs, public-private partnerships aimed at reducing the economy's reliance on fossil fuels, and research to probe into scientific uncertainties regarding climate change.

5000|$|There are {{pathways}} {{that have}} been proposed to explain the non-motor dysfunctions seen in CCAS. A leading view of CCAS is the dysmetria of thought hypothesis, which proposes that the non-motor deficits in CCAS are caused by dysfunction in the cerebrocerebellar system linking the cerebral cortex with the cerebellum. [...] The normal cerebellum is now thought {{to be responsible for}} <b>regulating</b> <b>motor,</b> cognitive and emotional behaviors. When there is some type of damage to the cerebellum, this regulation is affected, leading to deregulation of emotional behaviors. This effect has been compared to dysmetria of movement, which describes the motor dysfunctions seen after cerebellar lesions. [...] These ideas build upon earlier theories and results of investigations indicating that the cerebellum is linked with the frontal orbital cortex, limbic system, and reticular structures. It was proposed that these circuits are involved with emotional regulation, such that damage to this circuit would result in behavioral dysfunctions such as hyperactivity, apathy, and stimulus-seeking behaviors.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} novel {{wearable}} haptic system based on an elastic fabric which can be moved forward and backward over the user forearm thus simulating a human caress. The system allows to control both the velocity of the “caress-like” movement, by <b>regulating</b> <b>motor</b> velocity, and the “strength of the caress”, by <b>regulating</b> <b>motor</b> positions and hence the force exerted by the fabric on the user forearm. Along {{with a description of}} the mechanical design and control of the system, we also report the preliminary results of psycho-physiological assessment tests performed by six healthy participants. Such an assessment is intended as a preliminary characterization of the device capability of eliciting tactually emotional states in humans using different combinations of velocity and caress strength. The emotional state is expressed in terms of arousal and valence. Moreover, the activation of the autonomic nervous system is also evaluated through the analysis of the electrodermal response (EDR). The main results reveal a statistically significant correlation between the perceived arousal level and the “strength of the caress” and between the perceived valence level and the “velocity of the caress”. Moreover, we found that phasic EDR is able to discern between pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. These preliminary results are very encouraging and confirm the effectiveness of this device in conveying emotional-like haptic stimuli in a controllable and wearable fashion...|$|E
40|$|Ataxia {{represents}} a pathological coordination failure that often involves functional disturbances in cerebellar circuits. Purkinje cells (PCs) characterize the only output neurons of the cerebellar cortex and critically participate in <b>regulating</b> <b>motor</b> coordination. Although different genetic mutations are known that cause ataxia, {{little is known}} about the underlying cellular mechanisms. Here we show that a mutated ax(J) gene locus, encoding the ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (Usp 14), negatively influences synaptic receptor turnover. Ax(J) mouse mutants, characterized by cerebellar ataxia, display both increased GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A) R) levels at PC surface membranes accompanied by enlarged IPSCs. Accordingly, we identify physical interaction of Usp 14 and the GABA(A) R alpha 1 subunit. Although other currently unknown changes might be involved, our data show that ubiquitin-dependent GABA(A) R turnover at cerebellar synapses contributes to ax(J) -mediated behavioural impairment...|$|E
