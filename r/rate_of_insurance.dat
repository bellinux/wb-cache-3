40|$|Using matched {{data from}} the 1996 to 2004 Current Population Survey (CPS), we examine racial {{patterns}} in annual transitions into and out <b>of</b> health <b>insurance</b> coverage. We first decompose racial differences in static health insurance coverage rates into group differences in transition rates into and out <b>of</b> health <b>insurance</b> coverage. The low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> health <b>insurance</b> coverage among African-Americans is due almost entirely to higher annual <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> losing health <b>insurance</b> than whites. Among the uninsured, African-Americans have similar <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> gaining health <b>insurance</b> {{in the following year}} as whites. Estimates from the matched CPS also indicate that the lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> health <b>insurance</b> coverage among Asians is almost entirely accounted for by a relatively high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> losing health <b>insurance.</b> In contrast to these findings, differences in health insurance coverage between Latinos and whites are due to group differences in both the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> health <b>insurance</b> loss and gain. Using logit regression estimates, we also calculate non-linear decompositions for the racial gaps in health insurance loss and gain. We find that two main factors are responsible for differences in health insurance loss between working-age whites and minorities: job loss and education level. Higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> job loss account for 30 percent <b>of</b> the health <b>insurance</b> gap for African-Americans and Asians, and 16 percent <b>of</b> the health <b>insurance</b> gap for Latinos. Lower levels of education explain roughly 15 percent of the gap for African-Americans and Latinos (Asians' higher levels of education serve to close the gap).

40|$|BACKGROUND:: Emergency {{departments}} (EDs) nationwide are {{key entry}} points into {{the health care}} system, and their use may reflect changes in access and need in their communities. However, no studies to date have empirically and longitudinally studied how changes in a community's level of insurance coverage, a key determinant of access, affect ED utilization. OBJECTIVE:: To {{determine the effects of}} changes in a community's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage on its population's ED use. METHODS:: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of all California counties between 2005 and 2010 using comprehensive ED visit data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. Using Poisson regression with county and year fixed effects, we determined how changes in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage within a given county affect ED visits per 1000 residents. RESULTS:: We found that changes in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage within a county had a slight but significant inverse relationship with ED visits per 1000 residents for both adults and children. For example, if a county's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage among adults jumped from the 10 th (73. 22 %) to the 90 th percentile (84. 93 %), an estimated 2 fewer ED visits would occur per 1000 adult residents. CONCLUSIONS:: As the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage increased within California counties, overall ED utilization declined only slightly. Thus, expanding insurance coverage may not lead to significant decreases in overall ED use. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|E

40|$|One popular {{explanation}} for this low rate of employee coverage {{is the presence of}} numerous state regulations which mandate that group health insurance plans must include certain benefits. By raising the minimum costs of providing any health insurance coverage, these mandated benefits make it impossible for firms which would have desired to offer minimal health insurance at a low cost to do so. I use data on insurance coverage among employees in small firms to investigate whether this problem is an important cause of employee non-insurance. I find that mandates have little effect on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage; this finding is robust to a variety of specifications of the regulations.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of search {{frictions}} {{in the market for}} commercial health insurance. Frictions increase the cost of insurance by enabling insurers to set price above marginal cost, and by creating incentives for inefficiently high levels of marketing. Frictions also lead to price dispersion for identical products and, as a consequence, to increases in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> turnover. Our empirical analysis indicates that frictions increase prices enough to transfer 13. 2 % of consumer surplus from employer groups to insurers (approximately $ 34. 4 billion in 1997), and increase employer group turnover by 64 % for the average insurance policy. This heightened turnover reduces insurer incentives to invest in the future health of their policy holders. Our analysis also suggests that a publicly-financed insurance option might improve private insurance markets by reducing distortions induced by search frictions. ...|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} public policy {{concern over the}} relatively low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> health <b>insurance</b> coverage among the self-employed in the United States. Presumably, {{the reason for the}} concern is that their low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> lead to worse health outcomes. We use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey conducted in 1996 to analyze how the self-employed and wage-earners differ with respect to insurance coverage and health status. Using a variety of ways to measure health status, we find that the relative lack <b>of</b> health <b>insurance</b> among the self-employed does not affect their health. For virtually every subjective and objective measure of health status, the self-employed and wage earners are statistically indistinguishable from each other. Further, we present some evidence that this phenomenon is not {{due to the fact that}} individuals who select into self-employment are healthier than wage-earners, ceteris paribus. Thus, public policy concern with the relative lack <b>of</b> health <b>insurance</b> among the self-employed may be somewhat misplaced. ...|$|R

40|$|More than 45 % of Australians buy health {{insurance}} for private treatment in hospital. This is despite having access to universal and free public hospital treatment. Anecdotal evidence suggests that avoidance of long waits for public treatment is {{one possible explanation for}} the high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage. In this study, we investigate the effect of waiting on individual decisions to buy private {{health insurance}}. Individuals are assumed to form an expectation of their own waiting time as a function of their demographics and health status. We model waiting times using administrative data on the population hospitalised for elective procedures in public hospitals and use the parameter estimates to impute the expected waiting time and the probability of a long wait for a representative sample of the population. We find that expected waiting time does not increase the probability of buying insurance but a high probability of experiencing a long wait does. On average, waiting time has no significant impact on insurance. In addition, we find that favourable selection into private insurance, measured by self-assessed health, is no longer significant once waiting time variables are included. This result suggests that a source of favourable selection may be aversion to waiting among healthier people. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the apparent failure of private markets to adequately insure long-term risks. I {{argue that the}} key to long-term insurance is the importance of intertemporal risk. Long-term risks are difficult to insure because much of the risk concerns variability in the average cost of services used, rather than cross-section heterogeneity in service use. When intertemporal risk is large, insurance will provide indemnity benefits rather than a service benefit, and this in turn will limit demand for insurance. Analysis of long-term care insurance supports this view. An insurer underwriting full long-term care insurance would have a standard deviation of average costs for its pool of policies of 13 percent. Full insurance is essentially non-existent, however. Rather, insurers offer an indemnity payment conditional on use. While I cannot directly test whether this indemnity payment limits demand, I show that other common theories of market failure cannot explain all of the low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> purchase. I am grateful to Peter Diamond, Jon Gruber, Larry Katz, Brigitte Madrian, Jim Poterba, Jon Skinner, and Richard Zeckhauser for helpful discussions, and to the National Institutes of Aging for financial support.

40|$|There are fragmentations in Iran’s health {{insurance}} system. Multiple {{health insurance}} funds exist, without adequate provisions for transfer or redistribution of cross subsidy among them. Multiple risk pools, including several private secondary insurance schemes, {{have resulted in}} a tiered health insurance system with inequitable benefit packages for different segments of the population. Also fragmentation might have contributed to inefficiency in the health insurance systems, a low financial protection against healthcare expenditures for the insured persons, high coinsurance rates, a notable <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage duplication, low contribution of well-funded institutes with generous benefit package to the public health insurance schemes, underfunding and severe financial shortages for the public funds, and a lack of transparency and reliable data and statistics for policy-making.

As a result we introduce three policy options: keeping the existing structural fragmentations of social health insurance (SHI) schemes but implementing a comprehensive “policy integration” strategy; consolidation of existing health insurance funds and creating a single national health insurance scheme; and reducing fragmentation by merging minor well-resourced funds together and creating two or three large insurance funds under the umbrella of the existing organizations.
