40|$|Present study {{tends to}} {{investigate}} {{the existence of the}} bacterial oncogenes- <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> of Agrobacterium rhizogenes Riker., in Nicotiana rustica, N. plumbaginifolia and their hybrid. These Nicotiana species and hybrid were normal morphologically under field conditions without any neoplastic growth. So, the habituation studies were carried out to identify the presence of <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> by culturing the leaf discs on hormone supplemented Murashige and Skoog medium and then shifting to MS basal medium. Habituation showed phytohormone independent growth response even after shifting to MS basal medium indicating the presence of <b>rol</b> <b>genes.</b> Then, Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis showed amplification of rol A, B and C genes in N. rustica, rol A and C in N. plumbaginifolia and the hybrid. The amplified genes were sequenced and deposited in GenBank. The homology between the novel genes was compared with the <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> of A. rhizogenes {{as well as the other}} plants species containing rol gene homologues using Pairwise sequence alignment search tool.

40|$|Summary The {{effects of}} Agrobacterium pRiA 4 rol and aux genes, {{controlled}} by their endogenous promoters, on tree growth and wood anatomy and chemistry were studied in 5 -and 7 -year-old silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) plants. Southern hybridization confirmed the following rol and aux gene combinations: control plants (no genes transferred); plants with rolC and rolD genes; plants with rolA, rolB, rolC and rolD genes; and plants with rolA, rolB, rolC, rolD, aux 1 and aux 2 genes. Transgene mRNA was most abundant in phloem/cambium samples {{and in the}} developing xylem, whereas no expression was detected in leaves. Plants with rolC and rolD genes or with all the <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> were significantly shorter and had smaller leaves and a more bushy growth habit than control plants or plants with both aux and <b>rol</b> <b>genes.</b> Mor-phological observations and wood chemistry analyses revealed that plants with <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> produced less xylem and broke bud later than control plants or plants with both aux and <b>rol</b> <b>genes.</b> Tension wood was detected in both control and transgenic plants irrespective of their gene combination, probably as a re-sult of greenhouse cultivation. Xylem fibers were shorter in transgenic plants than in control plants, and plants with all the <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> were characterized by shorter vessels compared with the control plants and a smaller proportional area of vessels compared with the other groups. In addition, silver birch plants with all the <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> had approximately a 3. 3 % lower concen-tration of total acid soluble carbohydrates than control plants. We conclude that the rolC and rolD genes induced the typical “rol-phenotype, ” {{and that this was}} emphasized by concomitant expression of the rolA and rolB genes and alleviated by the presence of aux 1 and aux 2 genes. We observed consistent phenotypic effects of rol and aux genes on the morphology, anatomy and cell wall chemistry of the plants...|$|E

Integration and expression of Ri T-DNA genes in transformed embryogenic callus lines derived from transformed root lines, 300 Ri-transformed somatic embryos, and 23 Ri-transformed plant lines were analysed. Fifty root lines studied showed integration and expression of four <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> of TL-DNA. Spontaneous regeneration via indirect somatic embryogenesis was obtained from root lines that were TL+/TR−. Stable integration and expression of <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> were observed in root lines, embryogenic callus lines, and the spontaneously induced somatic embryos. Nineteen out of the 23 Ri-transformed plant lines and their clones showed phenotypic and genetic stability over the period of 3 years. Four Ri-transformed plants were morphologically similar to nontransformed plants but showed variation with the integration and expression of the rolA gene and absence of other <b>rol</b> <b>genes.</b> Variant Ri-transformed plant line A 428 # 1 -V showed highest tylophorine content (2. 93 ± 0. 03 [*]mg[*]gDW− 1) among plant lines studied.

40|$|The rfb {{region of}} Shigella flexneri encodes the {{proteins}} required to synthesize the O-antigen component of its cell surface lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We have previously {{reported that a}} region adjacent to rfb was involved in regulating the length distribution of the O-antigen polysaccharide chains (D. F. Macpherson et al., Mol. Microbiol. 5 : 1491 - 1499, 1991). The gene responsible has been identified in Escherichia coli O 75 (called rol [R. A. Batchelor et al., J. Bacteriol. 173 : 5699 - 5704, 1991]) and in E. coli O 111 and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain LT 2 (called cld [D. A. Bastin et al., Mol. Microbiol. 5 : 2223 - 2231, 1991]). Through a combination of subcloning, deletion, and transposon insertion analysis, we have identified a gene adjacent to the S. flexneri rfb region which encodes a protein of 36 kDa responsible for the length distribution of O-antigen chains in LPS as seen on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. DNA sequence analysis identified an open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to the <b>rol</b> <b>gene.</b> The corresponding protein was almost identical in sequence to the Rol protein of E. coli O 75 and was highly homologous to the functionally identical Cld proteins of E. coli O 111 and S. enterica serovar typhimurium LT 2. These proteins, together with ORF o 349 adjacent to rfe, had almost identical hydropathy plots which predict membrane-spanning segments at the amino- and carboxy-terminal ends and a hydrophilic central region. We isolated a number of TnphoA insertions which inactivated the <b>rol</b> <b>gene,</b> and the fusion end points were determined. The PhoA+ Rol::PhoA fusion proteins had PhoA fused within the large hydrophilic central domain of Rol. These proteins were located in the whole-membrane fraction, and extraction with Triton X- 100 indicated a cytoplasmic membrane location. This finding was supported by sucrose density gradient fractionation of the whole-cell membranes and of E. coli maxicells expressing L-[35 S]methionine-labelled Rol protein. Hence, we interpret these data {{to indicate that the}} Rol protein is anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane via its amino- and carboxy-terminal ends but {{that the majority of the}} protein is located in the periplasmic space. To confirm that rol is responsible for the effects on O-antigen chain length observed with the cloned rfb genes in E. coli K- 12, it was mutated in S. flexneri by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cartridge. The resulting strains produced LPS with O antigens of nonmodal chain length, thereby confirming the function of the <b>rol</b> <b>gene</b> product. We propose a model for the function of Rol protein in which it acts as a type of molecular chaperone to facilitate the interaction of the O-antigen ligase (RfaL) with the O-antigen polymerase (Rfc) and polymerized, acyl carrier lipid-linked, O-antigen chains. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the region identified a number of ORFs corresponding to the well-known gnd and hisIE <b>genes.</b> The <b>rol</b> <b>gene</b> was located immediately downstream of two ORFs with sequence similarity to the gene encoding UDPglucose dehydrogenase (HasB) of Streptococcus pyogenes. The ORFs arise because of a deletion or frameshift mutation within the gene we have termed udg (for UDPglucose dehydrogenase) ...|$|R

Both transformed and control plants exhibited identical auxin-sensitivity changes during vegetative and induction to flowering periods. However the sensitivity of flowering-transformed plants Was 100 -times higher than that of control plants. Consistent observations were also made when using rol A+B+C-transformed plants.

40|$|Two {{kinds of}} {{cellular}} responses to auxin, the hyperpolarization of protoplasts and {{the division of}} protoplast-derived cells, were compared in Nicotiana tabacum plants transformed by different T-DNA fragments of Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain A 4. Using transmembrane potential difference measurements to characterize hormonal sensitivity of mesophyll protoplasts, we found a 30 -fold increase in sensitivity to auxin in protoplasts transformed by the whole Ri A 4 T-DNA. Furthermore, the <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> of the Ri A 4 TL-DNA, together or as single genes, were able to increase the sensitivity to auxin by factors up to 104. The different effects of the single <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> on the sensitivity of mesophyll protoplasts to auxin, rolB being the most powerful, were consistent with their respective rhizogenic effects on leaf fragments (A Spena, T Schmülling, C Koncz, J Schell [1987] EMBO J 6 : 3891 - 3899). No difference was seen concerning the effects of auxin on division of cells derived from normal or transformed protoplasts.

The introduction of the aux 1 and aux 2 genes enabled the auxin-autonomous growth of BY- 2 cells, but the introduction of the rolABCD genes did not affect the auxin requirement of the BY- 2 cells.

The intergenic region separating the rolB and C genes represents a bidirectional promoter. This bidirectional promoter regulates transcription for both genes in a similar fashion in aerial organs of the plants, but in a distinct way in roots. Moreover, both rolB and C promoter activities differ from those characteristic of the rolA promoter.

40|$|In vitro gene {{chemical}} synthesis {{is a powerful}} tool to improve the expression of gene in heterologous system. In this study, a two-step gene synthesis strategy that combines an assembly PCR and an overlap extension PCR (AOE) was developed. In this strategy, the chemically synthesized oligonucleotides were assembled into several 200 – 500 bp fragments with 20 – 25 bp overlap at each end by assembly PCR, and then an overlap extension PCR was conducted to assemble all these fragments into a full length DNA sequence. Using this method, we de novo designed and optimized the codon of Rhizopus oryzae lipase <b>gene</b> <b>ROL</b> (810 bp) and Aspergillus niger phytase gene phyA (1404 bp).

We demonstrate here that the fragility difference between BXD- 31 and DBA/ 2 is the consequence of allelic variation at a single autosomal locus, termed rol. The resistance allele (rol(r)) is almost completely recessive to the sensitive one (rol(s)). Results of bone marrow chimera analyses indicate that (1) the mode of <b>rol</b> <b>gene</b> action is by a direct influence on the properties of the red cells rather than an indirect influence on their extracellular milieu, and (2) rol does not affect erythrocyte production and turnover.

This study describes the molecular characterization of the corresponding wzz (<b>rol)</b> <b>gene,</b> responsible for modulating O-antigen chain length. P. aeruginosa O 5 Wzz has 19 to 20 % amino acid identity with Wzz of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Shigella flexneri. Knockout mutations of the wzz gene in serotypes O 5 and O 16 (which has an O antigen structurally related to that of O 5) yielded mutants expressing O antigens with a distribution of chain lengths differing markedly {{from that of the}} parent strains. Unlike enteric wzz mutants, the P. aeruginosa wzz mutants continued to display some chain length modulation. The P. aeruginosa O 5 wzz gene complemented both O 5 and O 16 wzz mutants as well as an E. coli wzz mutant. Coexpression of E. coli and P. aeruginosa wzz genes in a rough strain of E. coli carrying the P. aeruginosa wbp cluster resulted in the expression of two populations of O-antigen chain lengths. Sequence analysis of the region upstream of wzz led to identification of the genes rpsA and himD, encoding 30 S ribosomal subunit protein S 1 and integration host factor, respectively. This finding places rpsA and himD adjacent to wzz and the wbp cluster at 37 min on the PAO 1 chromosomal map and completes the delineation of the O 5 serogroup-specific region of the wbp cluster.

A depression of rooting capability was caused by the inclusion of rolC together with rolB (rolB+C). In all cases co-inoculation with the Agrobacterium carrying TR-DNA-borne auxin genes was necessary for root induction since none of the rol constructions was in itself capable of eliciting any response; an exceeding majority of these roots were however shown to contain <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> but no TR-DNA.

The rol::Km and rfbD::Km mutations prevented plaque formation on HeLa cells, but neither mutation affected the ability of S. flexneri to invade and replicate in HeLa cells. Microscopy of bacteria-infected HeLa cells stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -phalloidin demonstrated that both the rol::Km and rfbD::Km mutants were defective in F-actin tail formation: the latter mutant showed distorted F-actin tails. Plasma-membrane protrusions were occasionally observed. Investigation of the location of IcsA (required for F-actin tail formation) on the cell surface by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy showed that while most rol mutant bacteria produced little or no cell-surface IcsA, 10 % resembled the parental bacterial cell (which had IcsA at one cell pole; the rfbD mutant had IcsA located over its entire cell surface although it was more concentrated {{at one end of the}} cell).

All five mutants and GR- 12 were analyzed for survival in 80 % serum. The GR- 12 parent was resistant, exhibiting a 500 % increase in numbers. The rol, rfbKM, rfbD, and kfiC-rfbD mutants were sensitive, experiencing 99 %, 99. 9 %, 99. 9 %, and at least 99. 999 % killing, respectively, in the first hour. The kfiC mutant, however, increased in numbers in the first hour but experienced delayed sensitivity, decreasing in viability by 80 % in the third hour. Single mutants were complemented with the wild-type gene in trans, showing restoration of the wild-type phenotype and serum resistance.

Results were discussed in terms of silencing of rolA, B and C genes in N. glauca and their expression in the hybrid. Hence, it could be concluded that DNA hypermethylation of <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> in N. glauca resulted in their silencing causing normal morphology and behavior of the plant, whereas DNA hypomethylation of <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> was responsible for their expression in the hybrid causing morphological abnormalities and tumorigensis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Camptothecin {{derivatives}} are clinically used as anti-tumor alkaloids {{that are}} currently obtained by extraction from intact plants. Seeking for the alternative sources for commercial production and for fundamental study, cell and tissue cultures have been investigated. In the present study, we developed a method for regeneration of Ophiorrhiza pumila plant from hairy roots transformed with Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The regeneration frequency was over 83 %. Integration of a <b>rol</b> B <b>gene</b> from T-DNA of A. rhizogenes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in both of the hairy roots and the regenerated plants. The transformed plants accumulated camptothecin in amounts of 66 – 111 % compared with that in the wild-type plants. Key words: Camptothecin, indole alkaloids, Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Camptothecin (CPT) {{is one of the}} modified monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, originally identified in the extracts of Camptotheca acuminata (Nyssaceae) during a screening project for anti-tumor agents by the National Cancer Institute in the United States (Wall et al. 1966).

40|$|The growth {{parameters}} of transformed root cultures, total phenolic content and phenolic acids composition {{has been studied}} in root cultures, which were obtained from various explants of buckwheat by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains A 4. The methods of obtaining of the transformed root cultures, total phenol estimation, gas-liquid chromatography and polymerase chain reaction has been used. Elevated levels of total phenols in transformed roots of buckwheat from different sources of explants have been found. The high content of chlorogenic, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-anisic and caffeic acids has been discovered in the root cultures, {{which can be used}} for their industrial production. Maximal root growth was equal 21. 2 g/l of dry weight in the roots as source for root culture, 17. 7 g/l with leaves and 14. 6 g/l with stems at 3 week after placement.

30|$|An {{efficient}} {{protocol for}} hairy root induction in Berberis aristata DC. was established using two different strains of Agrobacterium rhizogenes, MTCC 532 and 2364 from IMTECH (Institute of Microbial Technology), Chandigarh, India. The strain 532 {{was more effective}} than strain 2364 in hairy root induction and in vitro grown callus (61.11  ±  1.60  % transformation frequency) {{was found to be}} suitable explant in comparison to leaves (42.59  ±  0.92  % transformation frequency) and nodal segments (34.25  ±  0.92  % transformation frequency) of in vitro grown microshoots for hairy root induction. The presence of rol A and <b>rol</b> B <b>genes</b> during amplification confirmed the transgenic nature of hairy roots and transformed callus. Transformation frequency of callus was further enhanced (from 61.11  ±  1.60  % to 72.22  ±  1.60  %; when infection time was 1  h) by using acetosyringone (100  µM) during co-cultivation period (48  h) on semisolid MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium. In conclusion, this study describes the protocol for hairy root induction which could further be useful for the production of berberin and may reduce the overharvesting of this endangered species from its natural habitat.|$|R

Abstract—Plasmid constructions containing rolA, rolB and rolC genes, isolated earlier {{from the}} TL-DNA of Agrobacterium rhizogenes {{were used to}} transform a cell culture (strain 1 c) of Panax ginseng. The levels of ginsenosides were measured in the resulting transgenic tissues to evaluate the possible role of <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> in ginsenoside formation. The ginsenoside content of the hairy root culture of P. ginseng, transformed by wild type A 4 plasmid DNA and containing all rol loci, was {{higher than that of}} the control 1 c culture (5. 12 – 8. 92 mg gÿ 1 dry wt), being in the range of 13. 23 – 21. 27 mg gÿ 1 dry wt. Ginseng tissue, transgenic for the rolA gene appeared to lose the ability to synthesize ginsenosides since only a trace amount of Re ginse-noside was found in 1 c-rolA tissue. 1 c-rolB cultures contained at least five times lower ginsenoside levels compared to the initial 1 c culture. The ginsenoside content of rolC transgenic roots was about three times higher than that of the respective control. Taking into account the dierences in cell dierentiation levels in tissues transformed by <b>rol</b> <b>genes,</b> we compared the ginsenoside levels in rolC roots and tumours. It was found that ginsenoside production in tissues with dierent levels of dierentiation is nearly the same. We have concluded that the plant oncogene rolC is responsible for increased ginsenoside formation in ginsen...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we report}} on the {{nucleotide}} sequences of the <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> of Escherichia coli O 75 and Salmonella typhimurium LT 2. The rol gene in E. coli was previously shown to encode a 36 -kDa protein that regulates size distribution of the O-antigen moiety of lipopolysaccharide. The E. coli and S. typhimurium rol gene sequences consist of 978 and 984 nucleotides, respectively. The homology between the nucleotide sequences of these two genes was found to be 68. 9 %. Both the E. coli rol and S. typhimurium <b>rol</b> <b>genes</b> are transcribed counter to the histidine operon and code for deduced polypeptides of 325 and 327 amino acids, respectively. The S. typhimurium rol gene was previously identified to encode a protein of unknown function and to share a transcription termination region with his. The homology between these deduced polypeptide sequences was observed to be 72 %. A complementation test was performed in which the S. typhimurium rol gene was placed in trans with an E. coli plasmid (pRAB 3) which encodes the O 75 rfb gene cluster and not rol. The protein expressed from the S. typhimurium rol gene was found to regulate the distribution of the O 75 O polysaccharide on the lipopolysaccharide of the host strain, E. coli S phi 874. The mechanism of Rol action may be independent of O antigen subunit structure, and its presence may be conserved in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and other gram-negative bacilli that express O polysaccharides on their surface membrane...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{fusion of}} myoblasts {{leading to the}} {{formation}} of myotubes {{is an integral part of}} skeletal myogenesis in many organisms. In Drosophila, specialized founder myoblasts initiate fusion through expression of the receptor-like attractant Dumbfounded (Duf), which brings them into close contact with other myoblasts. Here, we identify <b>Rols</b> 7, a <b>gene</b> expressed in founders, as an essential component for fusion during myotube formation. During fusion, Rols 7 localizes in a Duf-dependent manner at membrane sites that contact other myoblasts. These sites are also enriched with D-Titin, which functions to maintain myotube structure and morphology. When Rols 7 is absent or its localization is perturbed, the enrichment of D-Titin fails to occur. Rols 7 integrates the initial event of myoblast attraction with the downstream event of myotube structural organization by linking Duf to D-Titin...|$|R
40|$|Plants are {{composed}} of chemical elements, which uptake, distribution and accumulation are controlled by genetic and environmental factors. Particularly, plants face adverse or limiting conditions by activating a complex system of physiological and metabolic responses. High temperatures, together with other stress factors induced by global climate change, may significantly affect the growth and development of plants; heat stress conditions showed to delay plant’s growth, damage its cell membranes, increase transpiration and reduce {{the opening of the}} stomata. In this work, Nicotiana langsdorffii plants, wild and transgenic for the Agrobacterium rhizogenes rol C and <b>rol</b> D <b>gene</b> and the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene, were exposed to heat stress. The responses of the transgenic plants to the abiotic stresses were assessed by the analysis of the plant ionomic profile, the metabolomic data and the phytormonal profile (1, 2). Simultaneous determination of 12 elements was carried out by ICP-MS equipped with a collision/reaction cell (ICP-ORS-MS). WT, Rol D and Rol C plants showed higher changes both in the ionomic and in the metabolic profile, suggesting that these genotypes could be more affected by heat stress exposition. On the contrary GR plants showed almost unchanged values of many elements and organic compounds (including phytohormone and lipids) indicating that this genetic modification could provide a higher plant resistance toward heat stress. Statistical analysis permitted to highlight the main significant differences among the metabolic responses of the examined genotype...|$|R
40|$|Nicotiana langsdorffii plants, {{wild and}} {{transgenic}} for the Agrobacterium rhizogenes <b>rol</b> C <b>gene</b> and the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene, {{were exposed to}} different abiotic stresses (high temperature, water deficit, and high chromium concentrations). An untargeted metabolomic analysis {{was carried out in}} order to investigate the metabolic effects of the inserted genes in response to the applied stresses and to obtain a comprehensive profiling of metabolites induced during abiotic stresses. High-performance liquid chromatography separation (HPLC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) enabled the identification of more than 200 metabolites, and statistical analysis highlighted the most relevant compounds for each plant treatment. The plants exposed to heat stress showed a unique set of induced secondary metabolites, some of which were known while others were not previously reported for this kind of stress; significant changes were observed especially in lipid composition. The role of trichome, as a protection against heat stress, is here suggested by the induction of both acylsugars and glykoalkaloids. Water deficit and Cr(VI) stresses resulted mainly in enhanced antioxidant (HCAs, polyamine) levels and in the damage of lipids, probably as a consequence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, the ability of rol C expression to prevent oxidative burst was confirmed. The results highlighted a clear influence of GR modification on plant stress response, especially to water deficiency-a phenomenon whose applications should be further investigated. This study provides new insights into the field of system biology and demonstrates the importance of metabolomics in the study of plant functioning. Graphical Abstract Untargeted metabolomic analysis was applied to wild type, GR and RolC modified Nicotiana Langsdorffii plants exposed to heat, water and Cr(VI) stresses. The key metabolites, highly affected by stress application, were identified, allowing to outline the main metabolic responses to stress in each plant genotype...|$|R
