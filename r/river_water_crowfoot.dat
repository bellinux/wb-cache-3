40|$|Populations of many {{freshwater}} {{species are}} becoming increasingly threatened {{as a result of}} a wide range of anthropogenically mediated factors. In the present study, we wanted to assess levels and patterns of genetic diversity in Ireland's sole population of the <b>River</b> <b>water</b> <b>crowfoot</b> (Ranunculus fluitans), which is restricted to a 12 km stretch of a single river, to assist the formation of conservation strategies. Analysis using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) indicated comparable levels of genetic diversity to those exhibited by a more extensive population of the species in England, and revealed no evidence of clonal reproduction. Allele-specific PCR analysis of five nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indicated no evidence of hybridization with its more abundant congener Ranunculus penicillatus, despite previous anecdotal reports of the occurrence of hybrids. Although the population currently exhibits healthy levels of genetic diversity and is not at risk of genetic assimilation via hybridization with R. penicillatus, it still remains vulnerable to other factors such as stochastic events and invasive species.

5000|$|As {{noted by}} Johnsgard (2010): [...] "Most {{observers}} agree that heavily forested rivers that are relatively swift-flowing are the preferred habitat of this species, although they also occur on slow-moving rivers and on pools or ponds of the adjoining forest areas. They {{are said to}} consume both vegetable and animal materials, and have been observed eating small snails that abound on stony shingle beaches. Stomach remains from two birds that were examined contained the seeds of <b>water</b> <b>crowfoot</b> (Batrachium), <b>water</b> milfoil (Myriophyllum), and a bulrush, leaves of <b>water</b> <b>crowfoot,</b> foliage and seeds of a pondweed, and caddis fly larvae {{as well as a}} few other aquatic insect remains (Phillips, 1922-26).

50|$|The {{lake was}} formed when {{the site was}} used for the {{extraction}} of sand, gravel and limestone between 1969 and 1975, and an Iron Age house was found during the extraction. In the 1980s the site was restored to become a nature reserve. The lake is important for aquatic birds such as terns and coot, and plants such as <b>water</b> <b>crowfoot</b> and reedmace. A wild flower meadow provides a habitat for butterflies. There is also woodland, grassland and a limestone cliff.|$|R
5|$|The {{saltmarsh}} contains glassworts {{and common}} cord {{grass in the}} most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The drier areas contain maritime grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass. The reedbeds are dominated by common reed with saltmarsh rush, brackish <b>water</b> <b>crowfoot,</b> sea clubrush and common bulrush also common in the various wetland habitats.|$|R
50|$|The Bybrook has {{significant}} populations of <b>water</b> <b>crowfoot,</b> native white-clawed crayfish and dippers.

Freshwater fish, found include specifically the brown trout, grayling and bullhead. To support the fish population there is a rich diversity of invertebrates, including the mayfly.|$|R
50|$|The River Kennet is a {{haven for}} various plants and animals. Its course takes it through the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the river between Marlborough and Woolhampton is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The protection that this status affords the Kennet means that many endangered species {{of plants and animals}} can be found here. The white drifts of <b>water</b> <b>crowfoot</b> (Ranunculus) in early summer are characteristic of chalk and limestone rivers; there are superb displays by the footbridge at Chilton Foliat, and by the road bridge in Hungerford.|$|R

50|$|These vast {{bodies of}} water of some fifty {{hectares}} are equipped with a bathing area that combines water recreation, fitness and nature discovery. The site of the Monnerie is a mosaic of lakes and meadows situated in a bend of the Loire with a rich biodiversity. Many animal and plant species coexist in these places: herons, reed warbler, coot, hare, ermine, green frog, frog, dragonfly, snail, reed, iris, <b>water</b> <b>crowfoot,</b> and water-plantain make this site a popular place for walkers and naturalists. The preservation of these wetlands helps maintain biodiversity. The lakes {{are the result of}} the operation of a gravel pit, and wet meadows. Each winter, over thirty migratory species (e.g. greylag goose, pochard, teal) find shelter here.|$|R
