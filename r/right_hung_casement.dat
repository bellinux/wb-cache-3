The building is enhanced by potted palms, ferns and hanging baskets of tropical rainforest plants.|$|R
60|$|The {{windows were}} glazed in lattice panes of leadwork, <b>hung</b> in <b>{{casement}}s.</b> He broke {{one of the}} panes with a stone, thrust his hand through the hole, unfastened the latch which held the casement close, and began opening the window.|$|R
50|$|The hall is {{constructed}} from dressed stone with a hipped slate roof. The main frontage {{of the building}} faces south and is composed of three storeys and a seven window range, the windows are mostly 20th century top <b>hung</b> <b>casements</b> with moulded surrounds and keystones.

2500|$|In Australia, the [...] "{{refrigerator}} rule" [...] applies, and {{a refrigerator}} door is not opened from the inside.

60|$|Pierson did not {{shut his}} eyes; he opened {{them as he}} fell on his knees. In the seat behind, Noel and young Morland had also fallen on their knees their faces covered each with a single hand; but her left hand and his <b>right</b> <b>hung</b> at their sides. They prayed {{a little longer than}} any others and, on rising, sang the hymn a little louder.|$|R
60|$|Her {{left hand}} still held mine, but her <b>right</b> hand <b>hung</b> listlessly at her side. He raised it gently to his lips--touched it with them, rather than kissed it--bowed to me--and then, with perfect {{delicacy}} and discretion, silently quitted the room.|$|R
50|$|The Station Main Building's {{northern}} wing comprises three {{rooms and}} a semi-enclosed, west-facing verandah. It is supported on low concrete stumps, and timber and steel posts. Tongue-and-groove jointed boarding lines the ceilings of each {{room and the}} floors are covered in vinyl or carpet. The walls of the central room are sheeted while {{the walls of the}} other two rooms have vertically-jointed boards with moulded belt rails. The rooms contain some solid timber furniture, wall-hung cupboards, and workbenches that appear original to the 1932 construction date. One original timber-boarded door remains in the southern-most room. The original windows are timber-framed and double- <b>hung</b> or <b>casements</b> with fanlights. Air conditioning units have replaced some windows however those remaining retain original brass hardware.|$|R
60|$|It was Randy who {{uttered the}} words, as he danced {{around the floor}} of the living-room, almost on top of the stove. The fire had burned low during the night, and he had just shoved in some fresh wood and opened the draughts. Going to the little window of the sleeping-apartment, he looked through the single pane of glass at the thermometer, which <b>hung</b> on the <b>casement</b> outside. The mercury {{registered}} twenty-two degrees below zero.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Crisparkle goes in, {{with the}} hat {{that has so}} easily, so almost imperceptibly, {{acquired}} the <b>right</b> to be <b>hung</b> up in his hall; hangs it up; and goes thoughtfully to bed.|$|R
60|$|His brain still whirled {{with the}} {{emotions}} that had so lately overwhelmed his mind; his <b>right</b> hand <b>hung</b> helplessly by his side, dragged after him like a prisoner's chain, and lacerated by the uneven surface of the ground over which it was slowly drawn, as--supporting himself on his left arm, and creeping forward a few inches at a time--he set forth on his toilsome journey.|$|R
5000|$|... Mary Beth from Minneapolis, Minnesota {{created the}} WCCD flag {{shown on the}} <b>right,</b> and <b>hung</b> it up on a flag pole outside her house. She flew it for {{everyone}} to see, and invited several media sources from Minneapolis to report on it and film the event. Additionally, she also sent Josh a flag {{to thank him for}} his community-wide efforts in Crohn's disease and Colitis. (Insert picture).|$|R

60|$|That was {{a comforting}} reflection. It not only {{justified}} a slow progress up the hill, {{but at the}} crest a sprawl on the turf beside the road, to contemplate the Weald from the south. In a matter of two days he had crossed that spacious valley, with its frozen surge of green hills, its little villages and townships here and there, its copses and cornfields, its ponds and streams like jewelery of diamonds and silver glittering in the sun. The North Downs were hidden, far away beyond the Wealden Heights. Down below was the little village of Cocking, and half-way up the hill, a mile perhaps to the <b>right,</b> <b>hung</b> a flock of sheep grazing together. Overhead an anxious peewit circled against the blue, {{and every now and}} then emitted its feeble cry. Up here the heat was tempered by a pleasant breeze. Mr. Hoopdriver was possessed by unreasonable contentment; he lit himself a cigarette and lounged more comfortably. Surely the Sussex ale is made of the waters of Lethe, of poppies and pleasant dreams. Drowsiness coiled insidiously about him.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Professor Charles Frederick Holder and boatman Jim Gardner [Mexican Joe?] {{displaying}} a fish at Catalina, 1898. A large tuna fish {{can be seen}} at <b>right</b> <b>hung</b> by its gills from a pole. Jim Gardner is visible at center. He is wearing a large straw hat, vest and long pants. He has a long pole with a large metal hook at left. Dr. Holder is visible at left and can be seen wearing a corduroy suit and striped hat. He has a gray beard and glasses and is holding a long fishing pole. Holder was a conservationist, sportsman, and professor of Piscatorial science. Please note that some sources identify the boatman as "Mexican Joe" (also known as Jose Felice Presiado). "Avalon, June 2. [...] Prof. C. F. Holder of Pasadena, after a fight of about four hours in a heavy sea, with Jim Gardner as boatman, made the record catch probably of the world yesterday, taking a leaping tuna weighing 183 ponds on rod and reel and twenty-one cuttuhunk line [...] .

40|$|The {{vocabulary}} of the Hungarian Polonia Community {{is characterized by}} {{a relatively small number of}} words borrowed directly from Hungarian (ex. : bácsi uncle, mister, néni aunt, madam, lady etc.) and also by a large number of so called “hidden Hungarianisms”: that is to say Hungarian words, expressions, and word formations that are translated directly into Polish. In the lexical system of the Hungarian Polonia Community it is possible to distinguish two groups of “hidden Hungarianisms”: 1. Semantically borrowed words: punktualny – exact, precise, Hung. : pontos, Pol. : dokładny: to nie jest punktualna informacja; 2. Semantically borrowed word formations; mieć prawde – to be <b>right,</b> <b>Hung</b> [...] vkinek igaza van, Pol. : mieć rację: mama, masz prawdę. Thus the vocabulary system of the Hungarian Polish Community is expanding through this process of borrowing Hungarian words and word formations. This characteristic distinguishes the language of the Hungarian Polonia Community from the Polish language spoken in other Polonia communities, where the influence of the host country's language produces a large number of directly borrowed words...|$|R
6000|$|... 8. A course precipitous, of dizzy speed, [...] 190 Suspending {{thought and}} breath; a monstrous sight!

6000|$|... "That's the tune, sir; that's the tune, sir." [...] The words aimlessly {{repeated}} {{themselves in}} my brain, as if bringing me a message I could not grasp or understand. [...] "What was I thinking about?" [...] a voice kept asking me. A strange, sluggish look dwelt in the dilated pupils under the drooping lids when the moonbeams struck in on us {{from between the}} branches. His <b>right</b> hand <b>hung</b> loosely down. I clasped it--stone-cold.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another visitor," [...] Guy said. Getting up, he {{slightly}} drew aside a thick curtain that <b>hung</b> {{before a}} <b>casement,</b> {{a moment later}} he let it fall again. [...] "There are two men-at-arms standing {{on the other side of}} the street and one at the door." [...] He heard the door opened, then the boy's step was heard on the stairs, two or three minutes later there was a movement above and the sound of the footsteps of two men coming down. Presently the outside door closed, two or three minutes elapsed; then the door opened and the Italian entered.|$|R
5000|$|Born Henry Thaddeus Jones in 1859, {{he entered}} the Cork School of Art when he was ten years old. There he studied under the genre painter James Brenan. Thaddeus won the Taylor Prize in 1878 {{enabling}} {{him to go to}} London, and then again in 1879 enabling him to continue his studies in Paris at the Académie Julian. His first major painting (illustration, <b>right)</b> was <b>hung</b> [...] "on the line" [...] (at eye-level) at the Paris Salon of 1881.|$|R
5|$|Trent Milton {{was born}} in Newcastle, New South Wales, on 4 May 1972. He {{currently}} lives in Lake Cathie, New South Wales. On 5 March 2011, a motorcycle accident {{on the way home}} from work in Port Macquarie tore off his right leg. It also led to a brain injury. Doctors considered amputating both his arms – his <b>right</b> arm <b>hung</b> by a thread – but managed to save both, which they fastened back together with steel plates. He suffered post-traumatic amnesia, and spent a year in recovery.|$|R
60|$|As, with Le Chapelier, he {{was walking}} slowly and in silent dejection towards the {{entrance}} of the Bois, where they had left their carriage, they were passed by the caleche conveying La Tour d'Azyr and his second--which had originally driven almost right up to the spot of the encounter. The Marquis' wounded arm was carried in a sling improvised from his companion's sword-belt. His sky-blue coat with three collars had been buttoned over this, so that the <b>right</b> sleeve <b>hung</b> empty. Otherwise, saving a certain pallor, he looked much his usual self.|$|R

5|$|The {{back wall}} of the room, which is in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series of}} scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Peter Paul Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the <b>right</b> is <b>hung</b> with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|R
60|$|It needed but {{a glance}} at the new-comer to detect at once the form and {{features}} of the haughty aborigine,--the untaught and untrammeled son of the forest. Over one shoulder a blanket, negligently but gracefully thrown, disclosed a bare and powerful breast, decorated with a quantity of three-cent postage-stamps which he had despoiled from an Overland Mail stage a few weeks previous. A cast-off beaver of Judge Tompkins's, adorned by a simple feather, covered his erect head, from beneath which his straight locks descended. His <b>right</b> hand <b>hung</b> lightly by his side, while his left was engaged in holding on a pair of pantaloons, which the lawless grace and freedom of his lower limbs evidently could not brook.|$|R

60|$|Captain Vere, his {{lieutenant}} and ensign {{and his two}} pages, were quartered in {{the house}} of a wealthy merchant, whose family did all in their power to make them comfortable. It was a grand old house, and the boys, accustomed as they were to the splendours of Hedingham Castle, agreed that the simple merchants of the Low Countries were far in advance of English nobles in the comforts and conveniences of their dwellings. The walls of the rooms were all heavily panelled; rich curtains <b>hung</b> before the <b>casements.</b> The furniture was not only richly carved, but comfortable. Heavy hangings before the doors excluded draughts, and in the principal apartments Eastern carpets covered the floors. The meals were served on spotless white linen. Rich plates stood on the sideboard, and gold and silver vessels of rare carved work from Italy glittered in the armoires.|$|R
