50|$|The Association wasted little time; they {{despatched}} ten Cornish miners, {{a blacksmith}} and a captain {{to the site}} and began blasting on 29 September, and soon bullock drays loaded with the <b>red</b> <b>copper</b> oxide <b>ore</b> were inching their way to Port Adelaide. Within seven months the Association had made a profit of ₤20,000; and ₤90,000 in the first eighteen months. Some shareholders sold up and returned to England with their new-found wealth; Emanuel Solomon realised ₤200 for every ₤5 share {{and went on to}} other projects, others held on and reaped enormous dividends every year until 1860. In the twelve months to 31 March 1848, 13,533 tons of ore was shipped. By 1 September 1848 every ₤5 share had earned ₤50 for its owner, and ₤315 in the 21 years before the Association was dissolved. Meanwhile, the economy of South Australia, which had been in the doldrums since George Grey became Governor of South Australia in 1841, recovered completely.|$|R
60|$|The natives ate {{all their}} meat raw, lived {30} mostly on fish and 'ate grass and ice with delight.' They were rarely {{out of the}} water, but lived {{in the nature of}} fishes except when 'dead sleep took them,' and they lay down {{exhausted}} in a warm hollow of the rocks. Davis found among them <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> and black and <b>red</b> <b>copper.</b> But Frobisher's experience seems to have made him loath to hunt for mineral treasure.|$|R
50|$|Copper {{also can}} be found in the Watchungs. Near Belleville, <b>ore</b> {{containing}} 8% <b>copper</b> was discovered, and a copper mine once operated in the area. Other <b>copper</b> bearing <b>ores</b> have been noted near Paterson. These ores typically contain cuprite (<b>red</b> <b>copper</b> oxide) and/or copper carbonate in a matrix of red or gray sandstone. Pyritous copper, also known as chalcopyrite, is not known to exist in ores found in the Watchungs.|$|R
40|$|Polish <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> are {{exploited}} {{from the}} Legnicko-Glowacki copper district and this raw material is the feed for mineral plants. Polish <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> are the mixtures of three lithological types: carbonate, sandstone and shale. The carbonate type of <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> {{is represented by}} dolomite mineral and shale type — by slate mineral. Each of them features by different values of physic-mechanical and chemicals, what influences on the enrichment process [2]...|$|R
50|$|In 1700 almost 230 tons of <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> {{was shipped}} from the Dhyrnane Mine mine at Maughold whilst also {{at this time}} the Rushen and Kirk Arbory mines were {{producing}} significant quantities of <b>copper</b> <b>ore.</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> at Mount Isa (Queensland, Australia) are {{hosted by}} the Urquhart Shale, a metamorphosed Proterozoic {{sequence}} of dolomitic siltstones and shales. Sulfur isotope data from <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> and their hosts suggest hat the highly pyritic Urquhart Shale provided a major sulfur component o the <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> and also that variable contributions from an 34 S-enriched source have been added along with copper by the hydrothermal brine. The ratio of sedimentary-diagenetic sulfur to introduced sulfur is poorly constrained because of the probable isotopic heterogeneity of the sedimentary-diagenetic pyrite {{at the onset of}} copper mineral-ization. The isotopic evidence for large-scale incorporation of sedin•entary sulfide sulfur into the epigenetic <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> is consistent with the suggestion that the sulfides in the replaced metasediments were an important ingredient in the chemical trap that contributed to the localization of the <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> at Mount Isa...|$|R
50|$|Historically, Redruth {{was a small}} {{market town}} overshadowed by its {{neighbours}} until a boom in the demand for <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> during the 18th century. <b>Copper</b> <b>ore</b> had mostly been discarded by the Cornish tin-mining industry but was now needed to make brass, an essential metal in the Industrial Revolution. Surrounded by <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> deposits, Redruth quickly {{became one of the}} largest and richest mining areas in Britain and the town's population grew markedly, although most miners' families remained poor.|$|R
50|$|The {{source of}} copper could have either been a <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> (such as malachite), filings from copper ingots, or bronze scrap and other alloys. Prior to the New Kingdom, {{evidence}} is scarce {{as to which}} copper source was being used, but it {{is believed to have}} been <b>copper</b> <b>ores.</b> During the New Kingdom, evidence has been found for the use of copper alloys, such as bronze, due to the presence of varying amounts of tin, arsenic, or lead found in the Egyptian blue material. The presence of tin oxide could have come from <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> that contained tin oxide and not from the use of bronze. However, no <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> have been found with these amounts of tin oxide. It is unclear as yet, why there would have been a switch from the use of <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> in earlier periods, to the use of bronze scrap during the Late Bronze Age. Reserves possibly had run out.|$|R

5000|$|A second mechanism, and {{probably}} the most important in most mining operations, involves chemical oxidation of the <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> with ferric (Fe3+) ions formed by the microbial oxidation of ferrous ions (derived from the oxidation of pyrite).Three possible reactions for the oxidation of <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> are: ...|$|R
50|$|By weight, more coal than <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> {{is needed}} for the process of {{smelting}} <b>copper</b> from the <b>ore,</b> so it is more economical to build the smelter near the coal source. Swansea had very local mines, a navigable river, a nearby supply of limestone (necessary as flux), and trading links across the Bristol Channel to Cornwall and Devon, sources of <b>copper</b> <b>ore.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Sternberg Mine at Copper Flat {{produced}} 200 tons of <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> between 1911 and 1934. By 1959, Bear Creek Mining Company {{had discovered}} a mineralized breccia pipe within the stock. Quintana Minerals Corporation started open-pit mining in 1980, averaging 0.45 per cent <b>copper.</b> <b>Ore</b> minerals include pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{probably}} mine workings {{in the area}} of Wheal Busy since the 16th century, {{but it was not until}} the 1720s that the mine started to produce large amounts of <b>copper</b> <b>ore.</b> The principal landowner was the Boscawen family.The mine was located in what was known at the time as [...] "the richest square mile on Earth". During its life it produced over 100,000 tons of <b>copper</b> <b>ore,</b> and 27,000 tons of arsenic. The mine adopted the name of Wheal Busy after 1823. At one time the mine also smelted the <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> it produced.|$|R

25|$|By 1884, {{the quality}} of the <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> {{produced}} at Devon Great Consols was poor, yielding more arsenic than copper. After being sorted by the mine's bal maidens, the <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> was sent to south Wales to be smelted. The company began exploring the possibility of tin deposits at the mine but found none.|$|R
50|$|The title Tilva Roš is {{the name}} of the area around Bor where the first {{geological}} explorations of <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> were done in the late 19th century.

50|$|Some limited {{statistics}} have survived: in 1849, 21,713 tons were carried, {{of which}} 7,546 tons were <b>copper</b> <b>ore,</b> and 6,175 tons were coal;in 1859, 48,193 tons were carried, of which 17,361 tons were <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> and 15,712 tons were coal, {{as well as}} 8,297 tons of granite.

It further presents results of chemical and spectral analysis of ore-bearing rocks, evaluation of its current state and potential possibilities of their use in the past. Based upon a statement that metal objects produced during the existence of the Tripolye culture were made of pure copper two methods of its procurement were considered: (a) from a virgin copper, and (b) from oxygenated <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> of sedimentary origin in which a small number of admixtures was noticed.
