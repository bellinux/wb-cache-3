5000|$|Armitage {{was born}} in Hartford Connecticut and moved to Beverly Hills in 1956, when he was 13. [...] "What a culture shock," [...] he {{reflected}} later. [...] "I’m still reeling. In Connecticut there wasn’t a hot rod in sight. Out here it was people racing {{up and down the}} street, building their own cars—it was teenage paradise, the kids were running everything." [...] He attended UCLA where he majored in economics and political science. While waiting for his <b>real</b> estate <b>licence</b> to come through, Armitage entered the film industry in 1965 via the mail room at 20th Century Fox. He later said:I have a very personal relationship to film. I've gone to films all the time since I was a kid. I thought I could have some fun trying to make them. I always thought I was pretty close to what people were thinking. There's lots of tricks to be played, things to be done in film. Film is so close to the way the mind works - the way the mind communicates with itself. Film is a dream, an emotional coda.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{licensing}} of the telecommunication spectrum as a public good and the search for equilibrium prices through bilateral bargaining and multilateral bidding. It develops a general model of price setting under dynamic uncertainty and applies it to the Italian auction for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The empirical application shows that the model can be used both to determine the base price as well as other desirable characteristics to organize an auction and to better understand, after the auction is closed, what really happened in terms of the critical factors involved. After recalling some basic concepts on spectrum rights and reviewing the general experience with UMTS auctions in Europe, the formal model and its application are presented. The results confirm certain views on the Italian auction, which are widely shared but were never tested before, namely that: (i) given the initial price, the number of licenses offered for the bidding should have been fewer, or alternatively, (ii) given the number of licenses, the base price should have been higher and (iii) the main bidder underpaid for the license. The model also allows us to quantify the bidders' reservation price and the State and the bidders' implicit bargaining powers. UMTS Auction <b>Real</b> option <b>Licence...</b>|$|R
50|$|Heart is {{a network}} of 21 adult-contemporary pop {{stations}} which currently broadcasts in numerous areas of England, Wales and central Scotland. The network began with a single regional station in the West Midlands and subsequently a second station in London. The third station, Heart 106 in the East Midlands (previously Century 106) was sold to Orion Media and run as a franchise retaining the Heart name until the start of 2011 where it was rebranded to Gem 106. In 2009 many of the heritage CHR stations which had formed part of the One Network were renamed Heart, as were Ocean and South Hams Radio (which {{were not part of}} the One Network). Heart Hertfordshire is owned by Adventure Radio and uses the Heart name and format under licence from Global; Heart South Devon is partly owned by UKRD Group; and Heart stations in North Wales and Yorkshire (both formerly <b>Real</b> Radio <b>licences)</b> are operated by Communicorp; all other Heart stations are wholly Global-owned. All of the Real Radio stations were rebranded as Heart on Tuesday 6 May 2014. Heart is also available on DAB in some areas where there is not a local Heart station on FM; these areas generally receiving Heart Digital, which is a relay of Heart London.|$|R
40|$|Exclusive rights {{granted by}} public authorities, like {{concessions}} to develop natural resources or electromagnetic spectrum licences, often have option-like features. However, to avoid licences being unused for lengthy periods, regulators sometimes set time limits, {{after which the}} exclusive right of exercise may be revoked. In this paper we analyse the impact of use or lose ("UOL") provisions upon the private time of investment. We find {{that the risk of}} losing the licence because of inaction generally increases the probability of early investment. However, when capital costs are expected to decline over time, UOL provisions may involve a "perverse effect", by increasing, rather than reducing, the expected time of investment, with respect to a situation where the date of investment is left entirely to the licencee’s discretion. <b>Licences,</b> <b>Real</b> Options, Use or Lose Provisions, Time of Investment...|$|R
40|$|For the {{competitiveness}} of an advanced economy like Germany, both the successful production of innovations and their efficient diffusion into the market by technical standards among others are decisive. Therefore, in contrast to most other empirical studies, an aggregate production function for Germany from 1960 until 1996 is estimated, integrating these two aspects. We distinguish between technical progress which {{is a result of}} own national R&D activities, and the import of technological know-how through licence agreements, approximated by the indicator variables stock of patents and <b>real</b> expenditures for <b>licences.</b> In addition, the diffusion of technology throughout the economy by official technical standards is integrated in the long-term production function, approximated by the stock of effective technical standards. This superior long-term production function, including the usual production factors capital and labour as well as the three indicator variables, is then used to assess the effects of the different sources on economic growth from 1961 until 199...|$|R
