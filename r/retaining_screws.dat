Methodology: Four implant analogues were placed in a polyurethane mandibular model at the position of left and right first and second molar. Abutments were fixed to the implant at a torque of 25 Ncm. Two such models were made. Four different prostheses were placed on abutment of each model i. e <b>screw</b> <b>retained</b> splinted, <b>screw</b> <b>retained</b> nonsplinted, cement retained splinted, cement retained non splinted. Four strain gauges were attached on the model, two on the buccal and two on the lingual aspect of each implant. Static load of 400 N was applied on the prosthesis using universal testing machine.

40|$|MDent, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandPURPOSE The {{purpose of}} this in vitro {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} effect of using either gold or titanium <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> on preload in the dental implant body-abutment complex. This preload is of vital importance for the long term success of the dental implant complex. Inadequate preload results in either loosening or fracture of the retaining screw, and is the most commonly occurring mechanical complication in implant supported/retained prostheses. Similar complications occur when excessive preload is applied to the <b>retaining</b> <b>screws.</b> These complications can result in unscheduled visits with costly and time consuming repairs for the clinician and patient. Routine maintenance protocols for implant supported prostheses range from biannually to five year visits to the dentist. Maintenance visits involve removal of the prosthesis facilitating cleaning of both the implant and prosthesis and inspection of <b>retaining</b> <b>screws.</b> This study sought to gain insight into changes in preload generation after repeated torque application to gold and titanium screws and to observe whether gold or titanium generated better preload. A maintenance protocol would be suggested if any observable pattern was noted. MATERIALS AND METHODS The test setup consisted of an implant body, a cylindrical transmucosal abutment and the <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> (gold or titanium). The implant body was anchored using a load cell. Transmucosal abutments were attached to the implant body using either a gold or titanium v retaining screw. A torque gauge was used to apply torque of 20 Ncm, 32 Ncm and 40 Ncm to the <b>retaining</b> <b>screws.</b> This was undertaken to investigate the effect of gold or titanium on preload generated. The effect of applying torque beyond manufacturers recommended 32 Ncm was carried out to see if greater preloads could be achieved. All components were from the Southern Implant system. RESULTS Gold <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> were found to achieve consistently higher preload values than titanium <b>retaining</b> <b>screws.</b> Preload values were not significantly different from the first to the tenth torque cycle. Titanium screws showed more consistent preload values, albeit lower than those of gold <b>retaining</b> <b>screws.</b> However due to possible galling of the internal thread of the implant body by titanium screws, gold screws remain the retaining screw of choice. Maintenance protocols suggest replacing <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> every 20 years. After ten torque cycles were applied to each screw there was an insignificant change in preload generated in both titanium and gold screws. This study was therefore inconclusive with regards to maintenance protocols. CONCLUSION Within the limitations of this study, gold <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> generated better preload than titanium. Torque application beyond manufacturers’ recommendations resulted in a more stable implant complex. Further investigation into repeated torque application to <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> is required, to determine ideal maintenance protocols...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to perform a failure {{analysis}} on fractured prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> after long-term use in vivo. Additionally, the study addresses the commonly asked question regarding whether complex repeated functional occlusal forces initiate fatigue-type cracks in prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws.</b> Materials and Methods: Ten fractured prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> retrieved from three patients treated with fixed detachable hybrid prostheses were subjected to a failure analysis. In patients 1 and 2, the middle three <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> of the prostheses were found fractured at retrieval time after they had been in service for 20 and 19 months, respectively. In patient 3, the middle three and one of the posterior <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> were found to be fractured at retrieval after they had been in service for 18 months. Low power stereomicroscopy and high-power scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to analyze the fractured surfaces of the <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> examining fatigue cracks in greater detail. Results: Typical fatigue failure characterized by ratchet mark formation was revealed by light microscopy and SEM for all examined screws. Using low magnification light microscopy, ratchet marks were visible on the fracture surfaces of only two screws. SEM examination revealed all three classical stages of fatigue failure, and it was possible to see the ratchet marks on the fracture surfaces of all specimens, indicating a fatigue zone. The final catastrophic overload fracture appeared fibrous, indicating ductile fracture. The final overload ductile fracture surfaces showed equiaxed dimples, suggesting tensile overload in all examined screws except in two specimens that showed an elongated dimple pattern indicating shear/tearing overload forces. Conclusions: Fracture of prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> in hybrid prostheses occurs mainly through a typical fatigue mode involving mostly the middle anterior three screws. Fatigue cracks can grow in more than one prosthetic retaining screw, leading to fracture before the patient or clinician determines that any problem exists. King Saud Universit...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the preload and tensile fracture load values of prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> after long-term use in vivo compared to unused screws (controls). Additionally, the investigation addressed whether the preload and fracture load values of prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> reported by the manufacturer become altered after long-term use in vivo. Materials and Methods: For preload testing, 10 new screws (controls) from Nobel Biocare (NB) and 73 used <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> [58 from NB and 15 from Sterngold (SG) ] were subjected to preload testing. For tensile testing, eight controls from NB and 58 used <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> (46 from NB and 12 from SG) were subjected to tensile testing. Used screws for both tests were in service for 18 – 120 months. A custom load frame, load cell, and torque wrench setup were used for preload testing. All 83 prosthetic screws were torqued once to 10 Ncm, and the produced preload value was recorded (N) using an X–Y plotter. Tensile testing was performed on a universal testing machine and the resulting tensile fracture load value was recorded (N). Preload and tensile fracture load values were analyzed with 2 -way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests. Results: There was a signiﬁcant difference between preload values for screws from NB and screws from SG (p < 0. 001). The preload values for gold alloy screws from NB decreased as the number of years in service increased. There was a signiﬁcant difference between tensile fracture values for the three groups (gold alloy screws from NB and SG and palladium alloy screws from NB) at p < 0. 001. The tensile fracture values for gold alloy screws from NB and SG decreased as the number of years in service increased. Conclusions: In ﬁxed detachable hybrid prostheses, perhaps as a result of galling, the intended preload values of prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> may decrease with increased in-service time. The reduction of the fracture load value may be related to the increase of in-service time; however, the actual determination of this relationship is not possible from this study alone.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{involved}} testing and analyzing multiple retrieved prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> after long-term use in vivo to: (1) detect manufacturing defects {{that could affect}} in-service behavior; (2) characterize the microstructure and alloy composition; and (3) further characterize the wear mechanism of the screw threads. Materials and Methods: Two new (control) screws from Nobel Biocare (NB) and 18 used (in service 18 – 120 months) <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> [12 from NB and 6 from Sterngold (SG) ] were: (1) metallographically examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the microstructure; (2) analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis to determine the qualitative and semiquantitative average alloy and individual phase compositions; and (3) tested for Vickers microhardness. Results: Examination of polished longitudinal sections of the screws using light microscopy revealed a significant defect in only one Group 4 screw. No significant defects in any other screws were observed. The defect was considered a “seam” originating as a “hot tear” during original casting solidification of the alloy. Additionally, the examination of longitudinal sections of the screws revealed a uniform homogeneous microstructure in some groups, while in other groups the sections exhibited rows of second phase particles. The screws for some groups demonstrated severe deformation of the lower threads and the bottom part of the screw leading {{to the formation of}} crevices and grooves. Some NB screws were comprised of Au-based alloy with Pt, Cu, and Ag as alloy elements, while others (Groups 4 and 19) were Pd-based with Ga, Cu, and Au alloy elements. The microstructure was homogeneous with fine or equiaxed grains for all groups except Group 4, which appeared inhomogeneous with anomalous grains. SG screws demonstrated a typical dendritic structure and were Au-based alloy with Cu and Ag alloy elements. There were differences in the microhardness of gold alloy screws from NB and SG as well as palladium alloy screws from NB. Conclusions: Significant differences within NB <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> and between NB and SG screws were found for microstructure, major alloy constituents, and microhardness.

40|$|Purpose: The general aim of {{this study}} and those {{presented}} in Parts 2 – 4 of this series was to characterize the structure, properties, wear, and fracture of prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses after long-term use in vivo. This part of the overall investigation addresses whether there are differences in thread wear between the screws closest to the fulcrum and those that are farthest from the fulcrum in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses. Materials and Methods: The total number of prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> used in this study was 100 (10 new and 90 used). New screws (controls) from Nobel Biocare (NB) were divided into Group 1 (slotted) and Group 2 (hexed). Ninety used screws (in service 18 – 120 months) were retrieved from fixed detachable hybrid prostheses in 18 patients (5 screws from each patient, 60 from NB and 30 from Sterngold). The used screws were divided into 18 groups. Additionally, each group was subdivided into A and B categories. Category A contained the middle three prosthetic screws, which were considered the farthest screws from the fulcrum line. Category B contained the most posterior two screws, which were considered the screws closest to the fulcrum line. All 100 screws were subjected to thorough, nondestructive testing. Results: Light and scanning electron microscopic examination of all used screws for each group revealed surface deterioration of the active profile of the screw threads consistent with adhesive wear. The observed thread profile deterioration ranged from mild to severe. The wear was aggressive enough to cause galling, which led to thinning of the threads and, in severe cases, to knife-edges at thread crests. In ten groups, the most anterior three screws exhibited more wear than the most posterior two screws. In addition to thread wear, severe plastic deformation was detected on the bottom part of each screw for three groups, and a long external longitudinal crack was detected in one screw of Group 2. Conclusions: The findings of this study and those presented in Parts 2 – 4 demonstrate that different <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> from the same manufacturer and/or from different manufacturers have different geometrical design, microstructures, major alloy constituents, and microhardness, and that these differences influence their preload and fractured load values. In this part of the overall investigation, the occurrence of galling as a result of wear involving prosthetic <b>retaining</b> <b>screws</b> appears to be an inevitable and unavoidable consequence of long-term use in vivo in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses regardless of the intended/original preload value. The galling rate is greater on the middle three screws compared to the most posterior two screws in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses. The wear pattern is consistent with an adhesive wear mechanism; however, this study does not provide enough data to support a definitive analysis. King Saud Universit...|$|E

40|$|Bone is an anistropic material, the {{drilling}} {{of which is}} an essential part of internal fixation in orthopaedic and trauma surgery. Some research has been carried out into {{the drilling}} of bone, but there are no definitive recommendations available on the most suitable drill shape or on the optimum drilling speed that should be used in surgical practice. The heat generated during the drilling of bone is proportional to the drilling speed and may be partially dissipated by the presence of blood and tissue fluids and also partially carried away by the chips formed. However, some heat may be conducted into the bone which, if exposed to a temperature higher than 558 C, may sustain serious damage.

30|$|Interestingly, our {{operative}} patients, {{all with}} radiographic union, {{had a higher}} rate of tenderness to palpation than nonoperative patients (50 vs. 0  %). The fact that none of the nonoperative patients had tenderness on examination, even those with radiographic osseous nonunion, suggests that these patients went on to develop a mechanically stable and, therefore, asymptomatic, fibrous union. Stress radiographs could be utilized in future studies to confirm this theory. All of these were reported as mild with no associated pain at rest or limitations to sports. As all of our patients had healed surgical incisions from their ORIF in addition to <b>retained</b> <b>screws,</b> we suspect that the subcutaneous nature of the retained implant may lead to increased rates of point tenderness. Of note, no patient or family desired implant removal, despite the reported mild tenderness.|$|R

The adjustable front sight {{could be lost}} if the <b>retaining</b> <b>screw</b> wasn't tightly secured. The weapon was susceptible to jamming if grime clogged the bolt's locking recess in the receiver. The two small magazine guide retaining pins and corresponding receiver stud holes were tapered allowing disassembly and assembly only from one direction—right to left for disassembly, and left to right for assembly; adding unacceptable levels of complexity in a combat environment. The retaining pins had to be delicately pounded out whenever the bolt needed to be removed for cleaning. During the reassembly process, if the retaining pins were inserted {{too much or too}} little when reassembling, the receiver might not fit back into the tight confines of the stock.|$|R
