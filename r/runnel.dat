5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost {{as they made their way}} westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep <b>runnel</b> after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E

He also discussed his attempt to focus on his original inspiration to produce music, stating [...] "The sound and feel of my music {{are going to be}} affected by what motivates me to do it". On his visit to South Carolina, D'Angelo stated that he [...] "went through this <b>runnel,</b> through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix", and [...] "I learned a lot about music, myself, and where I want to go musically". In the same interview, he cited the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. as having a great effect on him during the period. In another {{interview with}} Touré, D'Angelo said that he had lost his enthusiasm after Brown Sugars reception and [...] "was gettin' jaded, lookin' at what go on in the business". On his purpose for returning, D'Angelo stated [...] "I had to reiterate why I was doin' that in the first place, and the reason was the love for the music".|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} {{modification}} of saltmarsh habitat for mosquito control in Australia is <b>runnelling,</b> {{a system of}} shallow channels increasing seawater exchange in pools high on the marsh. Local effects within the immediate vicinity of <b>runnels</b> were examined by testing the hypothesis that fish assemblages immediately alongside <b>runnels</b> differ from those further away. Nekton assemblages were sampled using pop nets in winter (May) and summer (December) on a saltmarsh in southeast Queensland, alongside <b>runnels</b> and further (30 m) away, at two distances from a mangrove-lined intertidal creek. Nekton assemblages were dominated numerically (50 - 80 %) by one or two species of small fish (Ambassis marianus, Mugilogobius stigmaticus), and a commercially important prawn, Fenneropenaeus merguiensis. In winter, nekton assemblages alongside <b>runnels</b> were significantly different from those further away. Species richness, total nekton densities and densities of several individual species were higher away from <b>runnels,</b> but only at sites far from the creek. No differences in species richness or densities were found in summer. During both periods, nekton assemblages differed strongly with distance from the creek, with more species and higher densities of most species near the creek. For most species, the overall effect of <b>runnelling</b> {{appears to be a}} reduction in abundances in the immediate vicinity of <b>runnels,</b> at some times of year. This is probably related to lower prey availability near <b>runnels.</b> Given the extent of <b>runnelling</b> in some parts of Australia, even this local reduction in densities extending no more than 30 m from <b>runnels</b> means that nekton may be adversely affected over a large total area. The apparent influence of <b>runnels</b> on nekton densities highlights the potential effects of saltmarsh modification on non-target animals that should be considered as this management technique becomes more prevalent.
