5|$|The <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> was {{recovered}} by Bruce Campbell when {{he attended a}} film fair in the 1980s and began chatting to a stall holder who informed him {{that one of his}} regular customers had in their possession The <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> episode six. Campbell got in contact with the customer, bought the missing episode for £50, and then, in May 1982, donated it to the BBC through Ian Levine.|$|E

5|$|Albert Bras as an Old Servant, {{a servant}} at the manor house. After {{the death of}} his master, he finds Gray's book on vampirism and, aided by Gray, ends the vampire's <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although he was {{a member}} of the two {{committees}} of general defence which preceded the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror's</b> Committee <b>of</b> Public Safety, he did not belong to the latter at its creation. Instead, he composed an important report on the state of the French Revolutionary Army, recommending two measures which contributed largely to its success - the rapid advancement of the lower officers, which opened the way for the most successful generals of the Revolution, and the fusion of the volunteers with the veteran troops.|$|R
50|$|Dependent on {{government}} pensions {{he changed his}} politics with the times. He praised Calonne, comparing him with the great Sully, and likened Louis XVI to Henry IV of France, but he ended up as the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror's</b> official poet. He occupied rooms in the Louvre, and fulfilled his obligations by shameless attacks on the king and queen. His excellent ode on the Vengeur and the Ode nationale contre l'Angleterre {{on the occasion of}} the projected invasion of Britain were written in honour of the power of Napoleon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Were he not, as {{has been}} said, purblinded by enchantment, you had but to bid him open his eyes and look. In which country, in which time, was it {{hitherto}} that man's history, or the history of any man, went on by calculated or calculable 'Motives'? What make ye of your Christianities, and Chivalries, and Reformations, and Marseillaise Hymns, and <b>Reigns</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror?</b> Nay, has not perhaps the Motive-grinder himself been in Love? Did he never stand {{so much as a}} contested Election? Leave him to Time, and the medicating virtue of Nature." ...|$|R
5|$|Before the <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> {{reached its}} climax, Forster died after a rheumatic illness {{in his small}} attic {{apartment}} at Rue des Moulins in Paris in January 1794, {{at the age of}} thirty-nine. At the time, he was making plans to visit India.|$|E
5|$|In {{writing about}} the Italian situation, Shelley is also advocating a general liberal agenda of rights for the working and middle classes, which had been crushed by the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> and Napoleon. British reformers could look with hope towards Italy.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Just {{was arrested}} in the violent episode of 9 Thermidor and {{executed}} {{the next day with}} Robespierre and their allies. In many histories of the Revolution, their deaths at the guillotine mark the end of the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror.</b>|$|E
40|$|The idea {{performing}} comedy, {{and performing}} {{a lot of}} comedy, during one the most systematic <b>reigns</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> {{the world has ever}} known may at first blush seem somewhat degraded. The perception of most people, especially in the English-speaking world, is that “German comedy” in the first place is an oxymoron. The fact is, however, that 42, 000 productions were staged between 1933 and 1944 in the Third Reich, and the majority of them were comedies. The most frequently performed were plays by the now forgotten likes of August Hinrichs, Maximilian Böttcher, and Fritz Peter Buch, Jochen Huth, and Charlotte Rissmann. Who were these playwrights...|$|R
60|$|Not that I love thy children, whose dull eyes See nothing {{save their}} own unlovely woe, Whose minds know nothing, nothing care to know,-- But that {{the roar of}} thy Democracies, Thy <b>reigns</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror,</b> thy great Anarchies, Mirror my wildest passions like the sea And give my rage a brother--! Liberty! For this sake only do thy dissonant cries Delight my {{discreet}} soul, else might all kings By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades Rob nations of their rights inviolate And I remain unmoved--and yet, and yet, These Christs that die upon the barricades, God knows it I am with them, in some things.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Bennet, as almoner, {{with the}} other chaplains, was to arrange the matter; and horrible was the {{distress}} that he discovered in the city, that had for five-and-twenty years been devastated by civil fury, {{as well as by}} foreign wars; and famines, pestilences, murders, and tyrannies had held sway, so as to form an absolute succession <b>of</b> <b>reigns</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror.</b> The poor perished like flies in a frost; the homeless orphans of the parents murdered by either faction roamed the streets, and herded in the corners like the vagrant dogs of Eastern cities; and meantime, the nobles and their partisans revelled in wasteful pomp.|$|R
5|$|François died in Paris in 1680 but {{was buried}} in the Franciscan chapel of Verteuil, which had been founded in 1470 by his ancestor, John, 16th lord of Rochefoucauld and 13th lord of Verteuil. All of John's successors were buried in this chapel until the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> began in 1793.|$|E
5|$|Further degrees {{came and}} went, with a ten-degree system {{evolving}} {{at the end}} of the Eighteenth century. The idea spread widely in Europe, but never appeared in England. After a brief eclipse during the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> at the start of the French Revolution, lodges of adoption flourished, with the Empress Josephine presiding over one in Strasbourg in 1805.|$|E
5|$|In 1645, {{during the}} English Civil War, Matthew Hopkins (Vincent Price), an opportunist and witchhunter, takes {{advantage}} of the breakdown in social order to impose a <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> in East Anglia. Hopkins and his assistant, John Stearne (Robert Russell), visit village after village, brutally torturing confessions out of suspected witches. They charge the local magistrates for the work they carry out.|$|E

That Russia is {{building}} Socialism {{they have no}} doubt; {{but there is no}} freedom in Russia, no democracy, no equality. Instead there is a dictatorship, a <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> brute <b>terror,</b> <b>of</b> suppression of free thought, free criticism, free living." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of the town is in favour of the changes brought by the French Revolution, above all after the end <b>of</b> the <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Terror.</b> The major revolutionary event is the one celebrating the execution of Louis XVI, accompanied by a hatred oath to the royalty and to the anarchy. It is celebrated since 1795.|$|R
50|$|The Scottish lord Macbeth chooses evil {{as the way}} {{to fulfill}} his {{ambition}} for power. He commits regicide to become king and then furthers his moral descent with a <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> murderous <b>terror</b> to stay in power, eventually plunging the country into civil war. In the end, he loses everything that gives meaning and purpose to his life before losing his life itself.|$|R
5|$|In {{some cases}} missing episodes are bridged by {{narration}} {{to the camera}} – often by a surviving actor from the serial, occasionally in-character. For their VHS releases, The <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> and The Crusade were presented by actors Carole Ann Ford and William Russell – while Episodes 1 and 4 of The Invasion were bridged by Nicholas Courtney.|$|E
5|$|A fan in Australia has {{returned}} small excerpts of off-screen footage, recorded from repeat showings using an 8mm cine film camera.

5|$|His son {{was also}} {{executed}} {{a few months}} later, and his daughter-in-law suffered for several months in prison before she was released {{in the summer of}} 1794. She managed to recover some of the family property and emigrated to Germany, and later, Switzerland, with her son, Astolphe-Louis-Léonor. The fate of the family is representative of the fates of many of the minor aristocracy in France, especially those in the military and diplomatic corps, whose reputations the Montagnards tarnished in the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{interest}} {{of this story}} <b>of</b> the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> [...] <b>Terror</b> lies {{in the way in}} which the difficulties [...] and perils Harry has to encounter bring out the [...] heroic and steadfast qualities of a brave nature. [...] Again and again the last extremity seems to have [...] been reached, but his unfailing courage triumphs [...] over all. It is an admirable boy's [...] book."--Birmingham Post.|$|R
50|$|Glaeken engages Rasalom in his deep, dark lair {{where he}} lies {{waiting for the}} {{completion}} of his transformation into the <b>reigning</b> creature <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> on Earth.

50|$|Just before Passover in 70 CE, Titus {{began the}} siege of Jerusalem. He quickly took down {{the first and second}} wall, but then met fierce {{resistance}} as the rebel Judean factions within Jerusalem realized the necessity of joining forces. However, Simon and John both upheld their <b>reigns</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> over the citizens, causing many to flee to the Romans. To counteract these desertions, Simon put every potential betrayer, including some of his previous friends, to death. In August 70, five months after the siege began, Jerusalem fell to Titus. Simon escaped into the subterranean passages of the city. By means of stone cutters he tried to dig a way to freedom, but ran out of food before he could finish. Clothed in the garments of a Judean king he rose out of the ground at the very spot where the Temple had stood, was taken prisoner and brought to Rome.|$|R
5|$|In 1562 the château came briefly {{into the}} {{possession}} of the Huguenots and {{was turned into a}} state prison by Henry IV of France. Cardinal Richelieu was given the castle to prevent it from coming under the control of unfriendly forces, though he allowed it to fall into ruin. Château de Chinon was abandoned until 1793 when, during the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror,</b> the castle was temporarily occupied by royalist Vendeans. Soon after, the castle lapsed back into decay.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany and his regime's anti-Semitic {{policies}} significantly affected American pre-Code filmmaking. Although Hitler had become unpopular {{in many parts of}} the United States, Germany was still a voluminous importer of American films and the studios wanted to appease the German government. The ban on Jews and negative portrayals of Germany in the Fatherland even led to a significant reduction in work for Jews in Hollywood until after the end of World War II. As a result, only two social problem films released by independent film companies addressed the mania in Germany during the pre-Code era (Are We Civilized? and Hitler's <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror).</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Leading up to <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terrors</b> release date, Sleigh Bells went on an eight-day mini-tour of Florida {{with the}} DJ Diplo {{and the black}} metal band Liturgy. The idea for a tour {{exclusively}} in Florida came to Miller and Diplo while the two were in Brooklyn, New York. About this tour, Miller said, [...] "Not a lot of bands come down to Florida, but its a strange place and something about it felt right." [...] On February 18, 2012, Sleigh Bells was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live, and performed [...] "Comeback Kid" [...] and [...] "End of the Line." [...] Following a short tour opening for Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sleigh Bells will tour North America with the synthpop group Class Actress and the rapper Jel in July 2012. In August 2012, Sleigh Bells headlined Europe, toured the US West Coast with the hardcore punk band Refused, then announced a September-November 2012 tour with DJ AraabMuzik.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the time}} Lindsay became pregnant, a psychopathic pseudo-serial killer named William Hinks began {{threatening}} her. Bobby arranged {{for one of}} his former clients to intimidate Hinks in the hopes of scaring him away from Linsday, but instead, the client ended up cutting off Hinks's head and placing it in the freezer, an apparent homage to Hinks's brutal <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>terror.</b> Upon discovery <b>of</b> the crime, Bobby was arrested as a co-conspirator in the murder.|$|R
6000|$|From {{that first}} {{necessary}} assertion of Luther's, [...] "You, self-styled Papa, {{you are no}} Father in God at all; you are--a Chimera, whom I know not how to name in polite language!"--from that onwards to the shout which rose round Camille Desmoulins in the Palais-Royal, [...] "Aux armes!" [...] when the people had burst up against all manner of Chimeras,--I find a natural historical sequence. That shout too, so frightful, half-infernal, was a great matter. Once more the voice of awakened nations;--starting confusedly, as out of nightmare, as out of death-sleep, into some dim feeling that Life was real; that God's-world was not an expediency and diplomacy! Infernal;--yes, since {{they would not have}} it otherwise. Infernal, since not celestial or terrestrial! Hollowness, insincerity has to cease; sincerity of some sort has to begin. Cost what it may, <b>reigns</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror,</b> horrors <b>of</b> French Revolution or what else, we have to return to truth. Here is a Truth, as I said: a Truth clad in hell-fire, since they would not but have it so--! ...|$|R
5|$|In December, fifty-three peninsulars were banished to Salta, and the {{decision}} {{was sent to the}} Junta for approval. The vocal Domingo Matheu, who had business associations with Tulla and Pedro Salvador Casas, arranged the annulment of the act, arguing that Castelli had been influenced by slander and unfounded accusations. Support for Castelli began to decline, mainly due to the favourable treatment of natives and the determined opposition of the church, which attacked the public atheism of Bernardo Monteagudo, Castelli's secretary. Both royalists in Lima and Saavedra in Buenos Aires compared them with Maximilien Robespierre, leader of the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> of the French Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Lon Nol saw Cambodia's {{population}} of 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese as possible hostages to prevent PAVN attacks and ordered their roundup and internment. Cambodian soldiers and civilians then unleashed a <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror,</b> murdering thousands of Vietnamese civilians. On 15 April for example, 800 Vietnamese {{men had been}} rounded up at the village of Churi Changwar, tied together, executed, and their bodies dumped into the Mekong River. They then floated downstream into South Vietnam. Cambodia's actions were denounced by both the North and South Vietnamese governments.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVI and {{the royal}} family were brought to Paris and made prisoners within the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the {{revolution}} turned more and more radical, the king, queen, and the mayor were guillotined, along with more than 16,000 others (throughout France), during the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror.</b> The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished. A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 (coup d'état du 18 brumaire), when Napoléon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.|$|E
2500|$|The {{persecution}} of AK members {{was only one}} aspect <b>of</b> the <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> Stalinist <b>terror</b> in postwar Poland. In the period from 1944 to 1956, at least 300,000 Polish civilians were arrested, although some sources claim numbers up to two million. Approximately 6,000 death sentences were issued, {{and the majority of}} them were carried out. It is probable that over 20,000 people died in communist prisons including those executed [...] "in the majesty of the law" [...] such as Witold Pilecki, a hero of Auschwitz.|$|R
50|$|Hérault was {{a member}} <b>of</b> the <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror's</b> Committee <b>of</b> Public Safety, {{to which he was}} elected on 13 June 1793. He was chiefly {{concerned}} with diplomacy, and from October to December 1793 was employed on a diplomatic and military mission in Alsace. This mission made him an object of suspicion to {{the other members of the}} Committee, especially to Maximilien Robespierre, who as a deist and a follower of the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, resented Hérault and other followers of Denis Diderot's naturalism. Hérault, whose aristocratic background was also accounted a source of suspicion, was accused of collusion with foreign agents, amounting to treason by Bourdon de l'Oise on 16 December 1793. He responded by offering his resignation from the Committee of Public Safety, but this was refused. However the following Spring brought further accusations against him of collusion with counter-revolutionaries, and he was also embroiled in the scandal around the dissolution of the East India Company. He was tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and condemned alongside Danton, François Joseph Westermann, Camille Desmoulins, and Pierre Philippeaux. They were guillotined on the same day: 5 April 1794 (16th Germinal in the year II).|$|R
6000|$|In the Months of February and March, it is recorded, the <b>terror,</b> {{especially}} <b>of</b> rural France, {{had risen}} {{even to the}} transcendental pitch: not far from madness. In Town and Hamlet is rumour; of war, massacre: that Austrians, Aristocrats, above all, that The Brigands are close by. Men quit their houses and huts; rush fugitive, shrieking, with wife and child, they know not whither. Such a terror, the eye-witnesses say, never fell on a Nation; nor shall again fall, even in <b>Reigns</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> expressly so-called. The Countries of the Loire, all the Central and South-East regions, start up distracted, 'simultaneously as by an electric shock;'--for indeed grain too gets scarcer and scarcer. 'The people barricade the entrances of Towns, pile stones in the upper stories, the women prepare boiling water; from moment to moment, expecting the attack. In the Country, the alarm-bell rings incessant: troops of peasants, gathered by it, scour the highways, seeking an imaginary enemy. They are armed mostly with scythes stuck in wood; and, arriving in wild troops at the barricaded Towns, are themselves sometimes taken for Brigands.' (Newspapers, &c. in Hist. Parl. xiii. 325.) ...|$|R
