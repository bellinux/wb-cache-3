25|$|Increasingly, it {{has become}} popular to reduce handgun weight and cost as well as {{increase}} corrosion resistance by using polymers. Starting around the year 2000, Beretta began replacing some parts with polymer and polymer coated metal. Polymer parts include the recoil spring guide rod which is now also fluted, magazine floor plate, magazine follower and the mainspring cap/lanyard loop. Polymer coated metal parts include the left side safety lever, trigger, and magazine <b>release</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Beretta 92's open slide design ensures smooth {{feeding and}} {{ejection}} of ammunition and allows easy clearing of obstructions. The hard-chromed barrel bore reduces barrel wear and protects it from corrosion. The falling locking block design provides good accuracy and operability with suppressors {{due to the}} in-line travel of the barrel. This {{is in contrast to}} the complex travel of Browning designed barrels. The magazine <b>release</b> <b>button</b> is reversible with simple field tools. Reversing the magazine release makes left-handed operation much easier.|$|E
500|$|Reaching {{the grand}} final meant {{defeating}} the axe-wielding robot Terrorhurtz. Razer avoided the axe and lowered its arm into Terrorhurtz's polycarbonate armour panels. Terrorhurtz {{lined up for}} another strike, but Razer slid its wedge underneath Terrorhurtz's chassis. It buried the arm into its opponent, carried Terrorhurtz to the pit <b>release</b> <b>button,</b> and dropped it into the pit. Only Tornado stood between Razer and a successful title defence. After twice losing to Razer that year, the developers of Tornado had constructed a large metal frame equipped with a rotating blade. Controversially qualifying as an [...] "interchangeable weapon", {{the size of this}} framework prevented Razer's claw from reaching Tornado's chassis. Team Razer responded by attaching a lifting hook {{to the front of the}} arm before the fight. Although Razer would still not be able to pierce Tornado, it could lift it by the framework. In the battle, Tornado used its superior pushing power to slam Razer into the arena wall and the house robots. Near the end of the fight, Razer managed to lift Tornado up and push it over the pit, but the size of the additional framework prevented Tornado from falling in. After a 45 minute discussion, the judges ruled in favour of Tornado becoming the new UK champion.|$|E

As a result, the shooter can shoot in safe conditions upon target presentations in varying range (10 to 60 yards) and varying angles (sharp to wide).|$|R
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, the night of September 4, North Korean troops established a bridgehead across the Naktong River and were using it to advance across the river and attack Taegu, where the UN's Eighth United States Army was headquartered in defense of the perimeter. On September 5, a T-6 Mosquito forward air controller spotted a North Korea column advancing through the village of Hamchang. Sebille was ordered to lead a flight of three F-51's on an airstrike against the North Korean troops advancing there. Sebille flew a P-51 (tail number 44-74394) loaded with two [...] bombs, six rockets, and six M2 Browning [...]50 caliber machine guns. He and his wingmen, Captain Martin Johnson and Lieutenant Charles Morehouse, approached the village at an altitude of [...] and spotted a North Korean armored column crossing the river in a shallow area. Sebille positioned himself for a medium-angle dive bomb run, planning to drop both of his bombs on his first attack. Diving, he held steady until about [...] When he spotted a target column of trucks, artillery guns and armored cars, led by a North Korean Armored Personnel Carrier, he hit the bomb <b>release</b> <b>button</b> on his control stick, and then made a sharp pull-up to the left to stay away from his bomb blast. However, only one of his bombs had released, and the [...] of unbalanced weight under his left wing may have contributed to his near miss on the first run.|$|E

50|$|ABS is {{flammable}} when it {{is exposed}} to high temperatures, {{such as those of}} a wood fire. It will melt and then boil, at which point the vapors burst into intense, hot flames. Since pure ABS contains no halogens, its combustion does not typically produce any persistent organic pollutants, and the most toxic products of its combustion or pyrolysis are carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. ABS is also damaged by sunlight. This caused one of the most widespread and expensive automobile recalls in US history due to the degradation of the seatbelt <b>release</b> <b>buttons.</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} the procedure taken to modify trans-tibial shuttle lock release mechanisms to decrease standard reach requirements {{in a case of}} limited mobility secondary to morbid obesity. The participant was a middle-aged, morbidly obese client with bilateral trans-tibial amputations. The distomedial shuttle lock <b>release</b> <b>buttons</b> were modified to activate with a cable/Dacron pull strap located proximal/lateral. The outcome of the modification was determined by whether or not the client would be able to independently doff the prostheses, if the patient was satisfied with the prostheses and by the condition of the components at the three-month follow-up. The client was independently successful at doffing both prostheses following the modification procedure. The patient expressed satisfaction with operation of the release mechanism but cosmetic covering was an issue. Components were optimally functioning at the three month follow-up. It was concluded that this procedure is a viable option for relocating distomedial <b>release</b> lock <b>buttons</b> more proximally when reach is limited.

Frank Williams insisted the contract was fully binding, and that there would be [...] "absolutely no turning back"; his team required Button to fulfil some contractual obligations with sponsors. After several weeks of talks, Williams agreed to <b>release</b> <b>Button</b> in exchange for an estimated £18million in compensation. BAR brought in experienced driver Rubens Barrichello from Ferrari to partner Button, replacing Takuma Sato. In October, Honda bought the remaining 55 percent of BAR from British American Tobacco, renaming the team Honda Racing F1; Button said at the time, [...] "Honda buying the team is amazing news and really shows their commitment to winning the world championship".|$|E
2500|$|After its {{introduction}} to service, reports of unserviceability of the M3 commenced in February 1944 with stateside units in training, who reported early {{failure of the}} cocking handle/bolt retraction mechanism on some weapons. [...] Similar reports later came from U.S. forces in Britain who were issued the M3. [...] An investigation revealed several deficiencies {{in the construction of}} the M3's bolt retraction mechanism, together with issues concerning barrel removal and retention as well as easily bent rear sights. [...] As a result, several product improvements were incorporated into all new M3 production, including a new design retracting pawl with improved heat treatment, a new spring stop fitted to the right-hand brace of the retracting lever, a modified ejector featuring a cocking lever trip, a larger ratchet pad with improved heat treatment to more securely retain the barrel assembly, and strengthening gussets fitted to the sides of the fixed 'L' rear sight. [...] After new complaints were raised about accidental magazine releases and failure of the wire buttstock to remain in place in the collapsed position, two additional changes were made to M3 production and approved by Ordnance on 31 August 1944. [...] This included a small sheet metal guard around the magazine <b>release</b> <b>button,</b> and the inclusion of a stop between the two rods forming the wire stock at the butt end.|$|E
2500|$|For 1968, {{both the}} Corvette body and {{interior}} were completely redesigned. As before, {{the car was}} available in either coupe or convertible models, but coupe was now a notchback fitted with a near-vertical removable rear window and removable roof panels (T-tops). A soft folding top was included with convertibles, while an auxiliary hardtop with a glass rear window was offered at additional cost. Included with coupes were hold down straps {{and a pair of}} vinyl bags to store the roof panels, and above the luggage area was a rear window stowage tray. The enduring new body's concealed headlights moved into position via a vacuum operated system rather than electrically as on the previous generation, and the new hide-away windshield wipers utilized a problematic vacuum door. The door handles were flush with the top of the doors with a separate <b>release</b> <b>button.</b> Front fenders had functional engine cooling vents. Side vent windows were eliminated from all models, replaced with [...] "Astro Ventilation", a fresh air circulation system. In the cabin, a large round speedometer and matching tachometer were positioned in front of the driver. Auxiliary gauges were clustered above the forward end of the console and included oil pressure, water temperature, ammeter, fuel gauge, and an analog clock. A fiber-optic system appeared on the console that monitored exterior lights and there was no glove box. The battery was relocated from the engine area to one of three compartments behind the seats to improve weight distribution. New options included a rear window defroster, anti-theft alarm system, bright metal wheel covers, and an AM-FM Stereo radio. All cars ordered with a radio, like the C2 cars, continued to be fitted with chrome-plated ignition shielding covering the distributor to reduce interference.|$|E

The optional Positraction rear axle, mandated on many engine/gearbox combinations, was installed on more than 95% of the cars. [...] "Stingray" [...] script nameplates appeared on front fenders, now one word, in contrast to the “Sting Ray” name used previously. Exterior door handles were redesigned so the finger plate would actuate the door, eliminating the separate <b>release</b> <b>button.</b> Backup lights were integrated into the inboard taillights, headlight washers were added, and front grilles were made all black. Side mounted exhausts and front fender vent trim were options for this year only. On the inside, revised door panels provided additional shoulder room in the C3's tighter cabin and headrests became standard. Steering wheel diameter was reduced from 16 to 15inches to permit easier entry and exit, the ignition switch was moved from the dash to the steering column, and map pockets were added to the dash area in front of the passenger seat. Accounting for 57% of the cars, coupes with their removable roof panels, began a trend of outselling roadsters. An extended production cycle due to a labor dispute increased '69 volume.
