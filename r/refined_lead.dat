5|$|Production of lead is {{increasing}} worldwide {{due to its}} use in lead–acid batteries. There are two major categories of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64million from secondary production. The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of <b>refined</b> <b>lead</b> were China, the United States, and South Korea. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010, {{the total amount of}} lead in use, stockpiled, discarded or dissipated into the environment, on a global basis, is 8kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries (20–150kg per capita) rather than less developed ones (1–4kg per capita).|$|E

In the 1990s, the company tried to change its image, calling itself a [...] "diversified technical services" [...] firm. It started offering equipment rentals, staffing services, and financing for construction projects. The company began offering environmental cleanup and pollution control services, which grew to half of its new business by 1992. Fluor's mining business grew from $300 million in 1990 to $1 billion in 1994. The US government passed environmental regulations in 1995 that led to growth for the Massey Coal Co. business, because it had large reserves of low-sulfur coal. In 1992, Fluor sold its ownership of Doe Run Company, the world's largest producer of <b>refined</b> <b>lead,</b> which was losing money at the time due to declining lead prices.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} the amount of added grain refiner on grain size and morphology has been investigated for a range of hypoeutectic Al-Si alloys. The results show a transition in grain size at a silicon concentration of about 3 wt% in unrefined alloys; the grain size decreasing with silicon content before the transition, and increasing beyond the transition point. A change in morphology also occurs with increased silicon content. The addition of grain <b>refiner</b> <b>leads</b> to greater refinement for silicon contents below the transition point than for those contents above the transition point, while the transition point seems to remain unchanged. The slope of the grain size versus silicon content curve after the transition seems to be unaffected by the degree of grain refinement. The results are related to the competitive processes of nucleation and constitutional effects during growth and their impact on nucleation kinetics. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A.

40|$|Assay {{methods for}} {{measuring}} 238 U, 232 Th, and 210 Pb concentrations in <b>refined</b> <b>lead</b> are presented. The 238 U and 232 Th concentrations are determined using isotope dilution {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS) after anion exchange column separation of dissolved lead samples. The 210 Pb concentration is inferred through α-spectroscopy of a daughter isotope, 210 Po, after chemical precipitation separation on dissolved lead samples. Subsequent to the 210 Po α-spectroscopy assay, a method for evaluating 210 Pb concentrations in solid lead samples was developed via measurement of bremsstrahlung radiation from e̱ṯa̱-decay of a daughter isotope, 210 Bi, by employing a 14 -crystal array of high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that plate gaps are {{sometimes}} unequal in two-zoned low consistency refiners and that unequal gaps render unevenly refined pulp. It is also known that optimisation of plate gap in low consistency <b>refining</b> <b>leads</b> to improved energy efficiency. In this work, trials were made in mill scale in a modern TMP line equipped with a prototype 72 inch TwinFlo low consistency refiner in second stage. The study was designed to investigate the development of pulp properties from different rotor positions by means of altering the outlet flow rate ratio. The specific energy consumption was calculated for each refining zone and setting, based on flow rate and temperature increase. In order to produce homogenous pulp, it was found that uneven plate gaps need to be compensated in low consistency refiners with dual refining zones. Results from the different flow rate adjustments indicated that the control setting with similar plate gap gave the most homogenous pulp. However, further studies are needed to find an adequate rotor control strategy. The temperature increase in each refining zone seems to correlate well with the applied specific energy consumption in each refining zone.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Does the lead industry have a future, {{in the face of}} the developing environmental challenge? This thesis addresses this question and concludes, it should have for the foreseeable future, providing it adopts the changes detailed. These changes are posited within a framework, which consists of a strategy, approaches and tools. The changes are both technical and philosophical. They are technical, in the sense that the tools and approaches provide practical means whereby the environmental `risks' may be identified, assessed and managed. They are philosophical, because they set out and identify the features of a new conceptual paradigm, whose basis is in the concept of the `risk society'. The paradigm is significantly more holistic, multi-dimensional, inherently flexible, and is intended to be reflexive. Adoption of the elements of the framework, will facilitate a more effective establishment, and management of environmental `risk' credentials, which will help encourage better environmental decision making. Hence, it will facilitate, the balancing of resource consumption and environmental impact costs, versus social and economic benefits, in an improved manner. The modelling approaches, and selected inventory and environmental impact assessment tools, enclosed within this thesis, have been designed to facilitate the development of, and to function within, the new paradigm. These have been developed for BRM and MIM case studies, and function at the site-specific and the cradle-to-gate scales. The former consider the company site of Britannia Refined Metals (BRM) Ltd., where refining to produce primary and secondary <b>refined</b> <b>lead</b> products takes place, whilst the latter consider the life-cycle of the refined primary lead products of MIM Ltd. The modelling approaches have also been designed so, that they may be re-aggregated into models able to operate at many different scales, as required.
