50|$|In August 2015 SRAM Corporation {{announced}} its wireless shifting system, eTap. The system had been extensively developed and secretly tested {{over several years}} from initial design to a stage win in the 2015 Tour de France. The front and rear derailleurs use direct-mount batteries and communicate wirelessly with the shifters through a proprietary wireless protocol developed by SRAM called, Airea (pronounced: area). A set of small satellite shifter buttons, called Blips, can {{be connected to the}} shift levers or aero shift module (BlipBox) and placed anywhere along the handlebars as part of the system. A maximum of four Blips can be used per bike. The company also took the opportunity to introduce a new shifting convention with this system. The right lever shifts the <b>rear</b> derailleur <b>outboard,</b> the <b>left</b> lever shifts the rear derailleur inboard, and pressing both levers together shifts the front derailleur. SRAM made the groupset available for purchase on complete bikes and as aftermarket components sold through dealers from Spring 2016. Eventually, extension of the system is expected to the company's lower group sets, such as SRAM Force. In May 2016 the company announced a hydraulic disc brake version of its wireless road group called SRAM RED eTap HRD. The new brakes make use of a hydraulic lever design with both lever reach adjustment and lever contact point adjustment, a first for road disc brakes.|$|R

50|$|Its {{landing gear}} was {{essentially}} of the tailskid type. On each side, vertical V-form legs {{from the lower}} fuselage longerons and from under the meeting points of the two engine support struts carried a single axle with a mainwheel at either end. In addition, a third axle, similarly mounted from the fuselage but forward of the wing, carried a pair of slightly smaller wheels intended to prevent nose-overs. On each lower wing a pair of backward trailing thin skids, attached below {{each of the two}} <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> interplane struts and lightly braced from the trailing edge extended well behind, gaving protection against accidental ground contact.|$|R
50|$|On 22 November 2003, {{shortly after}} takeoff from Baghdad, Iraq, an Airbus A300B4-200F cargo plane owned by European Air Transport (doing {{business}} as DHL Express) was struck {{on the left}} wing tip by a surface-to-air missile. Severe wing damage resulted in a fire and complete loss of hydraulic flight control systems. Because <b>outboard</b> <b>left</b> wing fuel tank 1A was full at takeoff, there was no fuel-air vapour explosion. Liquid jet fuel dropped away as 1A disintegrated. Inboard fuel tank 1 was pierced and leaking.|$|R
50|$|In September 2004 for the 2005 model year, the FX range {{received}} enhancements such as {{lane departure warning}} (LDW) {{system that}} helps alert drivers to an unintended movement of the vehicle out of a designated traffic lane. Infiniti's system monitored the lane markings to alert passengers via an audible buzzer that the driver is drifting unintentionally. The LDW system, which utilize a small camera, speed sensor, an indicator and an audible warning buzzer, was offered on models. The Infiniti FX was the first passenger vehicle to offer a lane departure warning system in the United States market. In addition to LDW, the 2005 Infiniti FX range was now equipped with standard roof-mounted curtain supplemental curtain air bags with rollover protection for front and <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> seat occupants.|$|R
40|$|Lap and {{shoulder}} belts {{have been required}} in <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> positions since 1989. A recent congressional mandate encouraged the requirement of a lap {{and shoulder}} belt in the center rear seat position. This study utilized Data from the Partners for Child Passenger Safety study, a large-scale child-focused crash surveillance system, to quantify changes in seating patterns for children in vehicles that already have this feature compared to those which do not and measured the safety benefit associated with the provision of a shoulder belt in the center rear seat position. The data demonstrate {{that the presence of}} a shoulder belt in the center rear seating position influences seating practices only when there is a single child occupant in the vehicle. Belted children in the center rear of vehicles equipped with a lap shoulder belt are at an 81 % reduction in risk of injury than those belted in the center rear equipped with a lap only belt. The data suggest that by requiring lap shoulder belts in the center rear, benefits would be realized to belted children, specifically the 4 – 8 year old group...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of vortical flow significantly changes {{the properties of}} motion induced aerodynamic loads. Tests in the Transonic Wind Tunnel Göttingen with a half wing model of a Lambda wing are analyzed. Pitch oscillations were imposed by a hydraulic actuator with amplitudes (0. 08 °- 1. 5 °) and frequencies (up to 40 Hz) relevant for aeroelastic analyses. Unsteady surface pressure and flow field measurements were performed. With increasing angle of attack, a leading edge vortex emerges and moves inboard. The unsteady loads show a strong dependency {{on the effects of}} the vortical flow which can be described based on the measurements at constant angles of attack. The effects are lagging the motion. In the <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> part of the wing, the unsteady pressures are small, but the amplitude of the motion is high. Hence, a significant amount of energy - force integrated over motion - is transferred from the fluid to the motion. For a free motion or deformation of the wing this would cause a destabilization. A significant effect of the vortical flow is the strong discrepancy between the position where it emerges and is affected and the position, e. g. further outboard, where the flow may generate unsteady, potentially destabilizing, load...|$|R

50|$|Toyota {{had adopted}} a McLaren MP4-22-like bridge {{on the front}} wing, and have also moved the <b>rear</b> view mirrors <b>outboard,</b> like Ferrari and Renault.

50|$|As Williams' current chassis, the Iso-Marlboro FX3B, did {{not conform}} to 1973's new {{deformable}} structure regulations, a new car had to be designed. The result was the IR (the initials standing for Iso Rivolta), designed by John Clarke. Another conventional design, it featured {{double wishbone front suspension}} with upper and lower links at the <b>rear,</b> and <b>outboard</b> springs all round. The car's lines were angular except for the rounded cockpit. Italian engineer Gian Paolo Dallara was brought into the team to redesign the rear suspension during the 1973 season. Ron Tauranac also made some development changes later in the season.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Unsteady {{pressure}} distributions at {{a pitching}} Lambda wing with 53 ° sweep angle {{are described in}} this paper. The tests with a half wing model with a purely round leading edge were conducted in the Transonic Wind Tunnel Göttingen. The free stream Mach number was varied between 0. 3 and 0. 7. Oscillation frequencies up to 22 Hz and amplitudes smaller than 1 ° were used. The pressure distributions suggest flow conditions that {{can be divided into}} three Regimes, depending on the mean angle of attack: I) Above 10 °, at the <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> part of the wing, the suction increases which is caused by a vortical flow occurring close to the surface. A strong suction peak emerges at the leading edge. II) At higher angles of attack, the strong suction peak at the leading edge breaks down, and a typical hump like pressure distribution below a vortex core is generated further downstream. This is the sign for a vortex flow further separating from the surface. Features of a vortex breakdown can be found. However, it lacks the typical signs for a transformation from a jet-like to a wake-like flow. III) Finally, the low pressure region below the vortex moves inboard and a deadwater type of flow exists at the outboard part of the wing. The unsteady pressure distributions strongly depend on the mean angle of attack. The highest unsteady pressures occur in Regimes II and III. Especially the out of phase parts drastically increase in Regime II. Furthermore, the quasi-steady effects strongly lag the motion. This means, the sign of the imaginary part of the unsteady pressure distribution is opposite to that of the real part. The lag increases with frequency. For angles of attack above that of the maximum lift, the negative lift slope turns positive with increasing frequency due to the strong lag of the vortex...|$|R
50|$|The metal lattice {{gave the}} {{structure}} considerable strength, with any single stringer {{able to support}} a portion of load from {{the opposite side of}} the aircraft. Heavily damaged or destroyed beams on one side could still leave the aircraft structure viable; as a result, Wellingtons with huge areas of framework missing were often able to return home when other types would not have survived, leading to stories of the aircraft's 'invulnerability'. The effect was enhanced by the fabric skin occasionally burning off leaving the naked frames exposed. A further advantage of the geodesic construction of the wings was its enabling of a unique method for housing the fuel, with each wing containing three fuel tanks within the unobstructed space provided between the front and <b>rear</b> spars <b>outboard</b> of the engines.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{features}} of the Windsor included its pressurised crew compartment. To spread the load across the elliptical planform high aspect ratio wings, the undercarriage was of four mainwheel oleo struts - one in each engine nacelle - with a single balloon-tyred wheel on each. The defensive armament was guns mounted in barbettes at the <b>rear</b> of each <b>outboard</b> nacelle, which were to be remotely operated by a gunner in a pressurised compartment in the extreme tail.|$|R

40|$|Though a {{significant}} {{body of literature}} exists on the safety performance and effectiveness of various types of front seat occupant restraint systems, there is a paucity of data {{on the performance of}} rear seat occupant restraint systems. A research program was initiated to better understand rear seat restraint performance. Research included examining real world data using National Automotive Sampling System/Crashworthiness Data System (NASS/CDS) and Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) as well as conducting full frontal vehicle crashes into rigid barriers with dummies restrained in rear seats. Child dummies (Hybrid III 6 year-old) and adult dummies (Hybrid III 5 th percentile female and 50 th percentile male) were used for this purpose. The dummies were placed in <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> seats with lap/shoulder belts {{as well as in the}} center seating position where the lap/shoulder belts were integrated to the seat. A double-paired comparison study using FARS data files suggested that while occupants younger than 50 years of age benefit from sitting in rear seats in frontal crashes, restrained adult occupants older than 50 years are significantly better off in the front seats than the rear seats. The most injured body region for restrained children in rear seats is the head while that for restrained adults is the thorax. The major injury source for restrained occupants, not in child safety seats, is the seat belts while that for unrestrained occupants is the front seat back. The injury measures of restrained adult dummies in rear seats in frontal crash tests were generally higher than those of dummies of the same size in the driver and front passenger seat. The seat backs of integrated rear seats experienced excessive forward rotation in frontal crash tests, thereby causing the dummy’s head to hit the console or front seatback, resulting in high head and neck injury measures. The field and vehicle crash test data indicate that rear seat restraints could be further optimized to mitigate injury in frontal crashes for older rear seat occupants...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} 32 years of {{production}} {{of the first generation}} IRS, the disc brakes were mounted at the inboard ends of the driveshafts in order to minimise unsprung weight at the outboard end. The hydraulic brake calipers were mounted directly onto the differential. Care was taken to prevent heat generated by the brakes from damaging the differential output seals, although this was never totally successful. [...] The parking brake used separate mechanical calipers acting on the discs.For the 1993-1996 model XJS, the brakes were moved to the outboard position. This was achieved using the hub carriers from the Second Generation IRS, which by that time had already been in production for seven years for the XJ6 (XJ40). Moving the <b>rear</b> brakes <b>outboard</b> eliminated the heat transfer problem and allowed for easier servicing. The parking brake then used brake shoes inside a brake drum in the centre of the disc rotor.|$|R
5000|$|The 2010 {{model year}} refresh added {{redesigned}} forward and rear fascias, updated interior, an active Eco Mode energy-saving capability, and redesigned chassis and drivetrain components to the non-hybrid models. The interior received additional chrome trim {{for the center}} console, an optional DVD entertainment system behind the center armrest (versus the ceiling drop-down version available before), and in certain markets, an all-digital instrument panel with night vision capability. The [...] "Executive" [...] seating option gained a five-seat configuration, and vibrating massage for both <b>outboard</b> <b>rear</b> seats was introduced.

50|$|The Latham Trimotor (its Latham {{type number}} is not known) {{was a large}} biplane, with unequal span, blunted rectanglar plan wings with high aspect ratio for the time. The wings were built around a pair of spars {{constructed}} from spruce and poplar plywood. They were fabric covered and in three parts, a central section attached to the upper hull and two outer sections divided into two bays with three vertical pairs of parallel interplane struts, the innermost at the junction with the central section. The upper wing centre section was supported over the fuselage by a transverse inverted V-strut to the forward longeron and by two vertical struts to the <b>rear</b> longeron. <b>Outboard,</b> the overhangs of the upper wing were supported by outward leaning pairs of struts from {{the feet of the}} outer interplane pairs; below these points small, flat bottomed floats which provided lateral stability on water were mounted. Its ailerons were balanced and mounted only on the upper wing; they were short, reaching outwards from the outer interplane struts.|$|R

The right wing outboard of the number four engine broke away as well, causing structural damage to the fuselage and triggering {{the breakup of the}} aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|Turn {{signals are}} {{in almost every}} case {{activated}} by a horizontal lever (or [...] "stalk") protruding {{from the side of the}} steering column, though on some vehicles it protrudes from the dashboard. The outboard end of the stalk is pushed clockwise to activate the right turn signals, or anticlockwise for the left turn signals. In most cases, the signal stalk is on the <b>outboard,</b> usually <b>left</b> hand side of the column, in both left and right hand drive cars. Regulations do not specify a mandatory location for the turn signal control, only that it be visible and operable by the belted-in driver, and—at least in North America—that it be labelled with a specific symbol if it is not located on the left side of the steering column. The international UN Regulations do not include analogous specifications.|$|R
50|$|The 1980s saw {{relatively}} few {{changes to the}} Country Squire. In 1983 the carbureted engine was replaced with throttle body fuel injection.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and propose improvements to the injury mitigation systems, in near-side impacts, for 6 common sitting positions of young adolescents using a previously validated model. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car, including head and thorax–pelvis air bags, which was impacted laterally by a barrier in 2 load cases. The SID-IIs finite element model was used for the evaluations and was seated in 6 different positions in the <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> seat: the nominal anthropomorphic test device (ATD) position, 1 inboard position, 3 outboard positions, and 1 braking (forward) position. These positions have previously been identified as common sitting positions in awake and asleep children. The studied dependent variables were head injury criterion (HIC) 36, resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest viscous criterion, and chest deflection. Results: The lowest head injury measures were seen in the braking positions and in the nominal ATD position, and the highest were seen in the inboard and outboard positions. The lowest chest injury measures were recorded in the inboard and nominal ATD positions, and the highest were recorded in the outboard and braking positions. The occupant in the outboard positions interfered with the air bags during their deployment. The occupant in inboard and braking positions tended to push the curtain air bag over the windowsill. Conclusions: Studies that investigate the injury mitigation effects in common sitting positions, beyond the nominal ATD position, are essential to highlight means to provide improved and robust safety for child occupants. This study was based on the SID-IIs 5 th percentile female, which has very similar anthropometry to a 50 th percentile 12 -year-old. Therefore, the conclusions of this study are applicable to many 11 -year-olds up to young adolescents, as well as to small females. The outboard and inboard positions of this study resulted in the highest head injury measures. Although all of the injury measures were only slightly higher than the nominal position, the trends suggest that, in near-side impacts, these positions should be discouraged. The extensively outboard positions resulted in unfavorable air bag positioning during deployment. The inboard position resulted in head strikes further forward of the nominal one; the curtain air bags need inflated cells at all locations of head strike...|$|R
