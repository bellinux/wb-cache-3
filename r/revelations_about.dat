The two republics were absorbed into the British Empire, although the British were forced to make a number of concessions and reparations to the Boers. The granting of limited autonomy for the area ultimately led to the establishment of the Union of South Africa.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop the}} Probability Scaling Method, which rescales short-window {{announcement}} period returns; and the Intervention Method, which uses returns associated with intervening events, to estimate value improvements from tender offers. These methods address biases in conventional techniques, which measure {{only a fraction}} of the total tender offer gain; and which include <b>revelation</b> <b>about</b> bidder stand-alone value. Perceived value improvements are much larger than traditional methods indicate, so that we cannot reject the hypothesis that bidders on average pay fair prices for targets. Furthermore, our new methods affect inferences about economic forces in the takeover market. We identify several effects (higher combined bidder-target stock returns for hostile offers, lower for equity offers, and lower for diversifying offers) that reflect differences in <b>revelation</b> <b>about</b> stand-alone value, not gains from combination. ...|$|R
