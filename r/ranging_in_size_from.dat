5|$|Cluster {{diffusion}} involves {{motion of}} atomic clusters <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> dimers to islands containing hundreds of atoms. Motion {{of the cluster}} may occur via the displacement of individual atoms, sections of the cluster, or the entire cluster moving at once. All of these processes involve {{a change in the}} cluster’s center of mass.|$|E
5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of {{at least}} 60plant {{families}} are eaten by lemurs <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.|$|E
5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of}} the colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{have adapted}} to fill many open {{ecological}} niches since making their way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. <b>Ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.|$|E
5|$|Most cnidarians prey on organisms <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> {{plankton}} {{to animals}} several {{times larger than}} themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from dinoflagellates, and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals—which form the structural foundation for coral reefs—possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters, other cnidarians {{can be found at}} great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.|$|E
5|$|Polydopamine {{coatings}} {{can form}} on objects <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> nanoparticles to large surfaces. Polydopamine layers have chemical properties {{that have the}} potential to be extremely useful, and numerous studies have examined their possible applications. At the simplest level, they can be used for protection against damage by light, or to form capsules for drug delivery. At a more sophisticated level, their adhesive properties may make them useful as substrates for biosensors or other biologically active macromolecules.|$|E

5|$|The {{rings of}} Saturn {{are made up}} of objects <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> {{microscopic}} to moonlets hundreds of meters across, each in its own orbit around Saturn. Thus a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, because there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. Over 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The encircled Soviet forces {{continued}} to fight, and the Wehrmacht had to employ 28 divisions to eliminate them, using troops {{which could have}} supported the offensive towards Moscow. The remnants of the Soviet Western and Reserve Fronts retreated and manned new defensive lines around Mozhaisk. Although losses were high, some of the encircled units escaped in small groups, <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> platoons to full rifle divisions. Soviet resistance near Vyazma also provided time for the Soviet high command to reinforce the four armies defending Moscow (the 5th, 16th, 43rd and 49th Armies). Three rifle and two tank divisions were transferred from East Siberia with more to follow.|$|E

5|$|With the 2005 {{discovery}} of a new chamber and the 2008 {{discovery of}} two further tomb entrances, the valley is known to contain 63 tombs and chambers (<b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> KV54, a simple pit, to KV5, a complex tomb with over 120 chambers). It was the principal burial place of the major royal figures of the Egyptian New Kingdom, {{as well as a}} number of privileged nobles. The royal tombs are decorated with scenes from Egyptian mythology and give clues as to the beliefs and funerary rituals of the period. Almost all of the tombs seem to have been opened and robbed in antiquity, but they still give an idea of the opulence and power of the Pharaohs.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups are individuals that shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, {{as well as the}} seasonal formations of core groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E
5|$|Of the 21,000 civil {{aircraft}} {{registered in the}} UK, 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1.25 and 1.35 million hours flown. The single most common class of aircraft is the fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, but the main area of growth over the last 20 years {{has been in the}} use of more affordable aircraft, such as microlights, amateur built aeroplanes, and smaller helicopters. There are 28,000 Private Pilot Licence holders, and 10,000 certified glider pilots. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than 1,800 aerodromes and landing sites, <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> large regional airports to farm strips, over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes. The GA industry, which is around 7 per cent the size of its CAT cousin, employs 12,000 people, and contributes £1.4 billion to the UK economy.|$|E

5|$|The Marathas {{slipped past}} Stevenson and {{advanced}} on Hyderabad. After receiving reports of their movement on 30 August, Wellesley hurried east {{down to the}} Godavari to intercept. Stevenson, meanwhile, marched westwards to the Maratha city of Jalna which he took by storm. Scindia learned of Wellesley's intentions and returned to a position north of Jalna. Unable to make a clean break from the pursuing British he abandoned plans to raid into Hyderabad and instead assembled his infantry and artillery. The combined Maratha army was around 50,000 strong, the core of which was 10,800 well equipped regular infantry organised into three brigades, trained and commanded by European adventurer and mercenary officers. Colonel Anthony Pohlmann, a Hanoverian and former East India Company sergeant, commanded the largest brigade with eight battalions. A further brigade with five battalions was provided by Begum Samru, and was commanded on her behalf by a Frenchman, Colonel Jean Saleur. The third brigade had four battalions and was commanded by Dutchman, Major John James Dupont. In addition, the Maratha force included 10,000–20,000 of Berar's irregular infantry, some 30,000–40,000 irregular light cavalry and over 100 guns <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> one to 18-pounders.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas' {{force of}} 480 {{men had been}} split into four teams, <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> 60 to 198. On 15 June 1954 these four forces left their bases in Honduras and El Salvador, and {{assembled}} in various towns just outside the Guatemalan border. The largest force was supposed to attack the Atlantic harbor town of Puerto Barrios, while the others attacked the smaller towns of Esquipulas, Jutiapa, and Zacapa, the Guatemalan army's largest frontier post. The invasion plan quickly faced difficulties; the 60-man force was intercepted and jailed by Salvadoran policemen before {{it got to the}} border. At 8:20am on 18 June 1954, Castillo Armas led his invading troops over the border. Ten trained saboteurs preceded the invasion, with the aim of blowing up railways and cutting telegraph lines. At about the same time, Castillo Armas' planes flew over a pro-government rally in the capital. Castillo Armas demanded Árbenz's immediate surrender. The invasion provoked a brief panic in the capital, which quickly decreased as the rebels failed to make any striking moves. Bogged down by supplies and a lack of transportation, Castillo Armas' forces took several days to reach their targets, although their planes blew up a bridge on 19 June.|$|E
