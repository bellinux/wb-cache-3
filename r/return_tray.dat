40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between reasons and attitudes towards a particular behavior, in this case, the behavior of <b>returning</b> <b>trays</b> in cafeterias at James Cook University Singapore (JCU). Findings from the study showed that reasons related to self-responsibility and consideration for others had a strong influence on an individual's attitude towards <b>returning</b> <b>trays.</b> However, reasons related to social identity showed no relationship with an individual's attitude towards <b>returning</b> <b>trays...</b>|$|R

60|$|At {{seven o'clock}} Tuppence volunteered {{to go and}} make some tea. She <b>returned</b> with a <b>tray,</b> {{containing}} the teapot and four cups.|$|R
60|$|The waiter <b>returns</b> for the <b>tray</b> and glasses. As he enters, {{the girl}} crushes {{a little empty}} {{pasteboard}} box {{in her hand and}} throws it in a corner. She is stirring something in her glass with her hatpin.|$|R
50|$|Bryant {{finished}} his meal, {{walked into the}} café and <b>returned</b> his <b>tray,</b> assisted by some people who {{opened the door for}} him. He put his bag down on a table and pulled a Colt AR-15 SP1 Carbine with a Colt scope and one 30-round magazine attached out of the bag. He left the bag which contained, among other things, the knife with which he had stabbed Martin, on the table. It is believed the magazine was partially emptied from the shootings at Seascape.|$|R
6000|$|... "That way I {{never thought}} of it. But the friendliest one, that used to soothe my weariness so much, coolly quivering on the ferns, it was taken from me, never to <b>return,</b> as <b>Tray</b> did just now. The shadow of a birch. The tree was struck by lightning, and brother cut it up. You saw the cross-pile out-doors--the buried root lies under it; but not the shadow. That is flown, and never will come back, nor ever {{anywhere}} stir again." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{wrapped her}} own warm shawl {{about the other}} woman's thin shoulders. Then she hastened {{to the kitchen and}} soon <b>returned,</b> {{carrying}} a <b>tray</b> of food and a steaming hot drink. She wheeled a small table up to her visitor's side and said, very kindly, ...|$|R
60|$|She tripped {{out into}} the passage, <b>returning</b> with the <b>tray,</b> which she {{put on the table}} beside Clarence, and then {{standing}} back a little and with her hands tucked soubrette fashion in the tiny pockets of her apron, gazed at him with a mischievous smile.|$|R
2500|$|Bryant {{finished}} his meal, {{walked into the}} café and <b>returned</b> his <b>tray,</b> assisted by some people who {{opened the door for}} him. He put his bag down on a table and pulled a Colt AR-15 SP1 Carbine [...] with a Colt scope and one 30-round magazine attached out of the bag. He left the bag which contained, among other things, the knife with which he had stabbed Martin, on the table. It is believed the magazine was partially emptied from the shootings at Seascape.|$|R
60|$|I looked surprised; but in {{a moment}} more I was fairly {{overwhelmed}} when Lucretia left the room for a minute, and then <b>returned</b> carrying a <b>tray</b> covered with dishes. These she rapidly and dexterously placed upon the table, and then asked me to take my seat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless your heart! Of course I {{can spare}} you some food," [...] the woman answered, and {{entering}} her cottage she soon <b>returned</b> with a <b>tray</b> loaded with sandwiches, cakes and cheese. One {{of the children}} drew a bucket of clear, cold water from a spring and the three wanderers ate heartily and enjoyed the good things immensely.|$|R

6000|$|The {{black girl}} went {{off at a}} trot towards the house, and the young lady strolled round and round {{that portion of the}} garden, until her black {{attendant}} <b>returned,</b> with a <b>tray</b> containing coffee, lemonade, and fruits. This she placed on the table, and then in answer to the [...] "You need not wait," [...] of the lady, again retired.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I expec' the larder'll be in a swim,' she replied, 'but old bottled stuff don't {{take any}} harm from wet.' She <b>returned</b> with a <b>tray,</b> all in order, and they ate and drank together, and took {{observations}} of the falling flood till dawn opened its bleared eyes on the wreck {{of what had been}} a fair garden. Midmore, cold and annoyed, found himself humming: ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Mrs. Hutter <b>returned,</b> {{carrying}} a <b>tray,</b> which she set upon a chair, and drew to Carley's side. [...] "Eat an' drink," [...] she said, {{as if these}} actions were the cardinally important ones of life. [...] "Flo, you carry her bags up to that west room we always give to some particular person we want to love Lolomi." [...] Next she threw sticks of wood upon the fire, making it crackle and blaze, then seated herself near Carley and beamed upon her.|$|R
60|$|Janet's nervous {{irritation}} now {{broke out}} into sobs instead of complainings; {{and her mother}} was thankful, for after that crisis there would very likely come relenting, and tenderness, and comparative calm. She went out to make some tea, and when she <b>returned</b> with the <b>tray</b> in her hands, Janet had dried her eyes and now turned them towards her mother with a faint attempt to smile; but the poor face, in its sad blurred beauty, looked all the more piteous.|$|R
60|$|But {{the sound}} of a voice coming from what he thought a mere vision was too much for the Nome King's shaken nerves. He gave a yell of fear and rushed from the room. Tiktok followed, so the King bolted through the {{corridors}} on a swift run and bumped against Kaliko, who was <b>returning</b> with a <b>tray</b> of things to eat. The sound of the breaking dishes, as they struck the floor, added to the King's terror and he yelled again and dashed into a great cavern where a thousand Nomes were at work hammering metal.|$|R
50|$|As of July 2012, Sheba {{is again}} {{available}} in the United States. However, it now comes in pull-tab cans {{as opposed to the}} former plastic trays. In mid-2014, Sheba once again <b>returned</b> to plastic <b>trays</b> with its Perfect Portions line. One can of Sheba brand cat food contains two servings, but the consumer must manually separate the portions for their pet. The Perfect Portions line reintroduced the plastic packaging by splitting the contents of one can into two separate serving trays, thus eliminating the need for manual separation. The line is priced slightly higher than Sheba canned food.|$|R
60|$|Manipulation.--A tray {{is taken}} out, the three weights that it {{contains}} is shuffled {{by the operator}} who then passes them on to the experimenter. The latter sits at ease with his hand in an unconstrained position, and lifts the weights in turn between his finger and thumb, the finger pressing against the top, the thumb against {{the bottom of the}} cartridge. Guided by the touch alone, he arranges them in the tray in what he conceives to be their proper sequence; he then <b>returns</b> the <b>tray</b> to the operator, who notes the result, the operator then reshuffles the weights and repeats the trial. It is necessary to begin with coarse preparatory tests, to accustom the operatee to the character of the work. After a minute or two the operator may begin to record results, and the testing may go for several minutes, until the hand begins to tire, the judgment to be confused, and blunders to arise. Practice does not seem to increase the delicacy of perception after the first few trials, so much as might be expected.|$|R
6000|$|Lydia {{was hardly}} kissed {{so much at}} home during a year {{as she had been}} since meeting Mrs. Erwin. Her aunt Maria sparely embraced her when she went and came each week from the Mill Village; {{anything}} more than this would have come of insincerity between them; but it had been agreed that Mrs. Erwin's demonstrations of affection, of which she had been lavish during her visit to South Bradfield, might not be so false. Lydia accepted them submissively, and she said, when Veronica <b>returned</b> for the <b>tray,</b> [...] "I hate to give you so much trouble. And sending her all the way to Trieste on my account,--I felt ashamed. There wasn' a thing for her to do." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon this, the {{old woman}} cleared the little table, {{went out of the}} room, and quickly <b>returned</b> with a <b>tray</b> on which was a dish of little rusks and a small precise pat of butter, cool, symmetrical, white, and plump. The old man who had been {{standing}} by the door in one attitude during the whole interview, looking at the mother up-stairs as he had looked at the son down-stairs, went out at the same time, and, after a longer absence, <b>returned</b> with another <b>tray</b> on which was the greater part of a bottle of port wine (which, to judge by his panting, he had brought from the cellar), a lemon, a sugar-basin, and a spice box. With these materials and the aid of the kettle, he filled a tumbler with a hot and odorous mixture, measured out and compounded with as much nicety as a physician's prescription. Into this mixture Mrs Clennam dipped certain of the rusks, and ate them; while {{the old woman}} buttered certain other of the rusks, which were to be eaten alone. When the invalid had eaten all the rusks and drunk all the mixture, the two trays were removed; and the books and the candle, watch, handkerchief, and spectacles were replaced upon the table. She then put on the spectacles and read certain passages aloud from a book--sternly, fiercely, wrathfully--praying that her enemies (she made them by her tone and manner expressly hers) might be put {{to the edge of the}} sword, consumed by fire, smitten by plagues and leprosy, that their bones might be ground to dust, and that they might be utterly exterminated. As she read on, years seemed to fall away from her son like the imaginings of a dream, and all the old dark horrors of his usual preparation for the sleep of an innocent child to overshadow him.|$|R
2500|$|The {{next table}} had held {{a group of}} ten friends, but some had just left the table to <b>return</b> their meal <b>trays</b> and visit the gift shop. Bryant fired one shot that killed Kevin Vincent Sharp, 68. The second hit Walter Bennett, 66, passed through his body and struck Raymond John Sharp, 67, Kevin Sharp's brother, killing both. The three had their backs towards Bryant, and were unaware what was happening. They at first {{believed}} someone was letting off firecrackers. One of them made the comment [...] "That's not funny" [...] after hearing the first few shots, not realizing that they were real. The shots were all close range, with the gun at, or just inches away from, {{the back of their}} heads. Gerald Broome, Gaye Fidler and her husband John were all struck by bullet fragments, but survived.|$|R
