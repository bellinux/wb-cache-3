5000|$|Levomethorphan (INN, BAN) is an opioid {{analgesic}} of the morphinan {{family that has}} never been marketed. It is the L-stereoisomer of <b>racemethorphan</b> (methorphan). The effects of the two isomers of the <b>racemethorphan</b> are quite different, with dextromethorphan (DXM) contrarily being an antitussive at low doses and a dissociative hallucinogen at much higher doses. It is about five times stronger than morphine.|$|E

It is listed under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 and is {{therefore}} listed in the United States as a Controlled Substance, specifically as a Narcotic in Schedule II with an ACSCN of 9732 and an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 3 grammes in 2014.

5000|$|Chemically, {{levorphanol}} {{belongs to}} the morphinan class and is (−)-3-hydroxy-N-methyl-morphinan.It is the [...] "left-handed" [...] (levorotatory) stereoisomer of racemorphan, that is the racemic mixture of the two stereoisomers with differing pharmacology. The [...] "right-handed" [...] (dextrorotatory) enantiomer of racemorphan is dextrorphan (DXO), an antitussive, potent dissociative hallucinogen (NMDA receptor antagonist), and weakly active opioid. DXO is an active metabolite of the pharmaceutical drug dextromethorphan (DXM), which, analogously to DXO, is an enantiomer of the racemic mixture <b>racemethorphan</b> along with levomethorphan, the latter of which has similar properties to those of levorphanol.|$|E

De. xtrorphan tartrate, 4 which, like levorphan and racemorphan, was synthesized by Schnider and associates (1949, 1950), has also received the at-tention of Fromherz (1951), Pellmont (1951), Isbell and Fraser (1951), Benson et al. (1952) and Slomka and Gross (1952). More recently, the corresponding methyl ethers, levomethorphan hydro-bromide, 5 <b>racemethorphan</b> hydrobromide 6 and dextromethorphan hydrobromide 7 were prepared by Schnider and GrUssner (1951). These have been pharma-cologically investigated in animals by Fromherz, Peilmont and B#{ 228 }chtold (1950 - 1953) and by Benson et al. (1952). Slomka and Gross (1951) reported upon the analgesic activity of <b>racemethorphan</b> administered orally to man and Isbell and Fraser (1951) have discussed the addiction liability of this agent. These latter workers (1952) similarly reported upon the addiction liability of levomethorphan {{and the absence of}} addiction liability of dextromethorphan. This paper is concerned with the comparative evaluation of the three parent compounds (levorphan, racemorphan and dextrorphan) and of the three methyl ethers (levomethorphan, <b>racemethorphan</b> and dextromethorphan).
