40|$|A {{prototype}} airborne collision alerting logic {{was developed}} for aircraft on approach to closely-spaced parallel runways. A novel design methodology was used based on collision probabilities instead of traditional spatial or temporal alerting criteria. With this technique, an alert is issued when {{the probability of a}} collision exceeds an acceptable threshold value. The logic was based on a hazard level corresponding to the current Precision Runway Monitor System of one accident in every one thousand worst-case blunders. Probability contours were constructed through Monte Carlo simulation over a range of aircraft position, speed, heading, and turn rate conditions. These contours were stored in look-up tables that were accessed in real time for evaluation during numerical simulation of approaches. Three runway spacings were investigated: 3, 400, 2, 500, and 1, 700 ft. The results show that the unnecessary alert rate at 1, 700 ft <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> was double that at 3, 400 ft <b>runway</b> <b>spacing.</b> Additionally, the logic induced collisions in two low-closure-rate situations, suggesting that the worst case blunder may not be a drastic heading change.

40|$|As {{the growth}} in air travel {{continues}} over the coming decades, there {{will need to be}} increases in the capacity of the airspace system, especially airports. Technology associated with GPS, along with changes in procedures between air traffic controllers and pilots, has the capability to provide much of the required growth without sacrificing safety and without requiring wholesale expansions of airport land areas. The use of GPS to augment radar surveillance through Automatic Dependent Surveillance- Broadcast (ADS-B) provides a substantial improvement in surveillance accuracy and provides every pilot with information on neighboring traffic, information that does not exist now. Wake vortex turbulence of neighboring traffic is one of the limiting factors on parallel <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> and the in-trail spacing of aircraft. This paper shows how the impact of wake turbulence can be substantially reduced by the use of ADS-B and appropriate displays. The paper presents results of analyses, pilot simulations, and flight-testing that show the required <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> can be reduced from the current 4300 ft. to 750 ft., thus substantially improving landing capacity while minimizing cost and the effect on the environment...|$|E

In anticipation of future high precision guidance, navigation, and data link systems being implemented by the FAA, procedures once deemed unsafe are again being scrutinized for feasibility. The procedure addressed in this paper is simultaneous approaches into an airport with parallel runways spaced less than 1500 ft apart. The goal of this work {{is to determine the}} necessary technological components for reducing the <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> to less than 1500 ft. To assess the probability of collision during any one particular approach, variables such as navigation sensor error, flight technical error, relative longitudinal spacing, relative airspeeds, and data link delay time must all be modeled as probabilistic parameters. This research used Monte Carlo simulations in order to assess the probability of collision. The analysis shows that with a GPS-based Local Area Augmentation System installed and a reliable data link transmitting full state information between aircraft, <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> may be safely reduced to less than 1500 ft...|$|E

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration's Next Generation Air Transportation System will combine {{advanced}} {{air traffic}} management technologies, performance-based procedures, and state-of-the-art avionics to maintain efficient operations throughout the entire arrival phase of flight. Flight deck Interval Management (FIM) operations are expected to use sophisticated airborne spacing capabilities to meet precise in-trail spacing from top-of-descent to touchdown. Recent human-in-the-loop simulations by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have found that selection of the assigned spacing goal using the runway schedule can lead to premature interruptions of the FIM operation during periods of high traffic demand. This study compares three methods for calculating the assigned spacing goal for a FIM operation that is also subject to time-based metering constraints. The particular paradigms investigated include: one based upon the desired <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> interval, one based upon the desired meter fix spacing interval, and a composite method that combines both intervals. These three paradigms are evaluated for the primary arrival procedures to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport using the entire set of Rapid Update Cycle wind forecasts from 2011. For typical meter fix and <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> intervals, the runway- and meter fix-based paradigms exhibit moderate FIM interruption rates due to their inability to consider multiple metering constraints. The addition of larger separation buffers decreases the FIM interruption rate but also significantly reduces the achievable runway throughput. The composite paradigm causes no FIM interruptions, and maintains higher runway throughput more often than the other paradigms. A key implication of the results with respect to time-based metering is that FIM operations using a single assigned spacing goal will not allow reduction of the arrival schedule's excess spacing buffer. Alternative solutions for conducting the FIM operation in a manner more compatible with the arrival schedule are discussed in detail...|$|E

This report briefly describes the AILS operational concept {{and the results of}} a flight test of one implementation of this concept. The focus of this flight test experiment was to validate a prior simulator study, evaluating pilot performance, pilot acceptability, and minimum miss-distances for the rare situation in which an aircraft on one approach intrudes into the path of an aircraft on the other approach. Although the flight data set was not meant to be a statistically valid sample, the trends acquired in flight followed those of the simulator and therefore met the intent of validating the findings from the simulator. Results from this study showed that the design-goal mean miss-distance of 1, 200 feet to potential collision situations was surpassed with an actual mean miss-distance of 1, 859 feet.

This paper investigates how changes in the stochastic variability of flight tracks {{have the potential to}} impact the probability of potential wake encounters.

The results show that the mean and standard deviation of separation, and the vertical standard deviation are the key parameters affecting potential wake encounters. In the parallel-runway scenario, effects of crosswind and <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> are studied. A full factorial design is conducted to estimate the impact of parameters and their interactions, with dominating factors identified.

40|$|Demand in {{the future}} air {{transportation}} system concept is expected to double or triple by 2025 [1]. Increasing airport arrival rates will help meet the growing demand that could be met with additional runways but the expansion airports is met with environmental challenges for the surrounding communities when using current standards and procedures. Therefore, changes to airport operations can improve airport capacity without adding runways. Building additional runways between current ones, or moving them closer, is a potential solution to meeting the increasing demand, as addressed by the Terminal Area Capacity Enhancing Concept (TACEC). TACEC requires robust technologies and procedures {{that need to be}} tested such that operations are not compromised under instrument meteorological conditions. The reduction of <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> for independent simultaneous operations dramatically exacerbates the criticality of wake vortex incursion and the calculation of a safe and proper breakout maneuver.

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{constraints}} on {{the capacity of the}} nation's air transportation system is the landing capacity of its largest airports. Many airports with closely spaced parallel runways suffer a severe runway acceptance rate when the weather conditions do not allow full utilization of these parallel runways. The present requirement for simultaneous independent landings in Instrument Meteorological Conditions, IMC, is at least 4300 feet of lateral <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> (as close as 3000 feet for runways with a Precision Runway Monitor). Operations in Visual Meteorological Conditions, VMC, to Closely Spaced Parallel Approaches only require a lateral <b>runway</b> <b>spacing</b> greater than 750 feet. A study by Hardy and Lewis integrated and extended earlier studies and concepts in lateral traffic separation, longitudinal station keeping, wake prediction, wake display, and the concepts of R N P into a preliminary system concept for Closely Spaced Parallel Approaches in IMC. This system allows IMC airport acceptance rates to approach those for VMC. The system concept that was developed, presented traffic and wake information on the NAVigation Display, NAV, and developed operational procedures for a mix of conventional and Runway Independent Aircraft with different approach speeds to Closely Spaced Parallel Runways. This paper first describes some improvements made on the technology needed to better predict and formulate a probabilistic representation for the time-dependent motion and spreading of the hazardous region associated with the lift-generated vortex wakes of preceding aircraft. In this way, the time at which the vortex wakes of leading aircraft intrude into the airspace of adjacent flight-corridor/runway combinations can be more reliably predicted. Such a prediction is needed because it determines restraints to be placed on in-trail separation distances; or, the allowable time intervals between aircraft executing nearly simultaneous landings or takeoffs on very closely-spaced runways. Improved estimates of wake spreading are achieved by inclusion of representations in the equations for wake spreading due to ambient turbulence and due to the long-wave instability of a vortex pair. Wake motion and spreading due to the time-averaged wind and its variations with time, are retained. The more detailed representation of wake spreading presented here permits the development of probabilistically-based uncertainty estimates for wake spreading. Measurements needed within actual aircraft wake vortices to validate and support this analysis are also described. The second part of the paper uses the improvements in the accuracy of the location of wake vortices to extend the preliminary system concept for Closely Spaced Parallel Approaches described earlier with more robust operational procedures. Additionally, improvements in longitudinal station keeping, wake display, and risk assessment methodologies are incorporated and described...|$|E

Current FAA standards however, require a reduction in terminal operations during instrument-weather conditions at many airports, causing delays and reducing airport capacity. NASA, in cooperation with the FAA, has developed the Terminal Area Productivity Program to achieve clear-weather capacity in instrument- weather conditions for all phases of flight. This paper describes a series of experiments planned to investigate the conceptual design of different systems that provide information to flight crews regarding nearby traffic during the approach phase of flight. The purpose of this investigation is to identify and evaluate different display and auditory interfaces to the crew for use in closely-spaced parallel runway operations. Three separate experiments are planned for the investigation. The first two experiments will be conducted using part-task flight simulators located at the MIT Aeronautical Systems Laboratory and at NASA Ames.

40|$|Although air traffic’s {{growth rate}} has slowed, airport {{capacity}} and environmental issues, especially noise mitigation, {{are identified as}} major challenges that face aviation. From the perspective of flight guidance, the development of segmented or curved approach procedures based on required navigation performance (RNP) allow for rerouting around congested areas and is thus a promising approach in coping with these issues. Considering airports with parallel runway systems, an increased airport capacity can be reached when runways are operated independently. This, however, requires straight precision approaches to be conducted according to current guidelines issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). To help {{pave the way for}} independent operations of segmented approaches at parallel runway systems, an elementary safety concept was developed in previous work that utilizes the ground-based system of precision runway monitoring. Within this concept, a generic airport scenario with two parallel runways was considered, at which a straight approach is proposed for one of the parallel runways and a segmented or curved approach is assumed for a second runway. Based on this, it was shown that a modified concept of precision runway monitoring is capable of achieving target levels of safety comparable to or even more stringent than those defined in the literature for independent parallel precision approaches. Although the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) is by definition not part of this kind of safety assessment, an important question to answer is whether the current ACAS implementation can be characterized as compatible to the proposed approach geometry. Because classical approaches towards parallel runways are already critical with respect to generating nuisance ACAS alerts, this issue might even be exacerbated due to the segmented routing.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} arrival rates at many of today's heavily congested airports, simultaneous approaches are conducted on parallel runways. For many years, the FAA has permitted simultaneous independent instrument approach operations only for those parallel runways with a minimum separation of 4300 feet.
