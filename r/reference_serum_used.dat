None of the vaccines induced an antibody titre equal to that of the <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> <b>used</b> as an indicator of sufficient potency in the European Pharmacopoeia. Neutralizing antibody titres after vaccination correlated highly with the VP 2 content of the vaccines. A significant correlation was also found between the VP 3 content and the antibody response.

40|$|An {{epidemiological}} study of measles-specific immunoglobulin G antibody levels was conducted using {{a representative sample}} of a vaccinated suburban population in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The study aimed to determine immunity status in relation to age and infection or vaccination experience. 549 age-structured samples of sera, collected in 1990, were screened and calibrated to the international <b>reference</b> <b>serum,</b> <b>using</b> measles nucleoprotein in an enzyme immunoassay. In the age group with direct experience of vaccination (9 months to 15 years), whether routine or campaign, over 90 % had detectable antibody {{greater than or equal to}} 50 miu/mL.

In those over 15 years of age, 94 % had antibody levels > 255 miu/mL, assumed to be the result of past infection. The study suggested that, within highly vaccinated populations, a proportion of individuals had measles antibody levels which may be insufficient to protect against reinfection or clinical disease. The implications of these results, and similar findings elsewhere, in relation to the persistence of measles requires investigation; this has particular relevance in Sao Paulo following the recent measles outbreak...|$|R

Total and/or class-specific meningococcal serogroup A and C anticapsular antibody concentrations (in micro-grams per milliliter) were assigned to CDC 1992 by using homologous and heterologous enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA) formats. The <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> ECG was <b>used</b> as a reference standard to assign total anticapsular antibody concentrations to CDC 1992 by a homologous ELISA format.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of functional measles virus-specific neutralizing antibodies is of considerable interest for vaccine-related research. In this study, we developed and standardized a simple, rapid, highly sensitive, and reproducible fluorescence-based plaque reduction microneutralization (PRMN) assay with visual and automated readout, using a recombinant measles virus engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein. The assay is performed in micro format, requires {{less time to}} complete (2 versus 4 to 7 days), and is less labor-intensive and less costly than the classical plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) test, widely accepted as the “gold standard” in measles serology. Two available WHO international anti-measles virus standards and one in-house <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> were <b>used</b> to develop and standardize the new assay.

For validation, we used three groups of low, moderate, and high measles virus vaccine responders’ sera with moderate values of correlation in antibody levels (mIU/ml) between PRMN and the Dade Behring immunoglobulin G enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The PRMN assay was more sensitive at low antibody levels and more informative in terms of protection than this commercial EIA.

Accurate determination of VZV immunity in pregnant women exposed to VZV, with no history of chickenpox, guides therapeutic interventions. The accepted gold standard assay for the determination of immunity/protection against Varicella Zoster virus was for many years the fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA) assay which is labour intensive and subjective. A validated alternative is the Merck glycoprotein EIA (Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories, West Point, PA, USA) which reports VZV IgG levels in enzyme units per ml (EU/ml) because an internal, non-international <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> is <b>used</b> as calibrator. Comparison of different VZV IgG detection assays is hampered by a lack of an agreed cut-off in standardised units. A time resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA) for VZV IgG using British Standard VZV antibody has been developed and standardised. The limit of detection of VZV IgG by this assay was of the order 39 - 78 mIU/ml. Following comparison with the Merck glycoprotein EIA and the application of the USA Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended 5. 0 EU/ml cut-off the following standardised cut-offs in mIU/ml are proposed. A VZV TRFIA IgG cut-off of less than 100 mIU/ml VZV IgG equates with susceptibility and an equivocal range of 100 mIU/ml to less than 150 mIU/ml is proposed. VZV IgG levels of 150 mIU/ml, or greater, are indicative of natural infection at some time and the ability to mount a protective immune response is inferred...|$|R

In 2005, {{it was estimated that}} there remained between 2 and 5 years' supply of lot 89 SF. Since lot 89 SF was the reference standard used in the evaluation of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevnar (PCV 7), the link to clinical efficacy would be severed if stocks became completely depleted. Furthermore, demonstration of immune responses comparable to those elicited by PCV 7 is a licensure approach used for new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, so a replacement reference standard was required. A total of 278 volunteers were immunized with the 23 -valent unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine Pneumovax II, and a unit of blood was obtained twice within 120 days following immunization. Plasma was prepared, pooled, and confirmed to be free from hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV. The pooled serum was poured at 6 ml per vial into 15, 333 vials and lyophilized. Immunological bridging of 007 sp to 89 SF was used to establish equivalent reference values for 13 pneumococcal capsular serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6 A, 6 B, 7 F, 9 V, 14, 18 C, 19 A, 19 F and 23 F) by five independent laboratories.

40|$|A human anti-dextran serum, EAK, with IgG {{antibodies}} {{restricted to}} subclass IgG 2, was tested for {{its capacity to}} induce lysis of dextran-coated chicken erythrocytes by normal human lymphocytes or monocytes. Another human anti-dextran serum, RGM, with most antibodies belonging to sublass IgG 1, and a hyperimmune rabbit anti-dextran <b>serum</b> were <b>used</b> for <b>reference.</b> In lymphocyte-mediated erythrolysis, serum EAK gave rise to 51 -Cr release varying from 20 % to 80 % in different experiments. The hyperimmune rabbit serum was 100 to 1000 times more active, whereas serum RGM was consistently negative. These results correlated well with the concentration of anti-dextran antibodies in these sera. In monocyte-mediated erythrolysis serum EAK had a somewhat higher titer than in lymphocyte-mediated lysis, and serum RGM had a weak but significant activity at low dilutions. Serum EAK also induced erythrophagocytosis by monocytes. Ultracentrifugation did not significantly decrease the inductive capacity of this serum. The results show that antibodies of human sublass IgG 2 are efficient inducers of effector functions in both lymphocytic and monocytic cells. Myeloma proteins of the four IgG subclasses were tested for inhibitory capacity in lymphocyte- or monocyte-mediated erythrolysis. Either serum EAK or the rabbit <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> was <b>used</b> for induction of erythrolysis. Individual myeloma proteins within and between the subclasses varied considerably in inhibitory power. However, whereas IgG 1, IgG 2, and IgG 3 proteins inhibited lymphocyte-mediated erythrolysis induced by either type of antiserum, the two IgG 4 proteins tested were essentially negative. These results suggest a lack of specificity of the Fc receptor for subclasses IgG 1, IgG 2, and IgG 3 in both heterologous and homologous inhibition. In monocyte-mediated erythrolysis, IgG 1 and IgG 3 were strong inhibitors, whereas inhibition by IgG 2 and IgG 4 was weak and inconsistent. This pattern was seen regardless of whether and inducing antiserum was of rabbit or human origin. Similar results were obtained in monocyte-induced erythrophagocytosis induced by serum EAK.

In the present work, a novel neutralization test is presented which takes advantage of a modified vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) from which the glycoprotein G gene has been deleted and replaced by reporter genes. This single-cycle virus was trans-complemented with RABV envelope glycoprotein. Neutralization of this pseudotype virus with RABV <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> or immune sera from vaccinated mice showed a strong correlation with the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). Importantly, pseudotype viruses containing the envelope glycoproteins of other lyssaviruses were neutralized by <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> to a significantly lesser extent or were not neutralized at all. Taken together, a pseudotype virus system has been successfully developed which allows the safe, fast, and sensitive detection of neutralizing antibodies directed against different lyssaviruses...|$|R

The antiserum is specific for H. capsulatum in the immunodiffusion test {{and can be}} <b>used</b> as <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> for identifying antibodies to these antigens in sera from suspected cases histoplasmosis. We found that (1) hand m antigens are not located {{on the surface of}} yeast-phase cells and (ii) complement fixation releases the antigens reactive in the complement fixation test from yeast-phase cells...|$|R

Parthenium reference allergen discs and positive <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> were also generated. These reference reagents could not only be used for the quantitation of Parthenium-specific IgE in the sera of rhinitis patients but also for the evaluation of allergenic activity (relative potency and lot-to-lot variation) of different batches of Parthenium pollen...|$|R
40|$|An {{available}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) was {{studied for}} the detection of anti-B. canis antibodies in the sera of dogs using, indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) as a reference test. ELISA uses a soluble antigenic preparation of B. canis and the optimal dilutions of the antigen, serum and conjugate were determined by check board titration, using positive and negative <b>reference</b> <b>serum.</b> The soluble antigen preparation of B. canis merozoites was 10 µg. mL- 1, with reference sera from positive and negative in a single dilution of 1 : 100, and conjugated to 1 : 4. 000. A total of 246 serum samples were collected from dogs during the rabies vaccination campaign in Jaboticabal, São Paulo, Brazil and examined for the presence of antibodies against B. canis by ELISA and IFAT. Under these conditions, the average absorbance of negative serum was 0. 129 ± 0. 025, resulting in a cut-off value of 0. 323 (ELISA level 3) and the average absorbance of positive <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> was 2. 156 ± 1. 187. The serological positive samples tested for B. canis by ELISA and IFAT were 67. 89 % (n = 167) and 59. 35 % (n = 146), respectively. These results suggest that ELISA described may prove to be an effective serological test to diagnose canine babesiosis...|$|R
40|$|Although {{antibodies}} against nuclear antigens {{are considered}} the hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 1, antibodies against cytoplasmic constituents have also been identified (1, 2). Despite their recognition more than 25 years ago, the prevalence, antigenic specificities, and disease associations of antiribosomal antibodies (ARA) are all controversial (3 - 10). Since these problems may relate to detection of different ribosomal or ribosome-associated antigens, we attempted to define more precisely {{the identity of the}} ribosomal protein antigens. The results {{of this study indicate that}} ARA reactive with ribosomal proteins occur in ~ 5 - 10 % of SLE patients, but are highly specific, binding to epitopes on 3 out of a total of- 80 proteins. Materials and Methods Antibody Screening Procedures. Cellular localization of antigens was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using Hep- 2 cells as substrate. The effect of the enzymes RNase (50 #g/ml), trypsin (5 ~zg/ml), and proteinase K (0. 5 ~g/ml) on the intensity of immunofluorescence was quantitatively analyzed using a FIAX fluorometer, kindly loaned by Dr. L. J. Kagen (The Hospital for Special Surgery). Reactivity with saline-soluble extracts of human spleen and rabbit thymus was determined by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) (11) <b>using</b> standard <b>reference</b> <b>serum</b> to Ro, La, Sm, and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) (12).
