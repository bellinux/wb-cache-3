The magnitude of such contribution will highlight the importance of copyright-based industries in national economy. This study broadens the scope of discussion of copyright which traditionally covers only legal framework. Recognition on the economic contribution of copyright-based industries therefore will bring policy implications {{on the development of}} the industry and protection of copyrights in Indonesia. Copyright issue is crucial in the era of entrepreneurship and creative economy since it protects one's invention and enables the inventor to own, buy, sell, and use their property in a market economy. This study adopts World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) framework and methodology to quantify the contribution of copyright and <b>related</b> <b>right</b> industries in Indonesia in terms of output, value-added, and employment. Following WIPO's methodology, the copyright and <b>related</b> <b>right</b> industries are categorized into four layers, that is, core copyright, interdependent copyright, partial copyright, and non-dedicated support industries. This study has three objectives, that is (1) identifying the copyright-based industries, which are categorized to the four categories of industries, (2) calculating the economic contribution of the four categories of copyright industries, and (3) comparing the results with those of other countries...|$|R

25|$|In the European Union, {{copyrights}} {{have been}} harmonized amongst {{the member states}} by the EU directive 93/98/EEC on harmonising the term of copyright protection. This binding directive, which became effective on July 1, 1995, has raised the duration of copyrights throughout the union to 70 years p.m.a. It also includes in its article 7 a mandatory rule of the shorter term for works from non-EU countries. Within the EU, no comparison of terms is applied, and—as in the Berne Convention or in the UCC—existing international obligations (such as bilateral treaties) may override this rule of the shorter term. Directive 93/98/EEC was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain <b>related</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Design rights {{fall between}} {{copyright}} and patent law: {{they are sometimes}} considered to be industrial property and sometimes a <b>related</b> <b>right</b> to copyright. The Berne Convention requires the protection of [...] "applied art", but allows a shorter protection period of twenty-five years after creation. Although it requires protection to the same minimum standards as for copyright, the Convention does not require that the protection be called [...] "copyright", a fact used by many countries to protect applied art and certain artistic designs by a <b>related</b> design <b>right.</b> In countries where applied art can be protected by normal copyright term (e.g., Germany), an extremely high level of originality and creatlivity is demanded.|$|R
2500|$|DADVSI (generally {{pronounced}} as dadsi) is the abbreviation of the French Loi sur le Droit d’Auteur et les Droits Voisins dans la Société de l’Information (in English: [...] "law on authors' {{rights and}} <b>related</b> <b>rights</b> {{in the information}} society"). It is a bill reforming French copyright law, mostly in order to implement the 2001 European directive on copyright (known as EUCD), which in turn implements a 1996 WIPO treaty.|$|E

2500|$|In Germany, X-ray {{images as}} well as MRT, ultrasound, PET and {{scintigraphy}} images are protected by (copyright-like) <b>related</b> <b>rights</b> or neighbouring rights. This protection does not require creativity (as would be necessary for regular copyright protection) and lasts only for 50 years after image creation, if not published within 50 years, or for 50 {{years after the first}} legitimate publication. The letter of the law grants this right to the [...] "Lichtbildner", i.e. the person who created the image. The literature seems to uniformly consider the medical doctor, dentist or veterinary physician as the rights holder, which may result from the circumstance that in Germany many x-rays are performed in ambulatory setting and that the doctor prescribes the settings for the individual imaging.|$|E
40|$|On 14 September 2016, the European Commission {{proposed}} a Directive on “copyright in the Digital Single Market”. This proposal includes an Article 11 on the “protection of press publications concerning digital uses”, {{according to which}} “Member States shall provide publishers of press publications with the rights provided for in Article 2 and Article 3 (2) of Directive 2001 / 29 /EC for the digital use of their press publications. ” Relying on the experiences and debates surrounding the German and Spanish laws in this area, this study presents a legal analysis of the proposal for an EU <b>related</b> <b>right</b> for press publishers (RRPP). After a brief overview over the general limits of the EU competence to introduce such a new <b>related</b> <b>right,</b> the study critically examines the purpose of an RRPP.

40|$|After several failed {{national}} attempts (notably, in Germany and Spain) {{to secure}} remuneration for press publishers for the licensing of press contents by aggregation services and search engines, the proposed Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market grants press publishers an exclusive <b>related</b> <b>right</b> {{that would allow}} them to license (or prohibit) digital uses of their press publications for a period of 20 years. This proposal completely upsets the delicate (and necessary) balance between the protection of copyright and the non-protection of information. It is contrary to international obligations (such as Art. 10 (1) BC) and inconsistent with CJEU doctrine concluding that that linking to contents freely available online does not qualify as an act of communication to the public (Svensson, Bestwater, C-More Entertainment, GS Media). Because of the fundamental role that news and information plays in a democratic society, and specially on the internet, any copyright rule affecting news must be carefully balanced. An exclusive right to control (authorize, prohibit or license in exclusive) the linking of press contents online may have negative effects for the competition in the market and for the development of the information society altogether and fail to achieve its purpose. Nothing suggests that a <b>related</b> <b>right</b> is going to achieve anything different from what has been achieved through the authors’ rights in press-publications. If we want to “ensure quality journalism and citizen’s access to information” a <b>related</b> <b>right</b> for press publishers is not the way to go! Copyright should not be (mis) used to secure fair remuneration for the value of information; these are two different assets...|$|R
