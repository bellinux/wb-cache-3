5|$|The other fare {{control area}} at the station's east (railroad north) end, {{accessed}} by a <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> the platform, is unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and two staircases {{going up to the}} northwest and southeast corners of East 205th Street and Perry Avenue. The token booth at this location was closed on July 30, 2005 and removed sometime afterward.|$|E
5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock <b>ramp,</b> <b>to</b> allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|After {{unsuccessful}} litigation to {{stop the}} project, the Big Four Bridge was converted into a pedestrian and bicycle bridge as part of Louisville Waterfront Park and the ongoing revitalization of the Louisville riverfront. This conversion had been proposed and planned since the 1990s. The Indiana Department of Transportation pledged $1million for the project to build a <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> the Big Four Bridge on the Indiana side, on Riverside Drive, and Jeffersonville pledged $200,000; early estimates were that the Indiana ramp would cost $2.8million, but was likely to increase. The Kentucky ramp was expected to cost $4million; the ramp foundation is already done. Fixing the Big Four Bridge was expected to cost $3million and take 18months. The only other facility still standing that was owned by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway is the Spring Street Freight House. However, the mayor of Jeffersonville, Tom Galligan, called for a redesign of the entrance <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> the bridge on the Indiana side, stressing that the proposed ramp would be unattractive and that {{the building of the}} column on a flood plain would probably not be possible. Galligan pointed out that neither the United States Coast Guard nor the Army Corps of Engineers had approved of the planned rampway. Galligan said he would rather have a ramp that reached over the floodwall and ended on Mulberry Street, causing a less severe incline on and off the bridge. Previous plans to access the Big Four Bridge included building an elevator.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. The platoon moved forward {{on either side of the}} girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Kentucky and Indiana {{announced}} that the two states, along with the City of Jeffersonville, would allocate $22 million in funding to complete the Big Four Bridge project, creating a pedestrian and bicycle path to link Louisville and Jeffersonville. Indiana would spend up to $8 million and the City of Jeffersonville would provide $2 million in matching dollars to pay for construction of a <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> the Big Four Bridge. Kentucky pledged $12 million to replace the deck on the bridge and connect it to the spiral ramp that was completed in Waterfront Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff faced Smackdown General Manager Theodore Long (with Palmer Canon). Two referees from each show officiated the match. Theodore Long, began by {{avoiding}} Eric's attacks. As Canon climbed on the apron, and distracted the referees, Bischoff used his obi to choke Long. Bischoff continued choking Long and applied the sleeper hold. Cannon distracted the referees again as Long hit Bischoff with his shoe. The Boogeyman's music played with Bischoff sending the referees up the <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> stop him. The Boogeyman delivered a pumphandle slam to Bischoff and Long pinned Bischoff {{to win the}} match.|$|E

5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was {{later learned that}} this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> provide access to the handicapped.|$|E
5|$|MD 704 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Eastern Avenue near the eastern {{corner of the}} District of Columbia. The highway continues south as 63rd Street, which heads south toward Southern Avenue and East Capitol Street. MD 704 heads northeast as a six-lane divided highway through the city of Seat Pleasant, where the highway intersects Addison Road at staggered intersections. Addison Road leads to St. Matthew's Church, which {{is also known as}} the Addison Chapel. After leaving the city, the state highway crosses Cabin Branch and intersects Sheriff Road at an oblique angle. MD 704 passes through Landover, where the highway traverses Cattail Branch and meets MD 202 (Landover Road) at a full cloverleaf interchange. The highway continues through the city of Glenarden, where the highway intersects Ardwick Ardmore Road and crosses over Interstate 95 and I-495 (Capital Beltway) without access. MD 704 drops to four lanes again between Ardwick Ardmore Road and the five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at US 50 (John Hanson Highway), which is also unsigned I-595. The interchange includes a direct <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> northbound I-95 and I-495 toward Baltimore; the <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> westbound US 50 is used to access southbound I-95 and I-495 toward Richmond. MD 704 continues northeast as a six-lane highway across Bald Hill Branch and veers east before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 450 (Annapolis Road) in Lanham.|$|E
5|$|PA284 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with PA287 {{just north of}} the village of English Center. The road winds northeast through rural Lycoming County alongside nearby Little Pine Creek. PA284 runs through Pine Township, soon reaching the newly named Blackstone Creek (from Little Pine). The two-lane continues through the dense woods in the area, paralleling Blackstone Creek into the village of Buttonwood. In Buttonwood, PA284 enters an interchange with US15, first intersecting with the <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> US15 south. After crossing the freeway, PA284 curves north and ends at the junction with an on-ramp to US15 northbound.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, the {{interchange}} with I-565 opened. The interchange {{includes a}} mix of cloverleaf and fly-over <b>ramps</b> <b>to</b> provide full merge-in and merge-out access to both routes. As part of this construction, the original Clinton and Holmes overpasses were torn down and replaced with wider ones incorporating the necessary merge lanes. The access <b>ramps</b> <b>to</b> and from Holmes Avenue were eliminated {{as part of this}} work.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the mid-1970s}} {{construction}} on the Southern Motorway involved building on-ramps and off-ramps in the Central Motorway Junction. <b>Ramps</b> <b>to</b> {{the western side of}} the CBD at Nelson Street and Hobson Street opened for southbound traffic in 1973 and northbound traffic in 1977. <b>Ramps</b> <b>to</b> Grafton Road, allowing access to the Port of Auckland, opened to southbound traffic in 1975 and northbound traffic in 1978.|$|R
50|$|The Ministry of Transportation has {{awarded a}} $51.7 million {{contract}} for {{the conversion of the}} existing ferry docks from side-loading <b>ramps</b> <b>to</b> end-loading <b>ramps</b> <b>to</b> allow for easier access to and from the Island.

5|$|PA378 heads northward {{across the}} Hill to Hill Bridge, {{at which point}} it crosses back into Lehigh County. The route crosses over West Lehigh Street and intersects with the off-ramp to Main Street in Bethlehem. There was {{formerly}} a <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> 2nd Avenue, but that has been closed and is only used by pedestrians. After this interchange, PA378 becomes a four-lane freeway and is named the Fred B. Rooney Highway. The highway continues northward through the city, crossing under West Broad Street and reaching a southbound interchange with North Street, which leads to Center City and Third Avenue. The freeway continues northward, crossing over and receiving an on-ramp from Union Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|Route163 begins {{north of}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route46 and Roy Ace Road {{in the community}} of Delaware. The highway heads to the north along Lackawanna Road. Route163 passes several residences to the north and a short stretch of homes to the south. There is a short intersection with an unnamed local road. After that intersection, Route163 passes a truck stop that is visible on both Route46, which parallels to the south, and the short state highway. There is another short truck stop before an intersection with a return <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> Route46. Route163 officially terminates at a barricaded dead-end near Hemlock Hill Road.|$|E
5|$|The freeway {{has also}} been {{expanded}} with an extra lane northbound between Perth and Hutton Street, in conjunction with works to increase {{the capacity of the}} Graham Farmer Freeway tunnel. Works progressed in two stages, with Vincent Street as the midpoint. As part of the project, the overpasses at Powis Street, Vincent Street and Scarborough Beach Road have been widened. An additional slip lane has been constructed, from Graham Farmer Freeway's Loftus Street exit <b>ramp</b> <b>to</b> Mitchell Freeway northbound, to access Vincent Street without changing lanes to the left lanes of Mitchell Freeway northbound. The project commenced in February 2013 and was completed in December 2013.|$|E
