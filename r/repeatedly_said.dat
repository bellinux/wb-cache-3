5|$|Having {{declared}} his {{disdain for the}} 1956 reunification elections, Diệm saw the referendum {{as the first step}} in creating a long-term state to rule over South Vietnam. He <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that the creation of a legislature and a constitution for his new state would follow the referendum.|$|E
5|$|Trump {{also claimed}} {{to own the}} {{painting}} Two Sisters (On the Terrace), an 1881 work by French Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The original work hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago. In October 2017, Timothy L. O'Brien said that during his interviews with Trump for the book , he asked Trump about the copy of Two Sisters, which was then located on Trump's plane. Trump <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that his copy was the genuine work, despite O'Brien's statements to the contrary. By then, the Renoir copy was hanging in Trump's penthouse office, and the Art Institute of Chicago released a statement refuting Trump's claim that his Renoir copy was the genuine one.|$|E
25|$|Konrad Adenauer {{has been}} cited {{predicting}} the reunification of Germany {{as early as the}} 1950s, but according to Hans-Peter Schwarz, {{in the last few years}} of Adenauer's life he <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that Soviet power would last a long time.|$|E

She {{is in favor of}} having a diplomatic battle with China under United Nations specifications and international law. She also wants a unified ASEAN to combat China's aggression.|$|E
25|$|After 21 {{months of}} investigation, judge Juan del Olmo {{processed}} Moroccan national Jamal Zougam, among several others, for his participation {{carrying out the}} attack. The September 2007 sentence established no known mastermind nor direct al-Qaeda link, but experts have <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> {{that there is no}} such thing as an intellectual author in Spanish law.|$|E
25|$|Ford flies his de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver (N28S) {{more than}} any of his other {{aircraft}}, and has <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that he likes this aircraft and the sound of its Pratt & Whitney R-985 radial engine. According to Ford, it had been flown in the CIA's Air America operations, and was riddled with bullet holes that had to be patched up.|$|E

25|$|One such {{position}} is Obama's stance on health care. Obama has <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> {{that he wants}} to see that every American has the option of having affordable health care as good as every U. S. Senator has. He has proposed a major overhaul of the nation’s health care system, aimed at covering the nearly 45 million uninsured Americans, reducing premium costs for everyone else, and breaking what he asserted was “the stranglehold” that the biggest drug and insurance companies have on the health care market.|$|E
25|$|Mark David Chapman (born May 10, 1955) is an American {{prison inmate}} who murdered John Lennon outside the Dakota {{apartment}} building in Manhattan in New York City on December 8, 1980. Chapman fired four times at Lennon, hitting him {{three times in the}} back and once in his left shoulder. Chapman later remained at the crime scene and began reading J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye until the police arrived and arrested him. He <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that the novel was his statement.|$|E
25|$|In September, the candidacies of Victor Ponta and Monica Macovei were contested at the Constitutional Court, but the {{complaints}} were {{rejected by the}} court. On the other hand, the National Integrity Agency (ANI) announced in April 2013 that it believed Klaus Iohannis was in a 'state of incompatibility', {{because he has been}} the representative of Sibiu in the General Meeting of Shareholders of SC Apă Canal SA Sibiu (since 5 August 2010) and of SC Piețe SA (since 30 April 2009), which contravenes legal provisions governing conflicts of interest. Iohannis <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that ANI's claims to that effect were mistaken.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, {{the value}} of the Pistons {{franchise}} was estimated to be over $430 million. Regularly seen at the team's home games, Davidson had <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> that he would never sell the Pistons and the franchise would remain in his family after he died.|$|R
25|$|Insider {{sabotage}} regularly occurs, because insiders {{can observe}} and work around security measures. In {{a study of}} insider crimes, the authors <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that successful insider crimes depended on the perpetrators' observation and knowledge of security vulnerabilities. Since the atomic age began, the U.S. Department of Energy's nuclear laboratories have been known for widespread violations of security rules. During the Manhattan Project, physicist Richard Feynman was barred from entering certain nuclear facilities; he would crack safes and violate other rules as pranks to reveal deficiencies in security. A {{better understanding of the}} reality of the threat will help to overcome complacency and is critical to getting countries to take stronger preventive measures.|$|E
25|$|After {{months passed}} without an agreement, a harsh {{war of words}} erupted in the media in February 2007. The Twins angrily {{cancelled}} a planned unveiling of the ballpark design scheduled for February 15, declaring that the entire project was in jeopardy. Jerry Bell of the Twins and Mike Opat of Hennepin County gave multiple interviews in which they described the land owners as being “unwilling sellers,” “greedy,” “lawyered-up,” painted them as “greedy landowners in black hats,” and as not negotiating in good faith. Lambrecht and Pogin continued to insist that they {{had an obligation to}} their investors to secure nothing more than “fair market value” for the land. They <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that they would accept whatever valuation was determined in eminent domain proceedings, while media reports would later reveal their internal valuation (required by eminent domain laws) to be $65 million.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> in {{interviews}} {{that the character}} of Parnassus was meant autobiographically, a tale of an aging man with a vivid imagination {{in a world that}} doesn't listen any more. Still being caught in depression over the disruption of his last self-written project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, his constant struggle with the established studio system, as well as becoming aware of his progressing age, worried that he was going nowhere with his latest projects and that he might not have much time left, Gilliam put a number of references to sudden, tragic, and premature death into his script before the loss of Ledger became a reality. In fact, Gilliam felt compelled to emphasise time and again that upon the film's release many things might be mistaken as references to Ledger's fate but that the script wasn't changed apart from re-casting Tony with Depp, Farrell, and Law.|$|E

25|$|In October 1987, Presser led the Teamsters {{back into}} the AFL-CIO. Presser had <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> he was uninterested in reaffiliation, and AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland had been deeply angered by Presser's attempt to merge with the ITU and to raid AFL-CIO {{affiliated}} unions with members in the publishing industry. But as Presser's legal problems mounted and a federal takeover of the union appeared more and more likely, Presser sought reaffiliation {{as a means of}} shielding the Teamsters from the government. In August and September 1987, leaders of the AFL-CIO and the Teamsters secretly worked out a tentative reaffiliation agreement—exactly 30 years after the Teamsters were first expelled for corruption. Pushing reaffiliation on the AFL-CIO side were Robert Georgine, president of the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, and William H. Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers. Law enforcement officials said the reaffiliation undercut their effort to put the Teamsters under federal control.|$|E
500|$|Jagger has <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that he {{will not}} write an autobiography. [...] However, {{according}} to journalist John Blake, co-author of the book Up and Down with the Rolling Stones, in the early 1980s, after a slew of unauthorised books about him, Jagger was persuaded by Lord Weidenfeld to prepare his own, for a £1 million advance. The resulting 75,000-word manuscript is now held by Blake, who, he says, was briefly on track to publish it, until Jagger withdrew support.|$|E
500|$|In the Summer of 2003, Limp Bizkit participated on the Summer Sanitarium Tour, headlined by Metallica. At the tour's stop in Chicago, {{attendees}} of {{the concert}} threw items and heckled Durst {{from the moment he}} walked on stage. With the crowd chanting [...] "Fuck Fred Durst" [...] and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back. He <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Limp Bizkit are the best band in the world!" [...] until a roadie took his microphone away. An article in the Sun-Times stated that the hostility was started by radio personality Mancow.|$|E

500|$|Zakaria Mohieddin, who was Nasser's vice president, {{said that}} Nasser {{gradually}} changed during his reign. He ceased consulting his colleagues and made {{more and more}} of the decisions himself. Although Nasser <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> [...] that a war with Israel will start at a time of his, or Arab, choosing, in 1967 he started a bluffing game [...] "but a successful bluff means your opponent must not know which cards you are holding. In this case Nasser's opponent could see his hand in the mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces" [...] and Nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet. [...] "All of this was out of character...His tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes... That was the only rational explanation for his actions in 1967".|$|E
500|$|At Castro's command, the {{politically}} moderate lawyer Manuel Urrutia Lleó was proclaimed provisional president but Castro announced (falsely) that Urrutia {{had been selected}} by [...] "popular election". Most of Urrutia's cabinet were MR-26-7 members. Entering Havana, Castro proclaimed himself Representative of the Rebel Armed Forces of the Presidency, setting up home and office in the penthouse of the Havana Hilton Hotel. Castro exercised {{a great deal of}} influence over Urrutia's regime, which was now ruling by decree. He ensured that the government implemented policies to cut corruption and fight illiteracy and that it attempted to remove Batistanos from positions of power by dismissing Congress and barring all those elected in the rigged elections of 1954 and 1958 from future office. He then pushed Urrutia to issue a temporary ban on political parties; he <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that they would eventually hold multiparty elections. Although repeatedly denying that he was a communist to the press, he began clandestinely meeting members of the Popular Socialist Party to discuss the creation of a socialist state.|$|E
500|$|Though Pink Floyd {{turned down}} a {{contract}} worth £136million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting {{it ought to be}} for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen, stating: [...] "The [...] rehearsals convinced me [...] it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica; the resulting article declared: [...] "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." [...] Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: [...] "It's over... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old...it is much more comfortable to work on my own." [...] Gilmour and Waters <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> that they had no plans to reunite with the surviving former members.|$|E

5000|$|Although Vernon Sandusky, {{founding}} member of the band <b>repeatedly</b> has <b>said</b> it is not true, local Washington, DC legend has it that The Chartbusters also released several quickly recorded budget albums for Diplomat Records (a subsidiary of Synthetic Plastics Company) circa 1964 under the name [...] "The Manchesters," [...] including Beatlerama Volume 1 (Diplomat D-2307 mono and DS-2307 stereo) and Beatlerama Volume 2 (Diplomat D-2310 mono and DS-2310 stereo). These albums contained cover versions of several Beatles' songs along with (according to Sandusky) unauthorized versions of The Chartbusters' original songs/demos, including some which appeared in alternate versions on their Mutual Records singles.|$|R
