50|$|Each of {{the four}} {{turbines}} is an English Electric Company multi-cylinder impulse reaction machine operating on a single re-heat cycle with terminal steam connections of 158.6 bar (2,300 lbf/in2), 566 degrees Celsius (1051 degrees Fahrenheit) and exhausting at a back pressure of 1.5 in Hg. Steam from the boiler passes through four strainers and two pairs of combines stop and emergency valves, each pair being associated with two throttle valves which regulate admission of steam to the H.P. cylinder inlet belt. The H.P. cylinder comprises eight stages in total. The steam expands through the first five stages towards the governor end and then re-versus its direction and flows between {{the inner and outer}} case to the last three stages. Reversing the steam flow within the H.P. cylinder helps to balance the thrust thus relieving the load on the single thrust bearing. From the H.P. cylinder the steam is fed to the boiler re-heater and returned to the I.P. cylinder through two strainers and two pairs of I.P. emergency valves, each pair of which is associated with a pair of interceptor valves which are attached to the cylinder. The I.P. section of the turbine is double flow with seven stages to each flow. The exhaust steam from the I.P. cylinder is passed to the three L.P. cylinders by cross-over pipes <b>reducing</b> <b>cross</b> sections, which distribute the flow of steam equally to each L.P. cylinder through which it expands to the condenser. Each cylinder is double flow with five stages to each flow. A special feature of the Cottam machines is the radial condenser in which the tube nests are disposed right round the turbine L.P. shafts in a common casing. This reduces the steam velocity in the exhaust space, which together with the reduced losses in the exhaust duct improves the efficiency of the condenser. The weight of the whole structure is some hundreds of tons less than earlier structures, and the foundation block is also greatly simplified, since only a rudimentary structure above basement floor level is necessary under the L.P. turbine.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{theory of}} {{operation}} of a wideband interferometric Doppler spectroscopy technique, called externally dispersed interferometry (EDI), is presented. The first EDI prototype was tested on sunlight and detected the 12 m s 1 amplitude lunar signature in Earth’s motion. The hybrid instrument is an undispersed Michelson interferometer having a fixed delay of about 1 cm, in series with an external spectrograph of about 20, 000 resolution. The Michelson provides the Doppler shift discrimination, while the external spectrograph boosts net white-light fringe visibility by <b>reducing</b> <b>cross</b> talk from adjacent continuum channels. A moire ́ effect between the sinusoidal interferometer transmission and the input spectrum heterodynes high spectral details to broad moiré patterns, which carry the Doppler information in its phase. These broad patterns survive the blurring of the spectrograph, which can have several times lower resolution than grating-only spectrographs typically used now for the Doppler planet search. This enables the net instrument to be dramatically smaller in size (∼ 1 m) and cost. The EDI behavior is compared and contrasted to the conventional grating-only technique. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractG-protein-coupled enzyme cascades {{are used}} by {{eukaryotic}} cells to detect external signals and transduce them into intracellular messages that contain biological information relevant to the cell's function. Since G-protein-coupled receptors {{that are designed to}} detect different kinds of external signals can generate the same kind of intracellular response, effective signaling requires that there are mechanisms to increase signal specificity and fidelity. Here we examine the kinetic equations for the initial three stages in a generic G-protein-coupled cascade and show that the physical properties of the transduction pathway result in two intrinsic features that benefit signaling. 1), The response to a single activated receptor is naturally confined to a localized spatial domain, which could improve signal specificity by <b>reducing</b> <b>cross</b> talk. 2), The peak of the response generated by such a signaling domain is limited. This saturation effect reduces trial-to-trial variability and increases signaling fidelity by limiting the response to receptors that remain active for longer than average.

On the other hand, in non-vacuum autoclaves, steam penetration into turbine chamber is doubtful, while they are still in use in dental clinics.

The turbin chamber cap was opened in aseptic enviroment and a strip contaminated with bacillus stearothermophilus endospores was placed into chamber and chamber cap was closed. Twelve dental turbines were loaded in each of four autoclaves (2 large pre-vacuum autoclaves, 2 bench top non-vacuum autoclaves) and sterilization process preformed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

40|$|Stability-related issues, usually {{controlling}} {{design of}} steel structures, {{are getting more}} and more important even for concrete ones as more and more resistant materials are nowadays available and allowed by codes of standard for structural concrete. Indeed, increasing concrete strength results in <b>reducing</b> <b>cross</b> sections and, consequently, increasing member slenderness directly affecting second-order effect sensitivity of structures. Structural codes currently provide designers with several proposals for slenderness limits of concrete members. Those limits are usually derived on the basic assumption that second order effects are not greater than 10 % of the first order ones. Consequently, simple theoretical considerations based on the theory of elastic stability lead to define relevant slenderness limits of concrete members. Despite that theoretical simplicity, the behaviour of concrete structures is affected by non-linear phenomena such as concrete cracking and steel yielding which cannot by easily handled within the elastic theory. The present paper, starting from simple theoretical considerations aimed to recognize the basic parameters needed for defining consistent slenderness thresholds, deals with assessing various proposals derived by the scientific literature. In particular, focus is placed on two formulations recently adopted by both the European and the Italian codes for limiting slenderness of concrete members. Numerical analyses point out that those formulations are often unconservative...|$|E
40|$|Background: On {{the basis}} of an {{institutional}} audit, the authors published an individual patient-based protocol for preoperative arrangement of blood products in patients undergoing elective spine arthrodesis. The present study was conducted for the prospective validation of the proposed protocol in <b>reducing</b> <b>cross</b> match to transfusion ratio, and its implications on overall cost. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted over 1 year (2012). All adult patients who underwent elective spinal arthrodesis were included and prospectively observed. The actual transfusion index was calculated for individual patients with the formula C 1 /T, where C 1 is the number of units of packed RBCs cross matched and T is the number of actual transfusions. C 1 /T was then compared with a theoretical transfusion index C 2 /T for the same group of patients, C 2 being the number derived from calculating the number of units of packed RBCs that would have been ordered for individual patient according to the protocol. The cost difference between C 1 /T and C 2 /T was analyzed. Results: A total of 125 patients were included. A total of 435 units of packed RBCs were ordered (C 1), out of which only 108 units were transfused (T), yielding a C 1 /T of 4. 02. The C 2 for the same group of patients was 188 units of packed RBCs and the C 2 /T was thus calculated to be 1. 74.
