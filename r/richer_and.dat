5|$|Malabi is {{a creamy}} pudding {{originating}} from Turkey prepared with milk or almond milk (for a kosher version) and cornstarch. It is {{sold as a}} street food from carts or stalls, in disposable cups with thick sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving <b>richer</b> <b>and</b> more sophisticated versions using various toppings and garnishes such as berries and fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.|$|E

5|$|Canada is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, {{these may be}} grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, {{the federal government can}} initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the <b>richer</b> <b>and</b> poorer provinces.|$|E

5|$|In Toraja society, {{the funeral}} ritual {{is the most}} {{elaborate}} and expensive event. The <b>richer</b> <b>and</b> more powerful the individual, the more expensive is the funeral. In the aluk religion, only nobles {{have the right to}} have an extensive death feast. The death feast of a nobleman is usually attended by thousands and lasts for several days. A ceremonial site, called rante, is usually prepared in a large, grassy field where shelters for audiences, rice barns, and other ceremonial funeral structures are specially made by the deceased family. Flute music, funeral chants, songs and poems, and crying and wailing are traditional Toraja expressions of grief with the exceptions of funerals for young children, and poor, low-status adults.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university. However, the {{gap between rich and}} poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between <b>richer</b> <b>and</b> poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both <b>richer</b> <b>and</b> more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so {{it is not necessary to}} presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E

5|$|The Normans {{brought with}} them {{architectural}} styles from their own duchy, where austere stone churches were preferred. Under the early Norman kings this style was adapted to produce large, plain cathedrals with ribbed vaulting. During the 12th century the Anglo-Norman style became <b>richer</b> <b>and</b> more ornate, with pointed arches derived from French architecture replacing the curved Romanesque designs; this style is termed Early English Gothic and continued, with variation, {{throughout the rest of}} the Middle Ages. In the early 14th century the Perpendicular Gothic style was created in England, with an emphasis on verticality, immense windows and soaring arcades. Fine timber roofs in a variety of styles, but in particular the hammerbeam, were built in many English buildings. In the 15th century the architectural focus turned away from cathedrals and monasteries in favour of parish churches, often decorated with richly carved woodwork; in turn, these churches influenced the design of new chantry chapels for existing cathedrals.|$|E
5|$|The craft guilds {{required}} {{relatively stable}} markets and a relative equality {{of income and}} opportunity amongst their members to function effectively. By the 14th century these conditions were increasingly uncommon. The first strains were seen in London, where the old guild system began to collapse – more trade was being conducted at a national level, making it hard for craftsmen to both manufacture goods and trade in them, and there were growing disparities in incomes between the <b>richer</b> <b>and</b> poorer craftsmen. As a result, under EdwardIII many guilds became companies or livery companies, chartered companies focusing on trade and finance, leaving the guild structures to represent {{the interests of the}} smaller, poorer manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces to {{flourish}} {{in an economic}} revival that had begun {{in the time of}} his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, {{it has been argued that}} Byzantium in the 12th century was <b>richer</b> <b>and</b> more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasion during the reign of Herakleios, some five hundred years earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread. Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the kommerkion, a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports. The kommerkion was stated to have collected 20,000 hyperpyra each day.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} China's upcoming value-added tax (VAT) reform of removing investment from the tax base on capital accumulation and {{the welfare of the}} <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> the poor. Three alternative methods {{to make up for the}} loss of tax revenue are considered. The VAT reform with consumption tax being endogenous increases capital accumulation and the utility of both the <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> the poor. The VAT reform with the labor income tax rate being endogenous increases capital accumulation; and it decreases the utility of the <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> increases the utility of the poor (increases the utility of both the <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> the poor) if the rich has a higher rate or the same rate of time preference (if the rich has a lower rate of time preference). The VAT reform, accompanied by a cut in transfers to the poor, has no effect on capital accumulation if the <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> the poor have the same rate of time preference; it decreases (increases) capital accumulation if the rich has a higher (lower) rate of time preference; and it increases the utility of the <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> decreases the utility of the poor. ...|$|R

25|$|Many IWW members opposed United States {{participation}} in World War I. The organization {{passed a resolution}} against the war at its convention in November 1916.

25|$|Historians in {{the early}} 20th century, such as J. Franklin Jameson, {{examined}} the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence of a class war inside the revolution.

The word comes from an animated TV series called “Tall, <b>Rich</b> <b>and</b> Handsome” in which the name of the protagonist was “Tall, <b>Rich</b> <b>and</b> Handsome”. This slang has become widely used on the internet, symbolizing the perfect man that many women in China dream of marrying.|$|R
