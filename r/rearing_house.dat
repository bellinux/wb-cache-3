50|$|The {{birds are}} {{then moved to}} broiler breeder laying houses or {{production}} barns. The birds are typically placed into crates, and transported by truck to a separate facility. Males and females are raised together at this point. Outwardly the laying house will resemble the <b>rearing</b> <b>house.</b> Inside, about one-half of the floor might consist of raised 'slats.' During the production run, manure will drop through the slats and accumulate in the pit underneath the slats. The birds are not generally caged, especially since the roosters must mate with the hens to fertilize the eggs. Nests are provided for laying hens. Both automatic and manual (example) nesting systems exist. Manual nests are usually stuffed with straw or shavings and eggs are hand-collected. Automatic systems usually have a plastic carpet lining, with a belt for egg collection. Careful layout and attention to bird behavior is required to avoid 'floor eggs'.|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the growth of cold-blooded stallions in pig breeding test rearing houses. The Czech Republic has set up three pig breeding test rearing houses. A total of 96 stallions were measured with 14 body measurements and they were also weighed whilst alive. Statistically significant differences were detected between breeds as well as between age groups when evaluating the intensity of growth of all measured body size and body weight. In most body sizes there were the biggest Silesian Norics horses (SN). At the age of {{two and a half years}} they stagnated growth in chest circumference, the circumference of the tibia and sternum height, even though it is stated in the Rules and Regulation of breeding book that SN mature between 5 - 6 years of age. During the evaluation there were no statistically significant differences between rearing houses. Stallions from the <b>rearing</b> <b>house</b> of Proseč prevailed in growth usually at the beginning of rearing, and later stallions from the <b>rearing</b> <b>house</b> of Dvorka at the age of one and a half year grew most. Stallions in the <b>rearing</b> <b>house</b> of Humňany had the lowest WHS, WHT and CC. The smallest variances of individual body size from the three studied cold-blooded breeds were detected by the CzechMoravian Belgian horse (CMB). This breed can therefore be regarded as the most well bred. The greatest value of the index body frame, the index heights in the crisis as well as index of severity were found in the breed SN. On the other hand CMB reached the lowest values in the above-mentioned indices and also in the index of boniness. Norick horses (N) have the most massive skeleton. In the scope of the height index of the sternum there was prevailed CMB at the beginning of rearing, but at the age of year and a half they began reaching a higher value N.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} {{treatment}} with a newly developed characterized continuous-flow (CCF) culture composed of 29 strains of cecal bacteria on salmonellae colonization was evaluated in commercially reared broiler chick-ens. Newly hatched chicks in three flocks were sprayed with CCF culture {{as they were}} placed in rearing houses and compared with untreated flocks on the same farm. Hatchery transport tray liners and <b>rearing</b> <b>house</b> feed, water, and litter samples were cultured {{for the presence of}} salmonellae. Cecal samples were cultured after 3 - and 6 -wk growout. Skin-feather samples were cultured at 6 -wk growout. Fifty-five percent of the transport tray liners were contaminated with salmonellae on the day of chick placement. At 3 wk, salmonellae serotypes present on the tray liners were widely distributed in the litter of the rearing houses. The results indicated that exposure to salmonellae occurred before culture treatment and continued in the rearing houses during the 6 -wk growout period. Salmonellae cecal colonization was decreased (P <. 05) in two of the treated flocks at 3 wk and diminished (P <. 07) in the third treated flock compared with control flocks. At 6 wk, skin-feather contamination and cecal colonization were decreased (P <. 05) in one of the treated flocks whereas no treatment effect occurred in two of the treated flocks compared with controls. The results clearly indicate the necessity of implementing integrated programs to control salmonellae in both the hatchery and <b>rearing</b> <b>house</b> environments. The CCF culture served to enhance salmonellae colonization resistance and may serve as a useful component of an integrated control program.

The administration of antibiotics did not significantly reduce Campylobacter shedding. With the exception of one flock during rearing and a few flocks in the slaughterhouse with a mixed Campylobacter coli-Campylobacter jejuni infection, C. jejuni exclusively was found both during rearing and on the carcasses. A significant correlation exits between the contamination of the broilers during rearing and the carcasses after processing.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Lipids remain one of {{the most}} {{important}} nutrients required by broilers. The growing awareness that some Western societies have too high a dietary ratio of n- 6 /n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is of direct relevance to broiler nutrition and lipid metabolism. Meaningful quantities of n- 3 polyunsaturates have been incorporated into major poultry tissues, so that the production of broiler meat with high n- 3 polyunsaturates becomes advantageous for the broiler industry as they are perceived as having a 'healthier' lipid profile. Unfortunately, such broiler meat is rather susceptible to oxidative deterioration, and oxidation often determines shelf life of poultry meat products. The addition of a-tocopherol (vitamin E) to broiler diets is an effective means of improving the oxidative stability of broiler meat. Elevated a-tocopherol levels in broiler feeds increase tissue concentrations thereof resulting in improved stability of membranal structures which may be expected to increase the oxidative stability of broiler meat and meat products. Three investigations were done at Mariendahl Poultry Research Station in Stellenbosch. The broilers were kept in 1 x 0. 4 x 0. 5 m cages in a broiler <b>rearing</b> <b>house.</b> All the trials started with day-old chicks, except experiment 1 where 3 -week old broilers were used. At the end of trials 2 and 3 the 6 -week old broilers were slaughtered and the carcasses prepared for chemical analysis. Experiment 1 : Metabolisabie energy of Canola acid oil and Famarol acid oil for broiler chickens. In trials with 21 -day-old male broilers the true metabolisabie energy value, corrected for nitrogen retention (TMEn) was determined by the balance method for Canala acid oil (CAO) and Famarol acid oil (FAO). The trials were duplicated, each time using different samples of the two oils from the same source (experiment 1 and 2). Each of the two oils were blended in two ratios with a basal diet to form the test diets, viz. 100 % Basal; 96 % Basal: 4 % Oil; 92 % Basal: 8 % Oil. In experiment 3, 50 % bran was added to the maize to form the basal diet. The balance trials lasted for 3 days after an adaptation period of 4 days. The TMEn values determined by regression for the broilers of CAO did not differ significantly (P> 0. 05) between experiments 1 and 2. However, the value for experiment 3 was significantly (P 0. 05) between experiments 1 and 2, although the value for experiment 3 was significantly higher than that of experiment 1. The addition of 50 % bran to the basal diet in experiment 3 could have stimulated the digestive breakdown process and hence increase the secretion of digestive enzymes. This could lead to an increase in the utilisation of the test lipid and therefore an increase in the TMEn value. The TMEn values of CAO differed significantly (P 0. 05) in average daily gain (1. 71 ± 0. 059 g) or feed conversion ratios (1. 97 ± 0. 051) among dietary groups. No statistical differences (P> 0. 05) were found in the chemical proximate composition of the carcasses for the moisture (66. 20 ± 0. 112 %), protein (17. 63 ± 0. 484 %), lipid (15. 92 ± 1. 507 %) and ash (0. 95 ± 0. 115 %) content among dietary groups. No statistical differences (P> 0. 05) were found in the chemical proximate composition of the abdominal fat pads for the moisture (28. 77 ± 0. 112 %), protein (3. 03 ± 0. 484 %), lipid (63. 32 ± 9. 789 %) and ash (0. 45 ± 0. 135 %) content among dietary groups. With the increase in dietary CAO levels, the percentages of C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 20 : 4 n- 6 in the carcasses decreased respectively with 1. 78 % from 20. 88 % and 0. 35 % from 1. 05 %, whilst C 18 : 3 n- 3 and longer chain n- 3 fatty acids such as C 20 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 increased respectively with 2. 25 % from 1 %, 0. 1 % from 0. 1 % and 0. 67 % from 0. 2 %. The same tendency was seen in the abdominal fat pads where C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 20 : 4 n- 6 decreased respectively with 1. 55 % from 20. 75 % and 0. 98 % from 1. 2 % with an increase in dietary CAO, whilst C 18 : 3 n- 3, C 20 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 increased respectively with 2. 13 % from 1. 15 %, 0. 45 % from 0. 03 % and 0. 95 % from 0. 05 %. The n- 3 /n- 6 ratio in the carcasses and abdominal fat pads increased respectively with 0. 16 % from 0. 06 % and 0. 19 % from 0. 06 % with an increase in dietary CAO. These results clearly indicate that dietary CAO enriched with a-linolenic acid lower saturated fatty acids respectively in broiler carcasses and abdominal fat pads with 4. 88 % from 31. 6 % and 10. 63 % from 31. 1 %, whilst increasing monounsaturated fatty acids with 3. 87 % from 44. 95 % and 7. 25 % from 46. 7 % respectively and polyunsaturated fatty acids with 1. 02 % from 23. 45 % and 2. 38 % from 23. 2 % respectively. Experiment 3 : Effect of dietary vitamin E on the performance of broilers and oxidative stability, colour, microbiological stability, fatty acid composition and pH of broiler meat during refrigerated and frozen storage. Experiment 1 was carried out with 220 one-day-old broiler chicks to evaluate the effect of eleven concentrations of vitamin E (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 and 200 mg a-tocopheryl acetate 1 kg diet) on their production performance and the oxidative stability of their frozen broiler carcasses. The diets with vitamin E levels 0 to 100 mg were fed from day-old to 42 days of age while the diets with vitamin E levels 120 to 200 mg were fed from 21 to 42 days of age. The oxidative stability, evaluated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values, was determined after 30, 90, 120 and 150 days of storage at - 20 °C. There were no statistical differences (P> 0. 05) in average daily gain (1. 85 ± 0. 111 g) or feed conversion ratios (2. 29 ± 0. 397) among dietary groups. TBARS values increased significantly (P 0. 05) in average daily gain (1. 88 ± 0. 117 g) or feed conversion ratios (2. 37 ± 0. 467) among dietary groups. TBARS values increased significantly (P 0. 05) in colour measurements for L* (44. 97 ± 0. 662), a* (5. 23 ± 0. 315) or b* (12. 76 ± 0. 321) values between treatments. Microbiological counts increased significantly (P 0. 05) for any of the fatty acid groups measured (SFA: Day 0 = 26. 1 ± 1. 13 %, Day 12 = 26. 1 ± 1. 17 %; MUFA: Day 0 = 41. 4 ± 1. 46 %, Day 12 = 40. 2 ± 2. 28 %; PUFA: Day 0 = 32. 4 ± 1. 95 %, Day 12 = 33. 8 ± 2. 52 %) among dietary groups. Similarly, n{{one of the}} fatty acids showed statistical significant (P> 0. 05) concentration changes over time. There were no statistical differences (P> 0. 05) in pH (6. 01 ± 0. 206) among dietary groups. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Lipiede is steeds een van die mees belangrike voedingstowwe wat deur braakuikens benodig word. Die groeiende bewuswording dat sekere Westerse gemeenskappe 'n te hoë verhouding van n- 6 /n- 3 poli-onversadigde vetsure in hul dieet het, is direk relevant vir braaikuikenvoeding en lipiedmetabolisme. Betekenisvolle hoeveelhede n- 3 polionversadigde vetsure is geïnkorporeer in die belangrikste hoendersnitte, met die gevolg dat die produksie van braaikuikenvleis met hoë n- 3 poli-onversadigde vetsure voordelig is vir die braaikuikenindustrie en geag word 'n meer "gesonde" beeld te hê. Ongelukkig is sodanige braaikuikenvleis redelik vatbaar vir oksidatiewe bederf, en oksidasie bepaal dikwels die rakleeftyd van hoendervleisprodukte. Die byvoeging van a-tokoferol (vitamine E) by braaikuikendiëte is 'n effektiewe manier om die oksidatiewe stabiliteit van braaikuikenvleis te verbeter. Verhoogde a-tokoferol vlakke in braakuikenvoere verhoog die weefselkonsentrasie wat verhoogde stabiliteit van die membraanstrukture en derhalwe moontlike verhoogde oksidatiewe stabiliteit van braakuikenvleis en -produkte tot gevolg het. Drie ondersoeke is onderneem by Mariendahl Pluimvee Navorsingstasie te Stellenbosch. Die braakuikens is aangehou in 1 x 0. 4 x 0. 5 m hokke in braaikuikenhuise. In al die proewe is dagoud kuikens gebruik, behalwe eksperiment 1 waar drieweek oue kuikens gebruik is. Aan die einde van proewe 2 en 3 is die ses-week oue braaikuikens geslag en die karkasse voorberei vir analise. Eksperiment 1 : braaikuikens. Die ware metaboliseerbare energie waarde van Canola voergraadolie (CAO) en Famarol voergraadolie (FAO), Metaboliseerbare energie van Canola voergraadolie en Famarol voergraadolie vir gekorregeer vir stikstof retensie (WMEn), is by wyse van proewe op 21 dae oue braaikuikenhaantjies bepaal deur van die balansrnetode gebruik te maak. Die proewe is tweemaal herhaal vir verhoogde akkuraatheid, met die gebruik van verskillende monsters van die twee olies vanaf dieselfde bron. Die olies is in twee verhoudings met 'n basale diëet gemeng om die proef dieet te vorm, nl. 100 % Basaal; 96 % Basaal: 4 % Olie en 92 % Basaal: 8 % Olie. Die balans proewe het 3 dae geduur na afloop van 'n aanpassingsperiode van 4 dae. Die WMEn waardes van CAO, bepaal deur middel van regressie analise, het nie betekenisvol verskil (P> 0. 05) tussen eksperimente 1 en 2 nie. Die waarde van eksperiment 3 was betekenisvol hoër (P 0. 05) tussen eksperimente 1 en 2 nie, maar die waarde vir eksperiment 3 was betekenisvol hoër as dié van eksperiment 1. Die WMEn waardes van COA het betekenisvol verskil (P 0. 05) in die gemiddelde daaglikse toename (1. 71 ± 0. 059 g) of die voeromsetverhoudings (1. 97 ± 0. 051) nie. Geen statistiese verskil (P> 0. 05) is gevind in die chemiese samestelling van die karkasse vir vog (66. 20 ± 0. 112 %), proteïn (17. 63 ± 0. 484 %), lipied (15. 92 ± 1. 507 %) en as (0. 95 ± 0. 115 %) inhoud tussen die rantsoen groepe nie. Geen statistiese verskille (P> 0. 05) is gevind in die chemiese samestelling van die abdominale vetneerlegging vir vog (28. 77 ± 0. 112 %), proteien (3. 03 ± 0. 484 %), lipied (63. 32 ± 9. 789 %) en as (0. 45 ± 0. 135 %) inhoud onder die rantsoengroepe nie. Met die verhoging in die rantsoen CAO vlakke het die persentasie van C 18 : 2 n- 6 en C 20 : 4 n- 6 in die karkasse verminder met 1. 78 % en 0. 35 % respektiewelik, terwyl C 18 : 3 n- 3 en langer ketting n- 3 vetsure soos C 20 : 5 n- 3 en C 22 : 6 n- 3 respektiewelik met 2. 25 %, 0. 1 % en 0. 67 % verhoog het. Dieselfde tendens is opgemerk in die abdominale vetneerlegging waar C 18 : 2 n- 6 en C 20 : 4 n- 6 afgeneem het met 1. 55 % en 0. 98 % respektiewelik met die verhoging van rantsoen CAO, terwyl C 18 : 3 n- 3, C 20 : 5 n- 3 en C 22 : 6 n- 3 verhoog het met 2. 13 %, 0. 45 % en 0. 95 % respektiewelik. Die n- 3 /n- 6 verhouding in die karkasse en abdominale vetneerlegging het verhoog met 0. 16 % en 0. 19 % respektiewelik met die verhoging van die rantsoen CAO. Die resultate toon onomwonde aan dat rantsoen CAO verryk met c-Iinoletensuur, verlaag versadigde vetsure in braaikuikenkarkasse en -adbdominale vetneerleggings met 4. 88 % en 10. 63 % respektiewelik, terwyl die mono-onversadigde vetsure met 3. 87 % en 7. 25 % respektiewelik verhoog word en polionversadigde vetsure met 1. 02 % en 2. 38 % respektiewelik verhoog word. Eksperiment 3 : Die invloed van vitamine E op die produksie van braaikuikens en die oksidatiewe stabiliteit, kleur, mikrobiologiese stabilitiet, vetsuursamestelling en pH van braaikuikenvleis gedurende verkoelde en bevrore berging. Eksperiment 1 is uitgevoer met 220 dagoud braaikuikens ten einde die effek van elf konsentrasies van vitamine E (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 en 200 mg a-tokoferyl acetaat / kg voer) op hul produksieprestasie en die oksidatiewe stabiliteit van hul gevriesde braakuikenkarkasse te evalueer. Die diëte met vitamine E vlakke 0 tot 100 mg is vanaf dagoud tot 42 -dae-ouderdom gevoer, terwyl die diëte met vitamine E vlakke van 120 tot 200 mg gevoer is vanaf 21 tot 42 - dae-ouderdom. Die oksidatiewe stabiliteit, soos geëvalueer deur tiobarbituriese suur reaktiewe stowwe (TBARS) waardes, is bepaal na 30, 90, 120 en 150 dae van berging teen - 20 °C. Daar was geen statistiese verskille (P> 0. 05) in die gemiddelde daaglikse toename (1. 85 ± 0. 111 g) of voeromsetverhoudings (2. 29 ± 0. 397) tussen die rantsoengroepe nie. TBARS waardes het betekenisvol toegeneem (P 0. 05) in die gemiddelde daaglikse toename (1. 88 ± 0. 117 g) of voeromsetverhoudings (2. 37 ± 0. 467) tussen die rantsoengroepe nie.

40|$|Previous {{investigators}} of EPID dosimetric properties have ascribed the backscatter, that contaminates dosimetric EPID images, to its supporting arm. Accordingly, Monte-Carlo (MC) EPID {{models have}} approximated the backscatter {{signal from the}} layers under the detector and the robotic support arm using either uniform or non-uniform solid water slabs, or through convolutions with back-scatter kernels. The aim of this work {{is to improve the}} existent MC models by measuring and modelling the separate backscatter contributions of the robotic arm and the <b>rear</b> plastic <b>housing</b> of the EPID. The EPID plastic housing is non-uniform with a 11. 9 cm wide indented section that runs across the cross-plane direction in the superior half of the EPID which is 1. 75 cm closer to the EPID sensitive layer {{than the rest of the}} housing. The thickness of the plastic housing is 0. 5 cm. Experiments were performed with and without the housing present by removing all components of the EPID from the housing. The robotic support arm was not present for these measurements. A MC model of the linear accelerator and the EPID was modified to include the rear-housing indentation and results compared to the measurement. The <b>rear</b> <b>housing</b> was found to contribute a maximum of 3 % additional signal. The <b>rear</b> <b>housing</b> contribution to the image is non-uniform in the in-plane direction with 2 % asymmetry across the central 20 cm of an image irradiating the entire detector. The MC model was able to reproduce this non-uniform contribution. The EPID <b>rear</b> <b>housing</b> contributes a non-uniform backscatter component to the EPID image, which has not been previously characterized. This has been incorporated into an improved MC model of the EPID...|$|R

50|$|Aberthau House (previously {{known as}} <b>Rear</b> <b>House)</b> is a spacious {{heritage}} mansion in Tudor Revival style, {{located at the}} intersection of West 2nd Avenue and Trimble Street in Vancouver, British Columbia, which currently serves as a facility of the neighbourhood’s community centre. Situated on the highlands of the Point Grey neighbourhood, it overlooks English Bay, the Gulf of Georgia, and the City of Vancouver.|$|R
50|$|The building's core is {{one room}} deep, with the {{northeast}} wing {{consisting of a}} central entry hall, a bedroom on the north, a living room on the south, store rooms {{at the southern end}} and brick lean-to store rooms at the rear. The rear wing has one large bedroom, an enclosed verandah on the south housing a kitchen and a brick lean-to at the <b>rear</b> <b>housing</b> a bathroom.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} contained 16 apartments plus four artists' studios. Each apartment {{had its own}} toilet. The parlor (public room) was in {{the front}} because it had the most light and occupants could look out onto the street. Behind that were bedrooms, then the dining room in the middle. The <b>rear</b> <b>housed</b> the kitchen and bathroom. Two staircases gave access to the floors, one for the occupants and a service stairwell for deliveries and servants.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the front}} of the {{building}} originally housed the fire fighting apparatus while the <b>rear</b> <b>housed</b> the horses. Personnel stayed on the second floor and could access the first floor via a brass sliding pole. A steep staircase, intended to keep horses from following firemen up to their quarters, also led to the second floor. Hay was stored on the third floor loft. The captain had a room of his own with a desk.|$|R
