40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : Respirators (<b>respiratory</b> <b>protective</b> <b>equipments)</b> are widely used, {{but many of}} their health impacts, {{especially}} cardiovascular effects, have not been determined. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the impact of using respirators on heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Materials and methods : This interventional study was undertaken on 40 healthy 20 - 30 years old young men. Their heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and at the end of 5 minutes 7 kcal/min exertion with ergometer were measured. After 15 minutes rest, this process was repeated, while the person was breathing via respirators. The data were analyzed using SPSS, descriptive statistics and paired t-test. Results : Using respirator during heavy work increased the mean value of heart rate to 8. 5 beat/min, systolic and diastolic blood pressure 7. 4 and 4. 9 mmHg respectively. Conclusion : This study showed that respirator imposes additional load on cardiovascular system. Although these increases may seem inconsiderable, these mild increases of heart rate and blood pressure can be threatening in workers with hypertension, coronary artery disease and many other cardiovascular disorders...|$|R

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of educational intervention based on BASNEF pattern on increasing the use of personal <b>protective</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>equipment</b> among carbon black factory workers, where many air pollutants such as carbon block exists. Methods: In this study the intervention curriculum based on BASNEF pattern administrated on 100 (experimental and control) Ahvaz carbon block factory workers. Data were collected by questionnaires.

Materials and Methods: This study was performed on eleven healthy university students (male) under controlled thermal conditions in a climatic chamber. The mean (SD) of age, height and body mass index (BMI) were 24. 1 (2. 34) years, 172 (4. 2) cm and 22. 4 (1. 1) Kg/m 2, respectively. Subjects were participated in the four intermittent exercises experiments (without RPE, valve, half-face and full-face) on a treadmill in light, moderate and heavy workload. Duration of light, moderate and heavy activities was 30, 30 and 20 min, respectively. Heart rate was recorded every 5 min. Results: The mean of heart rate in 11 subjects for without RPE trial in light, moderate and high workload was 93. 5 ± 13. 1, 109. 7 ± 18. 1 and 119. 6 ± 25. 8 beats per min (bpm), for valve RPE was 102. 8 ± 9. 7, 116. 7 ± 16. 0 and 132. 1 ± 23. 2 bpm, for half-face RPE was 102. 4 ± 11. 42, 117. 3 ± 15. 8 and 132. 0 ± 23. 1 bpm and for full-face RPE was 109. 3 ± 14. 7, 125 ± 17. 4 and 140. 1 ± 23. 1 bpm, respectively. In three work load, {{significant differences between the}} mean of heart rate by using three kinds of RPE trials showed with without RPE trial were observed (P-value < 0. 001). Also, mean of heart rate in three workload levels when using full-face RPE trial was significantly higher than valve and half-face RPE trials.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{quantified}} the dispersion of potentially infectious bioaerosols produced by {{patients in the}} health care environment and the exposure of health care workers to these particles. Controlled studies are needed to assess the spread of bioaerosols and the efficacy of different types of <b>respiratory</b> personal <b>protective</b> <b>equipment</b> (PPE) in preventing airborne disease transmission. An environmental chamber was equipped to simulate a patient coughing aerosol particles into a medical examination room, and a health care worker breathing while exposed to these particles. The system has three main parts: (1) a coughing simulator that expels an aerosol-laden cough through a head form; (2) a breathing simulator with a second head form that can be fitted with respiratory PPE; and (3) aerosol particle counters to measure concentrations inside and outside the PPE and at locations throughout the room. Dispersion of aerosol particles with optical diameters from 0. 3 to 7. 520 was evaluated along with the influence of breathing rate, room ventilation, and the locations of the coughing and breathing simulators. Penetration of cough aerosol particles through nine models of surgical masks and respirators placed on the breathing simulator was measured at 32 and 85 L/min flow rates and compared with the results from a standard filter tester. Results show that cough-generated aerosol particles spread rapidly throughout the room, and that within 520 min, a worker anywhere in the room would be exposed to potentially hazardous aerosols. Aerosol exposure is highest with no personal <b>protective</b> <b>equipment,</b> followed by surgical masks, and the least exposure is seen with N 95 FFRs. These differences are seen regardless of breathing rate and relative position of the coughing and breathing simulators. These results provide {{a better understanding of the}} exposure of workers to cough aerosols from patients and of the relative efficacy of different types of respiratory PPE, and they will assist investigators in providing research-based recommendations for effective respiratory protection strategies in health care settings.
