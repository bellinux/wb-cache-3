40|$|Is {{there an}} {{association}} {{between the number of}} CGG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FMR 1 gene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal and intermediate range and age at natural menopause? The number of CGG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal and intermediate range <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FMR 1 gene was not associated with age at natural menopause. Excessive triple CGG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FMR 1 gene have been widely associated with primary ovarian insufficiency. Recently, the number of CGG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal and intermediate range (up to 55 repeats) was found to be associated with serum levels of anti-Mllerian hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, as markers for ovarian ageing. This suggests that <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal and intermediate range could be involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rate of exhaustion of the ovarian primordial follicle pool and ultimately the timing of menopause. Cross-sectional study in a population-based sample of 3611 Caucasian women with natural menopause. The FMR 1 CGG repeat number was determined by PCR amplification in 3611 women with a known age at natural menopause. A possible relation between CGG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal and intermediate range (up to 55 repeats) and menopausal age were analysed in various ways, including linear regression analysis and analysis of variance. The number of CGG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal and intermediate range <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FMR 1 gene was not associated with age at natural menopause. The mean age at menopause was 50. 30 (4. 2) years for women with 45 repeats and 50. 64 (3. 4) years for women with intermediate-sized repeats (P 0. 37). Linear regression analysis of the number of CGG repeats showed no association with menopausal age (0. 019, P 0. 16). In our cohort, age at menopause was self-reported and determined retrospectively. Earlier observations suggesting that the number of CGG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal and intermediate range is associated with the individual variation of the ovarian ageing process could not be confirmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current, large sample size study. A relation between the number of CGG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal and intermediate range and age at natural menopause appeared to be absent. This finding questions the role of CGG <b>repeat</b> sizes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ovarian ageing process. N. C. O. -M., Y. T. S. and H. K. P. A. have nothing to declare. M.

40|$|PURPOSE: Increased {{length of}} <b>the</b> CAG <b>repeat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{androgen}} receptor gene {{may be related}} to male subfertility. Expansion to 38 - 62 CAG repeats leads to the neurodegenerative disorder with male infertility called Kennedy's disease. Recently it was suggested that slight expansion is related to male subfertility. In this study we investigated the association of male subfertility with the length of CAG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> androgen receptor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAG <b>repeat</b> length <b>in</b> <b>the</b> androgen receptor gene was investigated in 75 subfertile men, who were mainly candidates for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Sperm parameters varied from azoospermia to severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. The control group consisted of 70 men who predominantly had bladder cancer. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyping was performed with polymerase chain reaction based methods. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mean length of the CAG repeat plus or minus standard deviation was noted in subfertile men and controls (22. 2 +/- 3. 1 and 21. 7 +/- 3. 4, respectively). The length of <b>the</b> CAG <b>repeat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> androgen receptor was not related to the degree of impaired spermatogenesis or clinical characteristics of the subfertile men. CONCLUSIONS: Increased length of CAG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> androgen receptor gene is not a risk factor for male subfertility...|$|R

His boldness in publicly urging Churchill not to give in to Joseph Stalin was widely remarked upon; many, including Churchill himself, observed that some of those once associated with appeasement were determined that it should not be <b>repeated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of Russian aggression. Labour left the wartime coalition in May 1945 and Churchill formed a caretaker Conservative government, pending a general election in July.
