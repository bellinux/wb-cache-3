40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was, first, to make clear the {{relationship}} between the scales of schools and pupils' achievement in the mountain village area and, secondly, to examine the case of a junior high school, consolidated three years ago. Recent studies have indicated that the achievement of large-scale schools were generally superior to that of small-scale ones, but in the rural area the factor of the school scale had little influence upon pupils' achievement because of the intensity of <b>ruralities.</b> In this reserch, difficult problems as to how we should deal with rural schools of three classes scale in mountain villages in particular, are taken up. There are different tendencies according to grades but, after all, <b>ruralities</b> seem to play the most important role in these matters. It was found by a comparative study of the boarders (old branch school pupils) and the day pupils in the case study school that the former were yet considerably inferior in their achievement and had more intense <b>ruralities</b> as a result of Uchida-Krapelin Psychodiagnositic Test. A study was made as to what effects the consolidation of schools had upon the life and learning of pupils in all grades and it was revealed that the consolidation yielded desirable and undesirable results at the same time.

Meanwhile I walked a little about the neighborhood, which is very dull and uninteresting; made up of crescents and terraces, and rows of houses that have no individuality, and second-rate shops,--in short, the {{outskirts}} of the vast city, when it begins to have a kind of village character but no <b>rurality</b> or sylvan aspect, as at Blackheath. My journey, when at last we started, was quite unmarked by incident, and extremely tedious; it being a slow train, which plods on without haste and without rest. At about ten o'clock we reached Birkenhead, and there crossed the familiar and detestable Mersey, which, as usual, had a cloudy sky brooding over it.

40|$|One {{approach}} that is helpful in framing and facilitating effective and ethical rural education research projects is centred on ensuring that researcher–participant relations are respectful, responsible and reciprocal, predicated on the shared principles of CHE (connectivity, humanness and empathy). This approach derives from a strengths-based paradigm that eschews deficit discourses about supposedly marginalised groups in favour of more enabling and productive narratives. This paper illustrates the appropriateness and utility of this approach to researching <b>ruralities</b> through a comparative analysis of two separate research projects involving rural residents {{in different parts of}} Queensland, Australia. One study investigated the approaches taken by selected rural families to enhancing the physical movement opportunities and experiences of their young children. The other inquiry explored the formal and informal learning aspirations and outcomes of members of mobile show or fairground communities whose itineraries pass through a succession of rural towns. The paper highlights ways in which the researchers, despite approaching and positioning educational research differently in their respective projects, worked to maximise the outcomes accruing to the participants. This maximising is a pre-requisite of educational research that provides mutual benefits to participating communities and that builds on their <b>ruralities</b> respectfully, responsibly and reciprocally. ...|$|R

[...] The orchestra was playing the Prayer from Der Freischutz, but Weber's lovely music only deepened the blank of memory. Who the deuce was he? where, when, how, had I known him? It seemed extraordinary that a face should be at once so familiar and so strange. We had our backs turned to him, so that I could not look at him again. When the music ceased we left our places, and I went to consign my friend to her mamma on the terrace. In passing, I saw that my young man had departed; I concluded that he only strikingly resembled some one I knew. But {{who in the world}} was it he resembled? The ladies went off to their lodgings, which were near by, and I turned into the gaming-rooms and hovered about the circle at roulette. Gradually I filtered through to the inner edge, near the table, and, looking round, saw my puzzling friend stationed opposite to me. He was watching the game, with his hands in his pockets; but singularly enough, now that I observed him at my leisure, the look of familiarity quite faded from his face. What had made us call his appearance odd was his great length and leanness of limb, his long, white neck, his blue, prominent eyes, and his ingenuous, unconscious absorption in the scene before him. He was not handsome, certainly, but he looked peculiarly amiable and if his overt wonderment savoured a trifle of <b>rurality,</b> it was an agreeable contrast to the hard, inexpressive masks about him. He was the verdant offshoot, I said to myself, of some ancient, rigid stem; he had been brought up in the quietest of homes, and he was having his first glimpse of life. I was curious to see whether he would put anything on the table; he evidently felt the temptation, but he seemed paralysed by chronic embarrassment. He stood gazing at the chinking complexity of losses and gains, shaking his loose gold in his pocket, {{and every now and then}} passing his hand nervously over his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Leaving the tavern, {{we drove}} {{a mile or}} two farther to the eastern brow of the mountain, whence we had a view, over the tops of a {{multitude}} of heights, into the intersecting valleys down which we were to plunge,--and beyond them the blue and indistinctive scene extended to the east and north for at least sixty miles. Beyond the hills it looked almost as if the blue ocean might be seen. Monadnock was visible, like a sapphire cloud against the sky. Descending, we by and by got a view of the Deerfield River, which makes a bend in its course from about north and south to about east and west, coming out from one defile among the mountains, and flowing through another. The scenery on {{the eastern side of the}} Green Mountains is incomparably more striking than on the western, where the long swells and ridges have a flatness of effect; and even Graylock heaves itself so gradually that it does not much strike the beholder. But on the eastern part, peaks one or two thousand feet high rush up on either bank of the river in ranges, thrusting out their shoulders side by side. They are almost precipitous, clothed in woods, through which the naked rock pushes itself forth to view. Sometimes the peak is bald, while the forest wraps the body of the hill, and the baldness gives it an indescribably stern effect. Sometimes the precipice rises with abruptness from the immediate side of the river; sometimes there is a cultivated valley on either side,--cultivated long, and with all the smoothness and antique <b>rurality</b> of a farm near cities,--this gentle picture strongly set off by the wild mountain-frame around it. Often it would seem a wonder how our road was to continue, the mountains rose so abruptly on either side, and stood, so direct a wall, across our onward course; while, looking behind, it would be an equal mystery how we had gotten thither, through the huge base of the mountain, that seemed to have reared itself erect after our passage. But, passing onward, a narrow defile would give us egress into a scene where new mountains would still appear to bar us. Our road was much of it level; but scooped out among mountains. The river was a brawling stream, shallow, and roughened by rocks; now we drove on a plane with it; now there was a sheer descent down from the roadside upon it, often unguarded by any kind of fence, except by the trees that contrived to grow on the headlong interval. Between the mountains there were gorges, that led the imagination away into new scenes of wildness. I have never driven through such romantic scenery, where there was such variety and boldness of mountain shapes as this; and though it was a broad sunny day, the mountains diversified the view with sunshine and shadow, and glory and gloom.|$|E
60|$|The {{second time}} I went to Blois I took a {{carriage}} for Chambord, {{and came back}} by the Chateau de Cheverny and the forest of Russy, - a charming little expedition, to which {{the beauty of the}} afternoon (the finest in a rainy season that was spotted with bright days) contributed not a little. To go to Chambord, you cross the Loire, leave it on one side, and strike away through a country in which salient features be- come less and less numerous, and which at last has no other quality than a look of intense, and peculiar <b>rurality,</b> - the characteristic, even when it is not the charm, of so much of the landscape of France. This is not the appearance of wildness, for it goes with great cultivation; it is simply the presence of the delving, drudging, economizing peasant. But it is a deep, unrelieved rusticity. It is a peasant's landscape; not, as in England, a landlord's. On the way to Cham- bord you enter the flat and sandy Sologne. The wide horizon opens out like a great potager, without inter- ruptions, without an eminence, with here and there a long, low stretch of wood. There is an absence of hedges, fences, signs of property; everything is ab- sorbed in the general flatness, - the patches of vine- yard, the scattered cottages, the villages, the children (planted and staring and almost always pretty), the women in the fields, the white caps, the faded blouses, the big sabots. At the end of an hour's drive (they assure you at Blois that even with two horses you will spend double that time), I passed through a sort of gap in a wall, which does duty as the gateway of the domain of an exiled pretender. I drove along a straight avenue, through a disfeatured park, - the park of Chambord has twenty-one miles of circumference, - a very sandy, scrubby, melancholy plantation, in which the timber must have been cut many times over and is to-day a mere tangle of brushwood. Here, as in so many spots in France, the traveller perceives that he is in a land of revolutoins. Nevertheless, its great ex- tent and the long perspective of its avenues give this desolate boskage a certain majesty; just as its shabbi- ness places it in agreement with one of the strongest impressions of the chateau. You follow one of these long perspectives a proportionate time, and at last you see the chimneys and pinnacles of Chambord rise ap- parently out of the ground. The filling-in of the wide moats that formerly surrounded it has, in vulgar par- lance, let it down, bud given it an appearance of top- heaviness that {{is at the same time}} a magnificent Orien- talism. The towers, the turrets, the cupolas, the gables, the lanterns, the chimneys, look more like the spires of a city than the salient points of a single building. You emerge from the avenue and find yourself at the foot of an enormous fantastic mass. Chambord has a strange mixture of society and solitude. A little village clusters within view of its stately windows, and a couple of inns near by offer entertainment to pilgrims. These things, of course, are incidents of the political pro- scription which hangs its thick veil over the place. Chambord is truly royal, - royal in its great scale, its grand air, its indifference to common considerations. If a cat may look at a king, a palace may lock at a tavern. I enjoyed my visit to this extraordinary struc- ture as much as if I had been a legitimist; and indeed there is something interesting in any monument of a great system, any bold presentation of a tradition.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: This study {{explored}} {{social determinants}} of chronic child malnutrition on national level and in very poor <b>ruralities</b> in the Andean region in Peru. Methods: Two samples were studied, a national sample, (n = 1426) and a rural subsample, (n = 171). The samples consisted of women age 15 - 49 and their firstborn children 3 - 60 months of age. Data {{were provided by}} the Demographic and Health Survey ENDES Continua 2004 - 2006 (DHS 2004 - 2006). The variable for child malnutrition was composed by anthropometric measures of height and age, and 2 standard deviations below the WHO growth standard indicated chronic malnutrition or stunting. The influence {{of a range of}} variables on child stunting were tested through bivariate and logistic regression analyses performed in SPSS. Results: For the national sample, the traditional socioeconomic indicators were found to be significantly associated with child stunting. Especially wealth, education and occupation were strong predictors even after controlling for possible confounding variables like age, altitude, and ethnicity. For the rural subsample, none of the classical socioeconomic measures were statistically significantly related to child stunting, indicating that other factors play a greater role in reducing child malnutrition. Altitude was a strong predictor for both samples. Discussion. The diverging results comparing national and rural sample indicate that the widely used measures of income/wealth, education and occupation are not successful at explaining differences in health in very poor <b>ruralities.</b> Rather structural, natural, and cultural structures not addressed in the survey might play more important roles in producing differences in child growth. The results from this study support findings from other studies on social determinants of health in remote and extremely poor areas. Conclusion: The differing results between the national and rural sample show that one must be careful in generalising findings concerning determinants of health from national to regional levels...|$|R

Establishment of an alternative discursive platform comprising several <b>ruralities</b> - counterpublic in Negt and Kluge's original term - allowed hunters to publicise oppositional needs, interests and rationalities in the debate, and was a key juncture in their radicalisation trajectory.

40|$|An {{important}} {{implication of}} agricultural modernization {{has been the}} break-down of interlinkages between farming, ecology and society. Historically, farming systems evolved from the specific responses of farming communities to local ecological conditions. The totality of regionalized farming systems arising out of this co-production moulded the countryside into an archipelago of differentiated <b>ruralities.</b> During the period of agricultural modernization, the nature of co-production changed thoroughly. The natural elements in co-production were increasingly artificialized or replaced by industrial artefacts.

Environmental cooperatives are local farmers associations that promote activities related to sustainable agriculture and rural development and claim {{to be actively involved}} in effectuating rural policies in their locale. Since the foundation of the first cooperative in 1992, numbers have rapidly grown to over 100.

40|$|Women {{living in}} very poor rural regions of {{developing}} countries are among those in the world facing the largest, avoidable risk for early illness, disability and death. Yet, some women in very poor areas are healthier than other women {{living in the same}} communities. Identification of factors that protect the health of women of childbearing age is a priority in the UN Millennium Development Goals. This is challenging as previous research shows that the standard protective factors higher income, higher education and higher occupational status are poorly associated with health in very poor rural places. Thus {{there is a need for}} research to emphasise protective factors that do have relevance in very poor <b>ruralities.</b> This project is part of a larger project which analyses qualitative and quantitative data from India, the Philippines, Peru, Haiti, Ghana, Tanzania and Saskatchewan (Canada). The aim of the larger project is to identify protective factors for the health of women at childbearing age living in poor <b>ruralities</b> of these countries. This thesis presents findings from qualitative data collected in the Bole District of Northern Ghana. This study implemented a case study design collecting data through focus group interviews, key informant interviews, personal observations during the field visit as well as information provided by a local nongovernmental organisation, GRID-NEA, established in and working with the women where the study took place. An open, semi-structured guide was implemented during the interviews and was modified as needed throughout the duration of the field visit in April 2009. Analysis of this research adapted the linear, hierarchical approach for qualitative data. The results indicated existing connections between social determinants and women's health. The ability to bear children, traditional skills, education, religious beliefs and social status were strong indicators that affect the status and wellbeing of women of childbearing age. Social support from husbands was highly valued in addition to assistance from older children. Previous local customs marginalised women yet with the adaption of different religions and change in beliefs of roles for women, women's health and status have increased. Although most women were not completely healthy women were able to sustain livelihoods to support themselves and their families. Unfortunately, the challenge lies in creating these opportunities because the women live in such dire circumstances. They have little access to existing resources in order to start on their own. Assistance from local organisations and agencies is necessary to create activities for them. It was difficult for a woman to succeed on her own, meaning social support had significant contributions to women's health and status. Several elements within the field of health promotion emerged from the findings of this study. These include empowerment, salutogenesis as well as influences of globalisation. These intertwined and sometimes complex concepts can be recognised as effective means to promote health, even in the harshest of living conditions...|$|R
40|$|After {{a plethora}} of {{legislative}} and policy frameworks have been passed to integrate traditional leadership system into the modern liberal democratic system in South Africa, incompatibilities of the two became increasingly evident, especially in respect of governance. The most protracted challenges of the incompatible governance systems {{are located in the}} local government sphere, especially in provinces that are predominantly rural with tribal settlements. Traditional leadership system has been in existence in African communities before imperial and colonial rule, and it had served good purposes for the wellbeing of citizens. Whilst it continued during imperialism and colonialism, it gradually took a form that principally benefited the alien Western ideology. With the attainment of democracy in South Africa, the traditional leadership system was further undermined through successive democratic regimes, albeit there was no overt state intention to demoralise, frustrate and discriminate against traditional leadership. But their exclusion from the mainstream of governance as well as encroachment into their selections and inauguration was palatable. Currently, the role and function of traditional leaders appear to be blurred in the day-to-day activities of municipalities, resulting in undue contestations of powers, jurisdiction and responsibility in local government. This article attempts to examine the reasons underlying incompatibility between the modern democratic system and the traditional leadership, amidst nationally-acclaimed legislative and policy framework provisions for their synergy. The article argues that harmonisation of the two would serve to enhance prospects of achieving good governance for service delivery tribal <b>ruralities</b> in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|While a {{remarkable}} continuity in smallholder agricultural production has been identified, {{the shift from}} subsistence orientation towards more wage dependence appears {{in a different light}} when analysed under a gender perspective. "Feminisation" has been a catchphrase to characterise some of these processes; however, the debate has been subject to overgeneralisation, and can only inadequately grasp the gender dynamics in what has been referred to as "new ruralities". Illustrated for high-value crop production as an expression of agricultural transition in the Global South, this contribution offers a critical account of the feminisation thesis. Instead of discarding the notion of feminisation, it advocates a reassessment of its potential as a comprehensive framework against which empirical findings can be reflected. While conventional uses of the feminisation thesis have, in their great majority, come up with the conclusion that for women it can always only get worse, I propose a perspective which reveals gains and risks and how they are shared between men and women as they engage in new agricultural labour markets. This perspective rests on a methodology for case-based, comparative studies developed in this paper as a contribution for assessing the nature of agricultural transition and to investigate the qualitative change associated with new <b>ruralities.</b> A distinctive appreciation of the substance of agricultural change for different members of the rural society – namely men and women, but also different men, and different women – is the premise for overcoming barriers to shared development, and for framing effective governance in the context of global development...|$|R
