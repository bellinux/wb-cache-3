30|$|Results: There was a {{tendency}} to slightly overestimate the <b>radioisotopic</b> <b>purity</b> of cyclotron-produced 99 mTc with “dilution” method (99.983 ± 0.007 %) compared to “shielding” method (99.979 ± 0.009 %). Since both methods require measurements by gamma-ray spectrometry, they are time-consuming, involve elaborate calculations, and demand specific expertise. “High-energy breakthrough” measurements showed good correlation {{with the results of}} gamma-spectrometry.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Formulations of cyclotron-produced 99 mTc contain trace {{amounts of}} other Tc {{isotopes}} {{depending on the}} isotopic composition of starting 100 Mo. Presence of other nuclides may affect image quality and patient dosimetry. Therefore, quantification of radioisotopic impurities is very important. Currently, <b>radioisotopic</b> <b>purity</b> of cyclotron-produced 99 mTc is measured using gamma-ray spectrometry and is time-consuming. We sought to identify another approach better suitable for quality control during routine productions.|$|E
40|$|According to the {{importance}} of positron emitters in nuclear medicine, 82 mRb was produced as a member of this group of radiopharmaceuticals. After being converted into an injectable form, enough information was provided for imaging with this radiopharmaceutical. 82 mRb with high <b>radioisotopic</b> <b>purity</b> and half-life of 6. 5 hours, in chloride form, can be considered as a suitable positron emitter for the assessment of myocardial function. As a result of the bombardment of 82 Kr with 15. 4 MeV protons, the activity of 35. 04 mCi was finally achieved. The nuclear reaction efficiency was 6. 37 mCi/&# 956;Ah. The product had a high radiopharmaceutical purity, according to international standards...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The Los Alamos Isotope Production Program {{commonly}} irradiates target stacks {{consisting of}} high, medium and low-energy {{targets in the}} “A-”, “B-”, and “C-slots”, respectively, with a 100 MeV proton beam. The Program has recently considered the production of 57 Co (t 1 / 2 = 271. 74 d, 100 % EC) from 58 Ni using the low-energy posi-tion of the Isotope Production Facility, down-stream of two RbCl salt targets. Initial MCNPX/ CINDER’ 90 studies predicted 57 Co <b>radioisotopic</b> <b>purities</b> > 90 % depending on time allotted for decay. But these studies do not account for broadening of the proton beam’s energy distribution caused by density changes in molten, potentially boiling RbCl targets upstream of the 58 Ni (see e. g., [1]). During a typical production with 230 µA average proton intensity, the RbCl targets’ temperature is expected to produce beam energy changes of several MeV and commensurate effects on the yield and purity of any radioisotope irradiated in the low-energy posi-tion of the target stack. An experiment was designed to investigate both the potential for 57 Co’s large-scale production and the 2 -dimensional proton beam energy distribution. Material and Methods Two aluminum targets holders were fabricated to each contain 31 58 Ni discs (99. 48 %, Isoflex, CA), 4. 76 mm (Φ) x 0. 127 mm (thickness). Each foil was indexed with a unique cut pattern by EDM with a 0. 254 mm brass wire to allow {{their position in the}} target to be tracked through hot cell disassembly and assay (see FIG. 1). Brass residue from EDM was removed with HNO 3 /HCl solution. The holders’ front windows were 2. 87 and 1. 37 mm thick, corresponding to predicted average incident energies of 17. 9 and 24. 8 MeV on the Ni [2]. Each target was irradiated with protons for 1 h with an average beam current of 218 ± 3 µA to ensure an upstream RbCl target temperature and density that would mimic routine production. Following irradiation, targets were disassembled and each disc was assayed by HPGe γ-spectroscopy. Residuals 56 Co (t 1 / 2 = 77. 2 d, 100 % EC) and 57 Co have inversely varying measured nuclear formation cross sections between approximately 15 and 40 MeV. Results and Conclusion Distributions of 56, 57, 58, 60 Co were tracked as described in both irradiated targets. The distribution of activities matched expectations, with radioisotopes produced by proton interactions with the 58 Ni target (56 Co and 57 Co) concentrated in the area struck by IPF’s rastered, annulus-shaped proton beam, and the distribution of radioisotopes produced by neutron-induced reactions (58 Co and 60 Co) relatively uniform across all irradiated foils. The potential range of such temperature variations predicted by thermal modeling (approx. ± 200 °C) corre-sponds to a density variation of nearly 0. 2 g. cm− 3, and a change in the average energy of protons incident on the low-energy “C-slot” of approximately 5 MeV, well-matched to the indi-rectly measured energy variation plotted in FIG. 3. No energy distribution in the plane per-pendicular to the beam axis has previously been assumed in the design of IPF targets. The effective incident energy measured by yields of 57 Co and 56 Co is, however, almost 5 MeV higher than those predicted using Anderson and Ziegler’s well-known formalism [2]. This discrepancy is supported by previous reports [3] and likely exacerbated compared to these reports by the large magnitude of energy degradation (from 100 MeV down to 30 MeV) in the IPF target stack. For more detailed discussion, refer to Marus et al. ’s abstract, also reported at this meeting. While the experiments reported do confirm the potential for many Ci-scale yields of 57 Co from months-long irradiations at the IPF, the level radioisotopic impurities 56 Co and 58 Co are concerning. Commercial radioisotope producers using U- 150 (23 MeV) and RIC- 14 (14 MeV) cyclotrons in Obninsk, Russia specify 56 / 58 Co activities at levels < 0. 2 % of available 57 C...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the neutron capture cross sections of s-process branching point isotopes represents a basic requirement for the understanding of star evolution. Since such branching point isotopes are by definition radioactive, the measurement of their cross sections from thermal to stellar energies becomes a challenging task. Considerable amounts of material have to be produced, representing a significant radioactive hazard. We report here on the production and separation of 3. 5 mg 171 Tm from 240 mg 170 Er 2 O 3 and 72 µg 147 Pm from 100 mg 146 Nd 2 O 3 irradiated at the ILL high flux reactor.

40|$|In despite of the {{cyclotron}} {{production method}} and {{the efficiency of}} radiochemical processing adopted, the long–lived radioisotopic impurity 202 Tl is always present in [201 Tl]labelled radiopharmaceuticals (RP) together with other short-living impurities like, 200 Tl. A rapid determination of 202 Tl impurity, is carried out by HPGe gamma spectrometry of 201 Tl samples, shielded by a 5 mm thick envelope of lead. DT correction errors, random pile-ups, Compton continuum and X-ray fluorescence background, are very efficiently avoided and suppressed. Some experimental results on DT correction performances of a commercial HPGe counting chain are reported.

30|$|Materials and methods: 100 Mo targets (99.815 % enrichment) were {{irradiated}} in a cyclotron at 24 MeV for 2 h. The {{targets were}} processed and <b>radioisotopic</b> <b>purity</b> of resulted 99 mTc was evaluated using three different procedures. Method 1, “Dilution”: An aliquot of diluted 99 mTc solution {{was measured using}} gamma-ray spectrometry. Percentage of each radioactive contaminant was calculated dividing activity of each isotope by total activity in the sample. Method 2, “Shielding”: A vial containing formulated 99 mTc was measured in a calibrated ionization chamber. Then, it was inserted into a 6 mm thick lead canister, used in nuclear medicine for 99 Mo breakthrough determination, and measured using gamma-ray spectrometry. The activity of each radioactive contaminant was calculated and divided by total activity in the vial as measured in ionization chamber. Method 3, “High-energy breakthrough”: A vial containing formulated 99 mTc was measured in a calibrated ionization chamber as is and inside the lead canister. The ratio of two measurements gave relative proportion of high-energy gamma-rays.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Previously we {{described}} the high yield production of 64 Cu using a target system {{designed specifically for}} low energy, biomedical cyclotrons. In this study, {{the use of this}} target system for the production of 60 Cu and 61 Cu is described and the utility of these isotopes in the labeling of biomolecules for tumor and hypoxia imaging is demonstrated. 60 Cu and 61 Cu were produced by the 60 Ni(p,n) 60 Cu, 61 Ni(p,n) 61 Cu, and 60 Ni(d,n) 61 Cu nuclear reactions. The nickel target (> 99 % enriched or natural nickel) was plated onto a gold disk as described previously (54 – 225 mm thickness) and irradiated (14. 7 MeV proton beam and 8. 1 MeV deuteron beam). The copper isotopes were separated from the nickel via ion exchange chromatography and the <b>radioisotopic</b> <b>purity</b> was assessed by gamma spectroscopy. Yields of up to 865 mCi of 60 Cu have been achieved using enriched 60 Ni. 61 Cu has been produced with a maximum yield of 144 mCi using enriched 61 Ni and 72 mCi using enriched 60 Ni. Specific activities (using enriched material) ranged from 80 to 300 mCi/mg Cu for 60 Cu and from 20 to 81 mCi/mg Cu for 61 Cu. Bombardments of natural Ni targets were performed using both protons and deuterons. Yields and radioisotopic impurities were determined and compared with that for enriched materials. 60 Cu was used to radiolabel diacetyl-bis(N 4 -methylthiosemicarbazone), ATSM. 60 Cu-ATSM was injected into rats that had an occluded left anterior descending coronary artery.
