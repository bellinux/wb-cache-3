40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on changes to the {{implementation}} of road safety inspections in Ireland following the requirement, under EU Directive 2008 / 96 /EC on Road Infrastructure Safety Management, for the establishment of periodic road safety inspections (RSI) of existing roads, along with safety impact assessments, high accident concentration ranking and <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> (<b>RSA).</b> Ireland, along with fellow EU member states, were required to adopt guidelines ensuring road safety inspections were carried out by a competent entity in order to safeguard adequate safety levels for road infrastructure. By using a case study, this paper will outline the transition Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has made by embracing new technology. This proactive approach to improving road safety contrasts with the reactive ‘black spot’ approach based on historical collision data. Incorporating RSI and the additional requirements (e. g. RSA) of the Directive 2008 / 96 /EC into existing design standards has provided TII complimentary tools to better enable designers’ effect positive change to the road environment in Ireland...|$|E

The first step of the research was data collection from 18 road safety audits conducted throughout the state of Utah. These <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Audits</b> (<b>RSA</b> 2 ̆ 7 s) provided a wide variety of data that was used for the validation of the road safety audit quantification methodology. The purpose of this research is to provide quantification to the RSA process that will increase the benefits gained from implementing the RSA recommendations. Benefits derived from the implementation of RSA recommendations were found by assessing the change of risk from before and after safety improvements. The RSA quantification tool was developed to analyze projects in both urban and rural settings. The implementation of the RSA tool will help practitioners show the benefits that can be gained from the safety recommendations and help decision makers in allocating funds to the areas that pose the most risk. The tool will show the difference in risk that the improvements make and the cost effectiveness of different project alternatives...|$|E

With the official recommendations for Road safety audits this method was introduced in Germany in the year 2002. Following the European Directive 2008 / 96 /EC and taking into account the experiences from more than 13 years of auditing the German recommendations are actualized and upgraded at the moment to a mandatory standard including RSA and RSI requirements. While the first road safety auditors in Germany were trained for motorways and rural roads the author developed together with other institutions the certification course and the RSA process for urban roads and residential roads. Germany might be the only state, where Road Safety Auditors are certified for different road categories and especially are divided into interurban and urban auditors. More than 130 auditors were certified and are now working as auditors for the urban road categories. Certificates are awarded with three years validity. Requirements for extensions are the verification of three audits and the participation in two courses. Yearly the „Symposia for road safety with auditor forums“ take part at the University of Wuppertal where actual research outputs in the field of Urban Road Safety are presented and critical audits like those for complex intersections, cycling and walking infrastructure or great residential zones are discussed...|$|E

The aim {{of this article is}} to present the outputs of BALTRIS project. The goal of the international project BALTRIS is to elaborate the road and street infrastructure safety management procedures and teaching material consistently explaining the above mentioned infrastructure management procedures. Four Baltic Sea region countries (Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), represented by universities and national road administrations participate in the elaboration of these procedures and teaching material.

40|$|AbstractThe general {{objective}} of the ECOROADS project is to overcome the barrier established by the formal interpretation of the two Directives 2008 / 96 /EC (on road infrastructure safety management) and 2004 / 54 /EC (on tunnels), that in practice do not allow the same Road Safety Audits/Inspections to be performed inside tunnels. The main problem is that, while from the user (driver) point of view a road is a unique linear infrastructure generally in open terrain and sometimes in closed environment (tunnels), the strict application of the two Directives leads to a non-uniform approach to the infrastructure safety management outside and inside tunnels. To overcome this barrier, ECOROADS projects aims at {{the establishment of a}} common enhanced approach to road infrastructure and tunnel safety management by using the concepts and criteria of the Directive, 2008 / 96 /CE on road infrastructure safety management and the results of related European Commission (EC) funded projects. Such an objective will be achieved through the following specific activities:Workshops with the stakeholders (European tunnel and road managers); Analysis/review of national practices regarding Road Safety Inspections (RSI) and <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Audits</b> (<b>RSA),</b> starting from the results of the two studies recently launched by the EC's Directorate for Mobility and Transport {{to assess the impact of}} the two Directives 2008 / 96 /EC and 2004 / 54 /EC [...] Exchange of best practices and experiences between European tunnel experts and road safety professionals; [...] Pilot joint safety operations in five European road sections which feature both open roads and tunnels; [...] Recommendations and guidelines for the application of the RSA and RSI concepts within the tunnel safety operations;Thanks to the high transferability of the ECOROADS results, the present formal gap between the Directive, 2008 / 96 /EC and the Directive 2004 / 54 /EC will be bridged, thus leading to “faster, more sustainable and better planned interventions with maximum safety for the workers and other traffic participants”...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{tools and}} procedures established {{in different countries}} which apply <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Audits</b> (<b>RSA).</b> These RSAs are utilized to identify potential safety problems and they concentrate on safety measures to overcome these problems. This technique is used to detect possible safety hazards, in the various stages of a scheme, before a new road is open to traffic. The slogan ‘Prevention is better than cure’ is already well known to us, and Road Safety Auditing can establish an association with road safety. The application of this preventive technique can prevent accidents or reduce the severity of accidents. Except for minimizing trauma, and increasing the designer’s awareness of road safety, RSAs can also reduce the overall lifetime cost of a scheme, for it is less likely that remedial rebuilding of road sections will take place. Therefore this report deals with schemes subject to design and redesign of new roads, rather than existing roads. Strict application of design regulations does not always lead to a safe road for general rules don’t always apply to specific situations. When applying an RSA, it improves awareness of road safety, and highlights safety among other aspects of road design. The main objective of safety audits {{is to ensure that}} highway schemes operate as safely as possible, i. e. to minimise the number and severity of occurring accidents. This can be achieved by avoiding accident-producing elements and by providing suitable accident-reducing elements. The purpose of safety audits is to ensure that ‘mistakes’ are not built into new schemes. The items summarised below, concerning the Great Britain situation, give quite a general picture about specific aims of the Road Safety Audit. (i) to minimise accident risk on the network adjacent to new schemes; (ii) to lay emphasis on safe design practice and increase the awareness of everyone involved in planning, design, construction, and maintenance of roads; (iii) to highlight the importance of taking into consideration the needs of all types of users; and (iv) to reduce the whole-life cost of the schemes, by minimising the need of future corrections. The UK definition is as follows: A formal procedure for assessing accident potential and safety performance in the provision of new road schemes, and schemes for the improvement and maintenance of existing roads. (Guidelines for The Safety Audit Of Highways, IHT, 1996) In order for a safety audit to be successful, some certain factors should be taken into consideration. The key factors that contribute to the efficiency of the safety audit may refer to the organisation and the selection of the audit team. With respect to safety audit organisation, support and commitment of senior management is necessary. Safety audits should {{be an integral part of}} an agency’s overall program. Local authorities often use a Road Safety Plan as a framework in which the RSA is placed. By doing so, the RSA is part of the overall safety management strategy. The purpose of the checklists is to insure that nothing is overlooked. Practitioners should not rely solely on them and are encouraged to expand them. Over the past few years checklists were re-considered and the new checklists in the revised guidelines are meant to indicate ‘principal issues’ rather than provide detailed lists of the items to be examined. Different checklists are provided for each safety audit stage. Checklists appear to be not very important. The usage of checklists decreases as the knowledge of Road Safety Audits increases. When conducting an RSA, the audit team should not try to redesign the scheme, instead they should pay attention to road safety for all kind of different road users, and theirs suspected road user behaviour. The way this should not be done, is to compare the design with relevant standards and see if it matches, but the audit team should check if the design appropriately interacts with the design standards, for strict application of standards does not always lead towards a safe road. Some other findings about RSA are mentioned below. It is important that a site visit is carried out. Both in daylight and at night. Thus the visibility for different road users can be checked in the context of the road and its surroundings. When an RSA is carried out in an early stage of the design process it is less likely that ‘errors’ become embedded in the design and become harder to correct later on. A RSA should not seriously delay a design process, thus attention should be paid to the embedding of the RSA during the planning of the design process. Attention should be paid to monitoring and feed back to the audit team after opening of the road when accidents occur. The RSA process should be formally organised and its outcomes documented. Concerning the formalization and purity of an audit, it is to recommend that the audit results are documented before there is discussion (if any) with the client, and concessions could arise. Some say that a formalised RSA leads towards a more systematical approach and enlarges the chance on a consistent outcome. The ultimate level of formalisation is to make an RSA mandatory. Relevant plans and documents should be available to the audit team and should be mentioned in the report. It should be clear what should be audited, which tasks there are and who is responsible for those tasks. It can be beneficial to use the same names and numbers of stages for less misunderstandings and for comparison with other RSA documents. Probably the best way of introducing RSA is ‘top down’ (management and governmental) approval and ‘bottom up’ training. In this introduction stage the use of checklists could be useful. When introducing RSA, knowledge of accident investigation techniques or safety engineering audit team is necessary. Another crucial point in introducing RSA is to how to tell when a designer is wrong. The best answer dealing with this problem is probably an increase of accidents. On a European level, the procedure could perhaps be used in a highly aggregate level, using local knowledge of road safety when performing an RSA. A framework for the development of RSAs can be found in five points containing tasks for the different bodies responsible for different aspects of road safety: (i) National governments; they should develop RSA procedures and methods; (ii) National road authorities; they should perform pilot audits for all roads, including TERN; (iii) National organisations which are responsible for design guidelines & manuals; they should integrate RSA in tools for improving road safety; (iv) National road research institutes; they should evaluate RSA; and (v) European Commission; it should initiate pilot audits on TERN roads. These pilots should point out how the audits for TERN roads will be performed, with regard to procedures, the audit team, and responsibilities. Some European countries have developed a national RSA system. Many people involved in this development think of RSA as a promising way to improve road safety. RSA Pilot projects point out that design inaccuracies can be discovered in new road designs and RSA evaluations already carried out in some counties have been very positive; RSA seems to work. The introduction of an RSA system can either be done bottom up or top down. A bottom up approach can lead to a vast, enthusiastic participation whereas a top down approach can lead to a more explicit introduction. Although road safety comprising design solutions can be tracked using an RSA, the precise effects are yet still unknown. Quality is added to a national road system by using an RSA system. (A...|$|E

The present paper focuses on the possibilities for further enhancing the consideration of human factor-related issues in RSA guidelines. This can be achieved through the incorporation of quantitative checks on consistency or driver work load. Such tests can give more weight to the auditors' reasoning. Moreover, the scope is investigated for providing increased opportunities for road user involvement in the RSA process. Public involvement is examined from the aspect of a group's representation, appropriate RSA stages, effective procedures, and responsibility. The possible means and methods for communication between auditors and road users' representatives are also discussed...|$|R

As such, there is critical need for a practical tool {{that focuses on the}} safety of the existing, as-built, local road facilities. As requested by the World Bank, the RSA process has been developed for this purpose, giving specific recognition to the safety performance of roadside and median barriers for three existing, typical freeways in Jiangxi, China, and to the gathering of design experience for a new RGF project. On top of a routine <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audit</b> process, a total of 172 roadside crashes are collected, with 74 belonging to single vehicle Run-off-Road crashes, and crash records are analyzed to supplement the qualitative auditing suggestions. The structure and safety performance of the roadside and median barriers in the three freeways reviewed are evaluated and compared with their counterparts in the US barrier system. Several critical issues were identified and improvement suggestions were recommended, including less attention being paid to the roadside Clear Recovery Zone (CRZ), weak barrier structures, un-protected roadside obstacles (i. e. barrier ends, advertisement signs, drainage ditches, etc.), and poor connections or transitions of rails. Based on these observations, detailed pertinent countermeasures for each issue have been suggested in a roadside <b>safety</b> <b>audit</b> report for guiding roadside safety design in the RGF project...|$|R

Good practices of <b>road</b> infrastructure <b>safety</b> management have been explored in order to find solutions to the issues highlighted by the survey and provide examples about how these issues have been overcome in some countries.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 22 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 14 - 16 July 2003 "National issues affecting the movement of people and goods - strategic approaches", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: A number of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> were undertaken by the Gauteng Department of Public Transport, Roads and Works (Gautrans) according to the methodology developed by the National Department of Transport. Apart from the obvious reasons for undertaking <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audits,</b> {{the objective of the}} project was also to evaluate and test the <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audit</b> methodology. The aim {{of this paper is to}} report on the findings of the project, as well as proposed modifications to the <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audit</b> methodology. An important conclusion of the project is that <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> can have significant advantages. All road authorities should consider implementing <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> on all projects involving changes to the road network. All projects should preferably be audited, from the smallest to the largest. A number of modifications to the <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audit</b> methodology are proposed in the paper. The modifications include the provision of a methodology for the undertaking of site inspections, changes to checklists used for <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audits,</b> and a change to the approach to <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> on existing <b>roads.</b> This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

The value of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audit</b> is critically dependent on the knowledge and training of the individuals undertaking the audit. The lack of formal and robust accreditation of <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> Auditors has led to a wide variation in the skills of people practicing: from the highest levels of technical competence, to those with poor knowledge who are able to conduct little more than checks of code compliance. It is expected that in future years rigorous examination based systems of accreditation will emerge internationally.|$|R

40|$|What is a <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audit?</b> A <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audit</b> is {{a formal}} {{procedure}} {{to assess the}} accident potential and likely safety performance of a specific road design or traffic scheme. It {{can be applied to}} a new construction or to an alteration of an existing road. Audits are intended to identify potential road problems that can put safety at risk by looking at the scheme as if {{through the eyes of the}} potential users, and to make suggestions for solving eventual problems applying the principles of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> engineering. 1 It is important to minimise the accident risk at the design stage already in order to decrease the likelihood of having to take accident remedial measures later. Thereby the whole-life cost of the scheme can be reduced. <b>Road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> are therefore a tool to prevent accidents on new or modified roads. They often complement low-cost measures to reduce accidents on existing roads. 2 Where are <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> carried out? Mandatory <b>safety</b> <b>audit</b> procedures programmed at well-defined stages during the planning, design and construction of road schemes have been used in the UK, Denmark, Australia and New Zealand for several years.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Audit</b> Standard in the UK, HD 19 / 03, and describes from practical experience how this standard is being applied to new road schemes and highway improvements. The paper describes co-operation between {{colleagues in the}} UK, and those in Ireland and Italy, who have introduced <b>Safety</b> <b>Audit</b> into two very different highways cultures. In Ireland a national Standard has been developed, together with a training and accreditation programme for Safety Auditors. In Italy a route wide programme of auditing on existing roads has been developed, with consultants producing detailed reports describing problems and recommendations for improvement. The paper comments on issues relating to consistency of audit comments, along with the subject of risk assessment within <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Audit.</b> The paper briefly {{examines the}} scale of the highway related <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> problem across Europe, and refers to European Commission objectives for <b>Safety</b> <b>Audit</b> and <b>safety</b> impact assessment.

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Audits</b> {{strongly}} {{depend on}} the operative conditions roads are exposed to, {{in terms of both}} influence of local environmental parameters (light, visibility, troubling elements, etc.) and vehicle dynamics related to driver behaviour. This is particularly important in the case of circular curves, where the influence of the “human” factor becomes highly determinant in the <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> assessment: both the choice of trajectory and transit speed along the geometric element unavoidably rebound on vehicle behaviour and, with this, on the tyre-road friction characteristics. These aspects are reflected in <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Audit</b> procedures, mainly through the integration of the “human” factor in <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> assessment. The border-line conditions to be used in <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> must reflect the real road geometry covered by drivers (free geometry or free trajectories), the transit speed accepted by drivers (in terms of S 85) and the real dynamic conditions undercurrent between tyres and <b>road</b> pavement. <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Audits</b> conducted considering the “human” factor will show a different safety degree between the operative conditions and the theoretical ones forecast for the geometric element, especially in terms of required skid resistance. The adoption of higher transit speeds than the theoretical ones, united with the choice of trajectories not coinciding with the road axis, unavoidably involves higher friction properties than those foreseen by designers. In particular, comparing required friction and offered friction in both cases (operative and theoretical), a different safety coefficient can be found for the considered geometric element. This paper discusses the importance of the interaction among the three factors “driver-vehicle-road” in <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Audits</b> in the case of circular curves...|$|R
