25|$|<b>Rectifier</b> <b>locomotives,</b> {{which used}} AC power {{transmission}} and DC motors, were common, though DC commutators had problems both in starting and at low velocities. Today's advanced electric locomotives use brushless three-phase AC induction motors. These polyphase machines are powered from GTO-, IGCT- or IGBT-based inverters. The cost of electronic devices {{in a modern}} locomotive can be up to 50% {{of the cost of}} the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Some {{electric}} railway systems {{also use}} DC power and thus {{make use of}} power electronics to feed grid power to the locomotives and often for speed control of the locomotive's motor. In the middle twentieth century, <b>rectifier</b> <b>locomotives</b> were popular, these used power electronics to convert AC power from the railway network for use by a DC motor. Today most electric locomotives are supplied with AC power and run using AC motors, but still use power electronics to provide suitable motor control. The use of power electronics to assist with motor control and with starter circuits cannot be underestimated and, in addition to rectification, is responsible for power electronics appearing {{in a wide range}} of industrial machinery. Power electronics even appear in modern residential air conditioners.|$|R

It {{was built to}} haul passenger trains between Grand Central Terminal or Penn Station, New York City and New Haven, Connecticut.|$|R
25|$|The VGN {{had a very}} major {{grade at}} Clark's Gap, West Virginia, and tried large steam {{locomotives}} before turning to an alternative already in use by one of its neighboring competitors, Norfolk & Western Railway: a railway electrification system. With work authorized beginning in 1922, a 134-mile portion of the railroad in the mountains from Mullens, West Virginia over Clark's Gap and several other major grades to Roanoke, Virginia was equipped with overhead wires supported by a catenary system. The VGN built its own power plant at Narrows, Virginia. The electrification was completed in 1925 {{at a cost of}} $15 million, equal to $ today. A link was established with Norfolk & Western to share electricity from its nearby electrification during contingencies. ALCO and Westinghouse supplied the electric locomotives, which were equipped with pantographs. The 36 initial units were normally linked in groups of three as one set, and had much greater load capacity than the steam power they replaced. In 1948, four huge EL-2B twin-unit locomotives were purchased, followed by twelve EL-C <b>rectifier</b> <b>locomotives</b> in 1955.|$|R
25|$|These low {{frequencies}} were later made unnecessary by high power <b>locomotive</b> <b>rectifiers</b> that can convert any AC frequency to DC: first the mercury-arc rectifier {{and then the}} semiconductor rectifier. Some AC railways have been converted to standard grid frequencies, but {{low frequencies}} are still widely used due to large sunken equipment costs.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} a system for monitoring the condition of electrical eqUipment, such as transformers and bushings where the internal insulation of the electrical eqUipment is composed of oil-paper composite. In particular, the invention relates to an integrated portable system for detecting condition of oil-paper composite insulation in electrical eqUipment. The invention further relates to a process for detecting the condition of oil-paper composite insulation in electrical eqUipment. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Transformers and bushings form {{an integral part of}} any electrical power distribution and transmission system that also include other type of transformers like <b>rectifier</b> transformers, <b>locomotive</b> transformers. One of the important components of the insulation of oil filled transformers comprises paper which is wound around the copper windings. There are spacers, washers, seals, separators, composed of paper or compressed board having characteristics that of paper. In order to enhance the insulatio...|$|R
