It made her the fourth artist to achieve that feat overall, behind Elton John with Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy and Rock of the Westies, Stevie Wonder with Songs in the Key of Life and Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band with Live/1975–85. On June 27, 1987 the album topped the chart and remained there for eleven consecutive weeks, the longest run among the releases that reached peak position of the year. It also debuted at number fourteen on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart (formerly the [...] "Top Black Albums" [...] chart) and peaked at the number two, staying on the chart for a total of seventy-five weeks. The album was Houston's fastest-selling album in the United States at that time, with four million copies shipped within {{the first three months of}} its release. It was certified 11× Platinum for shipping 11 million copies in the United States alone by the Recording Industry Association of America on November 29, 1995. Whitney has sold over 9,253,000 copies in the US as of Feabruary 2012. The album re-entered the Billboard 200 the week of February 25, 2012, after Houston's death, at number 122. It remained in the chart for 11 more weeks making 86 weeks on the Billboard 200 to date. The album has sold nearly 289,000 copies more since its <b>re</b> <b>entry</b> in 2012. It also sold 806,000 units at the BMG Music Club as of February 2003.. Whitney was a smash hit worldwide. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart on June 13, 1987 and remained there for six weeks. There·through, Whitney became the first album to debut at number one in the U.S. and in the UK both. It was 1987's third best-selling album in the UK, behind Michael Jackson's Bad and U2's The Joshua Tree, and was ranked number six on list of [...] "The Best-Selling Albums of the 1980s in UK". With 1.2 million copies sold there, it would become the biggest selling album by a female artist in the UK, a record that has since been broken. With her debut also selling over a million copies, this would make Houston the first female artist to have two albums sell over a million copies in the UK. With current sales of over 2.2 million, the album was the first album by an African-American woman to sell over 2 million in the UK. In Canada, the album topped the albums chart for eleven weeks, being the third best-selling album in 1987, behind U2's The Joshua Tree and Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet.

40|$|Automotive {{catalytic}} converters are used {{extensively in the}} automotive industry to reduce toxic pollutants from vehicle exhausts. The flow across automotive exhaust catalysts is distributed by a sudden expansion and has {{a significant effect on}} their conversion efficiency. The exhaust gas is pulsating and flow distribution is a function of engine operating condition, namely speed (frequency), load (flow rate) and pressure loss across the monolith. The aims of this study are to provide insight into the development of the pulsating flow field within the diffuser under isothermal conditions and to assess the steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predictions of flow maldistribution at high Reynolds numbers. Flow measurements were made across an automotive catalyst monolith situated downstream of a planar wide-angled diffuser in the presence of pulsating flow. Cycle-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were made in the diffuser and hot wire anemometry (HWA) downstream of the monoliths. The ratio of pulse period to residence time within the diffuser (J factor) characterises the flow distribution. During acceleration the flow remained attached to the diffuser walls for some distance before separating near the diffuser inlet later in the cycle. Two cases with J ~ 3. 5 resulted in very similar flow fields with the flow able to reattach downstream of the separation bubbles. With J = 6. 8 separation occurred earlier with the flow field resembling, at the time of deceleration, the steady flow field. Increasing J from 3. 5 to 6. 8 resulted in greater flow maldistribution within the monoliths; steady flow producing the highest maldistribution in all cases for the same <b>Re.</b> The oblique <b>entry</b> pressure loss of monoliths were measured using a one-dimensional steady flow rig over a range of approach Reynolds number (200 < Rea < 4090) and angles of incidence (0 o < α < 70 o). Losses increased with α and Re at low mass flow rates but were independent of Re at high flow rates being 20 % higher than the transverse dynamic pressure. The flow distribution across axisymmetric ceramic 400 cpsi and perforated 600 cpsi monoliths were modelled using CFD and the porous medium approach. This requires knowledge of the axial and transverse monolith resistances; the latter being only applicable to the radially open structure. The axial resistances were measured by presenting uniform flow to the front face of the monolith. The transverse resistances were deduced by best matching CFD predictions to measurements of the radial flow profiles obtained downstream of the monolith when presented with non-uniform flow at its front face. CFD predictions of the flow maldistibution were performed by adding the oblique entry pressure loss to the axial resistance to simulate the monolith losses. The critical angle approach was used to improve the predictions, i. e. the oblique entry loss was limited such that the losses were assumed constant above a fixed critical angle, αc. The result showed that the perforated 600 cpsi monolith requires the entrance effect to be restricted above αc = 81 o, while the losses were assumed constant above αc = 85 o for the ceramic 400 cpsi monolith. This might be due to the separation bubble at the monolith entrance being restricted by the smaller hydraulic diameter of the perforated monolith thus limiting the oblique entry loss at the lower incidence angle...|$|R

Localization of AP- 1 B to recycling endosomes (REs) along with other components (exocyst subunits and Rab 8) involved in AP- 1 B–dependent transport suggested that RE might be an intermediate between the Golgi and the plasma membrane. Although the involvement of endosomes in the secretory pathway has long been suspected, we now present direct evidence using four independent methods that REs play a role in basolateral transport in MDCK cells. Newly synthesized AP- 1 B–dependent cargo, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G), was found by video microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, and cell fractionation to enter transferrin-positive REs within a few minutes after exit from the trans-Golgi network. Although transient, <b>RE</b> <b>entry</b> appears essential because enzymatic inactivation of REs blocked VSV-G delivery to the cell surface.

Methods: A qualitative method, which employed interviews and focus group discussions, assessed the effect of the training programme on key individual, societal and physical factors set out by the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (2001). Results: 157 persons with disabilities (60 %) secured employment after training. Of these, 74 % reported that they were able to provide a better livelihood for their families, 92 % reported increased social acceptance, and 83 % reported improvement in overall quality of life.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{reconciliation}} or {{work and family}} life has been of cardinal importance {{over the past few}} years not only in the Czech Republic but in most European countries. For most families it is becoming more and more difficult to reconcile the duties connected with the care of children and other dependent persons with the occupation. This situation is caused by many factors such as the growth of women employment, changes in family structure, demographic effects, development of human rights and many others. Social policy must take these aspects into account and carry out such acctivities that will enable families to face the challenges of the present society and won't make them decide either work of family. As a part of theory there are quite many particular methods and ways how to help families to cope with their employment and family duties. Some sources distinguish these strategies among individual and family, employers' strategies and strategies of the welfare state.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the (<b>re)</b> <b>entry</b> of Norwegian mothers into full-time and part-time employment following {{the first and}} second birth. Based on theories of job search and human capital depreciation and appreciation a semi-parametric hazard model is estimated, expressing the entry rate as a function of a woman's full wage (the market wage plus the present value of reductions in future earnings due to a career break) and her reservation wage. As predicted, a higher market wage and higher accumulated employment experience before birth are found to speed up the return to work, but the positive effect of employment experience declines with time since birth. The most powerful predictor of after-birth employment is the length of prior home-time periods. Having stayed at home a long time before birth strongly inhibits the return to both full-time and part-time work, and the effect becomes stronger the longer the time since birth. This is in line with the notion that women tend to be either persistent workers or persistent non-workers, as is found in several U. S. studies. New to this study is the evidence of persistency also in full-time and part-time work, as previous full-timers {{are much more likely to}} return to full-time and previous part-timers are much more likely to return to part-time work.

40|$|The current {{uncertainty}} {{levels for}} afterbody (base) aeroheating are very large for capsule like (<b>re)</b> <b>entry</b> vehicles. The design margin on missions have traditionally ranged up to 200 % of CFD predictions. These uncertainties {{can be attributed}} to a lack of validation of the CFD tools with suitable flight data and a general difficulty in simulating afterbody flow fields in ground facilities in which base flows are perturbed by sting effects. In addition to basic smooth wall afterbody properties, local disturbances, e. g. connectors, windows and RCS thruster/flowfield interactions have {{to be taken into account}} for design. Without an established confidence in the ability of CFD to predict the base flowfield, any attempt to predict the latter effects would be futile.

40|$|Based on the {{recognition}} that many women who come into refuge have few options but {{to return to the}} sort of environment in which they have been abused, the Transition and Wellbeing programme aims to provide medium to long term housing for families as they re‐establish themselves in the community. Data for the evaluation of the programme was collected from two main sources; the women on the programme and key informants at Te Whakaruruhau. Five women, two of whom are housed in transitional accommodation were interviewed individually, while focus groups were conducted with middle and senior management teams. The completion of the interviews enabled the development of a programme logic, which describes the ‘theory’ of the programme. The model details the activities or what the programme does. These activities include linking women to programmes and resources, providing practical support, addressing specific cultural needs and the availability of quality advocates. These activities are built on foundational values, such as, whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and wairuatanga. The programme is only made possible with internal and external inputs. Of the external inputs, funding contributions are considered vital to the functioning of the programme. The women’s perspectives identified varying outcomes from their participation in the programme. The logic model details the intended outcomes in the short, medium and long‐term, reflecting personal, relational and community wellbeing. Short term outcomes include improved communication, improved self‐esteem, improved confidence and personal growth. Medium outcomes saw (re) engagement in training, education and for some, (<b>re)</b> <b>entry</b> into the workforce. Long term outcomes related to the establishment of a sustainable life style free from violence. The participants did not see a need to modify the programme in any significant way. Some did think that it could be usefully extended by adding to the existing activities a hands on, artistic approach. Programme developers may consider more creative ways in which to assess and measure the impact of the programme. Finally, it is suggested that the programme could benefit from a more systemic assessment process to determine whether women are “ready” to enter it...|$|E
40|$|The term "quarantine " {{is a very}} {{familiar}} word in both medi-cal and veterinary science and it was actually derived from an old French official method “querente ” meaning forty days of isolation (Arnall & Keymer, 1975) for a ship. It literally means compulsory isolation or detention to prevent spread of contagion or infection. It may be questioned as to why quarantine is important for zoos. There is an old adage, “prevention is better than cure” {{and one of the}} first steps or practices one would adopt in the realm of preventive medicine is quarantine. The appli-cation of quarantine in wild animals is particularly difficult because of multiple species involvement coupled with different managemental practices, transfer and tranship-ment of captive animals practiced between the zoos including pancontinental exchanges not withstanding less practised translocation. Besides varieties of diseases that may afflict the wild animals, the spectrum of which is vast, make the task truely challenging. It should be remembered that any newly procured wild animal and bird for a zoo could be a potential source of pathogenic microbes or parasites to an apparently healthy premises and its inhabitants. Even though an animal may have been considered free from any infectious disease at its previous captive facility, there are possibilities of the animal having contracted and/or exposed to infectious diseases during transit. Inadequately disinfected transport vehicles, crates, ropes, beddings and other ancilliary materials which might have been earlier used for transpor-tation of diseased animals and the cargo handlers are potential modes of transmission of the contagion to other areas. Therefore, quarantine is an invaluable method to prevent the introduction of infectious diseases or parasites into a free zone /zoo and obviously forms a part and parcel of any disease control programme. When practised in letter and spirit it helps to prevent the (<b>re)</b> <b>entry</b> of certain dis-eases into a country where these diseases are either non existent or have been eradicated.

These include (<b>re)</b> <b>entry</b> capsules (both ballistic and lifting) and lifting bodies such as ExoMars, EXPERT, ARV, CEV and IXV. The research programs {{are meant to}} enable technology and engineering capabilities to support {{during the next decade}} the development of affordable (possibly reusable) space transportation systems as well as hypersonic weapons systems for time critical targets. These programs have a broad range of goals, ranging from the qualification of thermal protection systems, the assessment of RCS performances, the development of GNC algorithms, to the full demonstration of the performance and operability of the integrated vehicles. Since the aerothermodynamic characteristics influence nearly all elements of the vehicle design, the accurate prediction of the aerothermal environment is a prerequisite for the design of efficient hypersonic systems. Significant uncertainties in the prediction of the hypersonic aerodynamic and the aerothermal loads can lead to conservative margins {{in the design of the}} vehicle including its Outer Mould Line (OML), thermal protection system, structure, and required control system robustness. The current level of aerothermal prediction uncertainties results therefore in reduced vehicle performances (e. g., sub-optimal payload to mass ratio, increased operational constraints). On the other hand, present computational capabilities enable the simulation of three dimensional flow fields with complex thermo-chemical models over complete trajectories and ease the validation of these tools by, e. g., reconstruction of detailed wind tunnel tests performed under identified and controlled conditions (flow properties and vehicle attitude in particular). These controlled conditions are typically difficult to achieve when performing in flight measurements which in turn results in large associated measurement uncertainties. Similar problems arise when attempting to rebuild measurements performed in "hot" ground facilities, where the difficulty level is increased by the addition of the free-flow characterization itself. The implementation of ever more sophisticated thermochemical models is no obvious cure to the aforementioned problems since their effect is often overwhelmed by the large measurement uncertainties incurred in both flight and ground high enthalpy facilities. Concurrent to the previous considerations, a major contributor to the overall vehicle mass of re-entry vehicles is the afterbody thermal protection system. This is due to the large acreage (equal or bigger than that of the forebody) to be protected. The present predictive capabilities for base flows are comparatively lower than those for windward flowfields and offer therefore a substantial potential for improving the design of future re-entry vehicles. To that end, it is essential to address the accuracy of high fidelity CFD tools exercised in the US and EU, which motivates a thorough investigation of the present status of hypersonic flight afterbody heating. This paper addresses the predictive capabilities of after body flow fields of re-entry vehicles investigated in the frame of the NATO/RTO - RTG- 043 Task Group and is structured as follows: First, the verification of base flow topologies on the basis of available wind-tunnel results performed under controlled supersonic conditions (i. e., cold flows devoid of reactive effects) is performed. Such tests address the detailed characterization of the base flow with particular emphasis on separation/reattachment and their relation to Mach number effects. The tests have been performed on an Apollo-like re-entry capsule configuration. Second, the tools validated in the frame of the previous effort are exercised and appraised against flight-test data collected during the Apollo AS- 202 re-entry...|$|E
