The most common design – the diamond interchange – has a limited capacity at the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> intersections, especially when the intersections are close together and the turning volumes are high. To address these problems, traffic engineers have developed the following innovative diamond interchange designs: the single-point interchange, roundabouts at the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> intersections, and the diverging diamond interchange. The single point interchange combines the two <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> intersections for a standard diamond interchange into a single intersection that is located typically at the freeway overcrossing or undercrossing. Modern roundabouts with yield control {{reduce the need for}} left-turn storage at the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> intersections. The diverging diamond interchange provides a crossover for the local street through traffic so that both left and right turns onto the freeway on-ramps do not cross opposing through traffic. With these three designs, the interchange would nearly maintain its existing footprint so that the right-of-way impact is reduced compared to typical high volume configurations such as the partial cloverleaf interchange or interchanges with direct connector ramps. This paper compares and contrasts {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the three innovative diamond interchange designs according to traffic operations, traffic safety, and construction cost. Using a case study, the three innovative designs are applied to demonstrate these advantages and disadvantages...|$|E

This data-driven paradigm, coupled {{with the fact that}} approximately 40 percent of traffic crashes in the U. S. occur at intersections, has led to substantial research focusing on intersections. This study focuses on three areas of intersection safety: vehicular crashes, pedestrian and cyclist crashes, and crashes near ramp-terminal intersections. The impact of geometric characteristics on vehicular crashes at intersections using five years of crash data at an aggregate and disaggregate level. The within sample predictive ability of negative binomial models estimated using aggregate crash data (with empirical Bayes methodology) was compared to that of a disaggregate model estimated using a site-specific random effects negative binomial framework. Pedestrian and cyclist crashes are often difficult to model on a large scale as exposure information is typically not collected or maintained by road agencies. To this end, the characteristics affecting pedestrian and cyclist crashes at intersections have been examined using census tract-level commuter information from the American Community Survey in lieu of observed pedestrian and cyclist volume. Finally, <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> intersections provide important points of connection between restricted access roadways (such as interstates) and adjacent land. The safety performance along the corridors adjacent to the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> intersections {{is directly related to the}} proximity between the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> and access points such as driveways and intersections.

Conversely, diverging lanes allow the drivers to slow down their vehicle enabling them to enter the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> conveniently. The length of the speed-change lane should be in optimum design {{to ensure that the}} drivers are allowed to make appropriate lane changes. AASHTO (2004) provides a minimum merging lane length for entrance terminals and also a minimum diverging lane length by considering the design speed of <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> and design speed of highway main stream without considering flow rates of influenced area. This research proposed a novel merging and diverging model using statistical platform called Minitab to predict merging and diverging lane lengths, respectively based on macroscopic parameters for Malaysia road traffic conditions.

40|$|Localized {{bottlenecks}} can {{be created}} when large volumes exiting a freeway are destined to turn left at the intersecting cross street. Retiming the signal at the intersection to address the left-turn congestion may worsen congestion for the crossing arterial street. One solution to reduce delay and queuing {{is to keep the}} left-turning traffic on a collector-distributor road past the cross street and then have the traffic use a loop ramp to access the cross street. The loop ramp configuration is a viable alternative when sufficient right-of-way is available to accommodate the loop roadway. The loop design converts a stop or signal-controlled left-turn movement at the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> into a merge or yield-controlled movement on a loop ramp. Collector-distributor roads can be used in conjunction with loop ramps to provide a speed change area for vehicles traveling between the intersecting streets. Target Market The provision of loop ramps for left-turning movements should be considered at locations where high left-turn volumes exist and sufficient right-of-way exists (or can be acquired) for the construction of the ramp. Two locations where loop ramps are considered include signalized freeway service interchanges and arterial intersections with heavy left-turn volumes. Signalized Freeway Service Interchanges The accommodation of high-volume left-turn movements can significantly affect the operations of a signalized intersection. These movements can be removed from the signalized <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> if a loop ramp is provided.

The safety analysis focuses on the impacts of different exit ramp types for freeway diverge areas and different factors contributing to the crashes that occur on the exit ramp sections. The operational analysis is based mainly on simulations by TSIS-CORSIM. Different ramp effects and guidance for selecting optimal exit ramp type are concluded. Issues related to ramp sections and crossroad sections are also demonstrated. Minimum ramp length and minimum distance between <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> and downstream or upstream intersections are calculated. The operational analysis was conducted to determine different ramp effects and to provide guidance for selecting optimal exit ramp type. Comparisons of the operational performance {{of different types of}} exit ramps are made to present a method for choosing the optimal one. Some methods of evaluation (MOEs) are used to approach this objective, such as number of lane changes, average speed, delay time, etc. Data collection at 24 sites in Florida was conducted, and traffic simulations by TSIS-CORSIM were applied for analysis. Mathematical models were built to evaluate different impacts of these ramps based on simulations. All impact analysis is concluded to summarize a model for optimal exit ramp selection.

In particular, the original Highway 401 /Holt Road interchange, located approximately 40 km east of Toronto and serving as the primary access route for employee traffic {{into and out of}} the DNGS, was in need of significant upgrade and improvement in advance of commencing the refurbishment. The original interchange provided partial access to the highway only, while an intersection between an adjacent service road and the eastbound off-ramp was considered both unconventional and potentially hazardous to drivers unfamiliar with the unique configuration. Further, the original Holt Road underpass structure precluded the necessary capacity additions required along both the crossing road and Highway 401 through the interchange. Consequently, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) hired AECOM to provide Preliminary and Detail Design services for upgrading of the Highway 401 /Holt Road interchange to address both the existing concerns and meet the future requirements of the area. The recommended design included provision of roundabouts at both the north and south <b>ramp</b> <b>terminals,</b> and a third successive multi-lane roundabout at a service road directly south of the interchange.

40|$|Service {{interchange}} ramp terminals provide access {{from the local}} highway or urban street system to the freeway. In urban areas, the ramp terminals at the arterial road are usually signalized for separation of all high-volume conflicting movements. If right-turn or other movements exiting from the ramp terminals are high, a free right-turn lane, which improves operations for right-turn and through exiting traffic, is sometimes provided at the ramp terminals with an exclusive lane for right-turn vehicles on a departure leg. If the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> is closely followed by the next downstream intersection, weaving maneuvers will occur since some vehicles make a right turn at the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> and make a left turn at the downstream intersection. These weaving vehicles usually slow down or stop on the free right-turn lane {{in order to find}} an acceptable gap in the arterial road traffic. These slowing or stopping vehicles may cause safety and operational problems. This research evaluates the effect of these weaving maneuvers on the operations of a free right-turn lane at the ramp terminals. To provide a means for evaluating free right-turn lane operations, a linear regression model was developed to predict the delay on the free right-turn lane caused by stopped or slowed vehicles planning on making a weaving maneuver. The variables for this model were arterial through volumes, weaving volumes, number of lanes, and ramp spacing within the interchange. The regression model was based upon the results of the CORSIM traffic simulation model that was calibrated using field data obtained from the study site in College Station, Texas. Once the predicted model was developed, the model validation was performed using the field data to check the accuracy of its prediction. A statistical measure was performed for quantifying the difference between the observed and predicted delay on the free right turn lane. From the research results, it was concluded that the weaving maneuvers influence the operation of a free right-turn lane and cause delay on the free right-turn lane...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{conventional}} {{understanding is that}} roundabouts {{have the potential to}} improve safety at intersections, particularly by reducing more severe crash types, there is limited knowledge on their safety impacts when utilized as part of an interchange system. This research utilizes multiple years of crash, traffic, and geometric data across a variety of roundabout interchange sites in Missouri to develop a two-level Empirical Bayes (EB) safety analysis at the project (entire interchange) and site-specific (<b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> only) levels. The results were then aggregated for both single-lane and dual-lane roundabout terminals. The project-level results for single-lane sites showed a decrease in fatal/injury crashes (FI) by 20. 3 percent, property damage only (PDO) crashes by 26. 0 percent and total crashes by 24. 5 percent. The site-specific results for single-lane roundabout terminals indicated a reduction of FI crashes by 32. 8 percent, PDO crashes by 23. 1 percent, and total crashes by 24. 4 percent. At the project-level, dual-lane roundabouts were shown to reduce FI crashes by 2. 3 percent while increasing PDO and total crashes by 16. 9 percent and 12. 2 percent, respectively. The dual-lane site-specific results indicated an increase in FI crashes by 34. 7 percent, PDO crashes by 53. 9 percent, and total crashes by 50. 0 percent at the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> specifically. This analysis directly compares observed crash data after roundabout implementation to the expected number of crashes over that time period if the roundabout were never constructed. Therefore, this indicates that single-lane roundabouts performed significantly better than their original configurations, while the dual-lane roundabout terminals were shown to be less-suitable for certain applications. Additionally, it was found that a high proportion of the roundabout crashes occurred at the exit ramp approach legs; this was illustrated in the collision diagrams and crash type distributions that were produced for the common observed crashes at both single and dual-lane roundabout terminals. As a separate part of this thesis research, an improved calibration of the Highway x Safety Manual safety performance functions of four facility types was performed using data from 2012 - 2014 to calibrate for local Missouri conditions.

40|$|AbstractBased on past studies, exit <b>ramp</b> <b>terminals</b> are {{the common}} {{locations}} for drivers {{to enter a}} physically separated highway in the wrong direction. Currently, many drivers, especially nonlocal drivers, often rely on voice-guided navigation apps and Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to navigate their routes on and off freeways. A few studies have reported that GPS devices sometimes give drivers wrong information and cause wrong-way entry into a freeway, especially at some confusing interchanges, such as partial cloverleaf and compressed diamond interchanges. The access points located close to exit ramps may also cause a problem for GPS devices in sending accurate voice-guidance. It is unknown if current GPS devices are capable of properly informing drivers regarding turning movements in advance of exit <b>ramp</b> <b>terminals</b> at some common interchanges. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the most commonly used GPS devices/navigation apps to identify existing problems and their potential for reducing wrong-way driving (WWD) incidents at interchange terminals. Field experiments were conducted at 10 common freeway interchanges or interchanges with nearby access driveways in the state of Alabama. Results show that most GPS devices have difficulty in providing correct guidance when the spacing between an access point and an exit ramp is less than 300 feet. Our comparison of five different GPS devices used on the same routes reveals that navigation apps have more limitations in guiding drivers than stand-alone GPS devices. Recommendations are offered to help GPS mapping companies improve their devices or add new features to reduce the occurrence of WWD...|$|R

Several traffic operational problems are routinely being experienced at {{one of the most critical}} elements in the highway system, i. e., grade-separated interchanges. A concern among many practicing engineers is arterial weaving, particularly between the interchange <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal</b> and a closely spaced downstream signalized intersection. High turning volumes and the close spacing between ramp terminals generally associated with interchanges in urbanized areas can create severe operational problems on the cross street. One of the more important factors in determining the level of service of a signalized intersection is the quality of progression along the arterial. The quality of progression is expressed by a progression factor (PF). Simulations were conducted using TRAF-NETSIM to observe the effect of progression on the ramp capacity which showed that the ramp capacity was affected by the quality of progression. The study section consisted of an arterial having an off-ramp on the upstream and a downstream intersection at a distance of 600 feet. There was no signal at the downstream intersection. The ramp traffic, having yield control, made a right turn on to the arterial and then made a left turn at the downstream intersection. All the arterial through traffic was made to go through the downstream intersection without making any turns. Both the default TRAF-NETSIM and Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) recommended decile gap distributions were analyzed. The effect of random flow along the arterial on ramp capacity was studied and a negative exponential regression model was developed to compute ramp capacity for one, two and three lane arterials. Though the trends were found to be similar, due to lower (better) gap acceptance criteria of the HCM recommended decile gap distribution, the ramp capacity while using this distribution was better. The effect of progressed flow on ramp capacity was then studied. It was observed that the variation in ramp capacity for different PF increased with an increase in volume to capacity ratios. Adjustment factors were developed to determine the ramp capacity for different PF given the ramp capacity for random flow...|$|E

In order to continue improving roadway safety, different approaches such as alternative designs have been considered. Alternative designs for roadway facilities include J-turn for minor roads and high-speed expressway intersections, the Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI) for freeway interchanges, or red light cameras for signalized intersections. There is limited research evaluating the safety effectiveness of recently implemented alternative designs and enforcement strategies. This dissertation focused on developing jurisdiction specific crash prediction models, calibrating existing models, and applying rigorous statistical methods to study the safety effectiveness of these new alternative treatments. This dissertation found that the DDI design replacing a conventional diamond decreased crash frequency for all severities. Fatal and injury (FI) crashes experienced a 62. 6 percent reduction. Property damage only (PDO) crashes reduced by 35. 1 percent and total (TOT) crashes decreased by 47. 9 percent. The collision diagram analysis of the DDI showed that the top two crash types were: 1) rear end collisions between right turning movements on the exit ramp at the intersection, and 2) rear end collisions on the outside crossroad approach leg to the <b>ramp</b> <b>terminal.</b> The DDI design traded a severe crash type, right angle left turn crash, with less severe rear end, sideswipe, and loss of control crash types. Wrong way crashes inside the crossroad between ramp terminals accounted for 4. 8 percent of the FI crashes occurring at the DDI. This dissertation also examined the DDI safety effect on two adjacent facilities: speed change lanes and major signalized intersections. There is no strong evidence that DDIs impacted the safety of adjacent roadway facilities, either positively or negatively. Another alternative intersection design studied in this dissertation was the J-turn intersection. The safety evaluation of the implementation of the J-turn replacing two-way stopcontrolled intersections was effective at decreasing FI crashes by 63. 8 percent and TOT crashes by 31. 2 percent. The collision diagram analysis showed that the most recurrent crashes were sideswipe with 31. 6 percent and rear end with 28. 1 percent on the main road. Red light running was also evaluated in this dissertation. The implementation of red light running cameras in Missouri resulted in a reduction of FI crashes by 7. 4 percent and increase in PDO crashes by 3. 8 percent. Additionally, right angle crashes were reduced across all severities, including 14. 5 percent for FI crashes. Rear end crashes increased by 16. 5 percent overall. The crash cost benefit results showed a positive net economic benefit of $ 35, 269 per site per year in 2001 dollars (approximately $ 47, 000 in 2015 dollars). It translated into an overall 5. 0 percent economic crash cost benefit. In addition to roadway safety, this dissertation also evaluated airfield safety. In the field of aviation, runway incursions are the incorrect presence of and aircraft, vehicle or person on an active runway designated for takeoff and landing. Runway incursions can result in property damage or loss of life through incidents leading to aircraft collisions or avoidance maneuvers. Efforts are on the rise {{to reduce the risk of}} runway incursions at airports. However, guidance is mostly qualitative and does not provide specific quantitative measures to predict runway incursion frequency and evaluate the effectiveness of treatments. This dissertation adapted statistical roadway safety modeling to airport airfield operations. The transferability of roadway safety modeling theory was possible because airfield operations share similar measures of exposure and hazard concepts. Thus, models were developed to estimate runway incursion frequency for hub airports in the United States.

The paved center median was replaced with a concrete barrier median, and the speed limit raised to 65 mph. This project was completed in late 2013.|$|R
50|$|The {{total area}} of the Salgado Filho Airport is about 3,805,810.04 m² with 142,750 m² of <b>ramp</b> area. <b>Terminal</b> 1 has 37,600 m² and 16 gates with jetways. Terminal 2 has 15,540 m². In front of {{terminal}} 1 there is a carpark with 1,440 places. Terminal 1 is the first facility in Latin America with a shopping mall.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{improvements}} {{include the}} reconstruction of the airline <b>ramps</b> near the <b>terminal</b> and a new, expanded public parking lot. The new lot has 731 covered parking spaces and escalator access to the upper level.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} commercially {{available}} traffic simulation packages that {{are able to}} model the full range of interchange <b>ramp</b> <b>terminals.</b> Each of these packages has pros and cons for simulating various types of interchanges and traffic control plans. Previous research has studied specific simulators in terms of their capabilities for simulating single urban point interchanges (SPUIs) and diamond interchanges. There is no guidance provided however on how to generally select appropriate simulators based on their capabilities and internal algorithms for analyzing specific interchange design and control scenarios. This paper focuses on identifying the elements that should be available in a simulator in order to evaluate a specific interchange scenario (including type, geometry and traffic control characteristics). The paper does not identify all the specific packages that are appropriate for a specific scenario because these evolve constantly; even though the current version of a package may not support a particular function, future versions of that package may incorporate it. Thus, identifying the most appropriate package would very quickly become obsolete. It is up to the analyst to examine whether a particula...|$|R
50|$|On December 21, 2016 {{at exactly}} 6:00 AM (PST), the Entertainment City-NAIA Road-SLEX-Skyway segment (including the access <b>ramp</b> {{connecting}} to <b>Terminal</b> 3) {{of the airport}} expressway was opened to all motorists because of the Christmas rush.|$|R
50|$|A new {{terminal}} was inaugurated in 2002, comprising car park, motorway access <b>ramps,</b> and four-story <b>terminal</b> building, with 12 gates. The airport regained its international status when flights to Caracas began. An inter-island domestic area was opened in 2005.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the design of}} foundations to support marine structures. Such structures include dolphins, wing walls, wharfs, terminal structures and docks, pedestrian <b>ramps,</b> and <b>terminal</b> buildings. Other than the pedestrian <b>ramps</b> and <b>terminal</b> buildings, these structures must handle ship impact loads and wave loads. While this may affect the load groups required, the foundation designs and resistance factors required {{are the same as}} for other transportation facilities. Therefore, Chapter 8 shall be used for foundation design for marine structures, other than for terminal buildings, in which case the IBC (2003) should be used as the basis for foundation design. 18. 2 Design Philosophy Normally, structures subject to ship impact loads are designed to fully resist those loads. However, for ferry terminals, the greater risk in terms of financial loss and potential loss of life is the potential to damage the ship. Therefore, ferry terminals subject to ship impact loads need to be designed to be flexible enough to slow down the ship without damaging the ship. If foundation failure occurs, the choice is to have the foundation fail before the ship is damaged. This requires that foundation element...|$|R
50|$|Adjacent to {{the main}} <b>terminal</b> <b>ramp,</b> the 50-acre north cargo ramp {{is home to the}} Rockford Regional Air Hub of UPS Airlines that was {{constructed}} in 1994. The largest ramp at the airport, it has parking spaces for up to 40 jet aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{handling}} of freight {{at the station}} {{is not subject to}} restrictions. A crane, a <b>terminal</b> <b>ramp</b> and side ramps and a 40 tonne weighbridge were formerly available for freight traffic. Freight traffic was discontinued in 1976. A few years later, however, a container terminal was built.|$|R
