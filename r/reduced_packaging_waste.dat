40|$|Uncorrected proofCurrently, mainly non-biodegradable petroleum-based {{synthetic}} polymers {{are used}} as packaging materials for foods, because of their availability, low cost and functionality. However, biodegradable/edible films {{can be made from}} polysaccharides, proteins and lipids without the environmental issues of petroleum-based polymers and with the additional advantage of being available from renewable sources or as by-products or waste-products from the food and agriculture industries. Although these sources are not enough, by far, to replace the synthetic polymers/films, they can help in <b>reducing</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>wastes</b> and can replace them in specific applications. Proteins have the extra advantage of allowing a wider range of functional properties than polysaccharides and lipids. This is conferred by their composition based on combinations of 20 different amino acids, which usually allows high intermolecular binding. This chapter starts by describing the main protein sources used in packaging materials, followed by a section dealing with materials processing and characterization. The chapter ends with an overview of current and foreseen applications. Nanotechnology applications through the utilization of materials at the nano-scale size in protein-based films are a valuable alterative for the improvement of the properties of packaging materials (water vapour transmission, mechanical, thermal). In particular, nanofilms and multi-nanolayer films constitute promising solutions for food applications using protein-based materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a process to develop a multi-material {{paperboard}} based laminate carton and membrane. This includes replacing the existing paperboard-polyethylene-foilpolyethylene structure used in the Foldcan. The new structure must meet the current barrier requirement without contaminating the pulp and finished paperboard. Standard requirements of repulpablility for recycled paperboard mills must aslo be met. Research has been conducted to identify all current materials. Potential replacement material for traditional, commonly laminated materials as well as newly developed materials have been studied. A possible new paperboard based lamination which could be easily separated and recycled by all recycled paperboard mills may be successful!. The research concluded that two development paths would be followed. The first path using a material made of flexible glass. This new material is the best candidate for barrier materials but will not be commercially available in the U. S. A. until 1 994. The second path using a material made with metallization. This structure will prove other aspects of a lamination including bond, sealability and machineability. Ultimately the metilization will be replaced with flexible glass.

40|$|New {{bio-based}} {{materials have}} been exploited to develop biodegradable and edible films {{as an effort}} to extend shelf life and improve quality of food while <b>reducing</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>waste.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate physicochemical properties of k-carrageenan/locust bean gum (k-car/LBG) films with different bcarotene emulsion concentrations. To prepare oil-in-water emulsions, b-carotene (0. 03 % v/v) was dissolved in mediumchain triglycerides (MCTs), and the solution was mixed (1 : 9 v/v) with a pectin solution (3 % w/v) as emulsifier. Film forming solutions were prepared by adding b-carotene emulsion (0 - 3 % w/w) into the k-car/LBG solution (40 / 60 % w/w) with 0. 3 % (w/v) of glycerol. Films with different b-carotene concentrations were characterized in terms of optical, mechanical and barrier properties and compared with control films without bcarotene. The results suggested that mechanical, physical and barrier properties of k-car/LBG films were influenced by the presence of b-carotene. Results showed that addition of b-carotene to the k-car/LBG films studied resulted in significant decrease (p< 0. 05) in water vapour transmission rate values. Film opacity values (ranging from 4. 9 to 12. 5 %) increased when b-carotene was incorporated to the film. Therefore, b-carotene emulsions have potential to be used as a natural additive on kcar/LBG films, particularly in the food packaging industry...|$|R

Specifically: (1) Were the consumers aware of and {{in agreement with the}} environmental benefits of a recycled paper scoop versus the current plastic scoop? (2) Did consumers consider a recycled paper scoop as an acceptable replacement for the current plastic measuring scoop? The implementation of a recycled paper scoop would <b>reduce</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> by approximately 20 % by weight and a significant source reduction through decreased consumption of raw materials. Additionally, it would provide a substantial cost savings of approximately $ 30 M USD annually. The recycled paper scoop consisted of 50 % of post industrial (external) recycled fibres, 40 % of post consumer recycled fibres and 10 % of virgin fibres and internal waste sources. The 10 % virgin fibres and internal sources was used to help increase the board strength and improve printability. The TAPPI (1989) test methods were used in the selection of the paperboard grades in meeting the performance requirements of the paper scoop application. The results of the home performance test indicated that a recycled paper measuring scoop was not an acceptable replacement for the plastic measuring scoop. Although there were positive ratings on the recycled paper scoop, they related to generalities and environmental preference.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{describe}} the waste produced by and environmental implications of individual cigarette consumption (filter tips, packages, and cartons) and tobacco manufacturing.  STUDY SELECTION—All available articles and reports published since 1970  related to cigarette consumption and production waste were reviewed.  DATA SOURCES—Global cigarette consumption data {{were used to}} estimate cigarette butt and <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> quantities. Data from the Center for Marine Conservation's International Coastal Cleanup Project were used to describe some environmental impacts of tobacco-related trash. Data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Toxics Release Inventory and reported global cigarette consumption totals were used to estimate waste production from cigarette manufacturing.  DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS—In 1995, an estimated 5. 535  trillion cigarettes (27   675 million cartons and 276   753 million packages) were sold by the tobacco industry globally. Some of the wastes from these products were properly deposited, but {{a large amount of}} tobacco consumption waste ends up in the environment. Some is recovered during environmental clean-up days. For the past eight years (1990 - 1997), cigarette butts have been the leading item found during the International Coastal Cleanup Project; they accounted for 19. 1 % of all items collected in 1997.  The tobacco manufacturing process produces liquid, solid, and airborne waste. Among those wastes, some materials, including nicotine, are designated by the EPA as Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) chemicals. These are possible environmental health hazards. In 1995, the global tobacco industry produced an estimated 2262  million kilograms of manufacturing waste and 209  million kilograms of chemical waste. In addition, total nicotine waste produced in the manufacture of reduced nicotine cigarettes was estimated at 300  million kilograms.  CONCLUSIONS—Laws against littering relative to cigarette butts could be better enforced. Additional taxes might be levied on cigarette products that would then be directed to environmental clean-up efforts. The tobacco industry should improve the biodegradability of filters, <b>reduce</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>waste,</b> and educate its customers. Worksites and public buildings should be encouraged or required to supply appropriate disposal mechanisms at all building entrances. Public awareness campaigns about the magnitude and prevention of cigarette consumption waste could be developed through partnerships among environmental groups, health organisations, and environmental protection agencies. Tobacco production waste should be a source of concern and regulation by governments throughout the world; it contains numerous chemicals which may be considered health hazards, {{not the least of which}} is nicotine produced in the manufacture of low-nicotine cigarettes.    Keywords: tobacco waste; litter; environmental impac...|$|R
40|$|Purpose This {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the environmental impacts of stakeholder-driven sustainable purchasing policies in institutional settings. Design/methodology/approach The research is framed using stakeholder and life cycle assessment (LCA) theories. The study uses a multi-method approach. Starting with interviews to understand the breadth of sustainability issues and significant food purchases facing institutional purchasing managers, the authors subsequently perform LCA of these various policies using the most popular food item in different categories. Findings From the interview results, the authors found that food purchasers focus predominately on cost, thus, are committed to food and packaging reduction. They are driven to buy local foods based on their consumer stakeholders but share their commitment to buying local products if the cost is appropriate. In the LCA of popular food items in multiple scenarios, avoiding food waste of various forms had significantly higher carbon emissions savings than packaging reduction or transportation minimizing (buy local) strategies. Research limitations/implications The sample relied solely on the perceptions of institutional purchasing managers in university dining services. Future research should involve collecting data from other stakeholder groups such as the customers themselves, institutional leaders, and in other types of institutional settings such as hospitals and government agencies. Practical implications The research provides managers with insights concerning the trade-offs between different sustainability objectives. In particular, findings show that reducing waste related animal protein has a bigger impact on environmental performance than many other popular sustainability objectives such as buying local or <b>reducing</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>waste.</b> Social implications The paper focuses on the purchasing trade-offs of buying local vs national food products, different packaging solutions, and food waste generation. These decisions offer some social benefits (improve the economic situation for local farms vs consolidated food producers) as well as multiple environmental benefits.

(Business Management) Abstract: Accelerated {{global warming}} and climate change, and the {{depletion}} of natural resources, {{have resulted in a}} need for persistent action from business in transforming practices so as to protect the environment. One important way organisations can do this is through green marketing. Green marketing is an ethical practice undertaken by engaged and responsible organisations that centres on manufacturing and selling products based on their ‘green’ attributes. This study aims at understanding, from a marketer’s perspective, factors that affect the firm adoption of green marketing strategies. The study deploys a qualitative research approach. In-depth interviews were held with 12 respondents who lead marketing strategies in prominent South African organisations. This was done in order to ascertain the factors that contribute to adoption of green marketing, from a marketer’s point of view. The interviews sought to investigate overall attitudes towards green marketing, and the various drivers and challenges that exist. The findings show that the key drivers of green marketing include a positive impact on reputation, customer interest shown (including increased interest in green issues on the part of millennials), government and legislation requirements, technology and access to information, as well as investor demand. Various challenges are also identified and these require mitigation if green marketing is to be adopted. These challenges include aligning green marketing practices with company goals and overcoming generally poor awareness of green marketing within the marketing community and amongst the customer base. The current state of the economy is also a challenge as, due to slow economic growth, businesses are {{more likely to engage in}} proven business practices and less likely to engage in green marketing. The findings also show that, where businesses in South Africa are actively engaged in sustainability strategies, they do so as a means to improve their processes so as reduce water use, reduce energy consumption, <b>reduce</b> <b>packaging,</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>waste</b> generation and increase recycling practices [...] ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Packaging</b> <b>waste</b> forms a {{significant}} part of municipal solid waste and as such has caused increasing environmental concerns, resulting in strengthening of EU Regulations in order to <b>reduce</b> amounts of <b>packaging</b> <b>waste.</b> Among other materials, a huge range of oil-based polymers is currently used in packaging applications. They are largely non-biodegradable and particularly difficult to recycle or reuse due to mixed levels of contamination and complex composites. In recent years, the development of biodegradable packaging materials from renewable natural resources (e. g. crops) has received increasing attention, particularly in EU countries. Significant progress has been made to produce biodegradable materials with similar functionality to that of the oil-based synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that, as the materials are from renewable resources and biodegradable, they would contribute to sustainable development and if properly managed would reduce their environmental impact upon disposal. This paper discusses the potential impact of biodegradable <b>packaging</b> materials on <b>waste</b> management in terms of landfill, incineration, recycle/reuse and composting. A comparison is also drawn to the oil-based polymer packaging materials. It is the view of the authors that biodegradable packaging materials are most suitable for single use disposable packaging applications where the post-consumer use packaging can be locally composted as a means of recycling the materials.

40|$|Article 18 of the Dutch Packaging Covenant {{mentions}} a {{monitoring system}} {{that will have to}} be set up to check on the progress made in realizing the objectives laid down in this Covenant. The RIVM's Laboratory for Waste Materials and Emissions was asked to carry out the output analyses as a part of this monitoring system for packaging materials. This report presents the results of the output analyses for 1994. It provides information on the amount, composition and destination of the <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> from the different categories (households, commercial and industrial sector) in 1994, with the accuracy of the data for the different categories indicated. The results for 1994 are compared with those from previous years (1986, 1991, 1992 and 1993). The amount of <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> originating in households (recycling excluded) has been measured for the last twenty years by means of sorting analyses. <b>Packaging</b> <b>waste</b> from the commercial and industrial sector for 1992 - 1994 was measured through the use of questionnaires; other methods were used for previous years. Taking into account the accuracy of the data for the different years, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Between 1993 and 1994 the total amount of <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> did not increase. (2) From 1986 till 1994 the total amount of <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> increased by approximately 15 percent. In 1986 the amount of glass in the deposit system rejected by industry was included. Comparing 1986 with 1993 and excluding the rejected glass for 1986, the total amount of <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> was seen to increase by approximately 18 percent. (3) For 1994 an interim target was mentioned in the Dutch Packaging Covenant, implying that the total amount of <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> in 1994 should not be higher than in 1991. Even when a possible overestimation for 1991 is taken into account, it is possible to conclude that the total amount of <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> did not increase between 1991 and 1994...|$|R

40|$|In this {{graduate}} thesis, Slovene and German <b>waste</b> <b>packaging</b> {{systems were}} described and analysed, from legislation through to recycling procedures in practice. European Union Directive 94 / 62 /ES dictates that {{member states should}} include certain <b>waste</b> <b>packaging</b> goals in their national legislation. These goals primarily relate to enforcement of <b>waste</b> <b>packaging</b> systems in all EU member states, and achievement of specific percentages of recycled <b>waste</b> <b>packaging</b> within specified time frames. Slovenia transferred the directive into its national legislation in 2006, with the regulation of <b>packaging</b> and <b>waste</b> <b>packaging.</b> Germany enacted the packaging ordinance (Verpackungsverordnung) in 1991 and harmonized it with the EU directive via enactment, in 1998. Germany introduced separate systems for household <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> using a dual system, according to which household <b>waste</b> <b>packaging</b> is separated with a special system. Slovenia does not separately treat household and industrial <b>waste</b> <b>packaging.</b> Data analysis highlighted {{a difference between the}} quantity of recycled <b>waste</b> <b>packaging</b> in Slovenia and in Germany; Germany recovers 24...|$|R
