5|$|The {{development}} team {{designed the}} online multiplayer component {{to be balanced}} and rewarding for new players while still offering something for experienced players. An early idea to implement air support (air strikes and attack helicopters) involved players fighting over special zones to access a trigger for air support against enemies. This idea was discarded because it discouraged the type of deathmatch gameplay they intended. The kill streak <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> was put in its place to encourage the improvement of player skills. Players were allowed to select weapons before matches to get accustomed to weapons more easily and minimize weapon hunting. Maps were designed primarily for deathmatch games—the developers felt such designs suited other types of gameplay as well. Map layouts were designed to minimize locations players could hide from enemy gunfire.|$|E

40|$|Recent work {{shows that}} both <b>reward</b> and {{punishment}} <b>systems</b> increase short-term cooperation in social dilemmas. Yet, {{a growing body}} of research finds that punishment systems generate a range of negative side effects, including an undermining of trust in fellow group members’ cooperative intentions. The present work asks whether <b>reward</b> <b>systems</b> can generate the same positive effects as punishment systems (increased cooperation) without the negative side effects (decreased interpersonal trust) or whether <b>reward</b> <b>systems</b> also lead to detrimental effects on trust. In two experiments we find that once removed, <b>reward</b> <b>systems,</b> like punish-ment systems, reduced trust to levels below a control group who never experienced sanctions. This research highlights the detrimental effects of punishment and <b>reward</b> <b>systems</b> on intra-group trust and thus shows that while <b>reward</b> <b>systems</b> can generate the same positive effects as punishment systems, they also generate the same negative side effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to, with the {{strategies}} of the organization and the preferences of the co-workers in mind, explore how <b>reward</b> <b>systems</b> can be designed in heterogeneous organizations.

The frame of reference deals with theoretical approaches on <b>reward</b> <b>systems</b> and is divided in the following sections, individual or group based, differentiated or not differentiated <b>rewards</b> <b>systems</b> and goals, measurements and rewards. These sections are highlighted from the following aspects, equity, implementation possibilities and finally environment. The theoretical discussion ends in the conclusion that heterogeneous organizations should have several different <b>reward</b> <b>systems,</b> but not if a restructuring process is in progress or the system becomes too costly. Furthermore <b>rewards</b> <b>systems</b> should have less strength and be more frequently updated in comparison to homogenous organizations.

25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a common {{neurological}} disorder characterized by a degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra {{and a loss of}} dopamine in the putamen. It is described as a motor disease, but it also produces cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The most common treatment is dopamine replacement therapy, which consists in the administration of levodopa (L-Dopa) or dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or ropinirole) to patients. Dopamine replacement therapy is well known to improve motor symptoms but its effects in cognitive and behavioral symptoms are more complex. Dopamine has been related to the normal learning of stimuli with behavioral and motivational significance, attention, and most importantly the <b>reward</b> <b>system.</b> In accordance with the role of dopamine in reward processing, addictive drugs stimulate dopamine release. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, the role of dopamine in the <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> and addiction has been proposed as the origin of DDS. Models of addiction have been used to explain how dopamine replacement therapy produces DDS. One of these models of addiction proposes that over the usage course of a drug there is a habituation to the rewarding that it produces at the initial stages. This habituation is thought to be dopamine mediated. With long-term administration of L-dopa the <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> gets used to it and needs higher quantities. As the user increases drug intake there is a loss of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum which acts in addition to an impairment in goal-direction mental functions to produce an enhancement of sensitization to dopamine therapy. The behavioral and mood symptoms of the syndrome are produced by the dopamine overdose.|$|E

25|$|When a {{cigarette}} is smoked, nicotine-rich blood passes from the lungs {{to the brain}} within seven seconds and immediately stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; this indirectly promotes the release of many chemical messengers such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, arginine vasopressin, serotonin, dopamine, and beta-endorphin {{in parts of the}} brain. Nicotine also extends the duration of positive effects of dopamine and increases the sensitivity of the brain's <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> to rewarding stimuli. Most cigarettes contain 1–3 milligrams of inhalable nicotine. Studies suggest that when smokers wish to achieve a stimulating effect, they take short quick puffs, which produce a low level of blood nicotine.|$|E
25|$|Expectancy {{theory has}} been shown to have useful {{applications}} in designing a <b>reward</b> <b>system.</b> If policies are consistently, clearly and fairly implemented, then the instrumentality would be high. If the rewards are substantial enough to be meaningful to an employee, then the valence would be also considered high. A precursor to motivation is that the employee finds the reward(s) attractive. In some instances, the reward or outcome might inadvertently be unattractive, such as increased workload or demanding travel that may come with a promotion. In such an instance, the valence might be lower for individuals who feel work–life balance is important, for example.|$|E

25|$|Some {{laboratory}} research demonstrate correlations between psychopathy and atypical responses to aversive stimuli, including weak conditioning to painful stimuli and poor learning of avoiding responses that cause punishment, {{as well as}} low reactivity in the autonomic nervous system as measured with skin conductance while waiting for a painful stimulus but not when the stimulus occurs. While {{it has been argued}} that the <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> functions normally, some studies have also found reduced reactivity to pleasurable stimuli. According to the response modulation hypothesis, psychopathic individuals have also had difficulty switching from an ongoing action despite environmental cues signaling a need to do so. This may explain the difficulty responding to punishment, although it is unclear if it can explain findings such as deficient conditioning. There may be methodological issues regarding the research. While establishing a range of idiosyncrasies on average in linguistic and affective processing under certain conditions, this research program has not confirmed a common pathology of psychopathy.|$|E
25|$|Addiction is a {{disorder}} of the brain's <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> which arises through transcriptional and neuroepigenetic mechanisms and occurs over time from chronically {{high levels of}} exposure to an addictive stimulus (e.g., morphine, cocaine, sexual intercourse, gambling, etc.).ΔFosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading {{to the formation of}} AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}} Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of addictive phenotypes has been noted to occur in preclinical studies.|$|E
