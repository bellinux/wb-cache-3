The samples were Ag and Ag+N hybrid ion implanted by using MEVVA (Metal Vapour Vacuum Arc) ion implantation technique with a fluence of 10 17 ions/cm 2, extraction voltage of 30 kV. Untreated and surface treated samples were investigated by Stopping andRange of Ions into Matters (SRIM), <b>Rutherford</b> <b>Back</b> <b>Scattered</b> Analysis (RBS), Attenuated Total Reflection - Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR/FT-IR) Spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, Optical Absorption Photospectroscopy (OAP), Thermo Gravimetry Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Optical Microscopy (OM), Micro-hardness and Contact Angle Measurement. The results of RBS analysis show that Ag ions were detected up to 32 + 15 nm after Ag implantation, and 42 + 15 nm after Ag+N implantation., underneath the surface. ATR- FTIR chemical characterization analyses results indicated that the effect of implantation on UHMWPE surfaces caused dehydrogenation of polymer with an increase of C. C bond formation which results in enriching the crosslinking carbon atoms on the surface. Optical Absorption Photospectroscopy and Raman spectrum suggests that the chemical structure of UHMWPE has changed after implantation. The characterization results showed that the ion bombardment induced an increase in the % crystallinity, onset and termination degradation temperatures of UHMWPE obtained by thermal analyses, an increase in hardness, and surface wettability and a decrease in roughness of the polymer. The surface topography results can be attributed to the implantation inducing surface roughness decreasing due to the better wettability properties of surfaces obtained after implantation. In conclusion, this study has shown that ion implantation represents a powerful tool on modifying key properties on UHMWPE surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Interfaces play a {{key role}} in dictating the {{long-term}} stability of materials under the influence of radiation and high temperatures. For example, grain boundaries affect corrosion by way of providing kinetically favorable paths for elemental diffusion, but they can also act as sinks for defects and helium generated during irradiation. Likewise, the retention of high-temperature strength in nanostructured, oxide-dispersion strengthened steels depends strongly on the stoichiometric and physical stability of the (Y, Ti) -oxide particles/matrix interface under radiation and high temperatures. An understanding of these interfacial effects at a fundamental level is important for the development of materials for extreme environments of nuclear reactors. The goal of this project is to develop an understanding stability of interfaces by depositing thin films of materials on substrates followed by ion irradiation of the film-substrate system at elevated temperatures followed by post-irradiation oxidation treatments. Specifically, the research will be performed by depositing thin films of yttrium and titanium (~ 500 nm) on Fe- 12 %Cr binary alloy substrate. Y and Ti have been selected as thin-film materials because they form highly stable protective oxides layers. The Fe- 12 %Cr binary alloy has been selected because it is representative of ferritic steels that are widely used in nuclear systems. The absence of other alloying elements in this binary alloy would allow for a clearer examination of structures and compositions that evolve during high-temperature irradiations and oxidation treatments. The research is divided into four specific tasks: (1) sputter deposition of 500 nm thick films of Y and Ti on Fe- 12 %Cr alloy substrates, (2) ion irradiation of the film-substrate system with 2 MeV protons to a dose of 2 dpa at temperatures of 300 °C, 500 °C, and 700 °C, (3) oxidation of as-deposited and ion-irradiated samples in a controlled oxygen environment at 500 °C and 700 °C, (4) multi-scale computational modeling involving first- principle molecular dynamics (FPMD) and coarse-grained dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) approaches to develop theories underlying the evolution and stability of structures and phases. Samples from Tasks 1 to 3 (above) will be rigorously characterized and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, Auger electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, <b>Rutherford</b> <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Expected outcomes of the experimental work include a quantitative understanding film-substrate interface mixing, evolution of defects and other phases at the interface, interaction of interfaces with defects, and the ability of the Y and Ti films to mitigate irradiation-assisted oxidation. The aforementioned experimental work will be closely coupled with multi-scale molecular dynamics (MD) modeling to understand the reactions at the surface, the transport of oxidant through the thin film, and the stabilities of the deposited thin films under radiation and oxidation. Simulations of materials property changes under conditions of radiation and oxidation require multiple size domains and a different simulation scheme for each of these domains. This will be achieved by coupling the FPMD and coarse-grained kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). This will enable the comparison of the results of each simulation approach with the experimental results...|$|R

Half (80) of the patients took simvastatin and half (80) received placebo. The lens was photographed with a Topcon SL- 45 slit lamp camera {{at the beginning and}} at 1  year intervals. A common lens nuclear area was used for measuring lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b>  RESULTS—Nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> increased with age and there was more pronounced scattering in women than in men.

Lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> increased during the study period independently of baseline <b>back</b> <b>scattering,</b> age, and sex for both groups.  CONCLUSION—Although no significant difference was found between the simvastatin and placebo groups, the currently available data are insufficient for exclusion of the possibility that taking simvastatin during a 3  year period increases nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b> However, a possible minor increase of nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> is clinically irrelevant considering known beneficial effects of simvastatin on coronary heart disease. ...|$|R
