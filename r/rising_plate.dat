Volcanoes near plate boundaries and mid-ocean ridges are built by the decompression melting of mantle rock that rises on an upwelling portion of a convection cell to the crustal surface.

40|$|The work {{outlined}} {{in this thesis}} was intended to study the grazing behaviour of lactating cows during winter, spring and early summer, {{and the effects of}} maize silage supplementation during winter. It also derived monthly <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> meter equations over the period of the experiments, in order to assist with the estimation of cow intake and sward characteristics. Supplementation influenced the quantity and relative proportions of grazing, ruminating and idling times. Total grazing times were 546 vs. 615 -min. /day, and total rumination times 403 vs. 333 -min. /day for supplemented and non-supplemented cows respectively. Substitution of pasture for maize silage occurred, with reductions in grazing time averaging 26 -minutes per kg DM eaten as maize silage. Rumination values per kg of total DM eaten were similar at 29 -minutes (supplemented) and 27 -minutes (non- supplemented). Intake rate of pasture was not affected by offering maize silage as a supplement, but grazing time was reduced. Cows preferred to graze during daylight hours, spending 47 - 57 % of daylight hours grazing irrespective of daylength. Grazing activity peaked after milkings, and before dusk. Autumn and spring calved cows were grazed together in two experiments {{in the spring and summer}} of 1998. Stage of lactation had no effect on bite rate, bite weight, and intake rate ot herbage. Grazing times were related to metabolic requirements, and grazing behaviour was similar for cows which had calved in autumn or in spring. Times for ruminating and grazing were similar for heifers and mature cows, with similar components of day and night-time grazing. Heifers have a lower intake rate (23 vs. 27 -g DM/min), and smaller bite weights (423 vs. 507 -mg DM/bite) without a faster bite rate (58 vs. 56 -bites/min). Heifers also ruminated for longer per kg DM eaten, with similar ruminating times to mature cows (380 vs. 380 -min/cow/day), despite their smaller daily pasture intake (12. 9 vs. 15. 3 -kg DM/cow). It is suggested that the grazing behaviour of heifers is influenced by social factors, such as their dominance position in a herd. Monthly <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> meter equations were derived between July 1998 and February 1999. When used to rank pastures for grazing order, the importance of the slope rather than the intercept was demonstrated.

The <b>rises</b> of <b>plate</b> spacing have effects to channel cross sectional area, channel velocity, equivalent diameter, and Reynold number at hot and cold fluid sides in PHE. Those parameters affect the total heat transfer area and total pressure drop that influence the PHE condenser performance. This paper investigated the detail effect of the plate spacing increments in the final total heat transfer area and total pressure drop design result. The plate spacing in design calculation method is varied and the other independent variables {{are assumed to be}} constant. The design was conducted by calculating condenser capacity at both sides and both zones, estimating overall heat transfer coefficient, and calculating heat transfer area and plate film coefficient. Analysis continued by calculating overall heat transfer coefficient that has small percent of error with the estimated overall heat transfer coefficient, calculating pressure drop, total plate number and total heat transfer area. The result of calculation shows that the <b>rises</b> of <b>plate</b> spacing increase the total heat transfer area and decrease the cold and hot fluid total pressure drop. The <b>rises</b> of <b>plate</b> spacing increase channel cross sectional area and equivalent diameter, and decrease channel velocity and Reynold number at zone 1 (without phase change) and zone 2 (with phase change).

A field {{experiment}} {{was established in}} northern Victoria {{in the autumn of}} 1999 to quantify the effects of renovating a 15 -year-old irrigatedperennial pasturewhichhad ahighpaspalumcontent [> 40 %drymatter (DM) ] in summer. The treatments were: (i) control, the existing pasture; (ii) oversown, in which the existing pasture was grazed, topped and direct drilled; and (iii) resown, in which the existing pasture was sprayed, cultivated and sown with a new pasture. The grass species used in both renovation treatments were perennial ryegrass, Italian ryegrass and tall fescue. The treatments were grazed by dairy cows when the perennial ryegrass had reached the 2. 5 – 3 leaf stage. Grazing of the resown tall fescue coincided with the resown ryegrass in years 1 and 2, but in subsequent years, resown tall fescue was grazed at a <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> meter height of 80 mm. All treatments were grazed to a residual pasture height of 40 – 45 mm, as measured with a <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> meter. Pasture consumption (measured as DM removed by dairy cows), in vitro DM digestibility (in vitro DMD) and crude protein (CP) contents were measured. Oversowing increased pasture consumption over the 4 -year period, compared with the control, by an average of 1. 1 t DM/ha. year when oversown once with perennial ryegrass and by 1. 6 t DM/ha. year when oversown annually with Italian ryegrass. This increase occurred principally during the winter–spring period for pastures oversown with both perennial (0. 7 t DM/ha) and Italian (1. 6 t DM/ha) ryegrass. Oversowing with perennial or Italian ryegrass did not affect the in vitro DMD or CP content of the pasture on offer. These results show that oversowing with either perennial or Italia...|$|E

Measurements of the variable feed offer at pasture plots with a <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> meter are relatively quick. They offer a data basis to improve grazing and pasture management.

Recent precision livestock farming developments have focused on high-rate monitoring of grazing animals to enhance livestock productivity and welfare. The evolution of grass resource during the grazing process is not being overlooked by graziers and researchers, but grass characteristics, such as height, dry matter content, productivity or density, are still measured using low frequency and sometimes destructive and time-consuming methods; such as quadrat, sward-sticks, <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> meters. This study investigated the potential of using 3 D cameras to assess sward physical characteristics. Main objectives were: (1) to define the correct way to capture images, particularly the camera position above the ground and, (2) to assess if differences in sward height were detectable. Couples of images differing in grass height were captured on the same spot with a 3 D camera at different above-ground heights (30, 40, 50 cm) on a ryegrass-white clover pasture. Pregrazing height was 15 cm and post-grazing sward was simulated by cutting at 2 cm. Histograms of intensity performed on greyscale images showed differences between pre- and post-grazing sward. As expected, overall darker pixels were observed for pre-grazing images (p< 0. 01) and whiter pixels for post-grazing images (p< 0. 01), indicating longer distances consistent with lower forage biomass. Images taken {{at a distance of}} 30 and 40 cm could identify these differences.

40|$|AbstractWhite clover (Trifolium repens) is an {{important}} legume for grazed grassland that can increase the profitability and environmental sustainability of milk production. Previous experiments on mown grass-clover plots suggest that low postgrazing heights (PGH) can increase sward clover content and herbage production. However, {{this has not been}} tested in actual strip or rotational grazing systems with dairy cows. Furthermore, lowering PGH in grass-only swards (typically perennial ryegrass without white clover) has previously been associated with reduced milk yields per cow. The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effect of PGH by dairy cows on clover content, herbage production, and milk production from strip-grazed grass-white clover swards in Ireland. Three target PGH treatments of 4, 5, and 6 cm were in place for entire grazing seasons (February to November) for 3 consecutive years (2007 to 2009). Each treatment had a mean of 21 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows that strip-grazed a mean annual area of 10. 2 ha. Postgrazing height was measured twice a day with a <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> meter, and cows were moved to the next strip once the target PGH was reached. Annual fertilizer nitrogen input was 90 kg of N/ha for each treatment. The PGH treatment did not significantly affect annual milk yield (6, 202 kg/cow), solids-corrected milk yield (6, 148 kg/cow), fat, protein, or lactose yields (265, 222, and 289 kg/cow, respectively), cow liveweight (592 kg) or body condition score (3. 01). The PGH treatment also had no significant effect on sward white clover content (196 g/kg). However, herbage production of both grass and clover were significantly higher with the 4 -cm PGH treatment compared with the 6 -cm treatment. Mean annual herbage yields were 11. 1, 10. 2, and 9. 1 t of organic matter (OM) /ha for the 4 -, 5 -, and 6 -cm PGH treatments, respectively. The lower herbage production in the 6 -cm PGH treatment resulted in lower annual silage production, greater housing requirements, and a substantially higher net silage deficit (− 1, 917 kg of OM/cow) compared with the 5 - or 4 -cm treatments (− 868 and − 192 kg of OM/cow, respectively).

Control (nil renovation) and medium (mulch and graze, spray with glyphosphate and sow) renovation treatments were common to all sites whereas minimum (mulch and graze, and sow) and full seedbed (graze and spray with glyphosphate and then full seedbed preparation) renovation were imposed only at some sites. Plots varied in area from 0. 14 to 0. 50 ha, and were renovated then sown in March or April 2000 and subsequently grazed by dairy cows. Pasture utilisation was estimated from pre- and post-grazing pasture mass assessed by a <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> pasture meter. Utilised herbage mass of the renovated treatments was significantly higher than control plots in period 1 (planting to August) and 2 (first spring) at the NSW site only. There was no difference among treatments in period 3 (first summer) at any site, and only at the WA and NSW sites in period 4 (March to July 2001) was there a response to renovation. As a result, renovation at the NSW site only significantly increased ryegrass utilisation over the whole experimental period. Ryegrass plant density was higher at the NSW, WA (excluding minimum renovation) and Tas. (excluding full renovation) sites 6 months after renovation but this was only sustained for 12 months for the minimum and medium treatments at the NSW and Tas. sites, respectively, presumably due to reduced competition from naturalised C 4 summer grasses [kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) and paspalum (Paspalum dilatatum) ] in NSW At the NSW, WA and SA sites, the original ryegrass plant density was low (< 35 plants/m 2) compared with the Tas. site where density was around 185 /m 2.

During walking, all cows were moved at the average walking speed of 55 m/min. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the effects of walking extra distances on the performance of grazing dairy cows in early lactation. A common daily herbage allowance (30 - 40 kgDM/cow/day) was given to both groups grazed in the same paddock, on equal areas separated by an electric fence. Milk production and composition, somatic cell counts, liveweight and condition score, reproductive performance and grazing behaviour were measured and analysed. Herbage intake was estimated directly using a <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> pasture meter and indirectly using chromic oxide technique (slow release chromium capsules; CAPTEC NZ., Ltd). The average dry matter intakes, as assessed by the pasture meter, were similar for the CT and the WK group being 16. 1 and 16. 5 kgDM/cow/day, respectively. Average daily yields of milk and milk solids for both groups were 25 litres/cow and 1. 9 kg/cow, respectively. There were no significant differences in milk yields, milk composition, somatic cell counts (SCC), or changes in liveweight and condition score between the two groups. However, the WK group did produce slightly less milk solids (by 2 to 3 %), and had slightly higher SCC than the CT group. No adverse effects on reproductive performance of cows in the WK group were observed. Although the WK group spent less time on the pasture by about 1. 5 hour per day, there was no significant difference in time spent grazing (GT) between both groups. Nevertheless, the WK group spent significandy less time standing (P< 0. 001) per day than the CT group, mainly because of less time spent standing/ruminating.

The aim {{of the study was to}} determine if strategic supplementation of lucerne hay will improve milk production, milk composition and the rumen environment of cows grazing high quality kikuyu/ryegrass during spring and receiving low levels of concentrate. Forty eight high producing Jersey cows were blocked and randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: control (no supplemental roughage), supplementation of 1. 0 kg lucerne hay and supplementation of 2. 0 kg lucerne hay after morning milking. Cows received 5 kg of dairy concentrate per day during milking. Cows grazed as one group and pasture was allocated to ensure a post grazing height of 10 - 12 on the <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> meter (5 - 6 cm). The average post grazing pasture height for the experimental period was 10. 83 ± 1. 68 (n= 73) on the RPM (5. 42 cm).

Milk fat and protein percentage was not affected (P > 0. 10) by supplementation of lucerne hay. The milk lactose content of cows receiving the control and 1 kg lucerne hay treatments were higher (P 0. 10) between treatments in overall mean pH, measured with either the logging systems or with the portable pH meters averaging 6. 18 and 6. 11 for cows receiving the control and the 2 kg lucerne treatment respectively.

In experiment 1, 42 cows grazed as seven separate groups of six cows on ryegrass pasture over a 2 -day period, and were fed 2 kg crushed barley grain/cow at morning and evening milking on the first day. On the second day, no concentrates were fed at morning milking and a different group of cows was removed at random from grazing and a rumen sample collected by stomach tube at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 h after commencement of grazing at 07 : 00 h. Sampling concluded before afternoon milking at 17 : 00 h. Rumen ammonia (NH 3) concentration peaked and pH fell to its lowest value between 7 and 9 h after cows commenced grazing. In experiment 2, 42 cows were stratified into three groups of 14 cows on the basis of milk and component yield, age, liveweight and calving date and randomly allocated within blocks to one of three treatments. Over a 10 -day adjustment period and a 21 -day experimental period, cows were given their daily pasture allocation of 13. 5 kg DM/cow (above 5 cm stubble height) either after morning milking, and fed crushed barley grain at morning and evening milking in the ratio of 3 : 1 kg/cow (Synch) or 1 : 3 kg (Asynch) or given their daily allocation of pasture after afternoon milking with barley fed at a ratio of 3 : 1 kg/cow (PM) in the morning and evening milking. Based on the results of experiment 1, the feeding schedule for the Synch group was predicted to more closely synchronise the availability of N from pasture and readily fermentable carbohydrates (RFC) from concentrates, in the rumen, compared to the Asynch cows. The comparison between Synch and PM groups was to determine the relative importance of 2 ̆ 7 synchrony 2 ̆ 7 compared to feeding pasture (afternoon) high in water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) content. The WSC content of ryegrass pasture sampled after morning milking (when the Asynch and Synch groups received their new pasture allocation) was 70 and 74 g/kg DM, respectively, compared to 124 g/kg DM for samples taken after afternoon milking (when the PM group received a new pasture allocation). Pasture dry matter intake (DMI) and in vivo digestibility of individual cows was determined by use of alkanes as inert markers, whilst group DMI was determined from pre- and post- grazing pasture mass estimated by <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> meter. Rumen samples were taken by stomach tube at 0, 3, 7 and 11 h after grazing commenced in the morning {{on the last day of}} the experiment. On this same day the...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to analyze the role of {{grassland}} in phosphorus (P) flows in mixed organic farms. The research farm of the Thünen Institute of Organic Farming, Trenthorst, located in northern Germany was used for the analyses. The farm converted to organic farming in 2001 and had no P-fertilizer import. Grassland-related P flows (by grazing and harvesting) were estimated with a specific method using a calibrated <b>rising</b> <b>plate</b> meter (DM = 100. 41 x h + 1 (r²= 0. 7549; n= 396)). Inner farm nutrient cycles were calculated with farm specific data for the dairy farm system for the years 2010 - 2012 based on a complete material flow model. The development of soil P characteristics of grassland and arable land after twelve years of organic farming was determined by P fractions, and the activities of phosphatases and dehydrogenase in the soil. The 116 ha sized farm showed deficits of 1, 105 kg P yr- 1 (7. 9 kg P ha- 1 a- 1 in permanent grassland and 10. 9 in arable land) which were supplied from soil P reserves. Maize (30. 5 kg P ha- 1 a- 1), grass-clover (23. 9 kg P ha- 1 yr- 1) and mixed faba bean and oats (19. 8 kg P ha- 1 a- 1) had the highest P uptake in cropland. At grassland, grazing intake by livestock was 15. 9 kg P ha- 1 a- 1 (± 2. 7, min. 9. 5, max. 20. 7). Grazing and feed conserves from grassland accounted for 29. 2 % of the P supply for the dairy cows and directly fed arable land with 64 kg P (average 1 kg P ha- 1 yr- 1). In arable land plant available P-contents in topsoils (0 - 30 cm) of the analyzed farm were still sufficient, but had decreased since converting to organic farming due to negative P balances. The readily available inorganic P fractions (H 2 O-P, NaHCO 3 -P) were also lower in 2013 than in 2001. The content of plant available P (CAL) in topsoils generally reduced from 65 mg kg- 1 over twelve years to 61. 3 mg kg- 1. In grassland between 2001 and 2013 the P (CAL) values reduced from 132. 0 to 107. 1 mg kg- 1. Above all, soil P mining has not yet endangered soil fertility, according to high P (CAL) -contents in the soils. Therefore, it might further serve as P reserve in the farm cycle for a limited time period. Forced biological P cycling on farms and integration of grassland P in fertilizing strategies might be part of a solution until safe systems of P recycling from the food chain in agriculture are installed, not only in organic farming. Knowledge transfer into practise and societal awareness for non-renewable resources – like P – needs to be raised. Thünen-Institut für Ökologischen Landbau, Trenthors...|$|E
