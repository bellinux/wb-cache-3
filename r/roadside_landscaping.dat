40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} provide an {{understanding}} of how human-induced changes in the economic sectors of agriculture and transport affect carabid diversity, potential carabidmediated biocontrol and predator-pest interactions. The research involved both observational and manipulative laboratory and field-based studies. Observational research consisted of two large-scale investigations of (1) the impact of Miscanthus and oilseed rape production (n= 45) and (2) the impact of horticultural and ecological based landscaping of roadside verges (n= 64). This research is the first record of carabid diversity, potential biocontrol and community assemblage with respect to bioenergy crop production and <b>roadside</b> <b>landscaping</b> in an Irish context and it is also an important addition to the limited knowledge of carabid populations in these ecosystems internationally. Manipulative work involved the examination of the role predator identity, diversity and biomass play in the suppression of pollen beetle larvae (an economically damaging insect pest of oilseed rape in Europe), using a novel experimental design called ‘simplex’. To complement this research, an additional field study on the impact of low and high oilseed rape pesticide management on carabid species richness and abundance, and crop yield, was also conducted. This research is a great contribution to the existing understanding of what constitutes the important components of predator biodiversity and expands the knowledge of the usefulness of carabid predators in the context of pollen beetle larvae control. In particular, the work shows that the abundance or biomass of beetles has an effect that is far larger than the effect of diversity on the capacity of beetles to consume prey. In turn, the field study showed that pesticide applications had little impact on yield, or carabid richness, but that carabid abundance/biomass declined drastically. The work provides compelling evidence that management practices erode the useful components of biodiversity that are essential for the delivery of biocontrol services...|$|E

40|$|The Pensacola Scenic Highway Foundation {{requested}} a Master Plan for the redesign of the Scenic Highway corridor that would beautify it, conserve it, {{and make it}} an asset to their community and an attraction for out-of-town visitors. The Pensacola Scenic Highway runs along the Escambia Bay Bluffs over the Escambia Bay. The project team made an initial site visit to Pensacola in May 2011 to assess the site and meet the client, then did site analysis and drafted conceptual designs for the corridor, its major entrance points, and the roadside City-owned properties Mallory Heights, Bay Bluffs Park, and Chimney Park. These designs were presented to the City in October 2011, along with preliminary research on mitigating ecological problems in the highway corridor, specifically invasive species outgrowth and erosion. Final designs based on stakeholder feedback from the October 2011 presentation were prepared for the client and presented in April 2012. The overarching theme of these designs was to build a visual identity for the highway that would resonate with motorists and be easily recognizable, yet unique. The final designs beautified park entrances, preserved existing environmental features, showcased sites of historical significance along the highway, improved <b>roadside</b> <b>landscaping,</b> added pedestrian and bike access along the roadway, and used native planting designs to accent park properties and major access points to Scenic Highway. Design proposals for a pedestrian path that would run {{along the length of}} Scenic Highway and a trail that would run along an active freight line along the coast of the bay were also prepared. The team also provided a comprehensive research report on how to suppress and remove the more prevalent invasive species found along Scenic Highway, and how best to implement erosion control measures along the bluffs and prevent further ecological degradation of the entire corridor...|$|E
40|$|Problem Drivmg in any {{situation}} where the available sight distance is less than that appropriate for the travel {{speed of the vehicle}} will naturally present a problem when a hazard occurs. A motorist is often forced to take some emergency action to avoid a potential accident. In most situations on the road there are many visual cues to give motorists an indication of an appropriate travel speed as well as conferring a perception of the speed actually being travelled. These may take the form of longitudinal lines on the road, warning signs or the general <b>roadside</b> <b>landscaping.</b> However, in fog these cues cease to be visible and motorists commonly drive at speeds well in excess of the available stopping distance, frequently unaware they are doing so having lost the cues that help create the perception of speed. This problem is obviously accentuated on higher speed roads such as divided carriageways where the only cues are to tell drivers they are on a high speed road and no apparent threats are available to prompt a lowering of speed. To address this there have been many attempts to provide Driver Aid Systems to warn motorists of the hazards they face. One such system was provided on the Waterfall - Bulli section of the F 6 in 1974. However the continued occurrences of multiple vehicle accidents culminating in a 66 vehicle event in 1986 suggested that the system may no longer be as effective as was originally intended. (No research was ever undertaken to assess whether the system actually met its objectives although this was unlikely, given the nature of the fog in the Bulli Tops area, the way the system operated and the fact a number of features of the original proposal were never actually installed). Proposed Solution Rather than simply replace a system which was no longer maintainable or visible in bad fog conditions with a similar system, a research project was proposed to examine changes in technology which had become available since the 70 s and to determine whether these could be used to develop a workable system. The new solution proposed a dynamic, site independent system which could monitor both the fog and the motorists and provide real-time advice to the motorist if vehicle speed was inappropriate to the conditions. Research Before developing a new system based purely on the theory, a trial site was selected and research undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the arrangement outlined. Over a three year period studies were undertaken on the characteristics of vehicles when travelling in various fog visibilities ranging from 250 m to under 50 m. The research was undertaken in three discrete stages; April - December, 1992, - characteristics of vehicles unaffected by any sign display January - April, 1993, - evaluation of the 1974 sign system modified to provide some limited dynamic information May, 1993 - December, 1994, - evaluation of an improved sign arrangement with full dynamic information provided on fog and speed where appropriate. The results showed that an independent dynamic sign display could be used which would be effective in modifying vehicle speed characteristics, particularly at times when the speeds were highest without the use of such a sign. Outcome As a result of the results of this research project, the RTA proceeded with the design and construction of a new Driver Aid System for the F 6 Waterfall-Bulli Freeway. The work involved a 3. 5 m contract with Telstra and was commissioned in 1996. A number a factors in the design were directly attributable to the findings of the research including: • the use of dynamic independent sites • incorporation into each site of fog detection equipment, speed detection and warning signs capable of displaying appropriate warning messages for individual motorists relative to the situation • location of the appropriate areas for the system to be located • use of flashing warning lights in association with each sign display Papers Published The following papers on this research have been published at various major Conferences: BRISBANE G.

40|$|Abstract: A primary {{responsibility}} of the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) is to maintain a highway right of way that is safe for the traveling public. Most often, this requires removal of trees, shrubs, and other fixed objects that may {{stand in the way}} of drivers leaving the highway. For many years, the department has fulfilled this responsibility by large scale clearing and mowing of a clear zone. Roadside management practices that maintain the right of way as parkland certainly make the road safe and visually pleasing, but provide little in the way of useful habitat for wildlife. The clear zone, occupying approximately 1 percent of the state’s land area, is a landscape that has much potential for providing nesting and foraging habitat for grassland bird species. Protection of the environment being another {{responsibility of the}} department, the NYSDOT needs to advance practices that promote wildlife use of habitats along the highway, while maintaining a safe and aesthetic roadside for the travelers.

40|$|The {{appropriately}} landscaped highway scenes may {{not only}} help improve road safety and comfort but also help protect ecological environment. Yet {{there is very little}} research data on highway length threshold with consideration of distinctive landscape patterns. Against this backdrop, the paper aims to quantitatively analyze highway landscape’s effect on driving behavior based on drivers’ physiological performance and quantify highway length thresholds under three typical landscape patterns, namely, “open,” “semiopen,” and “vertical” ones. The statistical analysis was based on data collected in a driving simulator and electrocardiograph. Specifically, vehicle-related data, ECG data, and supplemental subjective stress perception were collected. The study extracted two characteristic indices, lane deviation and LF/HF, and extrapolated the drivers’ U-shaped physiological response to landscape patterns. Models on highway length were built based on LF/HF’s variation trend with highway length. The results revealed that the theoretical highway length threshold tended to increase when the landscape pattern was switched to open, semiopen, and vertical ones. And the reliability and accuracy of the results were validated by questionnaires and field operational tests.

40|$|Traffic sign {{provides}} road {{users with}} the specified instruction and information to enhance traffic safety. Automatic detection of traffic sign {{is important for}} navigation, autonomous driving, transportation asset management, etc. With the advance of laser and imaging sensors, Mobile Mapping System (MMS) becomes widely used in transportation agencies to map the transportation infrastructure. Although many algorithms of traffic sign detection are developed in the literature, they are still a tradeoff between the detection speed and accuracy, especially for the large-scale mobile mapping of both the rural and urban roads. This paper is motivated to efficiently survey traffic signs while mapping the road network and the <b>roadside</b> <b>landscape.</b> Inspired by the manual delineation of traffic sign, a drawing strategy is proposed to quickly approximate the boundary of traffic sign. Both the shape and color prior of the traffic sign are simultaneously involved during the drawing process. The most common speed-limit sign circle and the statistic color model of traffic sign are studied in this paper. Anchor points of traffic sign edge are located with the local maxima of color and gradient difference. Starting with the anchor points, contour of traffic sign is drawn smartly along the most significant direction of color and intensity consistency. The drawing process is also constrained by the curvature feature of the traffic sign circle. The drawing of linear growth is discarded immediately if it fails to form an arc over some steps. The Kalman filter principle is adopted to predict the temporal context of traffic sign. Based on the estimated point,we can predict and double check the traffic sign in consecutive frames. The event probability of having a traffic sign over the consecutive observations is compared with the null hypothesis of no perceptible traffic sign. The temporally salient traffic sign is then detected statistically and automatically as the rare event of having a traffic sign. The proposed algorithm is tested with a diverse set of images that are taken inWuhan, China with theMMS ofWuhan University. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can detect traffic signs {{at the rate of}} over 80...|$|R
30|$|There {{are three}} {{important}} AVC countermeasures that we regard {{as important for}} the third research question concerning implications on planning practice: the radio message, wildlife fences and the <b>roadside</b> <b>landscape.</b> As discussed above, the radio message works so well because it provides a warning that is localised in time and space, and is thus very relevant to the driver. A practical difficulty is of course that directed warning messages requires accurate and timely information {{about the presence of}} animals close to the road. A less direct warning, such as a wildlife warning sign, is obviously easier to implement, but not as effective. To be effective in the planning phase, any implemented AVC countermeasure should be relevant enough for the drivers, by considering time/space localisation and by minimize the drivers’ habituation effect. Examples of such AVC countermeasures include mobile and/or variable message warning signs. Different designs {{can be used to make}} the warnings more effective in reducing vehicle speed. For example, it is possible to use moose decoys or large wildlife artworks along the road to increase the variation in warning design [24], but such AVC countermeasures are rarely implemented. To minimize the habituation effect, community-based geo-localized AVCs can be collected in an app that can be used while driving. Under such circumstances, it would be possible to receive warnings where many AVCs has taken place. In Sweden, the Swedish Council for the Prevention of Wildlife-Vehicle Accidents (SCPWVA) have developed a mobile app called “Viltolycka”, that makes it possible to receive active warnings on where along the route AVCs has occurred in the past. Even if the likelihood that an AVC will take place at the exactly same location is unknown, it is likely that the driver will increase his/her attention for wildlife on the road and decrease speed during longer distances. Hitherto, no studies have yet investigated driver behaviour when using AVC apps. The lasting effect over distance and consistent responses to directed radio messages shown in this study could however be used as an indication of what to expect in terms of AVC apps. When it comes to wildlife fences, there are two planning aspects that need to be considered, price and landscape impact. There are several ways to erect a fence along the road, all with a different impact on the landscape. Where there is forest close to the road, the fence can be erected a few metres beyond the forest edge, making the fence less visible to the naked eye. This approach may be positive in the sense that a less visible fence will avoid the issue with drivers feeling more secure [55]. Hidden fences may also have a touristic implication for visitors viewing the landscape, by not distorting their experiences of the countryside [56]. Such issues should be included in cost-benefit analyses as a decision support tool for transportation agencies, along with the direct benefit of the mitigation measures [13]. In an open landscape, e.g. in rural areas, this approach is obviously less applicable.|$|R
30|$|The raptor assemblages of {{the coastal}} plain and altitudinal grasslands are quite different. Despite these regions exhibiting similar species richness, they {{differed}} in species abundances. The regions differ in landscape features (e.g., relief and habitat availability) {{and the level of}} disturbance, and species-habitat relationships could explain differences in assemblage compositions. As regards the methods, despite the choice of survey method that depended on the objectives of the study, our results favor the use of point transects rather than strip transects to survey raptors in open <b>landscapes.</b> <b>Roadside</b> point transects may reduce bias due to differences in species detection caused by habitat features and in abundance estimates resulting from survey habitat being disproportional to their availability. Point counts may enhance the quality of the search for raptors in a surveyed area, increasing the detection probability. However, studies that compare roadside point transects with other methods, in other open landscapes around the world, are required to assess the generality of our findings.|$|R

Based on the assumed safety properties of modern freeways, parkways, and landscape enhancement features, researchers hypothesized that parkway or landscape-improved sections appear to be safer compared to parallel freeway sections or street sections before landscape improvements. In addition, researchers compared the safety performance of parallel sections of freeways and parkways in terms of fatal accident rates, and the safety performance of urban arterial road sections before and after landscape improvements in terms of crash rates. The findings of this study show parkway or landscape improved sections are significantly safer than the compared parallel freeways sections in pairs or street sections before the landscape improvement.

Mulch and compost from green waste material are used for <b>landscaping,</b> <b>roadside</b> revegetation and degraded land rehabilitation projects in northern Australia. A major concern {{is the presence of}} weed seeds, including the presence of seeds of the many declared weed species. Mulch can be pasteurised by microbiological activity and seeds destroyed by exposure to high temperatures for a sufficient duration. Information on lethal temperature and storage conditions was not available for weed species in the tropical conditions of the Northern Territory. This project determined the temperature, moisture and storage requirements to kill a range of weed seeds in mulch in Darwin. Seeds of Andropogon gayanus, Caryotis mitis, Centrosema molle, Hyptis suaveolens, Leucaena leucocephala, Mimosa pigra, Pennisetum pedicellatum, Pennisetum polystachion and Stachytarpheta australis were assessed. Seed viability and dormancy mechanisms were investigated to determine if viability could be assessed using germination after application of dormancy-breaking treatments. Seeds were then exposed to various temperature, moisture ans storage conditions in controlled temperature incubators and in experimental mulch piles. Under dry heat conditions, seeds could survive for three months at 70 °C, but significant mortality occured after 1 month if the seeds were stored at 80 °C. Under moist conditions mortality was acieved at lower temperatures. In the experimental mulch piles, significant mortality occured for some species even when stored for one week.

40|$|Transportation is the {{backbone}} of developing regional economies {{and the evolution of}} our civilization. Well planned road systems are essential to connect dispersed communities or cities. However, roads are one of the major destructive forces to regional ecosystems and the natural environment. The effects of roads on their adjacent ecosystems may include road kills, habitat fragmentation, barrier effect to animal movement, road edge effects, introduction of exotic species, pollution and noise, change of micro-climate, etc. This study undertakes a comprehensive survey of road kills in Kinmen (Taiwan) and analyzes their causes. The road crossing behaviors of animals have been utilized in deriving survival probability by employing Traffic Flow Theory. Two models, Traffic Flow Model and Linear Model, have been proposed in this study and comparisons of survey results and the models are also carried out. Comparing the survey results and predictions of models, both models yield similar results for moderate traffic flow and provide excellent agreement in predicting frequency of road kill of birds and small mammals. It is found that traffic volume, adjacent landscape and road condition are the major factors in road kills. Higher traffic volume near animals’ habitats always augments the probability of road kill, however <b>roadside</b> trees, adjacent <b>landscapes,</b> and road longitudinal slope may also affect the probability of successful crossing by small animals, especially birds. The barrier effect of roadside trees forces birds to fly between tree trunks and enter onto a collision course with oncoming vehicles, so that dense roadside trees may lead to higher bird casualties. On the other hand, roads with abrupt turns or steep longitudinal slopes may block the view of small animals and may be a significant factor in increasing the probability of being run over by vehicles.

DOI: 10. 1111 /j. 1467 - 954 X. 2006. 00638. xIn recent years social scientists have paid increasing {{attention to the}} complex relations between drivers and cars, drawing upon the writings of Bruno Latour, John Law, Donna Haraway and others to trace the materialities and practices associated with such hybrid or cyborg figures as ?human-car co(a) gents? (Michael, 2000 : 73), the ?car-driver? (Sheller and Urry, 2000 : 752; Lupton, 1999), and ?cason? (a conflation of car-person) (Michael, 2000 : 93; cf. Katz, 1999; Urry, 2000; B?hm et al., this volume). 1 As the accounts of these different writers suggest, while the normalized and individualized figure of the driver, and the mass-produced yet invariably customised vehicle, may appear to lie at the centre of these mobile assemblages, it is futile to attempt to understand the movements, politics, semiotics, emotions and ontological formations associated with driving by attempting (endlessly) to separate or purify these hybrid assemblages into constituent parts. In this chapter I argue that while academics can usefully examine the complex processes of hybridization, purification and distribution that are performed in acts of writing, talking about and doing driving, these associations, assemblages and social relations must be seen to extend far {{beyond the confines of}} the car (cf. B?hm et al., this volume; Urry, 2000, 2003). As Sheller and Urry (2000 : 447) have shown, the diverse ?scapes? associated with car travel ? including motorways, flyovers and service areas ? are intricately related to the ?machinic hybridization of the car driver?, as are the heterogeneous networks which Urry terms the ?global fluid? of automobility (Urry, 2003 : 69). Social scientists have paid particular attention to the regularized practices, movements and spaces associated with driving, but in this chapter I examine how {{the emergence of a new}} type of driving environment in Britain ? with the construction and opening of the M 1 motorway in the late 1950 s ? led a range of cultural commentators and experts to attempt to predict, measure, problematize and effect changes on the movements of drivers and vehicles.

Furthermore, on an international level, even less research has been committed to examining the removal of paved roads despite the fact the road development has been identified in the literature {{as one of the}} major causes of habitat fragmentation across landscapes worldwide. In the course of new road planning and design, sections of old road pavement may be abandoned due to (1) the establishment of a new road ecosystem; (2) the realignment of an existing road; (3) the By-Pass of traffic ‘hotspots’; and (4) required road closure for environmental reasons. Occasionally the extent of old road pavement is large enough to significantly extend native habitats adjacent to an old road system. For this reason, road decommissioning can potentially: (1) restore ecological integrity, and function of semi-natural ecosystems (including soil); (2) provide compensatory habitat; (3) maintain and improve quality of existing adjacent habitat by reducing noise disturbance and human access (amongst others); (4) restore connectivity by reinforcing the ecological network of surrounding core habitat areas, and; (5) contribute to the restoration of landscape quality in the vicinity of a new road ecosystem. It can be assumed that, where road pavement is not decommissioned and persists, it may continue to: (1) inhibit the ecological functions and services of semi-natural ecosystems, (2) pose as a barrier to the dispersal of wildlife, (3) in¬hibit the establishment of vegetation cover (and habitat), (4) may continue to have an adverse effect on environmental aesthetics; and (5) contribute to the release of pollutants from surface run-off. It is for {{one or more of these}} reasons that the process of road decommissioning is generally carried out. Paved road segments on five national road schemes in Ireland were examined with a view to identifying the potential role of restored vegetation as habitat for wildlife. It has been demonstrated that native vegetation can more readily colonize former road corridors post-decommissioning, especially those roads located adjacent to existing native plant communities e. g. grasslands, hedgerows and woodlands. The resulting decommissioned sections of road generally show rapid recovery through natural recolonisation, where vegetation successional processes are shown to recapture road corridors within a few years, resulting in valuable additional habitat for wildlife, especially birds and nectar feeding invertebrates such as butterflies and bees. Various native mammal species have also been found to utilize old roads as a means of dispersal, therefore providing connectivity in an increasingly intensified agricultural landscape...|$|R
