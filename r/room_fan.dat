500|$|In 1937, Kent {{returned}} to Chatham and underwent a major refit, {{which included a}} [...] Krupp cemented armour belt abreast the engine and boiler rooms {{as well as the}} dynamo room and the fire control transmitting station. This belt extended [...] down from the lower deck. Four inches of armour were also added to protect the sides of the boiler <b>room</b> <b>fan</b> compartments. The ship's aft director was moved to a pedestal [...] the searchlight tower that replaced the original aft control station. Two octuple-barrel 2-pounder mounts were added abreast the searchlight tower. The changes raised the ship's displacement by [...] and cost an estimated £161,000. Unlike her sister ships, no aircraft hangar was added because that would have pushed her over the Washington Naval Treaty limits, but her catapult was replaced with a more powerful one capable of handling the heavier Supermarine Walrus flying boat.|$|E
500|$|Water {{spread to}} the {{centreline}} boiler room, which started to flood from below, and power was lost shipwide when the boiler uptakes became choked; Ark Royal had no backup diesel generators. About half {{an hour after the}} explosion, the carrier appeared to stabilise. Admiral Somerville, determined to save Ark Royal, ordered damage control parties back to the carrier before taking the battleship Malaya to Gibraltar to organise salvage efforts. The damage control parties re-lit a boiler, restoring power to the bilge pumps. The destroyer [...] came alongside to provide power and additional pumps, while Swordfish aircraft from Gibraltar flew overhead to supplement anti-submarine patrols. The tug Thames arrived from Gibraltar at 20:00 and attached a tow line to Ark Royal, but the flooding had caused the ship to list more severely. Rising water reached the boiler <b>room</b> <b>fan</b> flat, an uninterrupted compartment running the width of the ship. This forced the shutdown of the restored boiler.|$|E
500|$|In July 1936, Cornwall {{returned}} home to begin a major refit, which included a [...] Krupp cemented armour belt abreast the engine and boiler rooms {{as well as the}} dynamo room and the fire control transmitting station. This belt extended [...] down from the lower deck. Four inches of armour were also added to protect the sides of the boiler <b>room</b> <b>fan</b> compartments. A hangar for her aircraft was added and a new, more powerful catapult was installed. The ship's director was moved to the roof of the hangar and a new power-operated director-control tower was installed in its original location. Her single four-inch AA guns were replaced with twin-gun mounts for Mark XVI guns of the same calibre. Two octuple-barrel 2-pounder mounts were added abreast the searchlight tower and the original 2-pounder guns were removed. The changes raised the ship's displacement by [...] and cost an estimated £215,000. After the refit was completed in December 1937, the ship was assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron before rejoining the 5th CS in 1939.|$|E

50|$|Thermal {{comfort of}} a {{learning}} space {{is important for}} student comfort, and therefore learning. This is affected by several factors: ambient room temperature, air movement (via open windows, mechanical ventilation, drafts across cold surfaces, and <b>room</b> <b>fans),</b> and solar exposure. Insulating windows, shaded windows, and careful placement of ventilation ducts can all affect the comfort.|$|R
50|$|Hugh and Leona Rank House is a {{historic}} home located in Marion Township, Jasper County, Indiana. The International Style dwelling was built in 1964, and has a curved design constructed of concrete block and vertical wood siding. It is one-story with a flat roof and consists of a hallway circling a central interior courtyard to connect <b>rooms</b> <b>fanning</b> off of it.|$|R
60|$|After {{reaching}} home, Miss Starbrow, {{without saying}} a word, went to her <b>room.</b> <b>Fan</b> ventured to follow her there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Use my name? I shall {{consent to}} {{nothing of the}} sort!" [...] But as she turned to leave the <b>room</b> <b>Fan</b> caught her hand and pulled her back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, it was thoughtless {{of me to}} {{keep her}} here--thanks for {{reminding}} me," [...] said Miss Starbrow, with a strange softening of her voice her friends were not accustomed to hear. [...] "Run up to your <b>room,</b> <b>Fan,</b> and go to bed. I'm sorry I've kept you up so late, poor child." ...|$|E
5000|$|Unlike air conditioners, which cool <b>rooms,</b> <b>fans</b> cool people. Ceiling fans {{increase}} {{air speed}} at the occupant level, which facilitates more efficient heat rejection, cooling the occupant, {{rather than the}} space. Elevated air speed increases the rate of convective and evaporative heat loss from the body, thus making the occupant feel cooler without changing the dry bulb temperature of the air.|$|R
50|$|There {{are eight}} fans and four <b>fan</b> <b>rooms,</b> and each <b>fan</b> can run {{anywhere}} from 250 to 700 horsepower. The fans are automatically turned on when air sensors {{in the tunnel}} are triggered, and can replace the tunnel's air {{in less than five}} minutes.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the ceiling}} fans rotate much more slowly than most {{electric}} desk fans. They cool people effectively by introducing slow movement into the otherwise still, hot air of a <b>room.</b> <b>Fans</b> never actually cool air, unlike air-conditioning equipment, but use significantly less power (cooling air is thermodynamically expensive). Conversely, a ceiling fan {{can also be used}} to reduce the stratification of warm air in a room by forcing it down to affect both occupants' sensations and thermostat readings, thereby improving climate control energy efficiency.|$|R
60|$|But one {{day there}} seemed to be a change for the better. Constance talked with Fan, for some time, asking {{questions}} about Miss Starbrow, of the books she had been reading, and showing a return of interest in life. When she was about to leave the <b>room</b> <b>Fan</b> came to her side and put an arm round her neck.|$|E
60|$|Bertha, in rich new garments, {{seemed as}} {{alien to the}} scene as any fine lady visiting among the slums. She was struggling, too, between disgust of her sister-in-law's slovenly house and untidy dress, and the good humor, tender {{sentiment}} and innate motherliness of her nature. There was charm in her voice and in her big gray eyes. Irish to the core, she could storm at one child and coo with another an instant later. She was like Mart, or rather Mart became every moment more of her kind and less of the bold and remorseless desperado he had once seemed to be. The deeper they dug into the past the more of his essential kinship to this woman he discovered. He greeted her children with kindly interest, leaving a dollar in each chubby, dirty fist, and when McArdle came into the <b>room</b> <b>Fan</b> had quite conquered her awe of Bertha's finery.|$|E

50|$|The {{convention}} typically offers anime screenings, {{an artist}} alley, concerts, cosplay masquerade contest, date auction, dealers <b>room,</b> <b>fan</b> panels, formal dance, guest autographs, karaoke, Maid Cafe, rave dances, video game tournaments, and workshops. The convention hosts a free ConSweet with free ramen noodles, rice, oatmeal, and soda for attendees.|$|E
50|$|The crew {{accommodations}} {{were all}} in a midship deck house. Crew quarters, messrooms, galley, hospital and the ship's stores were on the main deck. Officers' quarters, accommodations for eight passengers, a combined dining room/lounge and the pantry are on the cabin deck. The captain's office and stateroom and the chief mate's stateroom were on the bridge deck with the wheel house, chart room, radio room, gyro <b>room,</b> <b>fan</b> room and the emergency generator room. Mechanical ventilation and heating was provided for all living and working spaces.|$|E
50|$|As extreme as MAV {{specifications}} were, a team under Ilan Kroo at Stanford University {{worked on}} an even more extreme design {{in the form of}} a centimeter-wide four-rotor mesicopter using microcircuit fabrication techniques. The work was funded by NASA. Design of such a small aircraft was constrained by the fact that at such scales, the air becomes a highly viscous medium, or in aerodynamic terms a mesicopter had a low Reynolds number. Basic aerodynamics of the mesicopter were defined by a cycle of computer simulation, followed by tests of model components. The research led to mesicopter rotor designs where the rotor looked much more like the blades of an ordinary <b>room</b> <b>fan</b> than the rotor of a conventional helicopter. Propeller designs did not achieve desired efficiency and the Mesicopter was never able to lift the weight of its own energy source.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid 30s she {{designed}} and built a small circular bush cottage near Warragul {{for herself and her}} mother. [...] This little cottage was clad with weatherboards, and has exposed framing and roof rafters on the interior walls. It contains a central living space and fireplace, with external <b>rooms</b> <b>fanning</b> out from the centre. The circular form was quite unusual at that time in Australian architecture, though it was made popular by later modernists such as Roy Grounds. [...] The cottage is now listed on the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) and also has heritage protection HO267 under the Baw Baw Shire planning scheme.|$|R
40|$|Fans {{provide a}} major {{opportunity}} for buildings {{in that they}} enhance both energy efficiency and occupant comfort. Very low-wattage fans (3 watts) producing 1 m/s (2 mph) air movement near each occupant are capable of offsetting a 6 ºF (3 K) increase in indoor air temperature, while improving the comfort perceived by the occupants. Increasing the indoor temperature reduces a building’s total HVAC energy about 5 % per degree F, or 10 % per degree C, and even more in some climate zones if the higher indoor temperature permits natural ventilation or evaporative cooling systems to be used instead of compressor-based cooling. The opportunities for new design approaches and new fan products are considerable. <b>Room</b> <b>fans</b> have many applications in both new and retrofit designs since they do not involve other HVAC systems, can be easily turned on and off (as with occupancy sensors or wireless controls), yet they can provide an instantaneous cooling effect for the occupant. They strengthen the effectiveness of other energy-efficient measures which may be inherently slow-acting or unpredictable, such as radiant ceilings/floors, and buildings designed to rely on natural ventilation. The technologies involved are especially applicable in California climates. The overall goal {{of this study is}} to encourage the broader adoption of <b>room</b> <b>fans,</b> especially ceiling-integrated fans, in commercial building design. The project addresses a wide range of topics ranging from fundamental human subject studies to new product design and the removal of barriers to implementation in comfort and energy performance standards. 11 subprojects were accomplished...|$|R

25|$|At 3:30p.m. on February 13, 1966, a fire {{broke out}} in a greasy flue {{in the kitchen of}} the {{terminal}} building's second-floor restaurant, The Sky <b>Room.</b> <b>Fanned</b> by gusty winds, the fire spread through the terminal and control tower. Controllers in the tower were able to escape on an aerial ladder and air traffic was diverted to nearby Van Nuys Airport and Los Angeles International Airport for several hours. A controller communicated with aircraft using the radio in a light airplane belonging to Sky Roamers Air Travel, a flying club whose hangar was just east of the control tower. The fire, contained by about 6:30p.m., caused an estimated $2 million in damages to the terminal, tower and equipment in the tower. No injuries were reported.|$|R
