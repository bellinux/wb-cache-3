The logo features a graphic image of a reclining lion (from a side view) on a pedestal that has the text [...] "A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Picture" [...] inscribed on it. Behind the lion is a semi-circular film ribbon with the [...] "Ars Gratia Artis" [...] motto, much like the film <b>ribboning</b> of the company's primary logo. On {{either side of the}} pedestal are torches. This secondary logo was used in the opening title and end titles of most MGM films from the 1920s until the early 1960s, then moved to the main film credits until the mid-1980s. For example, the logo is seen on the 1983 release A Christmas Story during the closing credits.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps most tragic is {{the loss}} of the {{unfinished}} frescoes for the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence which consumed the last decade of his life. His frescoes depicted a Last Judgment day composed of an unsettling morass of writhing figures. The remaining drawings, showing a bizarre and mystical <b>ribboning</b> of bodies, had an almost hallucinatory effect. Florentine figure painting had mainly stressed linear and sculptural figures. For example, the Christ in Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel is a massive painted block, stern in his wrath; by contrast, Pontormo's Jesus in the Last Judgment twists sinuously, as if rippling through the heavens in the dance of ultimate finality. Angels swirl about him in even more serpentine poses. If Pontormo's work from the 1520s seemed to float in a world little touched by gravitational force, the Last Judgment figures seem to have escaped it altogether and flail through a rarefied air.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of automatic techniques {{for the analysis}} of abdominal CT images is a topic of large interest. By using automatic techniques, objective diagnostic support can be provided to physicians and organ segmentation can eliminate time-consuming manual procedures such as delineation. Automatic kidney segmentation has been achieved for healthy cases but is unsuccessful in cases with diseased kidney. In this paper we propose an automatic system to assist the segmentation of abdominal organs, using the medially positioned psoas major muscles' shape and location along with previously accomplished segmentations of the liver and spleen. A framework is employed to segment the vertebral column and <b>ribbones,</b> and the left and right psoas major muscles are segmented using a multi-atlas-based segmentation with weighted decision fusion and non-rigid registration. Due to a varying field of view (FOV) in each dataset and the requirement of an equal FOV for registration, an adjustment is made between pairs of datasets using an automatic vertebra identification framework created in this paper. The vertebra identification shows desired results in 88 % of 68 datasets. The psoas major segmentation accuracy is inspected using a cross-validation among 21 datasets, showing a median Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC) of 63. 4 % and 68. 6 % for the left and right muscles respectively. Future work will focus on adapting the kidney segmentation framework to include the shape and position of the psoas major muscle in the processing...|$|R
5000|$|About a {{pound weight}} of {{malleable}} iron, made from magnetic ore, is placed, minutely broken and moistened, in a crucible of refractory clay, together with finely chopped {{pieces of wood}} Cassia auriculata. It is packed without flux. The open pots are then covered with the green leaves of the Asclepias gigantea or the Convolvulus lanifolius, and the tops are coated over with wet clay, which is sun-dried to hardness. Charcoal will not do {{as a substitute for}} the green twigs. Some two dozen of these cupels or crucibles are disposed archways {{at the bottom of a}} furnace, whose blast is managed with bellows of bullock's hide. The fuel is composed mostly of charcoal and of sun-dried brattis or cow-chips. After two or three hours' smelting the cooled crucibles are broken up, when the regulus appears in the shape and size of half an egg. According to Tavernier, the best buttons from about Golconda were as large as a halfpenny roll, and sufficed to make two Sword-blades. These [...] "cops" [...] are converted into bars by exposure for several hours to a charcoal fire not hot enough to melt them. They are then turned over before the blast, and thus the too highly carburised steel is oxidised.According to Professor Oldham, [...] "Wootz" [...] is also worked in the Damudah Valley, at Birbhum, Dyucha, Narayanpur, Damrah, and Goanpiir. In 1852 some thirty furnaces at Dyucha reduced the ore to kachhd or pig-iron, small blooms from Catalan forges; as many more converted it to steel, prepared in furnaces of different kind. The work was done by different castes; the Muslims laboured at the rude metal, the Hindu preferred the refining work. I have read that anciently a large quantity of Wootz found its way westward via Peshawar.When last visiting (April 19, 1876) the Mahabaleshwar Hills near Bombay, I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Joyner, C.E., and with his assistance made personal inquiries into the process. The whole of the Sayhddri range (Western Ghats), and especially the great-Might-of-Shiva mountains, had for many ages supplied Persia with the best steel. Our Government, since 1866, forbade the industry, as it threatened the highlands with disforesting. The ore was worked by the Hill-tribes, of whom the principal are the Dhdnwars, Dravidians now speaking Hindustani. Only the brickwork of their many raised furnaces remained. For fuel they preferred the Jumbul-wood, and the Anjan or iron-wood. They packed the iron and fourteen pounds of charcoal in layers and, after two hours of bellows-working, the metal flowed into the forms. The Kurs' (bloom), five inches in diameter by two and a half deep, was then beaten into tiles or plates. The matrix resembled the Brazilian, a poor yellow-brown limonite striping the mud-coloured clay; and actual testing disproved the common idea that the [...] "watering" [...] of the surface is found in the metal. The Jauhar, ("jewel" [...] or <b>ribboning)</b> of the so-called Damascus blade was produced artificially, mostly by drawing out the steel into thin ribbons which were piled and welded by the hammer. Oral tradition in India maintains that a small piece of either white or black hematite (or old wootz) had to be included in each melt, and that a minimum of these elements must be present in the steel for the proper segregation of the micro carbides to take place.|$|E

40|$|Random winding {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} of yarn packages used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. <b>Ribboning</b> caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of <b>ribboning,</b> and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of suitable transducers to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from <b>ribboning</b> the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn unwinding tension were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the winding operation. It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor <b>ribboning</b> in the wound package, and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the nature of package driving by the grooved drum. The case of driving a deformable body such as a yarn package on a comparatively non-deformable grooved drum is important for understanding how the package rotates without any obvious slipping. By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a wound package, particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random wound package and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision wound package are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Immunocytochemistry is a {{compromise}} between maintaining antigenicity and preserving tissue morphology. In the testis, successful immunostaining results {{at the level of}} resolution provided by the light microscope have been obtained through use of either frozen or paraffin sections, although both techniques are fraught with limitations. With freezing, tissue preservation is not optimum, whereas with paraffin embedding, antigenicity is often destroyed. These limitations are not trivial and have led to numerous ambiguous results in the literature. In the present study we wish to report the results of immunocytochemical local-ization of various proteins in testis fixed by perfusion with Bouin's fluid and embedded in polyester wax, a <b>ribboning</b> embedding medium for histology. The advantages of this medium are that it does not require clearing of tissues in xylene solvents before embedding and that unlike paraffin, it liquifies at 38 °C. Because of these two properties, the polyester was appears to adequately maintain antigenicity as compared to that observed in frozen sections, yet because it is a <b>ribboning</b> wax, it preserves detailed structure as well as paraffin does. Proteins that were immunolocalized included cytoskeletal proteins (tubulin, actin, vinculin, vimentin) and cell-specific markers: 1) androgen-binding protein (ABP) for Sertoli cells; 2) peripheral type benzodiazepine re-ceptor (PBR) for Leydig cells; and 3) nuclear lamins for germ cells.

40|$|Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) {{is a rare}} {{neurodegenerative}} {{disorder in}} which accumulation of a pathogenic isoform of prion protein (PrPSc) induces neuronal damage with distinct pathologic features. The prognosis of sCJD is devastating: rapid clinical decline is followed by death generally within months after onset of symptoms. The classic clinical manifestations of sCJD are rapidly progressing dementia, myoclonus, and ataxia. However, the spectrum of clinical features can vary considerably. We describe a definite, neuropathologically verified sCJD in a 67 -year-old woman who initially presented with progressive stroke-like symptoms: left-sided hemiparesis and ataxia within a few days. The initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral cortical hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted sequences (DWI) resembling multiple ischemic lesions. Despite anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin, the patient deteriorated rapidly, became dysphagic and bedridden with myoclonic jerks on her left side extremities correlating with intermittent high-amplitude epileptiform discharges on electroencephalography (EEG). Basal ganglia hyperintense signal changes in addition to cortical <b>ribboning</b> were seen in DWI images of a follow-up MRI. Repeated EEG recordings showed an evolution to periodic sharp wave complexes. Protein 14 - 3 - 3 was positive in her cerebrospinal fluid specimen, {{in addition to an}} abnormally high total tau level.
