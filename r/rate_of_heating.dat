40|$|Hsp 72 {{concentration}} {{has been}} shown to be higher in the serum (eHsp 72) of runners with symptoms <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> illness than in non-ill runners. Recently, it has been suggested that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> storage during exercise in the heat may be an important factor in the development <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> stroke. Therefore, we compared the effect <b>of</b> two <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> storage on eHsp 72 concentration during exercise in which subjects reached the same final core temperature. We hypothesized that with a lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> storage the increase in eHsp 72 would be attenuated compared to a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> storage. Nine heat acclimated subjects performed two exercise trials in a counterbalanced order in the heat (42 °C, 30 % relative humidity). The trials consisted of walking on a treadmill (∼ 50 % VO 2 peak) dressed in military summer fatigues until rectal temperature reached 38. 5 °C. A high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> storage (HS, 1. 04 ± 0. 10 W m- 2 min- 1, mean± SE) occurred when subjects walked without cooling. To produce a lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> storage (LS, 0. 54 ± 0. 09 W m- 2 min- 1) subjects walked while wearing a water-perfused cooling vest underneath clothing. eHsp 72 increased pre- to post-exercise (P 0. 05) in eHSP between the two <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> storage (LS 1. 25 ± 0. 73 to 2. 23 ± 0. 70 ng ml- 1, HS 1. 04 ± 0. 57 to 2. 02 ± 0. 60 ng ml- 1).

5000|$|If one heats {{a pot of}} soup on {{the stove}} the pot will develop a {{temperature}} gradient, (warmest {{on the bottom and}} cooler at the surface). Mild agitation will increase the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> by dissipating the heat through the entire pot. See: Law of cooling (which also applies to heating). Even more significant, agitation disturbs the soup directly in contact with the hotter pot surface. Highly turbulent flow at the warming surface is important to good heat transfer. This is the same effect as the [...] "wind chill" [...] factor where moving air and turbulent action on surfaces (like those on people) resulting in significantly enhanced heat transfer. In unusual circumstances, overly-severe agitation may decrease the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> which defeats the purpose.|$|E
50|$|Shelters are {{important}} for controlling body temperature and water regulation, as they allow desert tortoises to slow their <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> in summer and provide protection from cold during the winter.

30|$|Fins are {{commonly}} used to facilitate the dissipation <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> from a heated wall to the surrounding environment. Examples of fin are the radiator in vehicles and heat exchangers in power plants. In electrical devices like motors and transformers, the generated heat can be efficiently transferred. In the study <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> transfer, fin is a surface, made by metallic material {{which is used to}} increase the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> transfer to the environment. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> transfer depends on the surface area of the fin. Fins are extensively used to improve the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> dissipation from a hot surface, especially in thermal engineering applications (Bergman et al.; Nield and Bejan).|$|R

50|$|The {{first stage}} {{starting}} at about 220 °C, is {{the release of}} the four molecules of water of crystallisation. This is followed at about 330 °C by the decomposition of the hydroxide ion to a further molecule of water. Finally, at about 350 °C carbon dioxide begins to be released. The release of the carbon dioxide can be further broken down into two stages depending on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating.</b>|$|E
50|$|Similarly to temperature, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> plays a {{critical}} role in the production of the different phase streams, due to the prevalence of secondary reactions at non-optimum heating rates. Secondary reactions become dominant in heating rates that are too low, leading to the formation of char. While high heating rates are required to form liquid bio-oil, there is a threshold heating rate and temperature where liquid production is inhibited and gas production is favored in secondary reactions.|$|E
50|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} is explosive, {{although there}} is a lack of modern research into this behaviour. Room temperature mixtures with oxygen could not be detonated by an electric spark until they contained at least 23.5% Cl2O. which is an exceedingly high minimum explosive limit. There are conflicting reports of it exploding on exposure to strong light. Heating above 120°C, or a rapid <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> at lower temperatures also apparently lead to explosions.Liquid dichlorine monoxide has been reported to be shock-sensitive.|$|E

50|$|Single crystal x-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used to}} determine the lattice parameters of Cd3As2 between 23 and 700 °C. Transition α → α′ occurs slowly and therefore is most likely an intermediate phase. Transition α′ → α″ occurs much faster than α → α′ and has very small thermal hysteresis. This transition results in a change in the fourfould axis of the tetragonal cell, causing crystal twinning. The width of the loop is independent of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> although it becomes narrower after several temperature cycles.|$|E
50|$|Mochi's {{characteristic}} chewiness {{is due to}} the polysaccharides in it. The viscosity and elasticity {{that account}} for this chewiness are affected by many factors such as the starch concentration, configuration of the swollen starch granules, the conditions of heating (temperature, heating period and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating)</b> as well as the junction zones that interconnect each polymer chain. The more junction zones the substance has, the stronger the cohesiveness of the gel, thereby forming a more solid like material. The perfect mochi has the perfect balance between viscosity and elasticity so that it is not inextensible and fragile but rather extensible yet firm.|$|E
50|$|Microwaves {{are used}} for heating of various {{materials}} in cooking and various industrial processes. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> of the material depends on the energy absorption, which depends on the dielectric constant of the material. The dependence of dielectric constant on temperature varies for different materials; some materials display significant increase with increasing temperature. This behavior, when the material gets exposed to microwaves, leads to selective local overheating, as the warmer areas {{are better able to}} accept further energy than the colder areas—potentially dangerous especially for thermal insulators, where the heat exchange between the hot spots {{and the rest of the}} material is slow. These materials are called thermal runaway materials. This phenomenon occurs in some ceramics.|$|E

40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{for heat}} generation in composting process with livestock and farmyard wastes {{had been made}} by using a compost container in laboratory scale. Following the previously proposed procedure for estimation, the apparent <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation was calculated by applying the observed value of temperature in a compost bed to the analytical solution of temperature derived from a three dimensional model for heat conduction problem. The true (or total) <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation was also calculated by adding the latent heat loss due to vaporization of water to the apparent <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation. The following results were obtained. 1) Since the initial moisture content was relatively small, the increasing <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> temperature became large and the attainable maximum temperature was high in the early stage of the composting process. Because of the leakage <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> from the side walls of the compost container to the atmosphere, however, temperature decreased within a comparatively short period. 2) During the composting process, the effective region <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation moved gradually downward {{from the surface of the}} compost bed, so that the apparent <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation was varied remarkably with both the time and the vertical location in the compost bed. 3) As for some results of the experiments used relatively large contents of rice bran and chicken manure (Runs 3, 4), the steady high-temperature period became longer and the local maximum value <b>of</b> the apparent <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation was larger than the results of the other experiments (Runs 1, 2). Even in the latter experiments, in the limited region of the effective duration <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation, the average value <b>of</b> the apparent <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation in the compost bed was approximately 150 kcal/m 3 hr, and this value was not so different from the results of the former experiments. 4) The above-mentioned results on the average value <b>of</b> the apparent <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation were also similar to the results of the previous experiments under the considerably larger moisture conditions. As for a natural composting process, the average <b>of</b> the apparent <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation in the effective region <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation seemed to be almost independent of the moisture content and to fall within the range from 150 to 200 kcal/m 3 hr. 5) The calculated results of the true (or total) <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generation agreed well with the values estimated from the consumption <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> carbon in the compost bed, and were almost equal to the results which had been obtained previously...|$|R
50|$|In zone refining, solutes are {{segregated}} {{at one end}} of the ingot {{in order}} to purify the remainder, or to concentrate the impurities. In zone leveling, the objective is to distribute solute evenly throughout the purified material, which may be sought in the form of a single crystal. For example, in the preparation of a transistor or diode semiconductor, an ingot of germanium is first purified by zone refining. Then a small amount of antimony is placed in the molten zone, which is passed through the pure germanium. With the proper choice of <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> and other variables, the antimony can be spread evenly through the germanium. This technique is also used for the preparation of silicon for use in computer chips.|$|E

50|$|Suppose {{that the}} gain {{of the control}} system is reduced {{drastically}} and it is restarted. As the temperature approaches, say 30° below SP (60° proportional band (PB)), the heat input begins to be reduced, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> of the furnace has time to slow and, as the heat is still further reduced, it eventually is brought up to set point, just as 50% power input is reached and the furnace is operating as required. There was some wasted time while the furnace crept to its final temperature using only 52% then 51% of available power, but at least no harm was done. By carefully increasing the gain (i.e. reducing {{the width of the}} PB) this overdamped and sluggish behavior can be improved until the system is critically damped for this SP temperature. Doing this is known as 'tuning' the control system. A well-tuned proportional furnace temperature control system will usually be more effective than on-off control, but will still respond more slowly than the furnace could under skillful manual control.|$|E
