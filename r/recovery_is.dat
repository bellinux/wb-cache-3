5|$|In {{addition}} to rich dinosaur fossils, {{there are also}} plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–Pg boundary. In the sediments below the K–Pg boundary the dominant plant remains are angiosperm pollen grains, but the boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores. More usual pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{poliomyelitis}} result in only temporary paralysis. Nerve impulses {{return to the}} formerly paralyzed muscle within a month, and <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> usually complete in six to eight months. The neurophysiological processes involved in recovery following acute paralytic poliomyelitis are quite effective; muscles are able to retain normal strength even if half the original motor neurons have been lost. Paralysis remaining after one year {{is likely to be}} permanent, although modest recoveries of muscle strength are possible 12 to 18 months after infection.|$|E
5|$|Despite her injury, McLeod {{returned}} to the pitch quickly, starting in three games at the CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifier in February 2016 where she recorded two shutouts. On February 19, McLeod joined the national team for their semifinal match against Costa Rica. In the warmup for the game, she again injured her right knee and left the warmup early. However, she played all 90 minutes of the match. Following the tournament, she {{returned to}} Sweden to play with her club team, FC Rosengård. In March 2016, her knee collapsed after kicking a ball while playing with FC Rosengård. It was revealed that she had torn her ACL in her right knee for the third time. Later, her surgeon stated that the injury had most likely occurred in the warmup before Canada's match against Costa Rica. McLeod has stated that her <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> expected to take {{one to two years}} and plans to be back on the field in February or March 2017.|$|E

5|$|Generally, if {{the patient}} is treated and survives then a full <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> expected. Patients who present early to medical {{facilities}} and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} serious {{poisoning}} the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of {{central nervous system}} depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days. In {{the majority of cases}} <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> complete within 12 to 24hours. The effect is highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain. For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E

50|$|Between December 1947 and December 1949, 6000 {{females were}} {{recovered}} from Pakistan and 12,000 from India. Most <b>recoveries</b> <b>were</b> made, {{in order of}} succession, from East and West Punjab, Jammu, Kashmir and Patiala. Over the eight year period 30,000 women had been repatriated by both governments. The number of Muslim women recovered was significantly higher; 20728 against 9,032 non-Muslim women.

5|$|One {{mechanism}} {{involved in}} <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> nerve terminal sprouting, in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal sprouts. These sprouts can reinnervate orphaned muscle fibers {{that have been}} denervated by acute polio infection, restoring the fibers' capacity to contract and improving strength. Terminal sprouting may generate a few significantly enlarged motor neurons doing work previously performed {{by as many as}} four or five units: a single motor neuron that once controlled 200 muscle cells might control 800 to 1000 cells. Other mechanisms that occur during the rehabilitation phase, and contribute to muscle strength restoration, include myofiber hypertrophy—enlargement of muscle fibers through exercise and activity—and transformation of type II muscle fibers to type I muscle fibers.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the {{vegetation}} {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has been limited to one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which is susceptible to damage from summer grazing. The vegetation structure has started to improve; however, <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from the large number of walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E

5|$|The player {{character}} has {{three levels of}} strength. The strength level is indicated by the cursor which will either be white, flashing yellow, or red. Strength will decrease after extreme actions or being attacked by the game's enemy, Scissorman, and recovers with time. When the character's life is being threatened, the cursor will blink red, indicating panic mode. If the character is being chased, click points are only effective on objects that will make Scissorman retreat. In escape mode, actions do not lower strength and <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> suspended. This mode stays active until Scissorman is somehow forced to retreat. If the player's strength reaches zero, then it is game over and the player must continue from the last room they entered with one level of strength.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main {{accounts}} of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is Polybius, who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. Livy wrote {{in the time of}} Augustus, and Appian later still. Appian's account describes events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius. Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, functioning as a literary device such that the subsequent Roman <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> more dramatic. For example, some argue that his casualty figures are exaggerated—"more symbolic than factual". Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy has a tendency to idealize. Scholars tend to discount Appian's account. The verdict of Philip Sabin—"a worthless farrago"—is typical.|$|E
5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of <b>recovery,</b> <b>is</b> not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E

5|$|Identified world zinc {{resources}} total about 1.9–2.8 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, {{with the}} largest reserves in Iran. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) {{at the time of}} determination. Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use.|$|E
