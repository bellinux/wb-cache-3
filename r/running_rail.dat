25|$|The key {{advantage}} of the four-rail system is that neither <b>running</b> <b>rail</b> carries any current. This scheme was introduced because {{of the problems of}} return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) <b>running</b> <b>rail,</b> flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.|$|E
25|$|The Watford DC Line between Queens Park and Harrow & Wealdstone and the North London Line between Richmond and Gunnersbury {{are used}} by London Overground trains {{designed}} for 750V third rail and Bakerloo line trains designed for 630V third and fourth rail. As a compromise, the nominal line voltage is 650V, and since 1970 the centre rail has been bonded to the return <b>running</b> <b>rail.</b> There are no special provisions required at Queens Park, where the two dissimilar systems meet, just a gap longer than one coach of a Bakerloo line train at the entry to (and exit from) the Bakerloo, which operates with a nominal -210V on the fourth rail and +420V on the third rail. There is no bridging of the incompatible systems as trains pass {{from one to the}} other since, like all UK electric trains intended to run extensively in tunnels, there is no continuity of traction power circuits between vehicles of the train.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conductor}} rail was a steel inverted channel placed centrally, with its upper surface {{at the same}} level as the upper surface of the running rails. At pointwork a hardwood ramp was provided to raise the collector shoes [...] above <b>running</b> <b>rail</b> level.|$|E

50|$|The {{ride was}} built with wooden <b>running</b> <b>rails</b> {{which were in}} a trough, like usual scenic railways; only the trough is {{partially}} set into the landscape and is concrete in construction.

2500|$|When the VFT was conceived, {{only three}} {{countries}} were <b>running</b> <b>rail</b> services {{at more than}} 200km/h on purpose-built tracks: France, Japan and Italy. If the VFT project had advanced reasonably quickly, Australia would have been about the sixth {{country in the world}} to have high-speed rail, after Germany and Spain. Today, high speed rail services are operating in a dozen countries, and a similar number are building or planning them. [...] Australia has dropped far behind.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a little}} after noon, Ladas with the two {{carriages}} started back down the mountain. About [...] above Clogwyn, where the line runs on a shelf formed across a steep drop, the locomotive jumped off the rack rail, losing all braking force and accelerating down the track. At first it remained on the <b>running</b> <b>rail</b> and the driver tried to apply the handbrake, but with no effect. Realising that the train was out of control, the driver and his fireman jumped from the footplate.|$|E
40|$|<b>Running</b> <b>rails</b> used as {{a return}} {{conductor}} and ungrounded scheme have been widely adopted in DC traction power systems. Due to the longitudinal resistance of <b>running</b> <b>rails</b> and insulation resistance of rail-to-ground, {{there will be a}} potential rise between <b>running</b> <b>rails</b> and the ground when return current flows through the <b>running</b> <b>rails,</b> which is known as rail potential. At present, abnormal rise of rail potential exists widely in DC traction power systems. The present rail potential model still cannot simulate and explain the abnormal rail potential in the system. Based on the analysis of power distribution with multiple trains running in multiple sections, a dynamic simulation model of rail potential in the whole line is proposed. The dynamic distribution of rail potential and stray current in DC traction power systems when multiple trains run in multiple sections is analyzed, and the impact of traction current distribution on rail potential is evaluated. Simulation results show that the abnormal rise of rail potential during the dynamic operation of the system can be evaluated effectively...|$|R

2500|$|All {{electrical}} equipment was shipped from the US, including power system plant equipment. A power station was {{built at the}} Shore Road pumping station and was designed, anticipating extension of the electrification to the Wirral Railway, although this was not to occur until 1938.

Four rail 600V DC electrification was installed, the positive outer rail set [...] from the <b>running</b> <b>rail.</b> The new multiple units had British wooden bodies on US bogies; 24 motor cars and 33 trailer cars were provided and trains were initially 2-car or 4-car sets.

2500|$|As a local railway the Mersey Railway {{remained}} {{independent in}} the 1923 grouping, although the Wirral Railway {{became part of}} the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The Wirral had authority to electrify its lines, but had not done so, and passengers making through journeys had to change at Birkenhead Park. In 1926 discussions started on electrification and through running. The Wirral section was electrified with a DC third rail system, the Mersey Railway retaining its fourth rail but moving the positive conductor to [...] from the <b>running</b> <b>rail.</b> The Mersey Railway electric multiple units were modified to run to the Wirral railway, {{and at the same time}} heaters and air compressors were added.|$|E
2500|$|The Circle line is [...] {{long with}} 36 {{stations}}. Much of its track {{and all of}} its stations are shared with the other London Underground sub-surface lines: the Hammersmith & City line from Hammersmith to just before Aldgate; the Metropolitan line from Baker Street to Aldgate; and the District line from Tower Hill station to Edgware Road station.

2500|$|The District line is [...] {{long and}} serves 60 stations. Much {{of the line}} is {{electrified}} with a four-rail DC system: a central conductor rail is now energised at –250V and a rail outside the <b>running</b> <b>rail</b> at +500V, giving a potential difference of 750V. These areas are: Upminster - Putney Bridge/Olympia/Barons Court and Edgware Road - Earl's Court. Other areas; Barons Court - Ealing Broadway, still remain–210V and a rail outside the <b>running</b> <b>rail</b> at +420V, giving a potential difference of 630V,. Two exceptions are the sections over which main line trains run; from East Putney to Wimbledon and from Gunnersbury to Richmond, which both have the centre rail bonded to the running rails. West of Earl's Court, there are four branches. At Ealing Broadway station, the District line has platforms north of the Central line and the Great Western main line out of Paddington. After about , the line meets the Piccadilly line Uxbridge branch at Hanger Lane junction, and the tracks are then shared through Ealing Common station until Acton Town station, where the Piccadilly line Heathrow branch joins. From Acton Town to Barons Court, the line has four tracks, paired by use: the District line uses the outer pair and the non-stopping Piccadilly line trains use the inner pair. At Richmond station, the London Overground and District line platforms are north of the Waterloo to Reading line through platforms. The two tracks which cross the Thames at Kew Railway Bridge are shared with the London Overground trains until Gunnersbury junction, after which the District line tracks join the four-track District and Piccadilly lines just before Turnham Green station.|$|E
50|$|Another design, with a {{third rail}} (current feed, outside the <b>running</b> <b>rails)</b> and fourth rail (current return, midway between the <b>running</b> <b>rails),</b> is used by a few steel-wheel systems; see fourth rail. The London Underground is the largest of these, (see railway {{electrification}} in Great Britain). The main reason for using the fourth rail to carry the return current is to avoid this current flowing through the original metal tunnel linings which were never intended to carry current, and which would suffer electrolytic corrosion should such currents flow in them.|$|R

The first [...] from Aldgate are below ground, {{shared with the}} Circle and Hammersmith & City lines to Baker Street, where the line diverges, remaining in tunnel until Finchley Road. Between Finchley Road and Wembley Park the line runs parallel to the Jubilee line, the tracks being paired by direction, with cross-platform interchange at the two stations. At Wembley Park the Jubilee line diverges to the Stanmore branch at a grade-separated junction. From just after Finchley Road these four tracks run parallel with the Network Rail Chiltern Main Line from Marylebone.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, {{the track}} and the rolling stock used on this line and the North London Line were changed to use a {{modified}} version of the BR standard third rail system, with the fourth rail (now bonded to the <b>running</b> <b>rail</b> used for returning traction current) left in place on the sections of line shared with LU Bakerloo line trains. North of Harrow & Wealdstone, now the limit of LU operation, the fourth rail has in most places been dropped onto the sleepers and remains bonded, thus leaving the resistance of the current return path unaltered. The fourth rail remains in the normal position from Queens Park to Kilburn High Road up platform, where a trailing crossover between those two stations is maintained in use to allow reversal of Bakerloo line trains unable to gain access to London Underground at Queens Park, due to planned work or other reasons. [...] The line is currently electrified (like all shared lines) using the standard compromise voltage of 660V. [...] This falls comfortably within the lower permanent voltage limit for the Capitalstar stock (500V) and the upper permanent voltage limit for the 1972 tube stock (760V).|$|E
