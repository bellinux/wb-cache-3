5|$|Due to the <b>rainout</b> and the racers' lack of {{familiarity}} with the EuroSpeedway, CART cancelled qualifying for the American Memorial. The starting grid was determined by drivers' order in the season points standings. The pole position went to de Ferran, though {{due to the lack}} of qualifying, he was not awarded a point in the standings as was customary for pole winners. Bräck earned second position since he held a tie-breaker over Castroneves, who started third, and Andretti began the race in fourth.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies opened May {{against the}} division-rival New York Mets, losing the opening {{game of the}} month, 7–4. Back-to-back walks in the tenth inning of the Saturday {{afternoon}} game gave the Phillies their first win of the season over the Mets. After a <b>rainout,</b> the Phillies opened their first series in St. Louis with the Cardinals. They won {{the first game of}} the series on Howard's second grand slam in as many weeks after a pitchers' duel between starters Kyle Lohse and Joe Blanton and completed the two-game series sweep with a 10–7 victory on May 5, capped by a Jayson Werth three-run home run and a 4-for-5 performance from Victorino. The Phillies' brief stop in New York was marred by a two-game series sweep; Phillies hitters were shut down by Mets starters Johan Santana and Mike Pelfrey, and closer Francisco Rodríguez recorded saves in both games of the series. The following series was barely better, as the Phillies dropped two games to the Braves.|$|E
5|$|Hershiser {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to pitch against the NL-leading New York Mets (80–54) on Sunday, September 4, but a <b>rainout</b> delayed his performance. The Dodgers entered the game with a 77–57 record and a 5-game lead in the NL West over the Astros, while the Atlanta Braves were 31 games back in sixth place in the division with a 46–88 record entering the game. With the September 5 win, the Dodgers retained their 5-game lead. Hershiser struck out Dale Murphy four times, once resorting to a rare sidearm curveball to do so, to the dismay of pitching coach Ron Perranoski, who worried about injuries caused by sidearm pitching. According to ESPN's Mark Simon, this was the only game of Murphy's 2,180-game career in which a single pitcher struck him out four times. After a two-out walk to Dion James in the third inning, Hershiser allowed no baserunners until the ninth inning. With his fourth straight complete game, Hershiser raised his record to 19–8, making him 3–1 with a 1.00 ERA in those games.|$|E

25|$|The race's start {{was delayed}} due to rain, marking {{the third time}} in seven race {{weekends}} in 2014 that weather affected a race. Eventually, NASCAR announced that the race would be postponed to Monday, April 7, and started at 12 p.m., marking the season's first <b>rainout.</b> Joey Logano made a last lap pass on Jeff Gordon to win the race.|$|E
25|$|In addition, X-rays taken late in {{his life}} {{disclosed}} that Gehrig had sustained several fractures during his playing career, although he remained in the lineup despite those previously undisclosed injuries. }} On the other hand, the streak was helped when Yankees general manager Ed Barrow postponed a game as a <b>rainout</b> {{on a day when}} Gehrig was sick with the flu—even though it was not raining.|$|E
25|$|The {{seventh and}} {{deciding}} {{game of the}} series was scheduled for Sunday night, October 26. However, heavy rain caused the postponement of the game one night and the game was played on Monday night, October 27. The Mets sent Ron Darling, their scheduled starter, out for Game 7 with an extra day of rest due to the <b>rainout.</b> Oil Can Boyd, who had struggled in his Game 3 start earlier in the series, {{was supposed to take}} the mound for the Red Sox in Game 7. The postponement gave Red Sox manager John McNamara another idea, and he decided to start Bruce Hurst, already 2-0 in the series and the presumptive series MVP if the Red Sox won, instead of Boyd as the <b>rainout</b> enabled him to get a third day of rest and thus be ready to go for the decider. Boyd, upset at not being given the ball as he was supposed to, went into the clubhouse and decided to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Thus, when pitching coach Bill Fischer went to check on him, he found Boyd was highly intoxicated and thus in no condition to pitch in relief that night if he was needed.|$|E
50|$|The season {{consists}} of 16-18 race nights (Heat races and one feature per night, per class and consolations if necessary), although due to <b>rainouts</b> during the season, {{an average of}} 12-14 races are run for the championship.|$|R

25|$|A team of Palauan all-stars {{participated in}} further {{international}} competition in 1963, defeating {{a team from}} Xavier High School on Chuuk and winning a three-game series against a team of Pohnpei all-stars, two games to one. The final game narrowly avoided a <b>rainout</b> that would {{have led to a}} Pohnpei victory as Palau only pulled ahead in the late innings. As such, much credit for the victory was given to the Palauan team magician for overcoming the spells of the Pohnpeiian magician.|$|E
25|$|In the best-of-five {{championship}} round, defending AAGPBL champion Rockford won {{the first}} two games over the visiting South Bend. In Game 1 the Peaches beat the Blue Sox, 5–4, behind the pitching of Helen Nicol. South Bend rallied to score two runs in the eighth and one in the ninth, but fell short. Following a <b>rainout,</b> Rose Gacioch pitched a six-hitter and slugged a solo home run in Game 2 to help the Peaches win, 7–1. Rockford led all the way, clinching the victory with three runs in the eighth inning.|$|E
25|$|Under Angelos' leadership, the Orioles {{adopted a}} wide range of {{consumer-friendly}} policies at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The franchise's Fan Cost Index metric consistently ranks among the best values in Major League Baseball for tickets, food, beverages and parking for a family of four. The franchise allows fans to bring food and beverages into the park to save on costs. In 2009, the team created a “Birdland Stimulus Package” with discounts and affordable entertainment options for families and the team's refund and exchange policy is one of the league's most liberal, allowing fans a great deal of scheduling flexibility. The club also received strong reviews for relaxing its refund policy during a bizarre <b>rainout</b> in 1999.|$|E
5000|$|Denny Hamlin {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 22.069 and a speed of 122.344 mph. Asked why it took so long in the season to get a pole, Hamlin said he had [...] "no idea. We were second and third so many times it was crazy. We were {{actually}} looking at the <b>rainouts</b> and were like, ‘We’re going to start seventh because of the <b>rainouts.</b> It hurts our average.’” He also added that Richmond was his [...] "hometown (being from nearby Chesterfield County, Virginia), so I’d probably be a little more aggressive than I would at any other racetrack, but ultimately this race isn’t going to make or break a championship run for us, but it surely would do a whole lot for momentum and feel-good going into the Chase if we could win." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1869, {{when the}} Cincinnati Red Stockings began their inaugural season as history's first {{professional}} baseball team, {{they played a}} preseason game {{at the site of}} what is now the Grand Union Terminal in Cincinnati against the Antiochs, who were {{regarded as one of the}} finest amateur clubs in Ohio. The game was played on May 15, 1869, and Cincinnati defeated Antioch 41-7. Antioch had been scheduled to host the first game of this professional tour on May 31, 1869, but pouring rain and an unplayable field kept the teams off the diamond. So, while Antioch was not a part of the first professional baseball game, the college does hold claim to hosting the first ever <b>rainout</b> in professional baseball.|$|E
25|$|In 1994–95, the Sharks {{earned their}} second-straight playoff berth and again reached the second round. Ray Whitney scored a goal in double {{overtime}} of Game 7 of the Conference Quarter-finals against the Calgary Flames. Key Sharks players included goaltender Arturs Irbe, defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh and forwards Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov. Despite their success against Calgary, round two {{would prove to}} be a disaster for the Sharks, when they lost in a four-game sweep to Detroit (in a rematch of the previous year) without even holding a single lead in all four games. However, the 1995 season also saw the only <b>rainout</b> {{in the history of the}} NHL, when the Guadalupe River flooded its banks in March 1995, making it impossible for anyone to get into the San Jose Arena for a game between the Sharks and the Red Wings.|$|E
25|$|In January 1969, McLain was {{selected}} as the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year. He created more disruption when he was named as the starting pitcher for the American League in the 1969 All-Star Game in Washington, DC, but missed the start of the game because of a dental appointment in Detroit. The appointment was scheduled for Wednesday the 23rd, the day after the All-Star game, but because of a <b>rainout</b> on the scheduled date, the game was played on the 23rd. McLain was a nonconformist and liked to play by his own rules. He had learned to fly and purchased an airplane. Having kept his dental appointment, he then flew himself to Washington, arriving at the game during the second inning. He pitched in the fourth inning, but by then the National League had already built a 9-2 lead. McLain created more dissension when he clashed with Tigers' manager Mayo Smith over the latter's role in the firing of Johnny Sain as the team's pitching coach. Despite the troubles, McLain had another productive season in 1969, winning 24 games and a second consecutive Cy Young Award, tying with Baltimore's Mike Cuellar, marking the first time two players had shared the award. It was the last award of his major league career.|$|E
50|$|The {{park was}} built for the 1994 season, {{although}} it opened several weeks late due to a rough winter that hampered construction. The sod also was unable to take properly that season, and the field did not properly drain, leading to <b>rainouts</b> on evenings where the sun had been out since noon. The drainage problem was fixed in 1995.|$|R
50|$|Though Connor {{had success}} in his {{season with the}} PL, the league struggled. Some of the teams ran into {{financial}} difficulties. National League teams rescheduled many of their games to conflict with PL games in the same cities, and {{a high number of}} PL games were cancelled late in the season due to <b>rainouts.</b> Connor was optimistic that the league would be successful in 1891, but it officially broke up that January.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} event <b>rainouts,</b> debt issues, and track {{maintenance}} costs combined {{to force the}} Speedway into bankruptcy by 1973, when the property was purchased for commercial development and the Speedway facilities were demolished. No trace of the Speedway remains at the site today. The track was located east of I-35E at what is now approximately mile marker 448 (Round Grove Rd./Hebron Parkway exit). The Speedway tower was near the present-day intersection of Waters Ridge Dr. and Lake Pointe Dr.|$|R
25|$|Game4 {{was pushed}} back a day because of rain, {{the first time}} a <b>rainout</b> had {{occurred}} in the World Series since Game1 in 1996. The fans from the game were to attend Game5. (Thus, fans who had tickets for Game5 went to Game4 instead.) The Cardinals won, taking a 3–1 series lead. The Tigers took a 3–0 lead into the top of the third, after Sean Casey had two RBIs, including a home run. The other RBI came from Detroit's Iván Rodríguez, who singled in Carlos Guillén. Rodriguez, who had been hitless in the previous three games, also went 3-for-4. In the bottom of the third, the Cardinals struck back with a run-scoring double by David Eckstein, scoring Aaron Miles who had the first stolen base of the series by either team. Yadier Molina doubled in Scott Rolen in the fourth to cut the Tiger lead to 3–2. The score remained that way, until the bottom of the seventh, when Eckstein led off with a double over the head of Curtis Granderson, who had slipped on the wet Busch Stadium outfield. Eckstein then scored on a sacrifice bunt by So Taguchi that was thrown over the head of Plácido Polanco covering first by Fernando Rodney, and that tied the score at three. Later that same inning, Preston Wilson hit a single to left with two outs that scored Taguchi from third. The Tigers tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth on a Brandon Inge double that scored Iván Rodríguez. In the bottom of the eighth inning, the Cardinals would regain and keep the lead when Miles scored on a double by Eckstein just off the glove of outfielder Craig Monroe, who had been playing shallow and dove for a ball just out of his reach.|$|E
500|$|He first played shortstop for {{the then}} Division III Stony Brook Patriots (now Division I {{and called the}} Seawolves), at Stony Brook University in Long Island, New York. Nathan [...] became a two-time Academic All-American and graduating {{as a member of}} the Golden Key International Honour Society. During his tenure there, {{professional}} baseball scouts began to notice his good arm and pitcher's body, and on the day of a <b>rainout,</b> unfortunately, [...] "literally someone from every organization" [...] came to watch him pitch. He was drafted in the sixth round (159th overall) of the amateur draft by the San Francisco Giants in 1995, and signed the next day, June 2. His college jersey number has since been retired, and he was awarded the University Medal, the highest recognition given by SUNY / Stony Brook. He also played for the Fairfield Stallions in the New England Collegiate Baseball League in 1994.|$|E
500|$|This late-season {{competition}} for the AL Central title included a four-game series between the two teams from September 29 to October 2. The series, played at the Tigers' home field Comerica Park, started with a day-night doubleheader caused by a <b>rainout</b> the night before when the series was scheduled to start. The {{final game of the}} series featured moments of contention between the two teams. In the third inning, Nate Robertson hit Denard Span. Minnesota starter Scott Baker hit Marcus Thames with a pitch the next inning. Thames responded by sliding hard into second base to break up a potential double play that inning. Twins' reliever Jose Mijares then threw behind the Tigers' Adam Everett in the eighth inning. Umpire Angel Hernandez warned Mijares and the Tigers bench, Tigers' manager Jim Leyland argued with Hernandez, and he was ejected. Despite the warning Minnesota's Delmon Young was hit in the knee with the first pitch in the ninth inning by Jeremy Bonderman. Bonderman was immediately ejected as was Tigers' catcher Gerald Laird who argued with Hernandez and the benches cleared, though there was no brawl. Bonderman was suspended for three games, and Tigers' hitting coach Lloyd McClendon—who had been acting as manager following Leyland's ejection—was suspended for a game. [...] McClendon, Leyland, and Laird were all fined.|$|E
50|$|The 1933 Boston Red Sox {{season was}} the 33rd {{season in the}} franchise's Major League Baseball history. The Red Sox {{finished}} seventh in the American League (AL) {{with a record of}} 63 wins and 86 losses. There were five <b>rainouts,</b> one against the Senators and a four game series against the Chicago White Sox that was cancelled due to the remnants of the 1933 Outer Banks hurricane, which passed to the southeast of New England the third weekend of September.|$|R
50|$|Play {{opened in}} late April 1908 {{and the league}} ran into {{problems}} almost immediately. The entire east coast was dealing with frequent rain. The Washington club, for example, experienced nine <b>rainouts</b> in May, with six of them occurring in a nine-day stretch. This, combined {{with the fact that}} the league had not attracted star players from the established leagues, contributed to poor attendance and low revenue. As players sometimes went unpaid, they began to leave the league. The league folded in June of its inaugural season.|$|R
50|$|Delaware Speedway {{became the}} first Canadian track to be member of the NASCAR Dodge Weekly Series in the 2004 season. At the {{conclusion}} of the 2005 racing season the speedway cancelled its NASCAR sanctioning {{at the same time as}} it dropped its CASCAR Super Series events. During the period after a series of <b>rainouts</b> and under the NASCAR rules at the time, the speedway was forced to run a number of double feature nights to make the minimum number of races required under the NASCAR program. With double feature nights increasing the weekly payout and not increasing the number of fans, the speedway reconsidered its place within NASCAR.|$|R
500|$|Young {{signed a}} highly incentivized one-year {{deal with the}} Seattle Mariners on March 27, 2014. Young was {{scheduled}} to debut as a starter for the Mariners on April 4. However, the Oakland Coliseum had its first <b>rainout</b> since 1998. As a result, after 159 Major League starts and 102 Minor League starts, Young made his first appearance as a relief pitcher (other than the 2007 All-Star Game) and he pitched two shutout innings on April 6 against the Oakland A's later in that series. He made his first Major League start since September 9, 2012 on April 13 against Oakland. He posted six scoreless innings, while scattering 4 hits and 3 walks. By early June, Young was in the conversation for Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award, with a 5–2 start and 3.27 ERA, according to MLB.com's Adam Lewis. In helping to stabilize a rotation battered by injuries and ineffectual fifth starters, Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon was unabashed in his praise of the right-hander at the time, calling him a [...] "godsend." [...] Young finished {{the season with a}} 12–9 record and a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts. His 7.8 hits per nine innings was the sixth in the AL. Following the season, Young was recognized with the Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award, The Sporting News American League Comeback Player of the Year Award, and Players Choice Comeback Player of the Year Award. At the conclusion of the season, Young became a free agent.|$|E

Due to dry summers in Southern California, rainouts at Dodger Stadium are rare. Prior to 1976, the Dodgers were rained out only once, against the St. Louis Cardinals, on April 21, 1967, ending a streak of 737 consecutive games without a postponement. On April 12, 1976, the second home <b>rainout</b> ended a streak of 724 straight games. April 19–21, 1988 saw three consecutive rainouts, the only time consecutive games have been rained out at Dodger Stadium. No rainouts occurred between April 21, 1988 and April 11, 1999 – a major league record of 856 straight home games without a <b>rainout.</b> [...] That record has since been broken, with no rainouts since April 17, 2000, 1,373 consecutive games through September 25, 2016.|$|E
