5|$|Raëlism (also {{known as}} Raëlianism or the <b>Raëlian</b> <b>movement)</b> is a UFO {{religion}} that {{was founded in}} 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (b. 1946), now known as Raël. The <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human when having personal contacts with {{the descendants of the}} humans that they made. They purposefully misinformed early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. The founder of Raëlism received the final message of the Elohim and that its purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and that if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they wish to be welcomed by them.|$|E
5|$|Two ex-Roman Catholic priests, Victor Legendre and Charles-Yvan Giroux {{converted}} to Raëlianism. A former bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) joined the <b>Raelian</b> <b>Movement</b> {{so he could}} be openly gay. The Raëlian, Mark Woodgate, stated that 8% of Raëlians worldwide are former Latter-day Saints. Religiously mixed couples are common, especially with spouses who are Christians or Buddhists.|$|E

5|$|According to Michel Beluet, {{the former}} {{director}} of a Raëlian-built museum called UFOland, the only pressure exerted on members is to attend annual Raëlian seminars, which allows members convinced of Raël's enthusiasm to voluntarily tithe. Palmer cited Raël, who claimed that more than 60% of the <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement's</b> members do not tithe. Dawson College students conducted a survey of the membership in Canada 1991 which found that only one-third of respondents tithed.|$|R

5|$|The Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials is {{the vision}} of the International <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> to {{establish}} an embassy, at a base cost of $20 million, with a landing pad that would serve as spaceport for extraterrestrial spaceships. Its location is intended to be in neutral territory, preferably Jerusalem, and would be surrounded by acres of campground capable of supporting about 144,000 people or more than twice the estimated Raëlian membership as of 2005.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement,</b> {{who believe}} that extraterrestrials {{originally}} created all life on earth, use a symbol that is often the source of considerable controversy: an interlaced star of David and a swastika. The Raelians state that the Star of David represents infinity in space whereas the swastika represents infinity in time—no beginning and no end in time, and everything being cyclic. In 1991, the symbol was changed to remove the swastika, out of respect {{to the victims of}} the Holocaust, but as of 2007 has been restored to its original form.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a {{parliamentary}} commission {{issued a report}} through the National Assembly of France that categorized the <b>Raelian</b> <b>Movement</b> (Mouvement Raëlien) as a [...] (French word for [...] "cult"), but did not give reasons for this classification. In 1997, {{a parliamentary}} inquiry commission issued a report through the Belgian Chamber of Representatives that categorized the Belgian <b>Raelian</b> <b>Movement</b> (Mouvement Raëlien Belge) as a sect. Glenn McGee, professor at the University of New Haven, stated {{that part of the}} sect is a cult while the other part is a commercial website that collects large sums of money from those interested in human cloning. [...] The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the United States Department of State and sociologist Susan J. Palmer have classified the International <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> as a religion.|$|E
500|$|In February 1991, the Raëlian Church {{modified}} their symbol. The official reason given was {{a request}} from the Elohim to change the symbol {{in order to help}} in negotiations with Israel for the building of the Extraterrestrial Embassy to greet the anticipated Elohim space vessels, although the country continued to deny their request. In 2005, the Israeli Raëlian Guide Kobi Drori stated that the Lebanese government was discussing proposals by the <b>Raëlian</b> <b>movement</b> to build their interplanetary embassy in Lebanon. However, one condition was that the Raëlians not display their logo on top of the building because it mixes a swastika and a Star of David. According to Drori, the Raëlians involved declined this offer, as they wished to keep the symbol as it was. [...] From 1991 to 2007, the official Raëlian symbol in Europe and America did not have the original swastika, but Raël, founder and leader of the <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> decided to make the original symbol, the Star of David intertwined with a swastika, the only official symbol of the <b>Raelian</b> <b>Movement</b> worldwide.|$|E
500|$|There is {{continuing}} debate on whether Raëlians {{can be identified}} as a cult. The government of France classifies the <b>Raelian</b> <b>Movement</b> as a [...] "" [...] (French word for cult). However, according to Glenn McGee, the {{associate director of the}} Center for Bioethics at the University of Virginia, part of the sect is a cult while the other part is a commercial website that collects large sums of money from those interested in human cloning.

500|$|In 2005, two Wired News {{reporters were}} welcomed into a Raëlian seminar and had {{permission}} to videotape it. They believe the footage they took {{makes it clear}} that the <b>Raelian</b> <b>Movement</b> is a cult which should disband. [...] A Raëlian guide said in a Wired interview that he was not ashamed of what is shown and that he has no concerns about this incident.|$|E
500|$|On 13 December 1997, {{the leader}} of the International <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> had decided to extend the {{possibility}} of building the embassy outside of Jerusalem and also allow that {{a significant portion of the}} embassy property be covered with water.

500|$|Vorilhon {{became a}} sports-car {{journalist}} and test driver {{for his own}} car-racing magazine, Autopop. Following an extraterrestrial encounter in December 1973, he formed the <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> and {{changed his name to}} Raël (meaning [...] "messenger of the elohim"). He later published several books, which detail his [...] encounter with a being called Yahweh in 1973. He traveled the world to promote his books for over 30 years.|$|E

500|$|From the Raëlian {{point of}} view, {{religious}} texts {{indicate that the}} Elohim would return {{at the age of}} Apocalypse or Revelation (unveiling of the truth). Humans from another world would appear to drop down from the sky and meet in the embassy they have asked Raël to build for them and share their advanced scientific knowledge with humanity. [...] Thus, one of the stated main goals of the <b>Raëlian</b> <b>movement</b> is to inform {{as many people as possible}} about this extraterrestrial race.|$|E
500|$|In recent years, many ex-Raelians {{have accused}} Claude Vorilhon of plagiarism. They have cited {{numerous}} quotes from Rael's books and compared them {{with those of}} author Jean Sendy. Raelian concepts such as chemical education, infinity, geniocracy and others may all be found in Sendy's books. [...] Most of Rael's [...] "Sensual Meditation" [...] book {{is said to have}} been derived from the Silva 'Mind Control' Method which was allegedly taught to him by ex-level-5 guide of the Canadian <b>Raelian</b> <b>Movement,</b> Jean-Denis Saint-Cyr.|$|E
500|$|The {{movement}} traces {{its beginnings}} {{to a conference}} in Paris, France of two thousand people in 1974. From there, the MADECH organization was born. The name MADECH is a double acronym in the French language; it stands both for [...] "Movement for the Welcoming of the Elohim, Creators of Humanity" [...] (Mouvement pour l‘accueil des Elohim, créateurs de l'humanité) and for [...] "Moses Preceded Elijah and the Christ" [...] (Moise a devancé Élie et le Christ). By 1976, Claude Vorilhon (called Raël) transformed MADECH into the International <b>Raelian</b> <b>Movement.</b>|$|E

[...] The movement gave vocal support in response to the company's support for genetically modified organisms particularly in their country. [...] Brazilian farmers have been using Monsanto's genetically engineered soy plant as well as the Roundup herbicide to which it was artificially adapted. [...] The Raëlians spoke against the Brazilian government's ban on GMOs.|$|E
500|$|Raëlians are {{encouraged}} to do as they feel right, whether that matches {{the rules of the}} culture in which they live or not. According to Susan J. Palmer, a majority of loosely affiliated <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> members have often strayed from following rules concerning [...] "diet, drugs, and sexual activity" [...] as described in the Raëlian books. Sometimes, they will not attend monthly meetings or pay a tithe in proportion to their income. Only the more committed members who do follow such rules can remain in the movement's structure.|$|E
500|$|A Swiss newspaper, {{who called}} Raëlians [...] "rat heads", was sued for defamation. Another suit was brought against {{journalist}} Stephane Baillargeon for {{writing in the}} Montreal daily Le Devoir that the Raëlians defended pedophiles and that certain ex-Raëlians claimed the [...] "gourou" [...] liked very young girls. After some negotiation, Le Devoir published a letter from Raël condemning the charge as [...] "ignominious defamation" [...] and asserting that the <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> had [...] "always condemned pedophilia and promoted respect for laws that justly forbid the practices that are always the fault of unbalanced individuals".|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Raël {{decided to}} give up his {{automobile}} magazine, Autopop. [...] That September, the last issue, number 34, was published. [...] Raël then devoted himself to the task he said was given by his [...] "biological father", an extraterrestrial named Yahweh. Shortly after a first public conference, Raël founded MADECH – a group of people interested in helping him in his task, which later became the International <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement.</b> Sociologist Susan J. Palmer said that Cristini, a nurse, diagnosed Raël as clinically depressed after he appeared at her doorstep in 1987, burnt out from the tasks he carried out within the movement.|$|E
500|$|The International <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> envisions {{having an}} {{entrance}} with an aseptic chamber {{leading to a}} conference room for twenty-one {{people as well as}} a dining room of the same capacity. [...] In the plan are seven rooms for the purpose of receiving human guests into the embassy. [...] The embassy building, along with the swimming pool, would be {{in the center of a}} large park and protected from trespassing by a wall—a maximum of two stories—to surround the entire complex's circumference. [...] Trees and bushes are to be planted in the outskirts of the wall's area. [...] The walls are to have a northern and southern entrance. [...] The landing pad for the embassy should be able fit a spaceship of twelve meters of diameter or 39'4" [...] on its terrace. [...] The terrace is to be above the rooms in the torus, which are for extraterrestrials only. [...] The seven rooms directly underneath the landing pad would be protected from occupants of other rooms with a thick metal door. [...] Finally, the International <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> wants to avoid military and radar surveillance of the airspace above the embassy. [...] Buildings for administration, food and water provisions, and state-of-the-art sanitation and communication systems are part of this vision. A nearby replica of the Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials open to the public is expected to show visitors what it is like inside the real one.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Raël {{appeared}} on the first airing of the Quebec version of the French talk show Tout le monde en parle, hosted by Guy A. Lepage. During this appearance, Raël upset panel members with his statements on democracy and cloning. The situation reached its peak when caricaturist Serge Chapleau called Raël a [...] "farce" [...] and a [...] "nerd", ridiculed his clothes, and {{grabbed him by the}} back of his neck. Raël left the stage, followed by his disciples. A fellow guest on the show, Parti Québécois Member of Quebec Legislative Assembly Pauline Marois, who would later become Premier of Quebec, called Raël [...] "insane". The <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> asked Marois to apologize, which she refused.|$|E
500|$|Raëlians {{routinely}} advocate sex-positive {{feminism and}} {{genetically modified food}} and actively protest against wars {{in addition to the}} Catholic Church. For example, a photographer of the Associated Press snapped a picture of half-naked Raëlian women wearing pasties as part of an anti-war demonstration in Seoul, Korea. A snapshot by Agence France-Presse revealed Raëlians in white alien costumes with signs bearing the message [...] "NO WAR ... ET wants Peace, too!". On 6 August 2003, the first day of Raëlian year 58 AH, a tech article on the USA Today newspaper mentions an [...] "unlikely ally" [...] of the Monsanto Company, the <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> of Brazil.

2500|$|In the 1880's the Theosophical Society {{adopted a}} {{swastika}} {{as part of}} its seal, along with an Om, a hexagram or star of David, an Ankh and an Ouroboros.

The current seal also includes the text [...] "There is no religion higher than truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Raëlism, members of the <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> have {{advocated}} the use of sex-positive feminism, condoms, birth control, masturbation, meditation, genetically modified organisms, and human cloning.

2500|$|In 2006, the <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> vocally {{advocated}} {{the concept of}} a [...] "United States of Africa" [...] following a more honest and complete decolonization that would involve the disbanding of corrupt rulerships as a result of Africans returning to their non-Christian ancestors' religious and territorial roots, which existed before colonization by Europeans. However, Raëlians later emphasized that the word [...] "Africa" [...] was colonial in origin, so on 28 December, an article in Raëlian Contact 325 suggested a different name: The United Kingdoms of Kama.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Raëlian</b> <b>Movement</b> {{promoted}} 2004 as the [...] "year of atheism". [...] On 11 December 2004, Raëlians {{marched in}} the Atheist Convention in Rome.
