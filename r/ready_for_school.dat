25|$|Kindergarten {{has been}} shown to improve school {{readiness}} in children at risk. Children attending a kindergarten were less likely to have impaired speech or impaired motor development. Only 50% of children whose parents did not graduate from school are <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>school</b> at age six. If such children were enrolled in a high-quality three-year Kindergarten programme, 87% were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>school</b> at age six. Thus Kindergarten helps to overcome unequal opportunities.|$|E
500|$|Kanako Sasa, usually {{referred}} to by her surname, is a girl who is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class {{at the beginning of}} Wandering Son. She is sometimes called [...] by her younger brother and Chizuru. She makes her first appearance in chapter two of the manga, but is not named until volume two. She is a short, energetic girl who thinks of herself as everyone's friend and becomes distressed when her friends fight among themselves. Sasa acts as a mediator between her friends in such times and tries not to leave anyone alone. She has been friends with Yoshino since pre-school, and later becomes close with Chizuru. Sasa is an innocent, childish girl who does not have many worries aside from her friends' quarrels. She tends to be a handful for her mother, who picks out her clothes for her and even helps her get <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>school</b> in the morning. She mentions that if she thinks too hard about something, her brain becomes itchy.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early to get <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>school.</b> Just before 7:00a.m., {{he went to the}} garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E

MacLean characterized Hometown Hockey {{as an extension of}} Hockey Day in Canada and the Kraft Hockeyville competition—highlighting grassroots hockey throughout the country on a weekly basis. He also felt that the Sunday night timeslot was [...] "a good hockey night", believing that it could be [...] " [...] family-forward way of doing the show to get the kids involved. Families can have it on while they get <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>school</b> or work Sunday night. For me, after 27 years, honestly, what’s wrong with doing something different?" [...] The games also seek to emulate the success of NBC's Sunday Night Football—which airs against Hometown Hockey during the National Football League season.|$|E

Ought she to have guessed? But let alone being a scholar he was eight years younger than she was. She knew his mother--old Mrs. Floyd. She had tea there. And it was that very evening when she came back from having tea with old Mrs. Floyd that she found the note in the hall and took it into the kitchen with her when she went to give Rebecca the fish, thinking it must be something about the boys.|$|E
