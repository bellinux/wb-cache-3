Aramid fiber can act as skeleton and improve the dielectric strength <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> paper greatly accordingly at the optimum dosages of aramid fiber, 4 %. When 3 % of PVA fibers were added the tensile strength <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> paper increased significantly. It is because PVA fibers can smelt and act as bond for mica flake and aramid fiber under high temperature. The optimum beating degree of aramid fiber was 35 oSR, and the optimum drying temperature was 100 ℃?. Compared with traditional mica paper, dielectric strength <b>of</b> composite <b>mica</b> paper with aramid fiber and PVA fiber increased above 25 % and tensile strength increased 2. 30 times under this optimum condition.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{series of}} laboratory studies <b>of</b> aggregates containing <b>mica</b> minerals obtained from aggregate producers located throughout Sweden. The main {{idea of the}} research was to study physical properties and behaviour <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> particles in unbound granular products of crushed rock materials. Another objective was to highlight the detrimental properties <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> occurrence in aggregates used for road construction industry and determine the applicable methods for quantitative determination <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> minerals presence. Due {{to the lack of}} previous investigations looking at this or similar subject, the current research can have international importance, especially for countries with crystalline, mica rich bedrock and temperate, subarctic climates. Recently a number of cases involving road construction failures and decrease in service life have been observed in northern parts of Sweden. One of the major reasons for the structural deterioration was enrichment <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> particles in aggregates and their interaction with water. Due to this reason first paper of this thesis represents a study of the behaviour <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> grains in crushed rock aggregates of metamorphic origin and recognition of any trend of enrichment <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> grains aggregates. As a result two general trends <b>of</b> enrichment <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> were obtained: Type I (isotropic source rock) and Type A (anisotropic source rock). Type I is exemplified by a general increase <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> towards finer grain fractions, with or without a peak for "coarser" grain fractions. Type A represents an increase <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> up to a certain grain fraction, thereafter no increase occurs towards finer grain fractions. Second part of the thesis focuses on the determination of the possible analytical methods which are susceptible to mica content and could be used as indicating technique for quantitative determination <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> particles in unbound granular materials. Two standard methods: Sand equivalent test and Methylene blue test were assumed as the most sensitive to mica presence. Both methods showed susceptibility to mica content and gave strong correlation in terms <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> content. The third paper enhances knowledge of the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> rich aggregates in interaction with water in terms of fraction sizes and free mica content. During the experiment several aggregates with different content <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> and pure <b>mica</b> material consisting <b>of</b> commercial biotite were studied. Two major parameters were investigated during the research: water storage capacity and specific water saturation value. With the aid of consecutive analytical and statistical analyses a more precise mica presence threshold value for certain unbound applications was indicated, resulting in recommendations for industry, authorities and for future experiments.

Methods: We obtained data on 222 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, including data on MICA expression, age, gender, ECOG score, pathological type, stage, treatment history (including 38 patients who were given autologous CIK cell infusion), and overall survival (OS). MICA expression in lung cancer tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Analyses <b>of</b> <b>MICA</b> expression, and CIK therapy association with survival outcomes were performed using Cox proportional models, Kaplan-Meier methods, and the log-rank test. Result: s MICA was expressed in both membrane and cytoplasm. MICA expression correlated with the stage of lung cancer, ECOG score, gender and age. Multivariate COX regression analysis showed that the expression <b>of</b> <b>MICA</b> was an independent prognostic factor of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (p = 0. 002).

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{abundance}} <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> {{has been}} used to determine the energy levels of the depositional environments of the Indus River/ Estuary in terms of the interactions between the river currents and tidal, wind and wave induced currents. Three distinct zones have been identified on the basis of sediment texture and mica content. Based on textural class, the Indus River/Estuary along the 40 km stretch up-stream is subdivided into three distinct classes: sandy silt, silty clay and sand silt clay. The textural data demonstrate the hydraulic associ-ation <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> with finer sediments. The excess presence <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> in ar-eas <b>of</b> fine sediment and its relative abundance in coarser sediments have been used to identify the boundaries between the three zones which are classified into environments of high-medium-low energy. Marine processes in the lower reaches (mouth) of the Indus River are responsible for winnowing of finer sediments, leaving coarser materi-als as lag deposits. However, the presence of coarser sediments in the upper limits shows the incompetency of the river flow to transport material and the waning effects of wave and wind generated currents on the depositional regime. The presence <b>of</b> abundant <b>mica</b> within mud is attributed to flocculation induced by the mixing of fresh and saline waters and the limit <b>of</b> tidal intrusion. <b>Mica</b> dominates in the mud and mimics the depositional characteristics of clay. The distribu-tion <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> and sediment texture suggest that sedimentation is con-trolled primarily by different energy levels, flocculation, and by prov-enance (metamorphic rocks in the Himalayan range) ...|$|R
40|$|A two-step {{deposition}} {{process for the}} formation of atomically flat gold films on mica is developed. The process starts with a high deposition rate followed by a 1 : 100 reduced rate. Using this combination a completely wetting <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> by gold resulting in a two-dimensional growth mode and finally extremely flat gold films with large terraces are achieved. Additionally hexagonal facefing of the gold films on mica is observed at moderate temperatures which can be related to the relaxation of stress caused by different thermal coefficients <b>of</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> and gold. The stress release leads to the generation of misfit dislocations that glide along the (100) planes producing facets on the surface. Annealing experiments in a UHV-STM and thermogravimetry point to the inset of intensified hexagonal faceting due to the starting decomposition <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> at elevated temperatures.
