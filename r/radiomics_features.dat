Tumor volumes were defined either by expert radiation oncologists or using semiautomatic segmentation methods. Their results identified a subset of radiomic features that may be useful for predicting patient survival and describing intratumoural heterogeneity. They also confirmed that the prognostic ability of these <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> may be transferred from lung to head-and-neck cancer. However, Parmar et al. (2015) demonstrated that prognostic value of some radiomic features may be cancer type dependent. Particularly, they observed that not every radiomic feature that significantly predicted the survival of lung cancer patients could also predict the survival of head-and-neck cancer patients and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare 2 D and 3 D <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> {{prognostic}} performance {{differences in}} CT images of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). METHOD: We enrolled 588 NSCLC patients from three independent cohorts. Two sets of 463 patients {{from two different}} institutes were used as the training cohort. The remaining cohort with 125 patients was set as the validation cohort. A total of 1014 <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> (507 2 D features and 507 3 D features correspondingly) were assessed. Based on the dichotomized survival data, 2 D and 3 D radiomics indicators were calculated for each patient by trained classifiers. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess the prediction performance of trained classifiers (the support vector machine and logistic regression). Kaplan–Meier and Cox hazard survival analyses were also employed. Harrell's concordance index (C-Index) and Akaike's information criteria (AIC) were applied to assess the trained models. RESULTS: Radiomics indicators were built and compared by AUCs. In the training cohort, 2 D_AUC =  0. 653, 3 D_AUC =  0. 671. In the validation cohort, 2 D_AUC =  0. 755, 3 D_AUC =  0. 663. Both 2 D and 3 D trained indicators achieved significant results (P < . 05) in the Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression. In the validation cohort, 2 D Cox model had a C-Index =  0. 683 and AIC =  789. 047; 3 D Cox model obtained a C-Index =  0. 632 and AIC =  799. 409. CONCLUSION: Both 2 D and 3 D CT <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> have a certain prognostic ability in NSCLC, but 2 D features showed better performance in our tests. Considering the cost of the <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> calculation, 2 D features are more recommended for use in the current study...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} if <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> from 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images could contribute to prognoses in cervical cancer. Methods: One hundred and two patients (69 for training and 33 for testing) with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) receiving chemoradiotherapy (CRT) from 08 / 2010 to 12 / 2016 were enrolled in this study. 18 F-FDG PET/CT and MRI examination [T 1, T 2, T 1 C, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) ] were performed for each patient before CRT. Primary tumor volumes were delineated with the fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian algorithm in the PET images and with 3 D Slicer™ in the MRI images. <b>Radiomics</b> <b>features</b> (intensity, shape, and texture) were extracted and their prognostic value was compared with clinical parameters for recurrence-free and locoregional control. Results: In the training cohort, median follow-up was 3. 0 years (range, 0. 43 – 6. 56 years) and relapse occurred in 36 % of patients. In univariate analysis, FIGO stage (I–II vs. III–IV) and metabolic response (complete vs. non-complete) were probably associated with outcome without reaching statistical significance, contrary to several <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> from both PET and MRI sequences. Multivariate analysis in training test identified Grey Level Non UniformityGLRLM in PET and EntropyGLCM in ADC maps from DWI MRI as independent prognostic factors. These had significantly higher prognostic power than clinical parameters, as evaluated in the testing cohort with accuracy of 94 % for predicting recurrence and 100 % for predicting lack of loco-regional control (versus ~ 50 – 60 % for clinical parameters). Conclusions: In LACC treated with CRT, <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> such as EntropyGLCM and GLNUGLRLM from functional imaging DWI-MRI and PET, respectively, are independent predictors of recurrence and loco-regional control with significantly higher prognostic power than usual clinical parameters. Further research is warranted for their validation, which may justify more aggressive treatment in patients identified with high probability of recurrence...|$|E

30|$|<b>Radiomics</b> are <b>features</b> {{that can}} be {{extracted}} only by computer algorithms, and cannot be derived by human visual assessment. This is the main “advantage” of quantitative analysis. However, extensive development and clinical validation of radiomic features is needed, and to date, the singular validated method of interpretation in clinical practice, with all the limitations and advantages of the human brain, is still the visual assessment. The high inter-reader agreement among radiologists in image interpretation supports the reliability of qualitative assessment, and may therefore represent a standard of reference for the development and validation of quantitative analysis integrating other “omics” and clinical data [8].|$|R
30|$|Unlike more {{traditional}} <b>radiomics</b> approaches where <b>feature</b> extraction and data analysis {{consisted of two}} separate steps, deep learning fuses these processes together and iteratively optimizes one {{with respect to the}} other. In other words, deep learning provides radiomics models with optimal features and optimal data analysis for a specific clinical problem.

40|$|Consistent pixel {{sizes are}} of {{fundamental}} importance for assessing texture features that relate intensity and spatial information in radiomics studies. To correct {{for the effects}} of variable pixel sizes, we combined image resampling with Butterworth filtering in the frequency domain and tested the correction on computed tomography (CT) scans of lung cancer patients reconstructed 5 times with pixel sizes varying from 0. 59 to 0. 98 mm. One hundred fifty <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> were calculated for each preprocessing and field-of-view combination. Intra-patient agreement and inter-patient agreement were compared using the overall concordance correlation coefficient (OCCC). To further evaluate the corrections, hierarchical clustering was used to identify patient scans before and after correction. To assess the general applicability of the corrections, they were applied to 17 CT scans of a radiomics phantom. The reduction in the inter-scanner variability relative to non-small cell lung cancer patient scans was quantified. The variation in pixel sizes caused the intra-patient variability to be large (OCCC < 95 %) relative to the inter-patient variability in 79 % of the features. However, with the resampling and filtering corrections, the intra-patient variability was relatively large in only 10 % of the features. With the filtering correction, 8 of 8 patients were correctly clustered, in contrast to only 2 of 8 without the correction. In the phantom study, resampling and filtering the images of a rubber particle cartridge substantially reduced variability in 61 % of the <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> and substantially increased variability in only 6 % of the features. Surprisingly, resampling without filtering tended to increase the variability. In conclusion, applying a correction based on resampling and Butterworth low-pass filtering in the frequency domain effectively reduced variability in CT <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> caused by variations in pixel size. This correction may also reduce the variability introduced by other CT scan acquisition parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> measured from weekly 4 -dimensional computed tomography (4 DCT) images of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) change during treatment and if those changes are prognostic for patient outcomes or dependent on treatment modality. <b>Radiomics</b> <b>features</b> are quantitative metrics designed to evaluate tumor heterogeneity from routine medical imaging. Features that are prognostic for patient outcome could be used to monitor tumor response and identify high-risk patients for adaptive treatment. This would be especially valuable for NSCLC due to the high prevalence and mortality of this disease. A novel process was designed to select feature-specific image preprocessing and remove features that were not robust to differences in CT model or tumor volumes. These features were then measured from weekly 4 DCT images. These features were evaluated to determine at which point in treatment they first begin changing if those changes were different for patients treated with protons versus photons. A subset of features demonstrated significant changes by the second or third week of treatment, however changes were never significantly different between patient groups. Delta-radiomics features were defined as relative net changes, linear regression slopes, and end of treatment feature values. Features were then evaluated in univariate and multivariate models for overall survival, distant metastases, and local-regional recurrence. In general, the delta-radiomics features were not more prognostic than models built using clinical factors or features at pre-treatment. However one shape descriptor measured at pre-treatment significantly improved model fit and performance for overall survival and distant metastases. Additionally for local-regional recurrence, the only significant covariate was texture strength measured at the end of treatment. A separate study characterized radiomics feature variability in cone-beam CT images to increased scatter, increased motion, and different scanners. Features were affected by all three parameters and specifically by motion amplitudes greater than 1 cm. This study resulted in strong evidence that a set of robust <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> change significantly during treatment. While these changes were not prognostic or dependent on treatment modality, future studies may benefit from the methodologies described here to explore delta-radiomics in alternative tumor sites or imaging modalities...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose Quantitative tissue {{characteristics}} {{derived from}} medical images, also called radiomics, contain valuable prognostic information in several tumour-sites. The {{large number of}} features available {{increases the risk of}} overfitting. Typically test-retest CT-scans are used to reduce dimensionality and select robust features. However, these scans are not always available. We propose to use different phases of respiratory-correlated 4 D CT-scans (4 DCT) as alternative.   Materials and Methods In test-retest CT-scans of 26 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and 4 DCT-scans (8 breathing phases) of 20 NSCLC and 20 oesophageal cancer patients, 1045 <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> of the primary tumours were calculated. A concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) > 0. 85 was used to identify robust features. Correlation with prognostic value was tested using univariate cox regression in 120 oesophageal cancer patients. Results Features based on unfiltered images demonstrated greater robustness than wavelet-filtered features. In total 63 / 74 (85 %) unfiltered features and 268 / 299 (90 %) wavelet features stable in the 4 D-lung dataset were also stable in the test-retest dataset. In oesophageal cancer 397 / 1045 (38 %) features were robust, of which 108 features were significantly associated with overall-survival. Conclusion 4 DCT-scans can be used as alternative to eliminate unstable <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> as first step in a feature selection procedure.

40|$|Increasing {{effort in}} brain image {{analysis}} has been dedicated to early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on neuroimaging data. Most existing {{studies have been}} focusing on binary classification problems, e. g., distinguishing AD patients from normal control (NC) elderly or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals from NC elderly. However, identifying individuals with AD and MCI, especially MCI individuals who will convert to AD (progressive MCI, pMCI), in a single setting, is needed to achieve the goal of early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, we propose a deep ordinal ranking model for distinguishing NC, stable MCI (sMCI), pMCI, and AD at an individual subject level, {{taking into account the}} inherent ordinal severity of brain degeneration caused by normal aging, MCI, and AD, rather than formulating the classification as a multi-category classification problem. The proposed deep ordinal ranking model focuses on the hippocampal morphology of individuals and learns informative and discriminative features automatically.

40|$|Abstract Background With a {{wide array}} of multi-modal, multi-protocol, and multi-scale {{biomedical}} data being routinely acquired for disease characterization, there is a pressing need for quantitative tools to combine these varied channels of information. The goal of these integrated predictors is to combine these varied sources of information, while improving on the predictive ability of any individual modality. A number of application-specific data fusion methods have been previously proposed in the literature which have attempted to reconcile the differences in dimensionalities and length scales across different modalities. Our objective in this paper was to help identify metholodological choices that need to be made in order to build a data fusion technique, as it is not always clear which strategy is optimal for a particular problem. As a comprehensive review of all possible data fusion methods was outside the scope of this paper, we have focused on fusion approaches that employ dimensionality reduction (DR). Methods In this work, we quantitatively evaluate 4 non-overlapping existing instantiations of DR-based data fusion, within 3 different biomedical applications comprising over 100 studies. These instantiations utilized different knowledge representation and knowledge fusion methods, allowing us to examine the interplay of these modules in the context of data fusion. The use cases considered in this work involve the integration of (a) <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> from T 2 w MRI with peak area features from MR spectroscopy for identification of prostate cancer in vivo, (b) histomorphometric features (quantitative features extracted from histopathology) with protein mass spectrometry features for predicting 5 year biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients, and (c) volumetric measurements on T 1 w MRI with protein expression features to discriminate between patients with and without Alzheimers 2 ̆ 019 Disease. Results and conclusions Our preliminary results in these specific use cases indicated that the use of kernel representations in conjunction with DR-based fusion may be most effective, as a weighted multi-kernel-based DR approach resulted in the highest area under the ROC curve of over 0. 8. By contrast non-optimized DR-based representation and fusion methods yielded the worst predictive performance across all 3 applications. Our results suggest that when the individual modalities demonstrate relatively poor discriminability, many of the data fusion methods may not yield accurate, discriminatory representations either.

40|$|Glioblastoma is {{a highly}} {{malignant}} tumor which mostly recurs locally around the resected contrast enhancement. However, {{it is difficult to}} identify tumor invasiveness pre-surgically, especially in non-enhancing areas. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to utilize multimodal MR technique to identify and characterize the peritumoral progression zone that eventually leads to tumor progression. Patients with newly diagnosed cerebral glioblastoma were included consecutively from our cohort between 2010 and 2014. The presurgical MRI sequences included volumetric T 1 -weighted with contrast, FLAIR, T 2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor and perfusion MR imaging. Postsurgical and follow-up MRI included structural and ADC images. Image deformation, caused by disease nature and surgical procedure, renders routine coregistration methods inadequate for MRIs comparison between different time points. Therefore, a two-staged non-linear semi-automatic coregistration method was developed from the modification of the linear FLIRT and non-linear FNIRT functions in FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL). Utilising the above mentioned coregistration method, a volumetric study was conducted to analyse the extent of resection based on different MR techniques, including T 1 weighted with contrast, FLAIR and DTI measures of isotropy (DTI-p) and anisotropy (DTI-q). The results showed that patients can have a better clinical outcome with a larger resection of the abnormal DTI q areas. Further study of the imaging characteristics of abnormal peritumoural DTI-q areas, using MRS and DCS-MRI, showed a higher Choline/NAA ratio (p = 0. 035), especially higher Choline (p = 0. 022), in these areas when compared to normal DTI-q areas. This was indicative of tumour activity in the peritumoural abnormal DTI-q areas. The peritumoural progression areas were found to have distinct imaging characteristics. In these progression areas, compared to non-progression areas within a 10 mm border around the contrast enhancing lesion, there was higher signal intensity in FLAIR (p = 0. 02), and T 1 C (p < 0. 001), and there were lower intensity in ADC (p = 0. 029) and DTI-p (p < 0. 001). Further applying <b>radiomics</b> <b>features</b> showed that 35 first order features and 77 second order features were significantly different between progression and non-progression areas. By using supervised convolutional neural network, there was an overall accuracy of 92. 4 % in the training set (n = 37) and 78. 5 % in the validation set (n= 14). In summary, multimodal MR imaging, particularly diffusion tensor imaging, can demonstrate distinct characteristics in areas of potential progression on preoperative MRI, which can be considered potential targets for treatment. Further application of radiomics and machine learning can be potentially useful when identifying the tumor invasive margin before the surgery. Chung Gung Medical Foundatio...|$|E
