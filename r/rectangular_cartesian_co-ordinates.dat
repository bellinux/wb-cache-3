40|$|In part A a {{non-singular}} {{connection matrix}} {{is used to}} combine the self and mutual impedance matrix {{of a group of}} mutually coupled elements with a network bus impedance matrix; the resulting impedance matrix is then reduced by eliminating rows and columns if necessary, to give the bus impedance matrix of the interconnected network. The self impedances of the mutually coupled group of elements are added to the network bus impedance matrix {{in the same way as}} uncoupled elements, then the mutual impedances Are added followed by matrix reduction. By considering examples of the connection matrix applied to adding a single element, then to adding groups of uncoupled and coupled elements to a network, rules are devised for combining the celf impedances of branch and loop elements and group mutual imped-ances with the network bus impedance matrix. From the bus impedance matrix of power system sequence networks fault parameters are derived by simple arithmetic operations. It is shown that rules for adding a group of mutually coupled loop elements can be applied to modify a bus impedance matrix when element self and mutual impedances are changed. The derivation of an equivalent network from the bus impedance matrix is noted; the addition of two network bus impedance matrixes is considered and shown to be a special case of the more general problem of adding a self and mutual impedance matrix to a bus impedance matrix. A numerical example involving the calculation and modification of the bus impedance matrix, deriving an equivalent circuit and adding bus impedance matrixes is included. An outline of a digital computer power system short circuit programme which calculates fault parameters from the bus impedance matrix derived from randomly ordered lists of network element self and mutual impedances is given. The inverse of the connection matrix discussed in part A is used in part B to combine a network bus admittance matrix with the self and mutual admittance matrix of a group of mutually coupled elements. From this the Well known method of forming the bus admit-tance matrix from uncoupled element self admittances follows and is extended to cover self and mutual admittances of coupled elements. For a group of mutually coupled elements, the diagonal terms of the group admittance matrix are added to the bus admittance matrix in the same way as self admittances of uncoupled elements while the off-diagonal terms are added in a matrix operation either before or after the diagonal terms. A relationship is indicated between the admit-tance connection matrix and the group element bus incidence matrix. Although the presence of mutual coupling results in some loss of spal-sity, it is shown that for power systems the bus admittance matrix still has a large proportion of zero terms. By eliminating terms below the main diagonal in an optimal order, a "factored inverse" of the admittance matrix is derived which has considerably fewer non-zero terms than the corresponding bus impedance matrix. Terms of the Impedance matrix can be obtained from the inverse as required. The numerical calculation of the bus admittance matrix of a power system zero sequence network is set out and derivation of fault impedance and current distribution factors included. A digital computer programme using the bus admittance matrix and factored inverse method for power system short circuit studies is described and a tabulation indicates the affect on computer storage requirements of the optimal factoring procedure. In part C Newton's method of power system load flow calculation using Gaussian elimination to solve the voltage correction equations is discussed. The network and problem parameters are specified in <b>rectangular</b> <b>cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinates.</b> As the voltage correction equation matrix has the same form as the bus admittance matrix, a preferred order for the Gaussian elimination which preserves sparsity is devised by analogy with network reduction. A digital computer load flow programme is outlined and a tab-ulation included which shows that, for typical power system networks, the preferred elimination order retains sparsity in the matrix. Algol listings of the digital computer short circuit and load flow programmes are included in the supplement with data and corresponding calculated results for power system studies...|$|E
40|$|Tiris {{thesis is}} about the {{creation}} of a numerical model and its application to Macquarie Harbour (Tasmania, Australia). With the aim being to better understand the harbour and aid the management of its environment and industry. A numerical model was developed through the combination of an original two-dimensional laterally averaged river model and an existing three-dimensional ocean model. The existing three-dimensional model used is the Princeton Oceanographic Model (POM) by Blumberg and Mellor (1987), which is used for modelling the harbour. The author's river model is used for the two main rivers flowing into Macquarie Harbour, and part of the ocean surrounding the harbour. The river model is based on non-Boussinesq primitive equations, which include the density terms neglected in the commonly used Boussinesq approximation. These density terms are important where there are large salinity stratifications, which occur in the rivers flowing into Macquarie Harbour. The primitive equations for the model are derived in a <b>rectangular</b> <b>Cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> system and then transformed to a a co-ordinate system. The a coordinate system transformation, also used by POM, non-dimensionalises depth - resulting in a more accurate and efficient method for handling a varying bathymetry. The river model is solved with a finite difference implicit scheme, which is numerically centred in space and time. As the models' bathymetries vaiy from 1 to 90 m, to get the required resolution in the deeper sections with the a co-ordinates, the resulting vertical spacing in the shallow sections is small. Hence, the finite difference equations are solved vertically, which avoids a restrictive Courant, Friedrichs and Lewy (CFL) time restraint with the explicit finite difference operators. The model successfully predicts the general circulation and pollution distribution in the harbour, agreeing to within 36...|$|R

As a first step, this study compared the standard deviation (SD) in contour delineation using Polar and <b>Cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> for whole breast. Whole breast Clinical Target Volumes (CTV) were delineated by eight observers for 9 patients. The SD of contour position was determined for Polar co-ordinates at 1 degree increments for 5 slices and averaged across all patients.

The SD was determined for <b>Cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> for medial-lateral and anterior-posterior positions. At slice Z= 0 cm considering Polar co-ordinates, the SD peaked medially reaching 3. 55 cm at 15 degrees for the right breast, and 1. 44 cm at 171 degrees for the left. The SD of the remaining slices maintained a similar distribution, with variation in the peak occurring within 10 degrees of the Z= 0 cm positions. by comparison, for <b>Cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> at slice Z= 0 cm, the largest SD in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions was 0. 54 / 0. 57 cm and 1. 03 / 0. 67 cm respectively for right/left breasts.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of location fingerprinting to be de-ployed in the real offices is the training database handling process, which does not scale well with increasing amount of tracking space to be covered.

40|$|Development {{of a novel}} {{two-dimensional}} estuarine {{hydrodynamic model}} in cylindrical co-ordinates is presented herein. The full non-linear Navier-Stokes equations are written in cylindrical co-ordinates with {{the advantage of the}} co-ordinate system fitting the estuary 2 ̆ 7 s shape. Thus the bending of the coastline can be more accurately described. Also, this way a fine mesh is obtained in the coastal area, while a coarse mesh is defined away from the coast provided that the position of the pole is appropriately chosen. The new model aims at improving the resolution of study areas and getting results without increasing computational costs. Validation of the cylindrical co-ordinates numerical model is done by comparison with robust industry-standard models, tidal basin measurements and analytical solution. Three test cases are proposed for comparison with other numerical models: horizontal bed with constant value of the scale factors in the radial direction, horizontal bed with one variation of the scale factors in the radial direction, horizontal bed with two variations of the scale factors in the radial direction. Variation of the scale factors in the radial direction is done with an exponential function. Comparisons with results of the two numerical models show very good agreement. Comparison with tidal basin data is done in three cases: cylindrical co-ordinates (the rectangular geometry is generated from cylindrical <b>co-ordinates),</b> uniform <b>Cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinates,</b> and non-uniform <b>Cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinates.</b> Results showed that agreement was achieved in all cases. Finally, agreement between analytical solution and results of the numerical model shows the potential of the cylindrical co-ordinates numerical model for estuarine hydrodynamic modelling. In terms of computational savings, the model proved to be four times faster than the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> numerical model ran at the finest resolution in the cylindrical co-ordinates numerical model. Compared to the general orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinates model, the new model is three times slower since this is a preliminary development of the cylindrical co-ordinates model and further improvement is required...|$|R

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] spectral element method for the two-dimensional shallow water equations on the sphere is presented. The equations {{are written in}} conservation form and the domains are discretized using quadrilateral elements obtained from the generalized icosahedral grid introduced previously (Giraldo FX. Lagrange-Galerkin methods on spherical geodesic grids: the shallow water equations. Journal of Computational Physics 2000; 160 : 336 - 368). The equations are written in <b>Cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> that introduce an additional momentum equation, but the pole singularities disappear. This paper represents a departure from previously published work on solving the shallow water equations on the sphere in that the equations are all written, discretized, and solved in three-dimensional Cartesian space. Because the equations are written in a three-dimensional <b>Cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> system, the algorithm simplifies into the integration of surface elements on the sphere from the fully three-dimensional equations. A mapping (Song Ch, Wolf JP. The scaled boundary finite element method-alias consistent infinitesimal finite element cell method-for diffusion. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 1999; 45 : 1403 - 1431) which simplifies these computations is described and is shown to contain the Eulerian version of the method introduced previously by Giraldo (Journal of Computational Physics 2000; 160 : 336 - 368) for the special case of triangular elements. The significance of this mapping is that although the equations are written in <b>Cartesian</b> <b>co-ordinates,</b> the mapping {{takes into account the}} curvature of the high-order spectral elements, thereby allowing the elements to lie entirely {{on the surface of the}} sphere. In addition, using this mapping simplifies all of the three-dimensional spectral-type finite element surface integrals because any of the typical two-dimensional planar finite element or spectral element basis functions found in any textbook (for example, Huebner et al.
