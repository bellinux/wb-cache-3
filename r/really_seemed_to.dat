500|$|Despite {{several options}} at Triple-A (AAA), when Freddy García got hurt, Pat Gillick {{promoted}} Kendrick {{to the major}} leagues, which drew skepticism, as Kendrick was just 22 years old, and had not pitched particularly well for Reading. However, according to Steve Noworyta, Phillies assistant director of player development, Kendrick's [...] "mound presence and his maturity", {{as well as the}} fact that [...] "nothing <b>really</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> bother him" [...] contributed to his promotion. His MLB debut came on June 13 against the Chicago White Sox at Citizens Bank Park. He pitched six innings and gave up three runs, receiving a no-decision in an 8–4 Phillies' victory. He pitched the second game of the 2007 National League Division Series against the Colorado Rockies, which the Phillies lost, en route to being swept in the series. He finished the season with a 10–4 win–loss record and a 3.87 ERA in 121 MLB innings pitched. He came in fifth place, ultimately losing to Ryan Braun, in 2007 National League Rookie of the Year Award voting.|$|E
500|$|Morley took a {{break from}} Neighbours in mid-2012, which led the writers to improvise an {{on-screen}} break up for Aidan and Chris. The break up occurs after Aidan learns Chris has not told his parents {{that they are in}} a relationship. Mason said that Chris is fine with his friends knowing about his relationship, but it is different story {{when it comes to his}} parents. His father has not always made things easy for him in the past, so he does not give him and his mother a chance to get to know Aidan. When Chris' parents throw him a birthday party at Lassiter's Lake, he decides not to invite Aidan. However, Aidan learns about the party from Andrew and he feels [...] "hurt and humiliated" [...] by Chris' actions. Aidan makes it clear to Chris that their relationship is over and Mason added [...] "That's when the gravity of the situation hits Chris, and he's left in shock. He thinks, 'How did it come to this?'. Things <b>really</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be falling into place with Aidan." [...] Chris then learns that his parents would have accepted the relationship and he realises that he has lost Aidan due to an assumption.|$|E
500|$|The {{conditions}} of Lamb's release were {{that he must}} spend a year living with the Barker family on their 200-acre (0.80sqkm; 0.31sqmi) farm, under the doctor's observation. The former inmate {{proved to be an}} industrious labourer, helping to fence the property and becoming one of the farm's best workers. Barker and his wife came to trust Lamb so closely that they allowed him to babysit their three-year-old daughter, who became very attached to the young man. During his time living and working on the farm, Lamb read a number of books on psychiatry, including The Mask of Sanity by Hervey M. Cleckley, which affected him particularly. He told the doctor that he had come to terms with his condition as a psychopath and that he wished to go overseas and do something purposeful with his life. At the same time, he considered a career in the military, which Barker supported. [...] "He wanted that kind of life," [...] Barker later told the Globe and Mail. [...] "He <b>really</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> need the esprit de corps of an army organisation." [...] When Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6 October 1973, starting the Yom Kippur War, Lamb thought he had found his calling—using money he had saved from his labourer's salary and gifts from his grandmother, he bought State of Israel Bonds and, with Barker's encouragement, travelled to Israel to volunteer for the Israel Defense Forces. However, after hitch-hiking to the Israeli lines, Lamb became disillusioned by conversations he had with the soldiers there, many of whom were loath to fight and wanted to go home. He applied anyway, but was turned down because of his psychiatric history. He resolved to instead tour the world, and to that end left Israel days after arriving, intending to travel to Australia.|$|E

Realizing that Willson-Piper would not respond, and in agreement with Powles at the time, [...] Kilbey said [...] "Yes, we have to find someone with stature. He has to have his own trip, he can’t be some weedy little guy coming in to play guitar. It has to be somebody with experience and gravitas." [...] As part of the same interview, Haug {{explained that}} he had {{received a phone call from}} Kilbey while he was returning home from a funeral. Without first greeting Haug, Kilbey simply asked, [...] "If I asked you to join The Church, what would you say?" [...] and ended the call after Haug's affirmative, but bewildered, response. Haug said that joining the Church was the [...] "last thing" [...] that would have entered his mind, but that [...] "it just <b>really</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> work".|$|E
