40|$|Abstract —This paper {{describes}} an optimal regenerative braking control scheme {{for a permanent}} magnet brushless DC motor to achieve goals of the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> with energy regeneration. During the braking period, the proposed method only changes the switching sequence of the inverter to control the inverse torque so that the braking energy {{will return to the}} battery. Compared with the presented methods, the proposed solution simultaneously achieves dual goals of the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> and the energy regeneration without using additional converter, ultra capacitor, or complex winding-changeover technique. Since the braking kinetic energy is converted into the electrical energy and then returns to the battery, the energy regeneration could increase the efficiency of BLDCM drive.

30|$|As a consequence, a {{considerable}} amount of the total brake effort should be distributed to traction motors, by performing regenerative or dissipative braking, according to the capability of the overhead line for managing the corresponding recovered power. In particular, not only regenerative but also dissipative <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> is quite attractive, considering the corresponding reduction of wear of friction braking components such as pads and disks. Since <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> is applied in parallel with the conventional pneumatic one, an optimized mixing strategy in the usage of both systems, usually called blending, has to be performed.|$|R
50|$|Because more {{electric}} locomotives were required {{as a result}} of the expansion of the network and the increase in traffic, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft issued a follow-on order for twelve E 91s in 1927 to cover the most pressing requirements.

2500|$|When it {{had been}} decided to {{transfer}} the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, the cars' braking was modernized further. In AMRE schedule <b>braking,</b> the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> must be activated at all times by use of the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> key to synchronize the train's braking effort electrically. If it was not [...] "cut in" [...] or failed en route, the system could still be manipulated to apply the brakes pneumatically. This would still allow the train to stop, but deceleration would take longer such as on the older AM(P) schedule braking. However, in AMRE, the notches in the brake stand to cause this pneumatic application are completely separate from the notches to cause an electric application. Therefore, if a motorman with a defective or inactive <b>electric</b> AMRE <b>brake</b> were to electrically apply the brakes, nothing would happen! Valuable seconds would be lost while he realized his <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> was inactive, before he could move to the pneumatic apply notch to begin slowing his train down (which would still take longer than usual without electric synchronization of the brakes). In a serious scenario, this could cause him to overshoot a station or an important stopping point, or overspeed. In a new braking schedule known as AMUE, however, the electric and pneumatic notches are joined together on the motorman's brake stand. Therefore, even if the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> is defective or inactive, his moving the brake handle to the apply position would still begin setting up a pneumatic application of the brakes, creating a much quicker response to the condition than possible under any other previous system. As part of the modifications for elevated service, the Composites were equipped with AMUE schedule braking from 1916 until their retirement.|$|R
30|$|Minimum {{pneumatic}} braking: in this region, the <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> {{effort is}} limited to a maximum value, often related to the motor currents. If a higher braking effort is required, then the pneumatic brake is activated to supply the difference.|$|R
50|$|Standard Lo-V cars also {{simplified}} braking for train crews. On IRT equipment, an <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> {{could be}} utilized to synchronize a braking effort and apply each car's brakes simultaneously and uniformly throughout the train. This {{was different from}} operating strictly using air (pneumatically), which was less responsive, but would still stop the train albeit more slowly. Lo-V cars simplified the braking process. On earlier IRT equipment, the braking notches were different for a motorman depending {{on whether or not}} he was operating electrically or pneumatically. On Lo-V cars, the notches were identical regardless of whether or not the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> was active. The braking system on a Lo-V car is known as AMUE.|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} of the exoskeleton-type masterarm, {{composed}} of serial links, is introduced in this paper. To provide maximum range of human motion, several redundant joints {{are added to the}} serial links. In order {{to reduce the number of}} joints to be measured, kinematics of serial links was taken into consideration in design. Three measurable, controllable joints and three redundant free joints are used for the upper arm (shoulder), similarly to the forearm (wrist) while one measurable, controllable joint is used for the elbow. In particular, a torque sensor beam is designed for fine force reflection using the strain gauge. It detects the torque as well as its direction applied by the human operator, which allows the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> to be used as an actuator for force reflection. The <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> constrains the joint movement so that the operator can feel the force. This <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> outperforms the motor in terms of torque/weight ratio and makes the device light and compact. This masterarm measures the movement of the operator’s arm precisely, and it can be used for teleoperation with a slave robot, or as a motion planner for an industrial robot. ...|$|R

50|$|Even {{with only}} 1/8 of the {{required}} braking power, there were still opportunities to stop or slow the train. First, {{there was one more}} station (Maisons-Alfort), before Gare de Lyon, which would have given the driver plenty of time to slow down or stop the train. However, to avoid throwing other trains at the Gare De Lyon station off schedule, the controllers ordered the driver to pass through Maisons-Alfort and proceed directly to Gare de Lyon. Second, the train was equipped with an additional <b>electric</b> <b>brake,</b> but according to Saulin, drivers usually disliked the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> because it was unreliable and had a strong tendency to wear down the brake pads. In any case, Saulin completely forgot about it {{as a result of his}} panic.|$|R
