40|$|Most {{important}} academic theoretical {{developments in}} finance and investment {{have been transferred}} to widespread practical use, especially in the more efficient securities markets. Real estate investment research has followed these developments, with a lag of about 20 years, but to some extent, common practice of asset allocation in a property portfolio still relies a lot on a qualitative and subjective personal judgment. To assess the reality and extent of this situation among the institutional property investors operating in the Portuguese market, a study based on a survey among a reference group of managers of large real estate portfolios was developed. This includes real estate fund management societies, pension funds and significant <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>investment</b> companies.

40|$|Tax Increment Financing (TIF) {{provides}} {{local governments}} {{with a way}} to fund public infrastructure improvements (such as roadways, bridges, ditches, water, and sewer lines) that are associated with new development. TIF programs have been widely popular since states began authorizing their use in the 1950 s. According to the Tax Increment Finance Coalition, 49 states have enabled local governments to designate TIF districts to finance public infrastructure in some manner or another. Local governments in Ohio are provided authority to redirect funds for such improvements through Ohio Revised Code (ORC) 5709. 40 - 5709. 43 for municipalities; 5709. 73 - 5709. 74 for townships; and 5709. 77 - 5709. 79 for counties. What Is Tax Increment Financing? Because Ohio’s Tax Increment Financing program (TIF) is designed to encourage new investment, it is considered by many as an economic development tool. Similar to the Ohio Enterprise Zone (EZ) program, the TIF program enables counties, municipalities, and townships to exempt from real property taxation the new value added to a parcel or group of parcels as a result of new property investment. This, however, is the extent of the similarities between the EZ program and TIF. Unlike the EZ program, TIF can be used with residential development. Another difference involves the exemption associated with a TIF. The EZ program abates taxes, whereas TIF does not change the taxpayer’s tax liability or the valuation of the taxpayer’s property. Instead, TIF enables the taxpayer to make payments to a special fund in an amount equal to the property tax liability. These payments in lieu of taxes (also referred to as PILOTs) are used by the local government to retire debt incurred for the infrastructure improvements needed to support the new <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>investment.</b> For more information on Ohio’s Enterprise Zone Program, refer to CDFS- 1552 - 9...|$|E

We employ a multifactor Arbitrage Pricing Model using prespecified macroeconomic factors. We also test whether equity REIT returns {{are related to}} changes in the discount on closed-end stock funds, which seems plausible given the closed-end nature of REITs. Three factors, and the percentage change in the discount on closed-end stock funds, consistently drive equity REIT returns: unexpected inflation and changes in the risk and term structures of interest rates. The impacts of these variables on equity REIT returns is around 60 % of the impacts on corporate stock returns generally. As expected, the impacts are greater for more heavily levered REITs than for less levered REITs. Real estate, at least as measured by the return performance of equity REITs, is less risky than stocks generally, but does not offer a superior risk-adjusted return and is not a hedge against unexpected inflation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{burst of}} the {{subprime}} mortgage crisis affected {{on a large scale}} the Italian real estate industry. The Italian real estate market underwent and is still undergoing a severe stagnancy due to the credit crunch worsened by the banking system and the resulting lack of liquidity. In financing <b>real</b> estate <b>property</b> <b>investments,</b> security packages play an extremely important role and guarantees have become a major tool for risk management and financial innovation in order to facilitate credit enhancement and hedging of risks. In this context the evaluation of guarantees and collaterals becomes extremely important.

40|$|The {{physical}} adaptability {{of buildings}} {{is very important}} in today's fast-changing business environment. The actors who invest in long-term adaptability are positioned better to the changes during the life cycle of a building. This conceptual paper argues that the current dominating <b>real</b> estate (<b>property)</b> <b>investment</b> analysis theories do not accommodate enough building design-related information (i. e. physical asset characteristics), which results in long-term loss of competitiveness and unsustainable use of built environment resources. It is demonstrated that physical asset characteristics can create valuable real options that should be acknowledged in real estate investment analysis and management. The real estate investment literature has not so far been able to produce a widely accepted financial model for justifying life-cycle investments. A theory is proposed here {{that can be used to}} value life-cycle investments in buildings. This new theory combines of real options valuation, investment analysis and building component life-cycle design. These themes are used to formulate a conceptual framework for valuing life-cycle investments. The framework is intuitive and transparent, and it can be easily added to current spreadsheet investment analysis tools. Peer reviewe...|$|R
