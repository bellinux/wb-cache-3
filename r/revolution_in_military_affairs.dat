25|$|The {{origins of}} blitzkrieg {{are in some}} doubt: if it existed, who contributed to it, whether {{it was part of}} German war {{strategy}} from 1933–1939. There has {{been a great deal of}} debate about whether it existed as a coherent military strategy. Many historians now think that blitzkrieg was not a military theory and the campaigns conducted by the Germans from 1939 to circa 1942 (with the exception of Operation Barbarossa) were improvised, rather than being based on a particular military strategy. Blitzkrieg had been called a <b>Revolution</b> <b>in</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Affairs</b> (RMA) but many writers and historians have concluded that the Germans did not invent a new form of warfare but applied new technologies to traditional ideas of Bewegungskrieg (manoeuvre warfare) to achieve decisive victory.|$|E
25|$|The Manstein Plan {{is often}} seen as either the result of or {{the cause of a}} mid-20th century <b>Revolution</b> <b>in</b> <b>military</b> <b>affairs.</b> In the former hypothesis, expounded by Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart {{immediately}} after the events, the Manstein Plan is presented as a natural outcome of the evolution of German military thinking in the twenties and thirties by Hans von Seeckt and Guderian, adopting the ideas of Fuller or Liddell Hart. If true, an explicit Blitzkrieg doctrine would have been established by 1939 and been the basis of the plan for the Invasion of Poland; the Manstein Plan would have been its most spectacular implementation. The doctrine would have been reflected in the organisation and equipment of the army and the Luftwaffe and would have been radically different from those of France, Britain and the Soviet Union, except for the contributions of individuals like Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Charles de Gaulle, Fuller and Liddell Hart. That the earliest plans by Halder or Manstein and the final plan by Halder did not conform to this doctrine is an anomaly, to be explained by circumstances.|$|E

40|$|<b>Revolutions</b> <b>in</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Affairs</b> (RMA) is {{the notion}} that {{development}} has taken the form of giant leaps caused by political, technological or organisational innovations. But how useful is RMA as a concept in historical analysis? This study examines the use of RMA as an analytic tool. Black lays down a variety of different definitions and understandings of the term, and points out a set of problems {{in the use of the}} term. RMA is at once description, analysis, prospectus and mission, and Black argues that the failure to distinguish between these different aspects surrounds the term with confusion. On these grounds, he argues that RMA has limited value as an analytic tool, and applies for caution in the use and application of both the term and concept...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} literature suggests {{different ways to}} explain the interconnection between technology, military, and society that creates changes <b>in</b> <b>military</b> <b>affairs.</b> It seems, however, that most of this literature concentrates on successful cases of military transformations and overlooks {{a significant number of}} failed transformations. The {{purpose of this article is}} to define the conceptual social-political-military environment that creates, or not, <b>military</b> transformations <b>in</b> general, and <b>revolutions</b> <b>in</b> <b>military</b> <b>affairs</b> (RMAs) <b>in</b> particular. Supporting its argument with two historical examples, this article suggests that an RMA is an outcome of traceable imbalance between political leadership, its military, and unmet political-military challenges. The conceptual framework proposed by the article significantly improves the ability of scholars and practitioners to explore, explain, and anticipate the possible directions of military transformations by a systematic examination of the political-military challenges that these transformations are intended to bridge and the socio-cultural environments that shape political-military decision-making processes...|$|R

Is RMA suffi-cient and suitable to define a change in small states security strategies? The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze to what extent RMA can be traced in Swedish strategy implementation after applying Francis Domingo’s theory of small states security strategies. The method used in this essay is a case study that analyses to what extent RMA can be found and proven by using the strategy implementation factors defined in Domingo’s theory. The result of this study shows that only two out of four strategies can prove RMA in Sweden’s implementation of security strategies. The result gives reason for criticism due to Domingo’s the-ory’s inability to trace and prove RMA and its implication in a small state’s security strategies...|$|R

Why do certain military communities have more aptitude than others to recognize discontinuities in the nature of warfare? By elaborating on the cultural approach to international relations, this issue of Defence and Security Studies will provide a plausible explanation for this intriguing problem. In describing the US transformation in the perception of warfare, Dima Adamsky asks why the cultivation of the technological seeds of the American RMA preceded the maturation of the conceptual ones, and why it took the US defense community close to a decade to acknowledge the accuracy of the assumptions of the Soviet military technical revolution (MTR).
