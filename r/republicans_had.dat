5|$|Although congressional <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> opposed Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of}} the 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> {{followed through}} {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221â€“213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E
5|$|For Register of Wills, as for City Controller, the <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> {{a primary}} fight between the Hamilton-Meade regulars and the Meehan faction. As in that contest, the regulars were victorious, nominating Robert C. Duffy, {{attorney}} and former football star, with 67,283 votes. In second came Meehan's man, Morris J. Root, with 42,977, and William P. Shermer, an independent candidate, with 8,909. The Democrats had {{an easier time}} nominating former Congressman Francis R. Smith, who trounced Joseph F. Amodie, 40,582 to 5,470. The general election contest {{was one of the}} closest on the ballot but the Republican, Duffy, still defeated the Democrat by more than 7,500 votes.|$|E
50|$|The Party faces steep {{difficulties}} in getting its candidates elected, as Democrats hugely outnumber Republicans in Washington. No <b>Republican</b> <b>has</b> ever been elected mayor since D.C. home rule began in 1975. The DC <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> had no {{representation in the}} D.C. Council since Carol Schwartz left office in 2009.|$|R

5|$|In February 2014 {{the group}} sent seven letter bombs to British Army {{recruitment}} offices in south-east England; {{the first time}} <b>republicans</b> <b>had</b> struck in Britain since 2001. The following month, a PSNI landrover was hit by an explosively formed projectile in Belfast. A civilian car was also hit by debris, {{but there were no}} injuries. The Real IRA claimed responsibility. In November 2014, a PSNI armoured jeep was hit by another 'horizontal mortar' in Derry, and in Belfast a PSNI landrover was attacked with a homemade rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with other results, this 12 percentage point margin was smaller than Gore's 25 point margin over Bush in the state Presidential contest, was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D'Amato in the hotly contested 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger Howard Mills. The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, {{because in recent decades}} the <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{proposed}} by the 104th United States Congress included term limits for Congressional Representatives, tax cuts, welfare reform, and a balanced budget amendment, as well as independent auditing of the finances of the House of Representatives and elimination of non-essential services such as the House barbershop and shoe-shine concessions. Following Gingrich's first two years as House Speaker, the Republican majority was re-elected in the 1996 election, the first time <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> done so in 68 years, {{and the first time}} simultaneously with a Democratic president winning re-election.|$|E
5|$|Randall left {{no doubt}} about his sympathies when he {{assigned}} members to the committee, stacking it with Hayes's enemies from both parties. The committee's investigation had {{the opposite of the}} Democrats' intended effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, William Tilden Pelton, offering bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. The Pelton telegrams were in code, which the committee was able to decode; <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> also sent ciphered dispatches, but the committee was unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess.|$|E
5|$|Beshear faced heavy {{deficits in}} polls against McConnell {{throughout}} {{the general election}} campaign. McConnell also raised twice {{as much money as}} Beshear during the campaign. Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a campaign issue, claiming much of the money came from political action committees that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, had voted to cut Medicare; McConnell responded that <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> not cut Medicare, but had put forward a plan to curb its growth, a plan that didn't differ significantly, McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E

5|$|Despite initial {{indications}} otherwise, Mathias {{announced on}} September 27, 1985, {{that he would}} not seek a fourth term. His announcement concerned Republican party officials in the state, who feared that local <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> poorer election chances without Mathias {{at the top of the}} ticket. At the national level, Mathias' announcement came shortly after news that Republican Paul Laxalt of Nevada would be retiring as well. The departure of two Republican senators from swing or Democratic-leaning states was treated by Republican party leaders as a poor sign of the party's chances in the upcoming elections. Linda Chavez won the Republican primary for the Senate seat, and she lost the general election to Democrat Barbara Mikulski.|$|E
5|$|In late 1832, the Democratic Party {{convention}} nominated Pierce {{for one of}} New Hampshire's five {{seats in}} the U.S. House of Representatives. This was tantamount to election for the young Democrat, as the National <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> faded as a political force, while the Whigs had not yet begun to attract a large following. Democratic strength in New Hampshire was also bolstered by Jackson's landslide re-election that year. New Hampshire had been a marginal state politically, but from 1832 through the mid-1850s became the most reliably Democratic state in the North, boosting Pierce's political career. Pierce's term began in March 1833, {{but he would not}} be sworn in until Congress met in December, and his attention was elsewhere. He had recently become engaged and bought his first house in Hillsborough. Franklin and Benjamin Pierce were among the prominent citizens who welcomed President Jackson to the state on his visit in mid-1833.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 5, 1957, involved {{the election of}} the district attorney, city controller, and the remainder of a term for one city council seat, as well as several row offices and judgeships. Democrats were successful citywide, continuing a run of victories racked up after the passage of a new city charter in 1951 despite growing divisions between factions of the party. Victor H. Blanc, the incumbent district attorney, led the Democratic ticket to victory. They held the city council seat and took two citywide offices that <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> won in 1953. In the judges' elections, most were endorsed by both parties but in the one race that pitted a Democratic candidate against a Republican, the Democrats were successful in seating their candidate, former Congressman Earl Chudoff.|$|E

5|$|The Erie County, New York <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> drafted Kemp after {{incumbent}} congressman Richard D. McCarthy {{decided to}} run for the United States Senate. During his inaugural campaign, his district was in economic malaise, and The New York Times described him as a John F. Kennedy throwback who campaigned on family values, patriotism, sports, and defense. Upon his election to the Congress in a class of sixty-two freshmen, he was one of six newcomersâ€”along with Ronald Dellums, Bella Abzug, Louise Day Hicks, Robert Drinan, and Pete du Pontâ€”discussed in Time. The article described him as a football fan like United States President Richard Nixon and as the recipient of advice from White House adviser Robert Finch and former Kemp boss Herb Klein, Nixon's director of communications. The Nixon aides encouraged Kemp to endorse the Cambodian invasion and to oppose criticism of Nixon's war policies in order to firm up Kemp's support from military hawks.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> {{formed a}} number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They {{believed}} that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic {{about the idea of}} African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E
5|$|The battleground {{proved to}} be the Midwestâ€”the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryanâ€”and the Democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states. The Northeast was {{considered}} most likely safe for McKinley after the early-voting states of Maine and Vermont supported him in September. By then, it was clear that public support for silver had receded, and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue. By the end of September, the <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> discontinued printing material on the silver issue, and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question. On November 3, 1896, the voters had their say. McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest; he won 51% of the vote and an ample majority in the Electoral College. Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue, and had not appealed to urban workers. Voters in cities supported McKinley; the only city outside the South of more than 100,000 population carried by Bryan was Denver, Colorado.|$|E

5|$|William H. West of Ohio {{nominated}} Blaine with {{an enthusiastic}} speech {{and after the}} first ballot, Blaine led the count with 334Â½ votes. While short of the necessary 417 for nomination, Blaine had far {{more than any other}} candidate with Arthur in second place at 278 votes. Blaine was unacceptable to the Arthur delegates just as Blaineâ€™s own delegates would never vote for the President, so the contest was between the two for the delegates of the remaining candidates. Blaineâ€™s total steadily increased as Logan and Sherman withdrew in his favor and some of the Edmunds delegates defected to him. Unlike in previous conventions, the momentum for Blaine in 1884 would not be halted. On the fourth ballot, Blaine received 541 votes and was, at last, nominated. Logan was named vice presidential nominee on the first ballot, and the <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> their ticket.|$|E
5|$|Franklin County, {{which has}} elected Kilroy twice, makes up 87% of the 15th Congressional {{district}}. The 2006 race in Ohio's 15th district gained significant national attention {{as it was}} seen {{as one of a}} handful of seats that Democrats had an opportunity to gain from Republicans. As of mid-October, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to incumbent Representative Pryce's leadership in the Republican Party. Pryce had not had a close contest since her first election in 1992 and had garnered 10% more of the vote than George W. Bush in 2004. However, Pryce was vulnerable due to Ohio Republican Party (Bob Taft and Bob Ney) scandals, the lagging Ohio economy, her association with controversial Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley, and backlash to Republican support of the Iraq War. Another Ohio Republican scandal in the minds of Ohio voters during the 2006 campaign was the Coingate scandal. Pryce and the <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> to keep conservative independent, Charles Morrison, off the ballot to have their best shot at success. A month before the election, Pryce was 12points behind Kilroy. On the eve of the election, some experts, such as Time, considered Pryce the underdog. Kilroy was expected to be the beneficiary of the decade-long migration of conservative voters to suburbs outside of the district.|$|E
5|$|There {{were strong}} {{factional}} conflicts inside the Ohio Republican party; {{one source of}} bitterness was the 1888 Republican National Convention. Ohio <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> endorsed the state's senior senator, John Sherman, for president. This was Sherman's third attempt at the Republican nomination; among his supporters were Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna, and Governor Foraker, whom Hanna had to that point strongly supported. After repeated balloting, Sherman did not {{get close to the}} number of delegate votes needed to nominate, and when rumors swept the convention that the party's 1884 nominee, former Maine senator James G. Blaine, might enter the race, Foraker expressed willingness to support Blaine. This dealt a serious blow to Sherman's candidacy by showing division in his home state, and the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was Ohio-born and went on to be elected. McKinley had received some delegate votes, and his action in refusing to consider a candidacy while pledged to support Sherman impressed Mark Hanna. The industrialist was outraged at Foraker and abandoned him. McKinley and Hanna shared similar political views, including support for a tariff to protect and encourage American industry, and in the years following 1888, Hanna became a strong supporter of McKinley.|$|E
