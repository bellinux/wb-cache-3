5000|$|Dental composites, {{also called}} [...] "white fillings", are {{a group of}} {{restorative}} materials used in dentistry. Crowns and in-lays {{can be made in}} the laboratory from dental composites. These materials are similar to those used in direct fillings and are tooth-colored. Their strength and durability is not as high as porcelain or metal restorations and they are more prone to wear and discolouration. As with other composite materials, a dental composite typically consists of a resin-based matrix, which contains a modified methacrylate or acrylate. Two examples of such commonly used monomers include bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate (BISMA) and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA), together with tri-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGMA). TEGMA is a comonomer which can be used to control viscosity, as Bis GMA is a big molecule with high viscosity, for easier clinical handling. Inorganic filler such as silica, quartz or glasses, are added to reduce polymerization shrinkage by occupying volume and to confirm <b>radio-opacity</b> of products due to translucency in property, which can be helpful in diagnosis of dental caries around dental restoration. The filler particles give the composites wear resistance as well. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. A coupling agent such as silane is used to enhance the bond between resin matrix and filler particles. An initiator package begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when external energy (light/heat, etc.) is applied. For example, camphorquinone can be excited by visible blue light with critical wavelength of 460-480 nm to yield necessary free radicals to start the process.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The poor {{prognosis}} of patients with persistent gastrointestinal <b>radio-opacities</b> after oral arsenic poisoning supports efficient gastrointestinal decontamination as critical for survival. In a case of massive arsenic ingestion, we performed repetitive gastric endoscopy and a continuous alkaline irrigation of the stomach over several days. CASE REPORT: A 41 -year-old woman was admitted 4 hours after intentional ingestion of trivalent arsenic powder 5 g. The admission abdominal X-ray confirmed the presence of multiple gastric opacities. Initial treatment was gastric lavage with normal saline, dimercaprol chelation, and supportive therapy. Since gastric opacities persisted on the abdominal X-ray at 34 hours despite repeated gastric lavage, a gastroscopy was performed showing nonremovable agglomerates. In an attempt to achieve further gastric decontamination, we performed a continuous gastric alkaline irrigation. After 3 days of alkaline irrigation, the abdomen was normal on X-ray but the gastroscopy still showed arsenic concretions. Alkaline irrigation was continued for another 3 days until total disappearance of arsenic agglomerates at the gastroscopy. Admission urinary arsenic was 3663 microg/L.

Overall stone free status is significantly lower on obese patients comparing the normal weight patients on a univariate analysis (p =  0.013).

Current treatments of aneurysms, both surgical and endovascular, involve isolation of the weakened area of artery {{from the rest of the}} vasculature. However, current filling methods do not result in optimal healing. Therefore, we are developing an alternative filling method using shape memory polymer (SMP) foams. This dissertation addresses multiple post processing methods and characterization of these SMP foams. The goals for characterizations addressed include 1) microstructure, 2) <b>radio-opacity,</b> 3) biocompatibility, 4) mechanical reticulation, 5) flow visualization via magnetic resonance imaging and 6) permeability measurements. The microstructure of the SMP foams was imaged via micro-computed tomography imaging methods at high resolution, 4 ?m/voxel. At this resolution we were able to resolve membranes, struts and obtain 3 D models of the foam for computational fluid dynamic simulations. Histogram data of average pore cells sizes in multiple axes were also measured. It was shown that these materials are anisotropic and heterogeneous. Increased <b>radio-opacity</b> via loading methods resulted in x-ray based visualization of devices made of these materials during endovascular implantation. The addition of high-z element particulates for <b>radio-opacity</b> resulted in a stronger or composite version of the material. It was shown that these shape memory polymer foams were biocompatible when implanted in a porcine aneurysm model. The implants elicited healing, were completely isolated from the parent vessel and covered with a complete endothelial cell layer at ninety days. A non-destructive mechanical reticulation device was made to puncture the membranes of the foams and thereby increase flow permeation. The permeability, or pressure drop induced by the samples was measured. Permeability results showed that with the increased amount of mechanical reticulation resulted in increased permeability of these materials. Flow visualization within the samples was achieved via MRI at sub pore cell resolution. All of this research aids in not only the understanding but also the development of these materials as a viable medical device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms and other vascular applications...|$|E
