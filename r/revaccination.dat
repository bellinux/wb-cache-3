60|$|Here we {{have the}} {{explanation}} of the savage rancor that so amazes people who imagine that the controversy concerning vaccination is a scientific one. It has really {{nothing to do with}} science. The medical profession, consisting for the most part of very poor men struggling to keep up appearances beyond their means, find themselves threatened with the extinction of a considerable part of their incomes: a part, too, that is easily and regularly earned, since it is independent of disease, and brings every person born into the nation, healthy or not, to the doctors. To boot, there is the occasional windfall of an epidemic, with its panic and rush for <b>revaccination.</b> Under such circumstances, vaccination would be defended desperately were it twice as dirty, dangerous, and unscientific in method as it actually is. The note of fury in the defence, the feeling that the anti-vaccinator is doing a cruel, ruinous, inconsiderate thing in a mood of indignant folly: all this, so puzzling to the observer who knows nothing of the economic side of the question, and only sees that the anti-vaccinator, having nothing whatever to gain and a good deal to lose by placing himself in opposition to the law and to the outcry that adds private persecution to legal penalties, can have no interest in the matter except the interest of a reformer in abolishing a corrupt and mischievous superstition, becomes intelligible the moment the tragedy of medical poverty and the lucrativeness of cheap vaccination is taken into account.|$|E
6000|$|Medical {{theories}} {{are so much}} a matter of fashion, and the most fertile of them are modified so rapidly by medical practice and biological research, which are international activities, that the play which furnishes the pretext for this preface is already slightly outmoded, though I believe it may be taken as a faithful record for the year (1906) in which it was begun. I must not expose any professional man to ruin by connecting his name with the entire freedom of criticism which I, as a layman, enjoy; but it will be evident to all experts that my play could not have been written but for the work done by Sir Almroth Wright in the theory and practice of securing immunization from bacterial diseases by the inoculation of [...] "vaccines" [...] made of their own bacteria: a practice incorrectly called vaccinetherapy (there is nothing vaccine about it) apparently because it is what vaccination ought to be and is not. Until Sir Almroth Wright, following up one of Metchnikoff's most suggestive biological romances, discovered that the white corpuscles or phagocytes which attack and devour disease germs for us do their work only when we butter the disease germs appetizingly for them with a natural sauce which Sir Almroth named opsonin, and that our production of this condiment continually rises and falls rhythmically from negligibility to the highest efficiency, nobody had been able even to conjecture why the various serums that were from time to time introduced as having effected marvellous cures, presently made such direful havoc of some unfortunate patient that they had to be dropped hastily. The quantity of sturdy lying that was necessary to save the credit of inoculation in those days was prodigious; and {{had it not been for}} the devotion shown by the military authorities throughout Europe, who would order the entire disappearance of some disease from their armies, and bring it about by the simple plan of changing the name under which the cases were reported, or for our own Metropolitan Asylums Board, which carefully suppressed all the medical reports that revealed the sometimes quite appalling effects of epidemics of <b>revaccination,</b> there is no saying what popular reaction might not have taken place against the whole immunization movement in therapeutics.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In the pre-highly active {{antiretroviral}} therapy era, a loss {{of specific}} antibodies was seen. Our objective with {{this study was to}} describe the loss of specific antibodies during treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: In a prospective, single-center, cohort study of 59 children with HIV- 1 infection, we investigated the long-term effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on the titers and course of specific antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine strains compared with wild-type varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus. RESULTS: During highly active antiretroviral therapy, age-adjusted CD 4 + T cells and B cells increased, whereas total immunoglobulin levels declined. Although these children were preimmunized before the start of highly active antiretroviral therapy, only 24 (43 %) had antibodies against all 3 measles, mumps, and rubella. Antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella were lost in 14 (40 %), 11 (38 %), and 5 (11 %) children who were seropositive at baseline. We also observed loss of varicella zoster virus immunoglobulin G in 7 (21 %) of 34, cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G in 3 (7 %) of 45, but none of 53 Epstein-Barr virus-seropositive children.

40|$|AbstractLong-term {{survival}} after allogeneic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} transplantation requires intact immunosurveillance, which is hampered by lymphoid organ damage associated with conditioning therapy, graft-versus-host disease, and immunosuppression. Our study aimed to identify the mechanisms contributing to sustained low memory B cell numbers after transplantation. Peripheral B and T cell subset recovery and functional marker expression were investigated in 35 acute leukemic patients up to 1  year after transplantation. Apoptosis of B cells after CD 40 /TLR- 9, CD 40 /BCR, and CD 40 /BCR/TLR- 9 -dependent stimulation and drug efflux capacity were analyzed. One half of the patients suffered from infections after day 180. All patients had strongly diminished CD 27 + memory B cells despite already normalized total B cell numbers and fully recovered CD 27 −IgD− memory B cells, putatively of extra-follicular origin. Circulating memory follicular helper T cells were reduced {{in the majority of}} patients as well. Naïve B cells exhibited a decreased expression of CXCR 5, which mediates follicular B cell entry. Additionally, a lower HLA-DR expression was found on naïve B cells, impairing antigen presentation. Upon CD 40 /TLR- 9 –dependent activation, B cells underwent significantly increased apoptosis paralleled by an aberrant up-regulation of Fas-L on activated T cells and Fas on resting B cells. Significantly increased B cell apoptosis was also observed after CD 40 /BCR and CD 40 /BCR/TLR- 9 –dependent activation. Drug efflux capacity of naïve B cells was diminished in cyclosporin A–treated patients, additionally contributing to an apoptosis-prone phenotype. We conclude that B cell survival and migration and T cell communication defects are contributing candidates for an impaired germinal center formation of memory B cells after allogeneic {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation. Follow-up studies should evaluate effectiveness of <b>revaccinations</b> on the cellular level and should address the long-term sequelae of B cell defects after transplantation...|$|R

The toxin neutralizing ability of induced antibodies was evaluated using an in vitro toxin neutralization assay. The protection afforded by the vaccine was also assessed in vaccinates. Anti-rPA, anti-FIS and lethal toxin neutralizing titres were superior after booster vaccinations, compared to single vaccinations. Qualitative analysis of humoral responses to rPA, rBclA and FIS antigens revealed a preponderance of anti-FIS IgG titres following either single or double vaccinations with the SLSV. Antibodies against FIS and rPA both increased by 350 and 300 -fold following <b>revaccinations</b> respectively. There was no response to rBclA following vaccinations with the SLSV. Toxin neutralizing titres increased by 80 -fold after single vaccination and 700 -fold following a double vaccination.

40|$|SUMMARY Treatment of {{malignancies}} with {{cytotoxic chemotherapy}} and/or bone marrow or stem cell transplantation also suppress {{the immune system}} which becomes incapable of controlling infections. Therefore infections can remain a serious problem {{for an extended period}} in these patients. The aims of these studies was to assess the immunological status against tetanus and pneumococci and the need of <b>revaccinations.</b> It was hypothesized that the immunity of the donor replaces the immunity of the patient after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). However, recipients of allogeneic marrow grafts frequently lost pretransplant immunity against tetanus after transplantation. After reimmunization with tetanus toxoid all patients responded with an adequate antibody production. Our further studies have shown similar findings in recipients of autologous grafts; the tetanus. immunity was defective both after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) and autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (APBSCT). None of the patients who were seronegative seroconverted spontaneously without vaccination. Also patients treated for hematological malignancies with cytotoxic chemotherapy were in a high frequency unprotected against tetanus. The risk factors for loss of immunity against tetanus were increasing age, lymphoid malignancy and advanced disease stage. All these patient groups can therefore benefit from tetanus vaccination; a three dose immunization schedule was superior to obtain a long -lasting imrnunity. Serologic studies of pneumococcal immunity showed that ABMT recipients retained pretransplant immunity, while it was lost in BMT patients. Immunization with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was effective in BMT patients without chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), while patients with chronic GVHD responded with an immature antibody pattem or did not respond at all. The poor antigenicity of the polysaccharide based vaccines was noted previously in immunocompromised patients. Therefore vaccines with polysaccharide conjugated to peptide were developed. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine seems to eli t better immune response than polysaccharide vaccine in BMT patients with chronic GVHD. The immune system matures slowly after transplantation and the patients have usually nommalized levels of immunoglobulins within one year. The specific immunity is defective in immunocompromised patients and there is no correlation between levels of specific antibodies and total immunoglobulin levels...|$|R

40|$|Background. There {{are about}} 400 million {{hepatitis}} B carriers in the world, of these some 20, 000 live in Slovenia. Due {{to the low}} prevalence of chronic hepatitis B carriers in our country, the infection is most frequently transmitted by means of sexual intercourse with an infected person, or parenterally, by blood. Perinatal transmissions from an infected mother to her child which represent the most frequent infection route in the hyperendemic regions of Asia and Africa, should not be ignored either. Methods. A retrospective study was carried out at the Department for Infectious Diseases and Febrile Conditions of the General Hospital Celje with the aim to assess the success of postnatal and later prophylaxis of children against hepatitis B infection for the period 1997 – 2002.  Children aged 1 – 5 years were examined using clinical, biochemical and virological tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. Results. We examined 23 out of 33 invited HBsAg positive mothers and their children, who received immediate postnatal prophylaxis with specific immunoglobulins and vaccination against hepatitis B. Afterwards they received two additional vaccinations in a Pediatric Clinic or in an Institute of public health Celje. At the time of follow-up examination none of the children had positive serum markers for active viral infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. All the children had sufficiently high titers of protective antibodies against hepatitis B virus present in the serum (> 10 IU/ml). AgHBs became negative in one mother only while the rest remained asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B virus. Consequently no treatment was required. Conclusions. Regardless of the outstandingly favorable results of postnatal prophylaxis against hepatitis B in our study subjects, {{the small number of}} children receiving this protection and the short follow-up period do not allow any long-term prognoses. Considering the high titers of protective antibodies in most of children, we presume that further <b>revaccinations</b> will not be necessary. The programs of preschool children screenings should also include follow-up tests for hepatitis B in children of HBsAg positive mothers who have received prophylaxis against hepatitis B after delivery. Early vaccination against hepatitis B of the whole preschool children population, which has been practiced in our country since 1998, will help to prevent many asymptomatic chronic and advancing infection with hepatitis B virus already in early childhood. </p...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{still remains}} {{the leading cause}} of {{mortality}} due to bacterial pathogen. The only currently available vaccine against TB, Bacille Calmette-GuĂŠrin (BCG) is at best credited with a 50 % overall protective efficacy. Skin testing with purified protein derivative (PPD) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the method of detecting BCG-induced cell mediated immunity, in vivo. In the previous study we found that approximately 60 % young volunteers with no history of TB, who had been subjected to neonatal BCG vaccination and <b>revaccination(s)</b> at school age, developed delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to tuberculin. The remaining volunteers were persistently tuberculin negative. Moreover, we found a significant association between BCG driven development of DTH to PPD and the polymorphism within the CD 14 C/T(- 159) gene for macrophage receptor recognising mycobacterial compounds. It has suggested that the CD 14 gene variants {{may play a role in}} the appearance and persistence of DTH to PPD in BCG vaccinated subjects. In order to extend our study on a possible role of CD 14 in BCG driven DTH response to PPD, we measured the expression of mCD 14 on macrophages, stimulated or not stimulated with mycobacterial antigens, and the serum levels of sCD 14. Considering the importance of CD 14 - TLR 2 /TLR 4 interactions in macrophage signalling, we determined the polymorphism of TLR 2 and TLR 4 genes as well as macrophage expression of TLR 2 for the volunteers with and without skin reactivity to PPD. We observed a subtle but significant decrease in CD 14 density on adherent monocytes from tuberculin positive versus tuberculin negative volunteers. However, we found no difference in CD 14 density on monocytes enriched in CD 14 + cells using anti-CD 14 mAb coupled to magnetic beads. A significant increase in CD 14 density was observed on macrophages stimulated with PPD and LPS but not with live BCG bacilli. However, this increase as well as serum levels of soluble sCD 14 were similar in the volunteers with and without skin reactions to PPD. Thus, our suggestion on the role of CD 14 in the generation of DTH to tuberculin in BCG vaccinated subjects should be further explored. The most important CD 14 co-receptors are Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which activate nuclear factors for the production of inflammatory cytokines. However, we could see no association between the polymorphisms of TLR 4 (Asp 299 Gly and Thr 399 Ile) and TLR 2 genes (Arg 753 Gln and Arg 677 Trp) and skin responses to PPD. Also, the TLR 2 density was similar on monocytes from tuberculin negative and tuberculin positive volunteers...|$|R

Animais caracterizados como não reatores para 24 sorovares de Leptospira sp pelo teste de soroaglutinação microscópica (SAM) e que nunca haviam sido vacinados contra a leptospirose foram divididos em três grupos: grupo A (n= 08) : recebeu duas doses, em intervalo de 30 dias, de bacterina comercial anti-leptospirose A; grupo B (n= 08) : recebeu duas doses, em intervalo de 30 dias de bacterina comercial anti-leptospirose B e grupo C (n= 08) : controle, não vacinado contra a leptospirose. As colheitas de sangue foram efetuadas a cada 30 dias durante seis meses a partir da primeira vacinação. Os soros foram submetidos aos testes da SAM e de inibição do crescimento de leptospiras in vitro (ICL) para avaliar, respectivamente, os níveis de anticorpos aglutinantes e neutralizantes. Foi constatado que os anticorpos neutralizantes persistem por mais tempo que os aglutinantes e que a ausência de anticorpos neutralizantes não corresponde a ausência dos aglutinantes. Os picos de anticorpos aglutinantes foram obtidos pelo menos 30 dias antes dos produzidos pelos neutralizantes. Houve diferença nos níveis de anticorpos neutralizantes induzidos pelas duas bacterinas testadas. O período de indução de anticorpos neutralizantes contra o sorovar Hardjo indica que marrãs devem ser imunizadas com duas doses de bacterina anti-leptospirose aplicadas com 30 dias de intervalo e pelo menos 90 dias antes da primeira cobertura. A manutenção de níveis elevados de anticorpos neutralizantes exige revacinações semestrais...|$|R

40|$|Tese de Doutoramento Ciências da Saúde – Ciências Biológicas e BiomédicasWorldwide, Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} {{infections are}} responsible for approximately 2 million deaths each year and the control of tuberculosis {{remains one of the}} most important challenges in the fight against infectious disease. The struggle against this mycobacterial infection has been performed using the vaccine M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and the administration of anti-mycobacterial drugs. However it is clear that vaccination has to be improved for the following reasons: i) the efficacy of BCG vaccination is not satisfactory, ranging from 0 - 80 %, ii) there has been an increase of mycobacterial strains resistant to the most common drugs actually used. The development of new vaccines requires however that significant effort be put into the study of the host-parasite interactions in this infection. It is with this in mind that I have investigated the cellular response to the vaccine BCG. It is known that interferon (IFN) -γ, associated with the development of acquired immune responses mediated by T helper (Th) 1 lymphocytes, plays an essential role in the control of infection by mycobacteria. IFN-γ-gene-deficient (ifn 2 -/-) mice are highly susceptible to mycobacterial infection and exhibit enhanced accumulation of activated effector T cells and neutrophils within granulomatous lesions. Nevertheless these T cells are not associated with control of bacterial growth and are associated with the development of pathology. Recently a new phenotype of T lymphocytes (Th 17), which is associated with the development of inflammatory type of responses and pathology, has been described. Th 17 cells produce mainly interleukin (IL) - 17, IL- 6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). IL- 17 can act on macrophages inducing the expression of TNF, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulatin factor (GM-CSF) and IL- 8, resulting in the maturation and recruitment of neutrophils. The dynamics and regulation of these cells following infection by bacteria are poorly understood. I have therefore examined the kinetics of Th 1 and Th 17 cellular response following infection by BCG. My data show that in C 57 BL/ 6 mice infected with BCG, both IFN-γ and IL- 17 -producing T cells develop early after infection, however only IFN-γ-producing T cells expand as infection progresses. In contrast, in ifn 2 -/- mice infected with BCG the number of IL- 17 -producing T cells increases dramatically. These observations point to a regulatory role of IFN-γ on the differentiation of Th 17 cells. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this observation, CD 4 T cells from OT II transgenic mice were cultured in the presence of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) infected with BCG and the cognate antigen. I observed that in these conditions a significant number of Th 17 cells differentiate and that the differentiation of these cells can be inhibited by the presence of IFN-γ. Furthermore IFN-γ, by increasing the production of IL- 12 and decreasing the synthesis of IL- 23 (a cytokine important for the differentiation of Th 17 cells), modulates the differentiation of Th 1 and Th 17 cells. These data reinforce the necessity to perform further studies to understand the dynamics of Th 1 /Th 17 cells following infection by mycobacteria as well as the regulatory role of IFN-γ. Although IL- 17 is induced soon after mycobacterial infection, the effect of IL- 17 on the bactericidal activity of macrophages was not known. To address this question bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) were infected with M. tuberculosis or M. bovis BCG, and treated with IFN-γ, IL- 17 or both. I have shown that IL- 17 increases the susceptibility of macrophages to the intracellular infection with mycobacteria and that it inhibits the macrophage bactericidal activity induced by IFN-γ. This effect of IL- 17 is not dependent on the macrophage effector mechanisms related with nitric oxide production or phagosome maturation. Surprisingly, IL- 17 alone but not in the presence of IFN-γ, increases macrophage survival which is related to an increased expression of IL- 6, a cytokine known to induce cell survival. These data illustrate the potential for IL- 17 to have an impact on disease progression and support the necessity to elucidate the role of IL- 17 on mycobacterially-infected macrophages. The differentiation and persistence of Th 17 cells has been considered responsible for several pathologies, including those associated with autoimmune and chronic infectious diseases. This is of interest as a well-known phenomenon of mycobacterial infection is the Koch reaction. This reaction occurs in mycobacterially-infected hosts re-exposed to mycobacterial antigens and is characterized by a massive influx of neutrophils and damaging pathologic consequences. As a result of the low level of protection afforded by BCG vaccination, and because protection is not long-lived, it has been proposed that re-vaccination should be considered. In view of the potential for Koch reaction in response to re-vaccination it is therefore essential that we have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to the Koch reaction; specifically whether Th 17 cells play a role. To address this question, C 57 BL/ 6 mice were infected with M. tuberculosis. Fifteen days after infection mice were vaccinated sub-cutaneously once, twice or three-times with BCG, with an interval of fifteen days between each vaccination. Importantly I determined that the number of Th 17 cells increases with the number of M. bovis BCG <b>revaccinations.</b> Since the presence of Th 17 cells has been associated with the induction of cytokines and chemokines responsible for the differentiation and recruitment of neutrophils, I postulate that neutrophils {{are responsible for}} the pathology and tissue damage associated to the Koch reaction. In summary, my work has identified potential new mechanisms into the complex network of immune responses, occurring in response to infection and vaccination with mycobacteria. Specifically, I have demonstrated a role for IFN-γ in the regulation of Th 17 cells differentiation, and the relevance of IL- 23 in the sustained differentiation of Th 17 cells. I have also shown that IL- 17 inhibits the bactericidal activity of infected macrophages. This has the potential to be important and of biological relevance but the role of this molecule in bacterial control must be clarified. Finally, my data support a role for IL- 17 in the pathology associated to the Koch reaction and this is important for the understanding of this unique reaction. Altogether my results point to the fact that the dynamics and effector function of Th 17 cells have to be taken into consideration for a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to resistance and/or pathology following infection by M. tuberculosis, as well as for the design of new vaccines. As infecções por Mycobacterium tuberculosis constituem um grave problema de saúde pública a nível mundial, sendo responsáveis por cerca de 2 milhões de mortes por ano. O controlo da infecção por M. tuberculosis tem vindo a ser feito pelo recurso à vacinação com M. bovis Bacilo Calmette-Guérin (BCG) e pela administração de fármacos anti-micobacterianos. Contudo é cada vez mais evidente que o desenvolvimento de novas vacinas é fundamental tendo em consideração: i) que a eficácia da vacinação por BCG é muito variável, com um grau de protecção que varia entre 0 - 80 %, dependendo de factores genéticos das populações e também de factores ambientais, ii) que se tem assistido nas últimas décadas a um aparecimento cada vez mais acentuado de estirpes de M. tuberculosis multi-resistentes aos fármacos disponíveis. Neste contexto, um conhecimento mais profundo das interacções parasita-hospedeiro é necessário para que se possam desenvolver estratégias preventivas e terapêuticas mais eficazes. Tendo por base este conhecimento, fui estudar a resposta celular à vacinação por BCG. A produção de interferão (IFN) -γ, associada ao desenvolvimento de respostas imunes adquiridas do tipo de linfócitos T de ajuda (Th) 1, desempenha um papel fundamental no controlo das infecções por micobactérias, pelo seu papel na potenciação dos mecanismos efectores dos macrófagos e na formação de granulomas. A formação de granulomas também ocorre em ratinhos deficientes em IFN-γ infectados por micobactérias. No entanto, estas estruturas exibem uma acumulação de neutrófilos e células T efectoras. Apesar da presença destas células no local da infecção, não se verifica o controlo do crescimento bacteriano, observando-se o desenvolvimento de patologia. Recentemente, foi descrito um novo fenótipo de linfócitos T designado por Th 17. Estas células produzem essencialmente interleucina (IL) - 17, IL- 6 e factor de necrose tumoral (TNF) e estão associadas ao desenvolvimento de respostas inflamatórias. A acção da IL- 17 sobre os macrófagos induz a expressão de TNF, factor estimulador de colónias de granulócitos e macrófagos (GM-CSF) e IL- 8. Contudo, a dinâmica, regulação e função efectora destas células após uma infecção por micobactérias não são conhecidas. Neste sentido, decidimos estudar a dinâmica das células Th 1 e Th 17 após uma infecção por BCG. Os resultados mostram que a infecção de ratinhos selvagens por BCG induz a diferenciação de células T produtoras de IFN-γ e de células T produtoras de IL- 17. No entanto, apenas o número de células T produtoras de IFN-γ expande durante o curso da infecção. Pelo contrário, a infecção por BCG em ratinhos deficientes em IFN-γ resulta numa expansão do número das células T produtoras de IL- 17. Esta observação sugere que o IFN-γ regula negativamente a diferenciação de células Th 17. Para elucidar o mecanismo por detrás desta observação, células T CD 4 + de ratinhos transgénicos (OT II) foram cultivadas com células dendríticas derivadas da medula óssea (BMDC) infectadas com BCG e antigénio. Nestas condições, observou-se a diferenciação de um elevado número de células Th 17, sendo esta diferenciação inibida pela presença de IFN- γ. Observou-se, ainda, que o IFN-γ, aumentando a produção de IL- 12 e inibindo a produção da IL- 23 (uma citocina importante para a diferenciação de células Th 17), modela a diferenciação de células Th 1 e Th 17. Os meus resultados mostram, pela primeira vez, que a IL- 17 pode estar envolvida na patologia associada a infecções por micobactérias e que as células Th 17 são reguladas pelo IFN-γ. Estes resultados realçam a importância de estudar a dinâmica das células Th 1 /Th 17, assim como o papel regulador do IFN-γ. No decurso das infecções experimentais por micobactérias a IL- 17 é induzida numa fase precoce, no entanto, o seu papel na actividade bactericida dos macrófagos não é conhecido. Para avaliar o efeito da IL- 17 na actividade dos fagócitos, macrófagos derivados da medula óssea (BMDM) foram infectados com M. tuberculosis ou M. bovis BCG e tratados com IFN-γ ou IL- 17. Os resultados mostram que a IL- 17 aumenta a susceptibilidade dos macrófagos a infecções por micobactérias e que, adicionalmente, inibe a acção bactericida induzida pelo IFN-γ. Observei ainda que estes efeitos não são dependentes da produção de óxido nítrico nem da maturação do fagosoma, dois mecanismos efectores do macrófago descritos como intervindo no controlo das infecções por micobactérias. Verificou-se, ainda, que a IL- 17 aumentava a sobrevivência in vitro dos macrófagos infectados. Dada a capacidade da IL- 17 induzir nos macrófagos um aumento da expressão de IL- 6, uma citoquina conhecida pelo seu efeito na sobrevivência de várias populações de células, podemos especular que o aumento da sobrevida dos macrófagos induzido pela IL- 17 estará relacionado com o aumento da expressão de IL- 6. Estudos adicionais serão necessários para elucidar o papel da IL- 17 na progressão da infecção por micobactérias em macrófagos. A diferenciação e persistência de células Th 17 estão associadas à patologia observada em algumas doenças auto-imunes e infecções crónicas. A exposição a antigénios micobacterianos em hospedeiros previamente infectados por M. tuberculosis resulta no desenvolvimento de uma patologia severa associada a um influxo massivo de neutrófilos, fenómeno designado por reacção de Koch. Como a protecção conferida pela vacinação por BCG é variável e tem, segundo alguns autores, uma duração de apenas 10 a 20 anos, tem-se vindo a sugerir que a re-vacinação pelo BCG seria uma estratégia para o controlo da tuberculose. Neste sentido, é necessário um conhecimento mais profundo dos mecanismos moleculares e celulares associados ao desenvolvimento da reacção de Koch. Para elucidar esta questão, ratinhos selvagens foram infectados com M. tuberculosis. Quinze dias depois, foram vacinados uma, duas ou três vezes com M. bovis BCG, com um intervalo de quinze dias entre cada vacinação. Os meus resultados mostram que o número de células Th 17 aumentava com o aumento do número de revacinações. Uma vez que a presença de células Th 17 está relacionada com o recrutamento massivo de neutrófilos, é de esperar que estes possam ser responsáveis pela patologia associada ao desenvolvimento da reacção de Koch. Em resumo, este trabalho introduz novos mecanismos na já complexa rede do desenvolvimento e regulação de respostas imunológicas, nomeadamente a regulação das células Th 17 pelo IFN-γ, e a relevância da IL- 23 na diferenciação das células Th 17. Mostrei ainda que a IL- 17, actuando nos macrófagos, inibe a sua actividade bactericida. Contudo, a relevância biológica desta observação tem que ser clarificada. Os meus resultados sugerem adicionalmente que a IL- 17, associada a um recrutamento massivo de neutrófilos, poderá ser responsável pelo desenvolvimento da patologia associada à reacção de Koch. Os resultados apresentados nesta tese abrem novas perspectivas sobre a importância do estudo da dinâmica e função das células Th 17 nas infecções por micobactérias, nomeadamente nos mecanismos envolvidos na resistência e desenvolvimento de patologia, tendo implicações para o desenvolvimento de novas estratégias preventivas.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess <b>revaccination</b> safety by determining whether pneumococcal <b>revaccination</b> is associated with greater utilization of postvaccination health care, compared with initial vaccination. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 119, 990 New York State Medicare beneficiaries 65 years of age and older who received pneumococcal vaccinations from February 1, 1999, through December 17, 1999. The study used a multivariate regression model with three primary outcome measures-emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and office visits during the two weeks postvaccination. Secondary outcome measures were specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD- 9 -CM) codes potentially related to adverse vaccine reactions.
