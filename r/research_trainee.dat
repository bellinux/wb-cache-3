Trainees whose support has terminated during 1999 - 2005 were included in this study. The data were obtained from the MSES human resources database (n= 1, 320). Additionally, trainees who were employed in 2006 were surveyed (n= 2, 093), as well as their mentors, in order to obtain additional information and mentor's feedback on their career development. The data were analysed with data mining and statistical methods. The results indicate that a third of <b>research</b> <b>trainees</b> managed to obtain a PhD degree during employment (32. 9 %), the most in natural sciences, and the least in biomedicine. A third of <b>research</b> <b>trainees</b> managed to get a permanent employment within the MSES support system after their fellowship has terminated (36. 1 %). Finally, a third of <b>research</b> <b>trainees</b> managed to publish at least one scientific article that is indexed in the Web of Science database.

A physical model based on flake-related parameters {{has been used to}} determine nonredundant measurement geometries for the complete description of the spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The analysis of experimental spectral BRDF was carried out by means of principal component analysis. From this analysis, a set of nine measurement geometries was proposed to characterize special effect coatings. It was shown that, for two different special effect coatings, these geometries provide a good prediction of their complete color shift. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

40|$|Social science {{research}} training is de-facto occupational socialisation to researcher-roles. To do research, trainees {{need to develop}} and demonstrate advanced scholarship that complies with disciplinary norms and perform tasks to pre-determined standards. Functionalist approaches to occupational socialization underpin the performative and standardised approach to research training common in universities. But {{there is more to}} research training than doing research. If truly successful, trainees will become researchers. They will take on the researcher-role and make it their own. Interpretive approaches to occupational socialization help illuminate intra- and inter-personal dimensions of role-taking and role-making, however this approach is rarely used to inform research training strategies. Occasional scholarship reveals ad-hoc application on interpretive approaches to <b>research</b> <b>trainee</b> experience (eg., 2 ̆ 2 the journey 2 ̆ 2) supervisor experience (eg., 2 ̆ 2 emotional burden of supervision 2 ̆ 2), research training methods such as peer-learning (eg., informal or fabricated groups, research micro-climates), or research training pedagogy (eg., collaborative learning, co-production). Recently, interpretive approaches have been used to inform career-planning strategies for PhD graduates (eg., 2 ̆ 2 Vitae 2 ̆ 2) but this is yet to systematically inform institutional strategies for research-training. To more effectively and efficiently facilitate researcher-role development, research training should consider occupational socialization as an organizing framework, and utilize performative and interpretive approaches to role development...|$|E
40|$|Flakes {{in effect}} coatings, which are {{responsible}} for its color shift, are not perfectly horizontally oriented, producing a non uniform texture when observed {{from a distance of}} around one meter or less. If the coating is illuminated by a diffuse source, a granular appearance is observed, called graininess. But when the coating is illuminated by unidirectional light, some luminous spots on a dark background appear, effect that is known as sparkle. The characterization of these two textures is getting more important for automotive industry because of the high percentage of cars with effect coatings and because improvements in imaging technology allows this effect to be measured by, for instance, commercial instruments as BYK-mac. A single analytical model to understand and radiometrically characterize both sparkle and graininess in effect coatings is presented and studied in this work. It allows both patterns to be explained and, despite its simplicity, includes variables related to the optical system (Point Spread Function (PSF) and size of the entrance pupil), its distance to the coating, the diffusion grade of the illumination, the illumination and observation directions, and coating parameters. © 2013 Optical Society of AmericaAuthors are grateful to “Plan Nacional de Física” for funding this work FIS 2010 - 19756 -E, to CSIC’s JAE Program and ”European Social Fund” for awarding us a <b>research</b> <b>trainee.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite being a core {{business}} of medicine, {{end of life}} care (EoLC) is neglected. It is hampered by research that is difficult to conduct with no common standards. We aimed to develop evidence-based guidance on the best methods for the design and conduct of research on EoLC to further knowledge in the field. Methods: The Methods Of Researching End of life Care (MORECare) project built on the Medical Research Council guidance on the development and evaluation of complex circumstances. We conducted systematic literature reviews, transparent expert consultations (TEC) involving consensus methods of nominal group and online voting, and stakeholder workshops to identify challenges and best practice in EoLC research, including: participation recruitment, ethics, attrition, integration of mixed methods, complex outcomes and economic evaluation. We synthesised all findings to develop a guidance statement on the best methods to research EoLC. Results: We integrated data from three systematic reviews and five TECs with 133 online responses. We recommend research designs extending beyond randomised trials and encompassing mixed methods. Patients and families value participation in research, and consumer or patient collaboration in developing studies can resolve some ethical concerns. It is ethically desirable to offer patients and families the opportunity to participate in research. Outcome measures should be short, responsive to change and ideally used for both clinical practice and research. Attrition should be anticipated in studies and may affirm inclusion of the relevant population, but careful reporting is necessitated using a new classification. Eventual implementation requires consideration at all stages of the project. Conclusions: The MORECare statement provides 36 best practice solutions for research evaluating services and treatments in EoLC to improve study quality and set the standard for future research. The statement may be used alongside existing statements and provides a first step in setting common, much needed standards for evaluative research in EoLC. These are relevant to those undertaking <b>research,</b> <b>trainee</b> researchers, research funders, ethical committees and editors...|$|E

Variations in practice often lead to adverse maternity outcomes following PPH. Our objective was to assess the current practice in managing PPH in the UK. Methods: We performed a national multicenter prospective service evaluation study over one calendar month and compared the current performance to national standards for managing PPH. We used a standardized data collection tool and collected data on patients’ demographics, incidence of PPH, estimated blood loss (EBL), prophylactic and treatment measures, onset of labor, and mode of delivery. Results: We collected data from 98 obstetric units, including 3663 cases of primary PPH. Fifty percent of cases were minor PPH (EBL 500 – 1000 mL, n= 1900 / 3613, 52. 6 %) and the remaining were moderate PPH (EBL > 1000 to 2000 mL, n= 289 / 3613, 8 %). The majority of women received active management of the third stage of labor (3504 / 3613, 97 %) most commonly with Syntometrine intramuscular (1479 / 3613, 40. 9 %). More than half required one additional uterotonic agent (2364 / 3613, 65. 4 %) most commonly with Syntocinon intravenous infusion (1155 / 2364, 48. 8 %). There was a poor involvement of consultant obstetricians and anesthetists in managing PPH cases, which was more prevalent when managing major PPH (p= 0. 0001). Conclusion: There are still variations in managing PPH in the UK against national guidelines. More senior doctor involvement and regular service evaluation are needed to improve maternal outcomes following PPH.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 In this thesis, high {{resolution}} ocean models {{are used to}} evaluate and forecast coastal ocean variability in two different applications. In the first study, the 2 -km resolution ocean circulation model for the Eastern Bering Sea is utilized to understand whether slope-interior exchange along {{the path of the}} Aleutian North Slope Current (ANSC) helps maintain the subsurface temperature maximum on the isopycnal surface 26. 8 kg m- 3, approximately 300 - 400 m deep. The simulation period is June-October of 2009. At the abovementioned isopycnal surface, the model shows the warmer pattern extending westward along the southern slope of the Aleutian Islands and then eastward along the northern slope as the season progresses. The direct exchange from the south to the north through Amukta Pass on this isopycnal surface is very limited. The model does not exhibit vigorous eddy shedding along the ANSC. However, there are several topographic features where the warm slope current separates into the basin, particularly at 178 ˚ W (just east of Amchitka Pass) and 174 ˚ W (Atka Island). Currents on the 26. 8 kg m- 3 isopycnal surface are too slow to account for the warming pattern along the ANSC reaching the Bering Canyon and the Bering Slope Current. The warming can be explained as a combination of faster advection of warmer waters above and downward vertical turbulent transport due to intensive tides. This hypothesis is confirmed by the heat equation term balance analysis and two-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking on the 26. 8 kg m- 3 surface and a shallower, 26. 4 kg m- 3 surface. In the second study, a team of four graduate students, including two ocean modelers, a cartographer, and a social scientist, work together as part of the National Science Foundation <b>Research</b> <b>Trainee</b> (NRT) program to develop new products based on ocean forecasts, quantify their uncertainty and communicate this knowledge to commercial fishermen. A 2 -km resolution ocean prediction system for the Oregon and Washington coasts produces three-day forecasts of surface velocity, temperature, and salinity. Based on the social scientist’s communications with the commercial fishermen on their perceptions of risk and uncertainty, uncertainty in the surface current forecast is quantified by calculating the root mean square error of the forecast with high frequency radar observations for each forecast horizon. This calculation reveals that the model performs better in the northern portion of the domain where high frequency radar observations are available, with a noticeable source of error being near the Columbia River Estuary. Additionally, the depth of the thermocline is calculated with two different methods: as a depth at which the temperature is 2 ˚F less than the surface temperature (a definition provided by the commercial fishermen) and as a depth of the maximum buoyancy frequency squared. Overall, the two parts of our thesis study complement each other showing that coastal ocean models can be used both for basic oceanographic research and for operational prediction...|$|E

40|$|While {{physical}} and human capital are established as important predictors of success among early-career clinical investigators, less {{is known about}} the role of social capital. The authors aimed to develop a brief scale to assess social capital in this population and test its reliability and validity. A three-item assessment was developed based on a conceptual framework and measures of social capital from other fields and was administered to 414 clinical <b>research</b> <b>trainees</b> at the University of Pittsburgh in 2007 - 2012. The measure exhibited good internal consistency reliability (α = 0. 71) and a normal distribution. On a 10 -point scale, mean social capital was 6. 4 (SD = 1. 7). Social capital was significantly associated with 7 of the 9 expected constructs: sex, age, confidence in research skills, work-related motivation, burnout, and social support. Exploratory multivariable regression analysis demonstrated that social capital was most strongly associated with higher research confidence (β = 0. 35, p < 0. 001), higher extrinsic motivation (β = 0. 50, p = 0. 003), and lower burnout (p trend = 0. 02). This three-item scale measures social capital in this population with adequate internal consistency reliability, face validity, and construct validity.

40|$|International audienceThe {{acceptability}} of nanomedical applications, {{which have the}} potential to generate ethical and societal impacts, is a significant factor in the deployment of nanomedicine. A lack of fit between nanomedical applications and society’s values may result from a partial consideration of such impacts. New approaches for technological evaluation focused on impact perception, acceptance, and acceptability are needed to go beyond traditional technology assessment approaches used with nanotechnology, which focus mainly on toxicological and safety criteria. Using a new evaluative approach based on perceived impacts of nanotechnology, the objective {{of this study was to}} assess perceptions among researchers and <b>research</b> <b>trainees</b> familiar with emergent technologies and from different disciplinary background the scope of acceptability judgments made towards the use of nanocarriers. This mixed-methods study was based on scenarios presenting two types of drug-delivery nanocarriers (carbon, synthetic DNA) in two contexts of use (lung cancer treatment, seasonal flu treatment). Researchers and <b>research</b> <b>trainees</b> in the natural sciences and engineering, and the social sciences and the humanities were invited by email to take part in this project. An online questionnaire followed by semi-directed interviews allowed characterization of disciplinary divergences regarding to impact perception, acceptance, and {{acceptability of}} the scenarios.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Despite marked {{optimism}} in {{the field}} of nanomedicine about the use of drug-delivery nanocarriers, uncertainties exist concerning nanocarriers’ possible unintended impacts and effects. These uncertainties could affect user acceptance and acceptability. “Acceptance” refers to the intention to put a technology or a device to a specified use. “Acceptability” refers to a value judgment that accounts for acceptance. The objectives of this study were to characterize impact perception, acceptance, and acceptability in relation to drug-delivery nanocarriers in different contexts of use, and to explore relationships among these concepts. Methods: A sample of European and Canadian researchers and graduate <b>research</b> <b>trainees</b> active {{in the field}} of new technologies was recruited by targeted email invitation for participation in a web-based questionnaire study. The questionnaire presented scenarios for two contexts of use (lung cancer, seasonal flu) of drug-delivery nanocarriers with two compositions (carbon, synthetic DNA). Respondents’ impact perception, acceptance, and acceptability judgment in relation to each kind of nanocarrier in each context of use were measured with Likert scale questions and scored using categorical values. Results: Two hundred and fourteen researchers and graduate <b>research</b> <b>trainees</b> completed the questionnaire. The results showed that nanocarrier composition influenced impact perception: as compared with the carbon nanocarrier impact perception, the positive impacts of the synthetic DNA nanocarrier were perceived as more significant and more likely to occur than its negative impacts. Composition did not influence acceptance or acceptability. Context of use significantly influenced acceptance and acceptability of both kinds of nanocarriers: researchers were more likely to accept the use of nanocarriers to treat lung cancer than the seasonal flu. The results also showed a significant relationship between acceptance and the perceived usefulness of the treatments. Conclusion: Nanocarrier composition does not appear to influence acceptance or acceptability. On the other hand, the nanocarriers’ perceived usefulness and context of use are both major factors in accounting for acceptance and acceptability.
