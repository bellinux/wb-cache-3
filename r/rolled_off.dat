5|$|The Cadillac Converj is a plug-in hybrid {{concept car}} first {{unveiled}} at the 2009 North American International Auto Show which incorporated the propulsion {{system from the}} Chevrolet Volt, including the Voltec powertrain. In August 2011, General Motors announced its decision to produce the Converj as the Cadillac ELR. The first 2014 ELRs <b>rolled</b> <b>off</b> the production line in late May 2013. These were pre-production units destined for testing purposes and production for retail customers started {{at the end of}} 2013. The ELR was released to retail customers in the U.S. in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Citroën AX was {{launched}} without a twin in 1986, {{and the only}} other Talbot in development, the Arizona family hatchback, {{was launched}} instead as the Peugeot 309 {{at the end of}} 1985. Production of the Samba ended in May 1986, by which time 270,555 had been made, signalling {{the beginning of the end}} of the Talbot brand for passenger cars, the death knell finally sounding the following year when the last Horizon <b>rolled</b> <b>off</b> the production line in Finland, although the brand survived on commercial vehicles until 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight test}} {{programme}} started in 1985 with the maiden flight of a converted Tu-142M fitted with the advanced avionics; state acceptance trials began within two years. Test results proved excellent, as the aircraft successfully tracked nuclear-powered submarines of the Northern and Pacific Fleets. The aircraft became operational with Russian Naval Aviation (AV-MP) in 1993. The last Tu-142MZ <b>rolled</b> <b>off</b> the Taganrog production line the following year, bringing {{an end to}} a 26-year production run during which 100 Tu-142s were produced.|$|E
5000|$|The Optimum [...] "L" [...] filter (also {{known as}} a Legendre-Papoulis filter) was {{proposed}} by Athanasios Papoulis in 1958. It has the maximum <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> rate for a given filter order while maintaining a monotonic frequency response. It provides a compromise between the Butterworth filter which is monotonic but has a slower <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> and the Chebyshev filter which has a faster <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> but has ripple in either the pass band or stop band. The filter design is based on Legendre polynomials which {{is the reason for}} its alternate name and the [...] "L" [...] in Optimum [...] "L".|$|R

5|$|Features of the He 111 were {{apparent}} in the Heinkel He 70. The first single-engined He 70 Blitz ("Lightning") <b>rolled</b> <b>off</b> the line in 1932 and immediately started breaking records. In the normal four-passenger version its speed reached 380km/h (230mph) when powered by a 447kW (600hp) BMW VI engine. The He 70 was designed with an elliptical wing, which the Günther brothers had already incorporated into the Bäumer Sausewind before they joined Heinkel. This wing design became a feature in this and many subsequent designs they developed. The He 70 drew {{the interest of the}} Luftwaffe, which was looking for an aircraft with both bomber and transport capabilities.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it <b>rolled</b> <b>off</b> the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E
5|$|FIAT driver Aldo Weilschott {{climbed from}} fourteenth on lap three to third on lap five, before his car <b>rolled</b> <b>off</b> the planks outside Vibraye. Szisz {{maintained}} the lead he had gained on lap three {{to finish the}} first day just before noon {{in a time of}} 5hours, 45minutes and 30.4seconds (5:45:30.4), 26minutes ahead of Albert Clément of Clément-Bayard. Despite a slow start, FIAT driver Felice Nazzaro moved up to third position, 15minutes behind Clément. Seventeen cars completed the first day; Henri Rougier's Lorraine-Dietrich finished last with a time of 8:15:55.0, two-and-a-half-hours behind Szisz. All the cars that were competing the next day were moved into parc fermé, a floodlit area guarded overnight by members of the ACF, to prevent teams and drivers from working on them until the following morning.|$|E

5|$|As {{predicted}} by analysts, the team easily secured a {{berth in the}} 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3–2, advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals {{for the first time}} in franchise history. Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell, the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot <b>rolled</b> <b>off</b> the rim. Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting, after a 39-point performance in Game 6. Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs.|$|E
