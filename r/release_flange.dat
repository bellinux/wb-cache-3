50|$|The ISO {{standard}} quick <b>release</b> <b>flange</b> {{is known}} by the names Quick Flange (QF), Klein Flange (KF) or NW, sometimes also as DN. The KF designation has been adopted by ISO, DIN, and Pneurop. KF flanges are made with a chamfered back surface that are attached with a circular clamp and an elastomeric o-ring that is mounted in a metal centering ring. Standard sizes are indicated by the nominal inner diameter in millimeters for flanges 10 through 50 mm in diameter. Sizes 10, 20 and 32 are less common sizes (see Reynard numbers). Some sizes share their flange dimensions with their respective larger neighbor and use the same clamp size. This means a DN10KF can mate to a DN16KF by using an adaptive centering ring. Same goes for DN20KF to DN25KF and DN32KF to DN40KF.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} 10 for effecting sealing of a {{fused quartz}} ampoule 24 {{while maintaining a}} vacuum on the ampoule via system 12 is disclosed. A plug 28 of fused quartz is lowered into the vertically disposed ampoule 24 (while maintaining the vacuum thereon) and heat sealed therein to prevent any vapor escape from, or contamination of, the contained semiconductor growth charge 29 during subsequent semiconductor crystal growth processes. A rotary vacuum feed-through mechanism 16 selectively rotates axle 34 and spool 32 to unwind wire 30 for lowering of plug 28 into the reduced diameter portion 24 b of ampoule 24. Ampoule 24 is hermatically connected to vacuum housing 18 by quick <b>release</b> <b>flange</b> 20 wherein O-ring 22 retains ampoule 24...|$|E
5000|$|Military Reisings {{are usually}} parkerized. They often have an {{adjustable}} front sight with an Allen screw and a rear sight with a retaining screw. They routinely have 14 fins on the barrel, a two piece magazine <b>release,</b> outward <b>flanges</b> on the safety/selector switch, sling swivels, stock ties (crossbolts through the forearm), and a knurled take-down screw. Finally, the military model commonly has a three-hole trigger guard, proofmarks like [...] "PH" [...] or [...] "Pm2" [...] above the chamber, and serial numbers ranging from 20,000 to 120,000.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} not one factor that distinguishes the {{so-called}} commercial from the military model, the commercial model is usually blued. It commonly has a fixed front sight and a rear sight with no retaining screw. It often has 28 fins on the barrel, a one piece magazine <b>release,</b> no outward <b>flanges</b> on the safety/selector switch, and no sling swivels. Lastly, the commercial model commonly has a smooth take-down screw, a two-hole trigger guard, and serial numbers ranging from one to 20,000.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{programme}} {{of large-scale}} experiments for atmospheric dispersion {{was carried out}} by INERIS over a period extending from December 1996 to April 1997. The objectives of the test campaign were to measure anhydrous ammonia concentrations in a range of few meters to 2 kin from the release, in order to generate data to be used to improve 2 -phase discharge and dispersion modelling. The discharges were released from a 6 -tonne storage tank of pressurised liquid ammonia and through a discharge device with an outlet diameter of 2 in. Fifteen trials were carried out with various release configurations corresponding to industrial situations (impinging jets on the ground and on a wall at various distances, <b>release</b> through a <b>flange</b> without seal [...] .). The quantity of ammonia discharged from the liquid phase varied according to the tests, from 1. 4 to 3. 5 tons for durations between 7 and 14 min and, therefore, at flow rates between 2 and 4. 5 kg/s. Approximately 200 sensors were settled downwind to measure ammonia concentrations and temperature in the plume. These tests showed that for discharges with identical flow rates the distances corresponding to the same concentration vary a lot according to the configurations. These distances tend to be reduced by the presence of obstacles or retention dikes that collected liquid ammonia. In the paper, the main experimental results are presented. In order to enable the comparisons with numerical predictions, more detailed information are given in [Bouet R. (1999). Ammoniac-Essais de dispersion atmosphérique à grande échelle.

40|$|The strains {{at which}} {{buckling}} and debond growth occur in adhesively bonded composite flanges containing an initial debond were experimentally measured using sandwich panel and coupon type specimens. Test parameters investigated were: initial debond geometry, the adhesive critical strain energy <b>release</b> rate (Gc), <b>flange</b> material stiffness, and layup sequence. ^ Buckling strains {{were found to}} be dependent on initial debond length, flange stiffness and layup sequence. Flanges with a longer initial debond length showed lower buckling strains. Buckling strains increased as the twisting to bending stiffness ratio (D 66 /D 11) increased due to changes in flange layup sequence. Debond growth was found to be strongly dependent on initial debond length but, weakly dependent on flange width. Flanges having higher bending stiffness exhibited a significantly lower debonding strain. Ultrasonic C-scans revealed that debond growth occurred along a curved front, as dictated by the post-buckling deformation of the flanges. Finally, changes in twisting to bending stiffness ratio (D 66 /D 11) due to different flange layup sequences resulted in a variation of post-buckled flange out-of-plane (u 3) deformation shape. This was found to affect the debond front shapes as the debond grew. ^ Finite Element Analysis (FEA) based Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) fracture analysis was conducted. Critical strain energy release rates measured from Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and Mixed-Mode Fracture (MMF) tests were used as input values and the FEA predictions were shown to be capable of accurately simulating the buckling and debonding behaviors. The FEA study included all the testing parameters investigated in the experiments and also revealed the mode-I, II and III strain energy release rate profiles at the debond front. From the strain energy release rate profiles, fracture mode content and the major fracture mode in each specimen type were clearly understood. ^ The FEA methodology developed within the current study {{has been shown to be}} capable of predicting the buckling and debonding tests very well. Being FEA based, this methodology can be applied to the analysis of other facture problems which due to their complexity would otherwise require expensive experimental investigation. ...|$|R
