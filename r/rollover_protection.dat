25|$|The SRTV has a {{range of}} up to 350 miles, and can operate in {{difficult}} environmental conditions, and including at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above mean sea level. The vehicle can travel at a speed over 100mph and climb vertical grades over 70 degrees, move on side slopes angles of over 60 degrees and climb vertical steps over three feet. It can turn on a 20' (6.1 m) diameter curb to curb. Maneuverability is enhanced with cutting brakes allowing U-turns on steep hills within the length and width of the vehicle, also allowing high speed J-turns. The vehicle provides rollover safety for all occupants without limiting mission operational performance. Storm can carry up to three liters inside the <b>rollover</b> <b>protection</b> frame, without modifications, while still maintaining 360° of weapon field of fire.|$|E
500|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt {{standard}} {{features include}} 4-wheel anti-lock brakes with traction control; StabiliTrak electronic {{stability control system}} with brake assist; tire-pressure monitoring system; and 8 total airbags: dual-stage frontal, side-impact and knee for driver and front passenger, and roof-rail side-impact for front and rear outboard seating positions, with a passenger sensing system. There is also available an optional emergency assistance system. A safety cage, built with high-strength and ultra high-strength steel, surrounds the passenger compartment to keep the space intact {{in the event of}} a crash. Crush zones framing the trunk and the engine crumple to absorb crash energy before it reaches occupants. Door hinges and latches in harmony with door structure and its steel reinforcements to keep doors closed during an impact. The 2011 Chevrolet Volt was named [...] "Top Safety Pick" [...] by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Volt received the top ratings of [...] "Good" [...] for front, side, and rear impact crash tests, and also on <b>rollover</b> <b>protection.</b> All injury measurements except one were rated good, indicating a low risk of significant injuries in crashes according to the scale of severity employed in the IIHS’s testing.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the main injury patterns and sources of non-ejected occupants (i. e. no full/partial ejection) during trip-over crashes, using the NASS-CDS database. Specific injury types and sources of the head, chest, and neck were identified. Results from this study suggest that cerebrum injuries, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage, rib fractures, lung injuries, and cervical spine fractures need to be emphasized if cadaveric tests or numerical simulations are designed to study rollover injury mechanisms. The roof has been identified as the major source for head and neck injuries. However, changing the roof design alone is not likely to improve rollover safety. Instead, the belt restraint systems, passive airbags, roof structure, and new innovations need to be considered in a systematic manner to provide enhanced <b>rollover</b> occupant <b>protection...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Rollover {{accidents}} {{have the}} highest serious to fatal injury rates of any accident mode. Research and development on <b>rollover</b> occupant <b>protection</b> has been frustrated {{by the lack of}} a low cost, controlled, repeatable, dynamic test. The most widely used tests, dolly and CRIS system rollovers, do not meet all of these conditions, but the Jordan Rollover System (JRS) does. This study demonstrates JRS repeatability using three identical production vehicles with anthropomorphic test dummies. The first test of each vehicle used string potentiometers to measure roof performance. The second used both string potentiometers and an instrumented test dummy. The JRS test parameters, roof structural performance, and Hybrid III dummy injury measures were all shown to be highly repeatable with variation generally not more than 10 percent. The dummy and vehicle repeatability was on par with the repeatability shown in similar crash test studies conducted by IIHS and NHTSA...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of an {{accident}} in Cherry Valley, Illinois, in 2009, the Association of American Railroads studied several options for increasing the crashworthiness of DOT-111 tank car designs and published new construction standards in a Casualty Prevention Circular, with the intent to revise the AAR Manual for Standards and Recommended Practices for tank cars that are used to transport ethanol and crude oil. Beginning on October 1, 2011, the new AAR standard for DOT-111 tank cars requires tank heads and shells to be constructed of thicker steel. The new specification also requires that heads and shells be constructed of normalized steel, and in all cases [...] thick half head shields must be provided. The AAR has also mandated a more robust housing or <b>rollover</b> skid for <b>protection</b> of top fittings. The new standards only apply to newly manufactured cars; there is no requirement to retrofit, repurpose, or retire existing DOT-111A cars built to the older design. The NTSB has called that design [...] "inadequate," [...] noting the older cars are [...] "subject to damage and catastrophic loss of hazardous materials." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1973, the Hornet GT toured auto {{shows as}} an {{asymmetrical}} styling exercise. The left (or driver's) side featured more glass {{area and a}} narrower [...] "C" [...] pillar for better visibility {{in comparison to the}} concept car's different design on its right side. Using different designs on each side is common practice within automobile styling studios, especially when money was tight; however, showing such an example to the public was unusual and AMC was not afraid to measure consumer reaction to new ideas. Other design elements and ideas presented on the Hornet GT show car included sealed glass to allowing hollow doors that could house easily accessible components while freeing up space in the dashboard area, as well as a stronger roof and support pillars for additional crash and <b>rollover</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many early {{row-crop}} tractors had a tricycle {{design with}} two closely spaced front tires, {{and some even}} had a single front tire. This made it dangerous to operate {{on the side of}} a steep hill; as a result, many farmers died from tractor rollovers. Also, early row-crop tractors had no <b>rollover</b> <b>protection</b> system (ROPS), meaning if the tractor flipped back, the operator could be crushed. Sweden was the first country which passed legislation requiring ROPS, in 1959.|$|E
50|$|Two {{operators}} are seated behind {{the driver and}} commander, the rear platform hosting the machine gunner {{and at least two}} other personnel (maximum seating is forseven). The rear platform carries a roll-over cage that is much taller than the front part of the vehicle (for air transport the cage can be collapsed by hand in less than 90 seconds from 2.80metres to 1.82). The design offers <b>rollover</b> <b>protection</b> (ROPS) as standard, with scalable protection optional. An armour attachment system is built-in at the design stage.|$|E
50|$|The {{decline in}} {{popularity}} of convertibles in the US was partly caused by concern about lack of protection in rollover accidents, because most convertibles have no protection beyond the windshield frame. Some convertibles provide <b>rollover</b> <b>protection</b> using two protruding curved bars behind the headrests. Some Mercedes-Benz convertibles have a retractable roll bar which deploys {{in case of}} an accident. Race cars almost always have roll cages, since racing is very likely to result in a rollover. In addition, the roll cage's chassis-stiffening effect is usually seen as a benefit to the car.|$|E
