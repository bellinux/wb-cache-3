For <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> to be viable, they must have a negligible impact on the utility of the multiperiod agents who only trade to rebalance. In this paper, we examine how the imposition of <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> for selling mutual funds purchased within a prespecified period affects the utility of long-horizon agents and we focus on 3 types of funds: domestic funds holding large cap stocks; domestic funds holding value stocks; and, domestic funds holding small cap stocks We find that <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> chosen to be large enough to make the “stale ” price trading strategies in these funds examined by Chalmers, Edelan and Kadlec (2001) unprofitable, do not materially affect the utility of long-horizon investors. The trade triggers employed in these “stale ” price trading strategies imply an average round trip trade length of 2 months but the utility reduction for a 6 -month redemption period can be bounded above by 0. 53 % of initial wealth or per period consumption; and based on exact cost numbers when the agent does not have access to a second fund, the utility cost is likely never more than 0. 27 % of initial wealth or per perio...|$|R

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this {{dissertation}} examines the behavior of long- and short-term capital gains distributions {{after the passage of}} the Tax Reform Act of 1997, which lowered the maximum tax rate on long-term gains. Using a panel of mutual fund data, I examine the ratio of long-term to total gains distributions {{around the time of the}} Act, and find that fund managers appear to tilttheir distributions towards the long-term after 1997. This behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that managers are tax-sensitive, and the estimates are robust to the inclusion of fund-level fixed effects and other controls. I also examine fund capital gains patterns in a difference-in-differences framework, comparing actively managed to index funds; this technique gives a lower-bound estimate of the increase in the fraction of gains paid-out as long-term after the Act of five percentage points. The second chapter examines equity mutual fund dividend yields. Dividends are highly-taxed for individual investors, but tax-favored for corporate investors. Consequently, I hypothesize that corporate investors may prefer to hold higher-dividend yield funds than non-corporate investors. I use institutional funds as a proxy for corporate, trust, or non-profit shareholders, and find that these funds do have systematically higher dividend yields than their retail counterparts. These results are consistent with the tax clientele hypothesis, and are robust to the inclusion of a number of fund- and industry-level controls. (cont.) Chapter three, co-authored with James Poterba, documents the increasing use of <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> throughout the mutual fund industry. These fees are levied against investors who liquidate their positions before a specified time, and are paid back into the fund to compensate existing investors for the negative externalities of redemptions. We find that foreign and sector funds are more likely to impose <b>redemption</b> <b>fees,</b> and that institutional funds are less likely to have fees. Using data from the SEC, we find that the largest funds with <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> collected nearly $ 58 million in fees in 2000. We also find that funds with <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> appear to have lower turnover and higher returns than their no-fee counterparts, controlling for time, fund objective, and other characteristics. by Stephanie L.

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{redemption}} policies affect daily fund flows in open-end mutual funds. Since short-term trading of fund shares, as manifested in daily fund flows, {{can have an}} adverse impact on returns to the fund’s shareholders, mutual funds might find it desirable to discourage short-term trading {{through the use of}} redemption fees. However, if daily fund flows are due to fund shareholders’ legitimate liquidity demands, the <b>redemption</b> <b>fee</b> would have little effect on daily fund flows and possibly adversely affect fund shareholders by imposing a liquidity cost on them. We find that the likelihood of a fund charging a <b>redemption</b> <b>fee</b> is largely a function of its overall fee structure.

40|$|Under the U. S. National Banking System (NBS), {{in effect}} from 1863 [...] 1914, banks with {{national}} charters could issue notes under four main restrictions: full collateral {{in the form}} of government bonds, a per-period tax on outstanding notes, redemption of notes into (outside) money on demand, and a clearing fee per issued note that is cleared through the Treasury's clearing system. The simple and predominant view of this system appeals to arbitrage to claim that the system should have produced an upper bound on the yield on collateral: the tax rate plus the product of the clearing fee and the average clearing rate of notes. However, as is well known and puzzling, yields on eligible collateral were generally higher than such a bound. We explain the puzzle by a model of note issue that includes the main features of the NBS. In the model, note issuers choose to issue notes only in trades that both produce a low clearing rate (high float) and are subject to diminishing returns, and there exists a steady state with a yield on collateral higher than the presumed bound. There are two main ingredients in our explanation: the concern about float and the inverse association between the float rate and the size of placement opportunities. The former is dictated by the rules for note issue. The latter is consistent with the notion that large placement opportunities would have been available only in organized markets, but notes used in such markets would have quickly been turned in to other banks and then been through the clearing system. To achieve high float, notes should be offered in trade to people who are infrequently connected to such markets, and such placement opportunities give rise to diminishing returns from additional note issue. We formulate the model with most of the background environment same as that of the Trejos-Wright-Shi model. For each specialization type, there is a small portion of â€œbankersâ€ while the remainder is â€œnonbankers. " There are three kinds of assets: (outside) money, notes issued by bankers, and bonds issued by government. Each date has two stages, the "morning" and the "afternoon. " The morning is reserved for the random pairwise meetings. The afternoon is reserved for bankers meeting the government and is used solely for note-clearing, bond purchases, and the levying of taxes and fees. Hence, a banker’s notes have two potential uses: to purchase eligible collateral and to purchase goods or other bankers' notes in pairwise meetings. Each use gives rise to different amounts of float. We assume that government clears all notes in inventory at the start of each afternoon. As a result, a banker does not use its own notes to purchase bonds because the potential float is not enough to overcome the <b>redemption</b> <b>fee.</b> Nevertheless, a banker does use its notes in pairwise meetings to trade for goods and to trade for other bankers' notes. This use gives rise to random and higher float, and, implies a diminishing marginal return from additional note issue. National banking system; note issuance; matching model...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} {{individuals}} can time their purchase and redemption of mutual fund shares to expropriate wealth from other fund holders is well documented. 1 The appropriate {{solution to the}} mutual fund timing problem remains {{the subject of much}} debate.

This article provides an overview of the key economic issues and considers the relative merits of alternative solutions to the mutual fund timing problem. In principle, the timing problem could be fully resolved by either removing predictability from NAVs (i. e., fair value pricing) or imposing barriers to its exploitation (i. e., <b>redemption</b> <b>fees).</b> Because of the practical limitations of removing predictability and the cost of imposing barriers, the most effective and efficient solution involves a balanced and modest attack on each front.

40|$|We build a {{model of}} a {{financial}} intermediary, in the tradition of Diamond and Dybvig (1983), and show that allowing the intermediary to impose <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> or gates in a crisis - a form of suspension of convertibility - can lead to preemptive runs. In our model, a fraction of investors (depositors) can become informed in advance about a shock to the return on the intermediary's assets. Later, the informed investors learn the realization of the shock and choose their redemption behavior based on this information. We prove two results: First, there are situations in which informed investors would wait until the uncertainty is resolved before redeeming if <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> or gates cannot be imposed, but those same investors would redeem preemptively if fees or gates are possible. Second, we show that for the intermediary, which maximizes the expected utility only of its own investors, imposing gates or fees can be ex post optimal. These results have important policy implications for intermediaries that are vulnerable to runs, such as money market funds, because the preemptive runs that can be caused by the possibility of gates or fees may have damaging negative externalities...|$|R

40|$|This paper re-examines the {{determinants}} of mutual fund fees paid by mutual fund shareholders for management costs and other expenses. There are two novelties with respect to previous studies. First, each type of fee is explained separately. Second, the paper employs a new dataset consisting of Spanish mutual funds, making it the second paper to study mutual fund fees outside the US market. Furthermore, the Spanish market has three interesting characteristics: (i) both distribution and management are highly dominated by banks and savings banks, which points towards potential conflicts of interest; (ii) Spanish mutual fund law imposes caps on all types of fees; and (iii) Spain ranks first in terms of average mutual fund fees among similar countries. We find significant differences in mutual fund fees not explained by the fund’s investment objective. For instance, management companies owned by banks and savings banks charge higher management <b>fees</b> and <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> to nonguaranteed funds. Also, investors in older non-guaranteed funds and non-guaranteed funds with a lower average investment {{are more likely to}} end up paying higher management fees. Moreover, there is clear evidence that some mutual funds enjoy better conditions from custodial institutions than others. In contrast to evidence from the US market, larger funds are not associated with lower fees, but with higher custody fees for guaranteed funds and higher <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> for both types of funds. Finally, fee-setting by mutual funds is not related to fund before-fee performance. mutual fund, fee caps, censored data...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In September 2003, several {{prominent}} mutual fund companies came {{under investigation for}} illegal trading practices. Allegations suggested these funds allowed certain investors to profit from short-term trading schemes {{at the expense of}} other investors. Surprisingly, regulatory authorities have known for more than two decades of the potential for such abuses, yet have taken limited steps to correct the problem. We explore investor reaction to the scandal by measuring assets under man-agement, stock returns, and performance. Mutual funds managed by investigated firms show a substantial decline in post-announcement assets under management. These firms also experienced significantly negative announce-ment-period returns. Finally, we discuss several policy suggestions to prevent future trading abuses and provide direction for future research.

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: In this thesis, I {{study the}} use of {{performance}} fees in Finnish mutual funds, {{their impact on the}} funds' risk-adjusted return, risk and their theoretical value. Furthermore, utilizing simulation-based methods, my objective is to calculate a theoretical value for the performance fee structures in Finnish mutual funds. Finally, I also study the different regulatory approaches to performance fees in select European countries and the disclosure of Finnish funds' performance fees. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: My sample consists of 332 mutual funds registered in Finland and contains quarterly observations on each fund from March 2007 to December 2012. 40 of these funds utilize performance fees. The sample is free from survivorship bias. My analysis is primarily based on random effects panel regressions with a variety of risk and return variables as dependent variables and funds' individual characteristics as explanatory variables. I also utilize Monte Carlo simulation and the Margrabe model to calculate the cost of the fee for each of the funds in the sample. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Funds with performance fees offer better risk-adjusted returns. The introduction of a performance fee increases the funds' ex post four-factor alpha by on average 83 basis points per quarter. The results hold also when using Sharpe ratio and the raw quarterly return as dependent variables. The use of performance fees does not increase funds' volatility levels relative to funds without such fees. However, funds with performance fees exhibit higher tracking errors, implying that funds take more active risk compared to their counterparts. The theoretical value of the performance fee is on average 1. 35 % Furthermore, funds with performance fees, on average, offer significantly lower management and <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> than funds without such fee structures. The difference is 22 and 24 basis points p. a. for management and <b>redemption</b> <b>fees,</b> respectively. However, the extra cost associated with the performance fees makes these funds more expensive on an annual basis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model {{which can be used}} to {{evaluate}} the performance of mutual funds. This model applies an operational research methodology, called data envelopment analysis (DEA), which allows to measure the relative efficiency of decision making units.

Therefore, a generalized version of the DEA mutual fund performance indexes is defined, too, which includes among the outputs a stochastic dominance indicator that reflects both the investors’ preference structure and the time occurrence of the returns. In addition, the procedure allows to identify, for each mutual fund, a composite portfolio which can be considered as a particular benchmark.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} both {{theoretical and}} empirical analyses of market participants' optimal decision-making in trading Japanese equity mutual funds. First, we build an intertemporal decision-making model under uncertainty {{in the presence of}} transaction costs. This setting enables us to shed light on the investors' option to delay investment. A comparative analysis shows that an increase in uncertainty over the expected rate of return on mutual funds has a negative impact not only on market participants' buying behavior but also on their selling behavior. In addition, a several percent increase in front-end loads and <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> is likely to change the optimal holding ratio of mutual funds in investors' portfolios, by up to 10 percent. Second, we empirically examine the theoretical implications using daily transaction data of selected equity mutual funds in Japan. By estimating a panel data model, we conclude that for the sample period, from August 2000 to July 2001, investment behavior has been rational in light of our theoretical model. Our results suggest that investors are likely to rationally postpone their purchases of equity mutual funds under the present circumstances of low expected returns, high degree of uncertainty, and high trading costs. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{hedge fund}} {{industry}} and hedge fund related research have grown {{rapidly in the}} last decade. In 1990, hedge funds controlled an estimated $ 39 billion in assets. At the end of 2006, hedge funds had an estimated $ 1. 72 trillion in assets under management. This dissertation consists of three essays exploring the hedge fund industry. In the first essay, I use the recent controversial and ultimately unsuccessful SEC attempt to increase hedge fund disclosure to examine the value of disclosure to investors. By examining SEC mandated disclosures filed by {{a large number of}} hedge funds in February 2006, I am able to construct a measure of operational risk distinct from market risk. Leverage and ownership structures as of December 2005 suggest that lenders and hedge fund equity investors were already aware of hedge fund operational risk characteristics. However, operational risk has no effect on the flow-performance relationship, suggesting that investors either lack this information, or they do not regard it as material. In the second essay, I examine hedge fund management and incentive fee structures and changes as well as the use of <b>redemption</b> <b>fees.</b> Overall, I find hedge funds’ fee structures are related to their other fund characteristics {{in a manner consistent with}} the mutual fund area and previous fee theory. I observe management fees are negatively related to fund characteristics that lower administrative overhead and positively related to tax incentives. Incentive fees are positively correlated with return characteristics that raise the total values of managers’ option-like incentive fee contracts. Hedge fund fee changes are found to be a function of pricing power and managers attempting to decrease investor demand in capacity constrained styles while <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> are used to protect managers against poor performance. Finally, funds of funds have positively associated incentive and management fees, which create a negative relationship between incentive fees and fund alphas. In the third essay, I examine if hedge fund managers close and reopen funds to investment to preserve performance. While my results show closed hedge funds do experience significantly lower flows, managers’ and management companies’ primary objective is to hoard assets. Hedge funds in capacity constrained styles do not close more often, do not close at lower relative asset levels and do not reopen at lower relative asset levels. Hedge funds reopen to investment to generate additional fees, not when funds are capable of generating out performance. These results suggest even high performance-pay deltas are not strong enough to overcome additional fees generated from larger amounts of assets. Other monitoring mechanisms are necessary to reduce agency costs for investors. ...|$|R

The study is entitled On Solutions to the Mufual Fund Timing Ptoblm, and,was authored by. Gregory Bryant kdlec, Pamplin Professor of Finzcnce at Vir,ginia Polytechnk institute. Drawing upon published research, Professor Kadec concludes that fair valuation & other trading frictions (such as <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> or baciing restrictions) are nec~ssary to stop maket timing in mutual lw~ds. He notes that market timing sterns from the prc&ct&ility of net asset values, and that this predictability can arise from the use of stale prices to value securities and from other sources that are inherent in the detennjnatmn of securities prices. In Line with SEC guidelines, fair valuation of portfolio securities only involves the removal of staleness; it does not, and should not, etiminate other sources of predictability. In the absence of trading frictions, as Professor Kacilec observes, market timers and arbitrageurs can exploit the predictability in net asset values that persists even after fair vduation.

40|$|Given {{the current}} {{tendency}} and {{momentum in the}} energy transition to shift from fossil fuels to renewable fuels, coal-fired power plants throughout Europe {{are expected to be}} mothballed in the near future. These stranded assets could however form a useful basis for Renewable Jet Fuel (RJF) production facilities. In a gradual transformation of these coal-power plants first their end of life is postponed by introducing biomass co-firing through a gasification system, while later the coal boiler is decommissioned and replaced by a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis add-on, in order to produce FT liquids from the same biomass gasification system. Through a techno-economic analysis and two case studies at coal-power plants in respectively Denmark (DONG Energy Asnaes 5 power plant) and the Netherlands (RWE Amer 9 power plant) the feasibility of such a transformation is investigated. The results of the case studies are benchmarked to Greenfield RJF production facilities in order to map the potential benefits of using these stranded assets and extending the coal-power plant’s lifetime. With no subsidies incorporated, the resulting Net Present Values (NPVs) are negative in the case studies (between - 600 and - 1000 Million Euro), but are between 10 % to 20 % higher than the NPVs of similar Greenfield projects. The most promising result is that in the worst case study the NPV of the transformation is about - 1000 Million euro, which is lower than the <b>redemption</b> <b>fees</b> that are likely to be claimed by utilities from the government for closing down the coal-power plant. Therefore the conclusion is that this gradual transformation could be a better option than mothballing the plants...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 178 {{publicly}} traded Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) in the period between 1994 and 2014, the first chapter provides evidence on the relation between a bank 2 ̆ 7 s equity capital ratio {{and the cost of}} capital. To address endogeneity between a bank 2 ̆ 7 s equity capital ratio and risk of balance sheet assets, we use an instrumental variable (IV) approach, as well as a triple differences (DDD) approach. The IV strategy exploits time-series and cross-sectional exogenous variation in statutory state income taxes levied on banks to instrument for the endogenous book equity capital ratio. The DDD approach examines treated banks, defined as having had a tax increase or decrease shock, against entropy balanced sample of control banks operating in states that did not experience tax shocks during the event window. When states increase statutory state tax rates, BHCs respond by decreasing their book equity capital ratio (increasing leverage) relative to peer out-of-state BHCs. We argue this causes the subsequent decrease in a bank 2 ̆ 7 s cost of capital. We find that a 10 percentage point increase in the book equity capital ratio is associated with a 92 basis points increase in the bank 2 ̆ 7 s cost of capital. We also find that a 10 percentage point increase in the market equity capital ratio is associated with a 59 basis points increase in the bank 2 ̆ 7 s cost of capital. Restricting the analysis to large banks with book assets in excess of 50 billion, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in the book equity capital ratio is associated with a 23 basis points increase in the bank 2 ̆ 7 s cost of capital. Even though an increase in the equity capital ratio is associated with a private cost to the banks, the effects on bank lending is positive. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the book (market) equity ratio is associated with a 1. 69 (1. 21) percentage point increase in bank-level new lending growth. Given the social and economic welfare costs of excessive risk taking by banks through leverage, the results in this paper indicate that raising equity capital requirements is not as costly banks claim. The second chapter examines the impact of a recent regulatory reform. Implosion of the Money Market Fund (MMF) industry in 2008 has raised alarms about MMF risk-taking; inevitably drawing the attention of financial regulators. Regulations were passed by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2014 to increase MMF disclosures, lower incentives to take risks, and reduce the probability of future investor runs on the funds. The new regulations allowed MMFs to impose liquidity gates and <b>redemption</b> <b>fees,</b> and required institutional prime MMFs to adopt a floating (mark-to-market) net asset value (NAV), starting October 2016. Using novel data compiled from algorithmic text-analysis of security-level MMF portfolio holdings, as reported to the SEC, this paper examines the impact of these reforms. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, I find that institutional prime funds responded to this regulation by significantly increasing risk of their portfolios, while simultaneously increasing holdings of opaque securities. I also find that opaque holdings is associated with significantly higher fund yields compared non-opaque asset class holdings. Large bank affiliated MMFs hold the riskiest portfolios. This evidence suggests that the MMF reform of October 2016 has not been effective in curbing MMF risk-taking behavior; importantly, MMFs still pose a systemic risk to the economy given large banks 2 ̆ 7 significant exposure to them...|$|R
