25|$|Based on the MQM-74 Chukar target drone, the XBQM-108A was {{modified}} with a revised, delta wing with canard control surfaces. The XBQM-108A was {{fitted with a}} thrust vectoring system based {{on the use of}} vanes that deflected the engine's exhaust; the aircraft retained the Chukar's recovery parachute and <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> system, {{with the addition of a}} radar altimeter and midcourse guidance unit based on that of the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile.|$|E
25|$|Later {{versions}} of CLOS missiles, {{such as the}} British Javelin, use a solid state television camera {{in lieu of the}} optical tracker to make the gunner's task easier. The Javelin's manufacturer, Thales Air Defence, claims that their missile is virtually impervious to countermeasures. Even more advanced CLOS versions, such as the British Starburst, use a laser data link in lieu of earlier <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> links to fly the missile to the target.|$|E
25|$|Early on, it was {{believed}} that the V-2 employed some form of <b>radio</b> <b>guidance,</b> a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver. This led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War II, Lamarr and composer George Antheil developed a <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> system for Allied torpedoes, which used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers. Although the US Navy did not adopt the technology until the 1960s, the principles of their work are arguably incorporated into Bluetooth technology, and are similar to methods used in legacy versions of CDMA and Wi-Fi. This work led to their induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The Titan II had {{debuted in}} 1962 as the Air Force's second-generation ICBM {{to replace the}} Atlas. By using hypergolic fuels, it could be stored {{for long periods of}} time and be easily readied for launch in {{addition}} to being a simpler design with fewer components, the only caveat being that the propellant mix (nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine) was extremely toxic compared to the Atlas's liquid oxygen/RP-1. However, the Titan had considerable difficulty being man-rated due to early problems with pogo oscillation. The launch vehicle used a <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> system that was unique to launches from Cape Kennedy.|$|E
500|$|After {{receiving}} his doctorate, Shea took {{a position}} at Bell Labs in Whippany, New Jersey. [...] There he first worked as systems engineer on the <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> system of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and then as the development and program manager on the inertial guidance system of the Titan II ICBM. Shea's specialty was systems engineering, {{a new type of}} engineering developed in the 1950s that focused on the management and integration of large-scale projects, turning the work of engineers and contractors into one functioning whole. He {{played a significant role in}} the Titan I project; as George Mueller writes, [...] "e contributed a considerable amount of engineering innovation and project management skill and was directly responsible for the successful development of this pioneering guidance system." [...] In addition to Shea's technical abilities, it quickly became obvious that he was also an excellent manager of people. Known for his quick intellect, he also endeared himself to his subordinates through small eccentricities such as his fondness for bad puns and habit of wearing red socks to important meetings. During the critical days of the Titan project Shea moved into the plant, sleeping on a cot in his office so as to be available at all hours if he was needed.|$|E

500|$|In {{parallel}} to the ICBM programme, the United States developed three separate intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) systems. On 8 November 1955, Wilson approved IRBM projects by both the United States Army and the United States Air Force (USAF). The United States National Security Council gave the ICBM and IRBM projects the highest national priority. The Army Ballistic Missile Agency, commanded by Major General John B. Medaris, with Wernher von Braun as its technical director, developed the Jupiter (SM-78) IRBM. After three failures, its first successful flight {{took place at the}} Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on 31 May 1957. The United States Navy initially participated in the Jupiter programme, intending to launch the missiles from ships, but in view of their size, decided instead to develop [...] a smaller, solid-propellant IRBM that could be launched from a submarine, which became Polaris. Despite reluctance on the part of Major General Bernard Schriever, the commander of the USAF Western Development Division, to take on IRBM development, and a pronounced lack of enthusiasm for missiles among senior USAF [...] officers, who preferred manned bombers, the rival USAF project moved quickly. The Douglas Aircraft Company was awarded the contract {{for the development of the}} missile, which was codenamed Thor (SM-75), in December 1955. Rocketdyne, Ramo-Wooldridge, AC Spark Plug, Bell Laboratories and General Electric were engaged as the subcontractors for the rocket engine, technical coordination, inertial guidance system, <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> system, and re-entry vehicle respectively. The first missile was delivered to Patrick Air Force Base on 26 October 1956. After four unsuccessful attempts, the first successful test flight took place on 20 September 1957.|$|E

2500|$|Low {{has been}} called the [...] "father of <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> systems" [...] due to his {{pioneering}} work on guided rockets, planes and torpedoes. [...] He was a pioneer in many fields though, often leading the way for others, but his lack of discipline meant he hardly ever saw a project through, being easily distracted by new ideas. [...] If it weren't for this inability to see things to a conclusion, Low could well have been remembered {{as one of the great}} men of science. [...] Many of his scientific contemporaries disliked him, due in part to his using the title Professor, which technically he wasn't entitled to do as he didn't occupy an academic chair. [...] His love of the limelight and publicity probably also added to the dislike.|$|E

2500|$|The USAF Air Materiel Command {{reactivated}} the JB-2 as Project EO-727-12 on 23 April 1948, at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, {{the former}} Alamogordo Army Air Field. The JB-2 {{was used for}} development of missile guidance control and seeker systems, testing of telemetering and optical tracking facilities, and as a target for new surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles (fulfilling the V1's covername, Flakzielgerät— anti-aircraft target device). The JB-2 project used the North American Aviation NATIV (North American Test Instrument Vehicle) Blockhouse and two launch ramps at Holloman: a , two-rail ramp on a 3° earth-filled slope, and a [...] trailer ramp. The trailer ramp {{was the first step}} toward a system which would eventually be adapted for the forthcoming Martin MGM-1 Matador, the first operational surface-to-surface cruise missile built by the United States. The program at Holloman was terminated on 10 January 1949 after successful development of a <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> and control system that could control and even skid-land a JB-2 under the control of an airborne or ground transmitter.|$|E
