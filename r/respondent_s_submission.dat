The submission alleges {{violations of the}} Labor Chapter of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), {{which has been in}} force between the United States and the Dominican Republic since March 2007. Although the Dominican Republic in general has a strong legal framework for protecting internationally recognized labor rights, allegations of labor abuses in the Dominican sugar sector have been longstanding subjects of international scrutiny. Reports on working conditions in this sector have repeatedly highlighted concerns. The Government of the Dominican Republic has conducted preventive labor inspections across the country during the period under review. However, the OTLA review has identified significant concerns about procedural and methodological shortcomings of that inspection process in the sugar sector that undermine the government’s capacity to effectively identify labor violations.

NICTA has considerable research expertise and practical experience in transport. Over the last six years, NICTA has worked extensively with both Federal and NSW government agencies and with NSW RMS (formerly NSW RTA). Our technology and research has been deployed in joint projects including video traffic detection, roundabout metering and signal control, over-height vehicle detection, structural health monitoring for the Sydney Harbour Bridge and, in conjunction with the NSW Transport Management Centre, incident management.

40|$|A photon or {{neutrino}} gas [...] semi-contained by a baryonic species through scattering [...] comprises {{a rather}} peculiar MHD fluid where {{the magnetic field}} is truly frozen only to the co-moving volume associated with the mass density. Although radiative diffusion precludes an adiabatic treatment of compressive perturbations, we show that the energy equation may be cast in "quasi-adiabatic" form for exponentially growing non-propagating wave modes. Defining a generalized quasi-adiabatic index leads to a relatively straightforward dispersion relation for non-axisymmetric magnetorotational modes in the horizontal regime when an accretion disk has comparable stress contributions from diffusive and non-diffusive particle species. This analysis is generally applicable to optically thick, neutrino-cooled disks since the pressure contributions from photons, pairs and neutrinos, {{all have the same}} temperature dependence whereas only the neutrino component has radiative heat conduction properties on the time and length scales of the instability.
