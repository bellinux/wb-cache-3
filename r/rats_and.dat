5|$|Before Ascension Island was colonised by Europeans in the 19th century, Johngarthia lagostoma was {{the only}} large land animal on the island. Since then, many species of mammal have been {{introduced}} to Ascension Island, and now compete with J.lagostoma; they include mice, <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> rabbits.|$|E
5|$|Delayed {{gratification}} or deferred gratification is {{an animal}} behavior {{that can be}} linked to delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms. Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as capuchin monkeys, tamarins, marmosets, <b>rats,</b> <b>and</b> pigeons.|$|E

5|$|The small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestus javanicus) {{was introduced}} to Hawaii {{in order to control}} the rat population. However the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the <b>rats,</b> <b>and</b> now both <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.|$|E
5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites. They smell foods on the fur, whiskers and especially the breath of other <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E

40|$|Secretin immunoreactivity was {{detected}} in {{the central nervous system}} of the <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> pig with a highly specific radioimmunoassay. The secretin immunoreactivity in the <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> pig brain and duodenum extracts was fractionated by using a reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatographic system. The immunoreactive secretin from pig brain and duodenum coeluted precisely with synthetic porcine secretin. However, immunoreactive secretin extracted from <b>rat</b> brain <b>and</b> duodenum eluted slightly before porcine secretin. These data suggest a slight difference in the structure of <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> pig secretin. The detection of secretin in the brain lays the groundwork for studies to determine the role of the peptide in central nervous system function...|$|R
5|$|Aristotle studied locusts {{and their}} {{breeding}} habits and Livy recorded a devastating plague in Capua in 203 BC. He mentioned human epidemics following locust plagues which he {{associated with the}} stench from the putrifying corpses; the linking of human disease outbreaks to locust plagues was widespread. A pestilence in China in 311 AD that killed 98% of the population locally was blamed on locusts, {{and may have been}} caused by an increase in numbers of <b>rats</b> (<b>and</b> their fleas) that devoured the locust carcases.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eater nests may be raided by <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> snakes, and {{the adults}} are hunted by {{birds of prey}} such as the Levant sparrowhawk. The little {{bee-eater}} and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide sounds like two bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of food from the adult bee-eaters.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with <b>rats,</b> <b>and</b> dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} damaging the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and bones were often removed to a nearby charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E

5|$|Experiments into behavior, to {{understand}} how organisms detect and {{interact with each other}} and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> birds. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity because it allows them to engage in a wider range of activities.|$|E
5|$|In most rodent species, such as brown <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> house mice, {{ovulation}} {{occurs on}} a regular cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating. During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage and to protect against other males inseminating the female. Females can remove the plug and may do so either immediately or after several hours.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, a bounty was levied on J.lagostoma {{in order to reduce}} its numbers. Hunters were paid 6 pence (alternatively paid in rum) for every hundred claws collected. In 1879, the total bag for the island {{comprised}} 66 cats, 4,013 mice, 7,683 <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> 80,414 land crabs; in the eight years to 1887, bounties were collected on more than 330,000 crabs. The current population is much smaller, and the low level of recruitment and lack of juveniles suggests that the species may become endangered.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, <b>rats,</b> <b>and</b> mice.|$|E
5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii, {{also known}} as Vespucci's rodent, is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil. Italian {{explorer}} Amerigo Vespucci may have seen it {{on a visit to}} Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, perhaps because of the exotic <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> mice introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain but probably Holocene age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Parrotfinches may be preyed upon by {{indigenous}} {{birds of}} prey such as the endemic Fiji goshawk, or by introduced mammals such as the small Asian mongoose, <b>rats,</b> <b>and</b> mice, {{and they may be}} susceptible to disease. The Fiji species, despite being both uncommon and endemic to one island group, appears to be stable in numbers. It is therefore classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and it is protected under Fijian law.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} storm petrel are {{threatened}} by human activities. One species, the Guadalupe storm petrel, {{is thought to have}} gone extinct. The principal threats to storm petrels are introduced species, particularly mammals, in their breeding colonies; many storm petrels habitually nest on isolated mammal-free islands and are unable to cope with predators like <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> feral cats.|$|E
5|$|Social rodents have a {{wider range}} of vocalizations than do solitary species. Fifteen {{different}} call-types have been recognized in adult Kataba mole <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> four in juveniles. Similarly, the common degu, another social, burrowing rodent, exhibits a wide array of communication methods and has an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising fifteen different categories of sound. Ultrasonic calls play a part in social communication between dormice and are used when the individuals are out of sight of each other.|$|E
5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E
