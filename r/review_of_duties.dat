40|$|Several {{environmental}} {{changes in the}} 1990 s – including {{the introduction of a}} national lottery, the rise of Internet gambling, and the reduction of trade barriers within the EU – induced the UK government to initiate a large-scale <b>review</b> <b>of</b> betting <b>duty.</b> As a result <b>of</b> this <b>review,</b> the government recently announced a significant reduction in betting taxes. They also decided to replace the current general betting duty (GBD), levied as a proportion of betting stakes, with a gross profits tax (GPT), based on the net revenue of bookmakers. We examine the economic rationale behind these decisions and demonstrate how these tax changes have broad implications regarding optimal levels of taxation for other sources of government revenue...|$|R
40|$|The Australian {{responses}} to corporate collapses {{in the modern}} commercial world have been implemented at both judicial and legislative levels {{over a period of}} decades. South Africa has lagged behind the reform process, only recently reviewing its company laws with a view to legislatively incorporating, inter alia, its directors’ <b>duties.</b> The consequence <b>of</b> such <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care is found in subsection 76 (3) (c) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008. This article critically evaluates the existing South African common law and the new legislative directors’ <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care in light <b>of</b> the equivalent <b>duties</b> in Australia and the United States. The analysis ultimately aims at determining whether the approach taken in any of these jurisdictions provides useful guidance in regard to reform options for the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. While the Companies Act contains features that are preferable to the Australian Corporations Act 2001, the impact of the Companies Act on crucial features, such as the objectivity <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care, is unclear and will have to await judicial review. It is concluded that while the South African measures at times echo Australian law in a positive manner, the Australian legislative regime is not without legitimate criticism as it can be unnecessarily complicated. Ultimately it is the United States and Australian common law <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care that provides the best model for legislative reform. <br /...|$|R

40|$|On 3 October 2008, the EU {{launched}} a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> anti-dumping <b>duties</b> on leather shoes from China and Vietnam. In December 2009, the EU decided to extend duties on the imports of leather shoes from China and Vietnam for another 15 months. This affirmative decision was taken despite heavy protests from consumers, importers and outsourcing firms, and it overruled the negative advice {{that had been}} formulated earlier by the EU Anti-Dumping Advisory Committee. The review procedure was launched {{just a few days}} after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which marked the outbreak of the Great Recession and fuelled the fear that the EU would engage in a ‘protectionist spiral’. In such a spiral, some countries would raise protection in order to counter the negative spillovers from the financial sector on the real economy. Other countries would become adversely affected by this protection and then start to retaliate. The question is whether this review marked the beginning of a more protectionist attitude in the EU in the face of the global recession...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{review the}} options for reform <b>of</b> stamp <b>duties</b> on {{immovable}} property transfers collected by Indian state governments. After briefly <b>reviewing</b> some <b>of</b> the many administrative difficulties experienced with the tax, they turn to an examination of its economic impacts. A <b>review</b> <b>of</b> stamp <b>duties</b> internationally indicates that Indian rates are exceptionally high, at rates often above 10 percent. Most countries' rates are less than 5 percent, including a number of low and middle-income developing countries. With these high rates, the authors find that while the tax has become the third largest revenue source for many Indian states, it imposes high compliance costs on taxpayers, has been subject to {{a good deal of}} evasion and fraud, and the distortionary impacts appear to be large, reducing the responsiveness of real estate markets in Indian cities by discouraging transactions essential to the efficient growth of cities. The authors then study the revenue implications <b>of</b> lowering stamp <b>duty</b> rates, which need to be understood if reform is to be viable. Evidence indicates that the current high duty rates, coupled with weak tax administration, lead to widespread evasion of the tax through under-declaration. This under-declaration of property values directly affects collection of other taxes, among them, property taxes and capital gains tax. Moreover, it indirectly affects the collection of all taxes through the impact of under-declaration on the circulation of black money. Simulations indicate that revenues lost due to a lowering <b>of</b> stamp <b>duty</b> rates closer to international levels are quite likely to be recovered in higher collections of other taxes. However, these taxes would at least in part be collected by other levels of government. So reform could be made a more viable option through appropriately designed intergovernmental transfers...|$|R

40|$|The current {{regulatory}} {{approach to}} coal seam gas projects in Queensland {{is based on}} the philosophy of adaptive environmental management. This method of “learning by doing” is implemented in Queensland primarily through the imposition of layered monitoring and reporting duties on the coal seam gas operator alongside obligations to compensate and “make good” harm caused. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide a critical <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the Queensland regulatory approach to the approval and minimisation of adverse impacts from coal seam gas activities. Following an overview of the hallmarks of an effective adaptive management approach, this article begins by addressing the mosaic of approval processes and impact assessment regimes that may apply to coal seam gas projects. This includes recent Strategic Cropping Land reforms. This article then turns to consider the preconditions for land access in Queensland and the emerging issues for landholders relating to the negotiation of access and compensation agreements. This article then undertakes a critical <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the environmental <b>duties</b> imposed on coal seam gas operators relating to hydraulic fracturing, well head leaks, groundwater management and the disposal and beneficial use of produced water. Finally, conclusions are drawn regarding the overall effectiveness of the Queensland framework and the lessons that may be drawn from Queensland’s adaptive environmental management approach...|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{there were}} two main {{fiduciary}} duties in corporate law, care and loyalty, and only the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty was {{likely to lead to}} liability. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, the Delaware Supreme Court breathed life into the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care, created a number of intermediate standards <b>of</b> <b>review,</b> elevated the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> good faith to equal standing with care and loyalty, and announced a unified test for <b>review</b> <b>of</b> breaches <b>of</b> fiduciary <b>duty.</b> The law, which once seemed so straightforward, suddenly became elaborate and complex. In 2006, in the case of Stone v. Ritter, the Delaware Supreme Court rejected the triadic formulation and declared that good faith was a component <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. In this and other respects, Delaware seems to be returning to a bifurcated understanding of the law <b>of</b> fiduciary <b>duties.</b> I believe that this is a mistake. The law is inherently complex and much too important to be oversimplified. The current academic debate on the issue focuses on whether there should be two duties or three. In this article, I argue that the question is misleading and irrelevant, but that if it must be asked, the best answer is that there are five duties - one for each paradigm of enforcement. In defending this claim, I explain the true nature <b>of</b> fiduciary <b>duties</b> and provide a robust framework for the discussion, implementation, and development of the law. fiduciary duties, corporate law, good faith, reasonableness, standards <b>of</b> <b>review,</b> corporate governanc...|$|R
