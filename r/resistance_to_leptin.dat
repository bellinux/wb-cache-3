The antagonist increased feeding and body weight (BW) in lean mice, but not in obese models of leptin, leptin receptor, or melanocortin- 4 receptor deficiency. In contrast, the antagonist increased feeding and BW comparably in lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, an increase associated with decreased hypothalamic expression of Socs 3, a primary target of leptin. These findings demonstrate that hyperleptinemic DIO mice retain leptin suppression of feeding comparable to lean mice and counter the view that <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> endogenous <b>leptin</b> contributes <b>to</b> the persistence of DIO in mice...|$|R

40|$|Obesity, {{defined as}} {{abnormal}} or excessive fat accumulation that may impair life quality, {{is one of}} the major public health problems worldwide. It results from an imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure. The control of energy balance in animals and humans is performed by the central nervous system (CNS) by means of neuroendocrine connections, in which circulating peripheral hormones, such as leptin and insulin, provide signals to specialized neurons of the hypothalamus reflecting body fat stores, and induce appropriate responses to maintain the stability of these stores. The majority of obesity cases are associated with central <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> both <b>leptin</b> and insulin actions. In experimental animals, high-fat diets can induce an inflammatory process in the hypothalamus, which impairs leptin and insulin intracellular signaling pathways, and results in hyperphagia, decreased energy expenditure and, ultimately, obesity.

40|$|SummaryLeptin {{secreted}} by adipocytes acts on {{the brain}} to reduce food intake by regulating neuronal activity in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). Obesity is associated with <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> high circulating <b>leptin</b> levels. Here, we demonstrate that peripherally administered leptin activates its receptor (LepR) in median eminence tanycytes followed by MBH neurons, a process requiring tanycytic ERK signaling and the passage of leptin through the cerebrospinal fluid. In mice lacking the signal-transducing LepRb isoform or with diet-induced obesity, leptin taken up by tanycytes accumulates in the median eminence and fails to reach the MBH. Triggering ERK signaling in tanycytes with EGF reestablishes leptin transport, elicits MBH neuron activation and energy expenditure in obese animals, and accelerates the restoration of leptin sensitivity upon the return to a normal-fat diet. ERK-dependent leptin transport by tanycytes could thus {{play a critical role}} in the pathophysiology of leptin resistance, and holds therapeutic potential for treating obesity...|$|R

Subjects: Two groups of patients the common symptoms of whom were underweight, amenorrhea, the absence of chromosomal or monogenic abnormality. Group 1 consisted of 48 adolescent girls diagnosed as having anorexia nervosa; Group 2 included 41 patients without eating behavioral disorders. A control group comprised 24 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 20. 3 (18. 5; 24. 9) without eating behavioral disorders and with a normal menstrual cycle. Methods: anthropometry, enzyme immunoassay of plasma leptin and neuropeptide Y levels. The statistical validity of group differences was estimated by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results. There were reductions in the serum content of leptin in patients at an anorectic stage, its hyperproduction at the stage of AN reduction, and no relationship of the <b>leptin</b> concentration <b>to</b> BMI.

Endo 1 is up-regulated in the ARC of high fat diet (HFD) -fed mice, and its silencing in the ARC of lean and obese mice prevents and reverses the development of obesity.

This thesis employed a rodent model of IH to examine changes to molecular neural pathways associated with metabolic and cardiovascular pathophysiological outcomes of OSA. Acute IH induces a specific negative body energy balance phenotype. This is concomitant to a reduction in body weight and food intake, with an elevation in food conversion efficiency. Increased plasma leptin concentrations also occur immediately following acute IH, which is mirrored by increased activation of leptin-signaling and satiety-inducing molecules within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). The effects observed on body energy balance following acute IH are attenuated in the homozygous leptin-deficient KILO rat, suggesting the importance of elevated leptin in mediating the body energy balance responses following acute IH. Over chronic IH exposure, rats have a complex metabolic phenotype, which includes a reduction in body weight and body fat mass. Throughout the chronic period of exposure, animals develop a <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the hormone <b>leptin,</b> the primary hallmark for the development of obesity.

Chronic IH also elevates resting blood pressure and reduces baroreceptor reflex gain, which are associated with reduced neuroplasticity markers within the nucleus of the solitary tract.

40|$|Intrauterine growth {{restriction}} (IUGR) {{is closely}} linked with metabolic diseases, appetite disorders and obesity at adulthood. Leptin, a major adipokine secreted by adipose tissue, circulates {{in direct proportion}} to body fat stores, enters the brain and regulates food intake and energy expenditure. Deficient leptin neuronal signalling favours weight gain by affecting central homeostatic circuitry. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if leptin resistance was programmed by perinatal nutritional environment and to decipher potential cellular mechanisms underneath. We clearly demonstrated that 5 months old IUGR rats develop a decrease of leptin sentivity, characterized by no significant reduction of food intake following an intraperitoneal injection of leptin. Apart from the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>leptin</b> injection, results obtained from IUGR rats submitted to rapid catch-up growth differed from those of IUGR rats with no catch-up since we observed, for the first group only, fat accumulation, increased appetite for food rich in fat and increased leptin synthesis. Centrally, the leptin resistant state of both groups was associated with a complex and not always similar changes in leptin receptor signalling steps. Leptin resistance in IUGR rats submitted to rapid catch-up was associated with alteration in AKT and mTOR pathways. Alternatively, in IUGR rats with no catch-up, leptin resistance was associated with low hypothalamic expression of LepRa and LepRb. This study reveals leptin resistance as an early marker of metabolic disorders that appears before any evidence of body weigh...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} the effects of neonatal handling, an animal model of early experience, on spatial learning and memory, on hippocampal glucocorticoid (GR), mineralocorticoid (MR) and type 1 A serotonin (5 -HT 1 A) receptors, as well as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and on circulating leptin levels, of male rats. Method Spatial learning and memory following an acute restraint stress (30 min) were assessed in the Morris water maze. Hippocampal GR, MR and BDNF levels were determined immunocytochemically. 5 -HT 1 A receptors were quantified by in vitro binding autoradiography. Circulating leptin levels, following a chronic forced swimming stress, were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results Neonatal handling increased the ability of male rats for spatial learning and memory. It also resulted in increased GR/MR ratio, BDNF and 5 -HT 1 A receptor levels in the hippocampus. Furthermore, leptin levels, body weight and food consumption during chronic forced swimming stress were reduced {{as a result of}} handling. Conclusion Neonatal handling is shown to have a beneficial effect in the males, improving their cognitive abilities. This effect on behavior could be mediated by the handling-induced increase in hippocampal GR/MR ratio and BDNF levels. The handling-induced changes in BDNF and 5 -HT 1 A receptors could underlie the previously documented effect of handling in preventing "depression". Furthermore, handling is shown to prevent other maladaptive states such as stress-induced hyperphagia, obesity and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>leptin.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Polymorphisms in genes {{encoding}} adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and interleukin- 6 (IL 6) {{have been}} associated with adiposity and obese-related phenotypes. This study investigated the relationship of ADIPOQ and IL 6 gene polymorphisms with pro-inflammatory and cardiometabolic markers in obese patients. Methods Anthropometric and body composition parameters were measured in 249 Brazilian subjects (30 to 68  yr). Metabolic and inflammatory markers and adipokines were analyzed in blood samples. ADIPOQ rs 2241766 (45  T[*]>[*]G) and IL 6 rs 1800795 (− 174 G[*]>[*]C) polymorphisms were analyzed by real-time PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. Results Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and increased values of waist circumference, body fat, leptin, fibrinogen, IL- 1 β, hsCRP and TNFα were related to obesity (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed a positive correlation between BMI and waist circumference, body fat, leptin, fibrinogen, PAI- 1, IL- 1 β, hsCRP and TNFα values (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) but not with adiponectin. Obese group had altered metabolic status, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>leptin</b> and insulin, and atherogenic and pro-inflammatory profiles. ADIPOQ and IL 6 variants were not directely related to obesity, leptin resistance or alterations in cardiometabolic markers. Individuals carrying ADIPOQ 45 G allele (TG[*]+[*]GG genotype) had higher IL- 6, IL- 1 β and TNFα levels than TT genotype carriers (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). IL 6 - 174 GG genotype was associated with increased IL- 1 β levels (p[*]=[*] 0. 033). Conclusion Obesity is associated with leptin resistance, cardiometabolic alterations and a pro-inflammatory status. Our results are suggestive that ADIPOQ and IL 6 polymorphisms contribute to cardiometabolic risk in obese individuals. FAPESPCAPESCNPqCONICY...|$|E
40|$|Diet-induced obesity (DIO) {{resulting}} from consumption {{of a high}} fat diet (HFD) attenuates normal neuronal responses <b>to</b> <b>leptin</b> and {{may contribute to the}} metabolic defense of an acquired higher body weight in humans; the molecular bases for the persistence of this defense are unknown. We measured the responses of 23 brain regions <b>to</b> exogenous <b>leptin</b> in 4 different groups of weight- and/or diet-perturbed mice. Responses <b>to</b> <b>leptin</b> were assessed by quantifying pSTAT 3 levels in brain nuclei 30 minutes following 3 mg/kg intraperitoneal leptin. HFD attenuated leptin sensing throughout the brain, but weight loss did not restore central <b>leptin</b> signaling <b>to</b> control levels in several brain regions important in energy homeostasis, including the arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei. Effects of diet on leptin signaling varied by brain region, with results dependent on the method of weight loss (restriction of calories of HFD, ad lib intake of standard mouse chow). High fat diet attenuates leptin signaling throughout the brain, but some brain regions maintain their ability <b>to</b> sense <b>leptin.</b> Weight loss restores <b>leptin</b> sensing <b>to</b> some degree in most (but not all) brain regions, while other brain regions display hypersensitivity <b>to</b> <b>leptin</b> following weight loss.

40|$|SummaryPI 3 K {{signaling}} {{is thought}} <b>to</b> mediate <b>leptin</b> and insulin action in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons, key regulators of energy homeostasis, through largely unknown mechanisms. We inactivated either p 110 α or p 110 β PI 3 K catalytic subunits in these neurons and demonstrate a dominant {{role for the}} latter in energy homeostasis regulation. In POMC neurons, p 110 β inactivation prevented insulin- and leptin-stimulated electrophysiological responses. POMCp 110 β null mice exhibited central leptin resistance, increased adiposity, and diet-induced obesity. In contrast, the response <b>to</b> <b>leptin</b> was not blocked in p 110 α-deficient POMC neurons. Accordingly, POMCp 110 α null mice displayed minimal energy homeostasis abnormalities. Similarly, in AgRP neurons, p 110 β had a more important role than p 110 α. AgRPp 110 α null mice displayed normal energy homeostasis regulation, whereas AgRPp 110 β null mice were lean, with increased <b>leptin</b> sensitivity and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> diet-induced obesity. These results demonstrate distinct metabolic roles for the p 110 α and p 110 β isoforms of PI 3 K in hypothalamic energy regulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLeptin {{concentrations}} are elevated in {{the majority}} of obese individuals raising the possibility that <b>leptin</b> <b>resistance</b> contributes <b>to</b> their obesity. Peripheral leptin administration for 48 h caused a several-fold increase in mRNA encoding the suppressors of cytokine signaling SOCS- 3 and CIS in hypothalamus and peripheral tissues. Paradoxically, CIS and SOCS- 3 mRNAs are also elevated in the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse. Forced expression of CIS in insulinoma cells prevented transactivation mediated by leptin. Thus tissues continuously exposed <b>to</b> <b>leptin</b> and/or other factors associated with obesity accumulate excessive amounts of SOCS- 3 and CIS which could provide a potential mechanism for leptin resistance...|$|R
