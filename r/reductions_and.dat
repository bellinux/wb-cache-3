5|$|For the 2007–2008 period, EVA Air {{coped with}} a 34% surge in fuel prices, which {{contributed to a}} US$61.2 million 2007 loss. In August 2008, EVA Air {{reported}} a second quarterly loss due to increased fuel costs. In response, the airline implemented cost-saving measures, including flight schedule <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> fee increases. In early 2008, EVA Air's business office in El Segundo, California, announced a major staff reduction, with over half the staff advised that they {{would no longer be}} employed by May 2008. Functions performed by those local staff were shifted to Taiwan by half, such as the reservation center.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, EVA Air began listing public stock offerings on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Initially, {{one percent}} of the company's shares was offered over-the-counter, with one-quarter held by parent company Evergreen Marine Corporation and EVA Air employees, respectively. In 2002, EVA Air {{underwent}} internal corporate reforms, with staff <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> streamlined management. This culminated a process which had begun in 1997, when the Asian financial crisis began affecting profitability. The 2002–2003 SARS contagion also affected passenger traffic for medium-haul flights in Southeast Asia, while long-haul flights to North America, Japan, and Europe were less affected.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2005 season, an NCAA {{investigation}} found that eleven ineligible players had played for the Yellow Jackets between the 1998 and 2005 seasons. These players played while not making progress towards graduation on the NCAA-approved schedule. The football victories for that season were initially revoked, and Georgia Tech was put on two years of NCAA probation. Twelve football scholarships were stricken from Georgia Tech's allotment for the 2006 and 2007 freshman classes. The Georgia Tech Athletic Department appealed this decision by the NCAA, and the records were restored but scholarship <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> probation remained. Athletic Director Dave Braine retired in January 2006, and Dan Radakovich was hired as Athletic Director.|$|E

5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E
5|$|Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich {{framed the}} McKinley Tariff that {{would raise the}} tariff even higher, {{including}} making some rates intentionally prohibitive. At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add reciprocity provisions, which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports. The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production. Even with the <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to {{the reputation of the}} Billion-Dollar Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Territorial Force was disbanded {{and later}} {{reformed}} as the Territorial Army and the regiment's battalions were also reformed. However, inter-war <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> reorganisations reduced the regiment's territorial battalions {{from six to}} just one by 1937. The 8th disbanded in the early 1920s, the 9th was absorbed by the Royal Engineers, and a restructuring of the Territorial Army's infantry in the mid-1930s converted the 6th, 7th, and 10th to new roles. The 6th were transferred to the Royal Engineers and became 38th (King's) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Engineers. The 7th joined the Royal Tank Regiment and became the 40th (The King's) Royal Tank Regiment, and the 10th became a battalion of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of percutaneous poking <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> fixation with open <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> fixation {{in the treatment of}} displaced calcaneal fractures. Methods: Reports of studies using case-controlled trials (CCT) to compare the percutaneous poking <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> fixation with the open <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> fixation in the management of calcaneal fractures were retrieved from the Cochrane Library, PubMed Database, CNKI, Chinese Biomedical Database, Wanfang Data (from January of 2005 to August of 2015). Methodological quality of the trials was critically assessed, and relevant data were extracted. Statistical software Revman 5. 0 was used for data-analysis. Results: Fifteen articles were included in the meta-analysis. Comparison of {{the efficacy of}} percutaneous poking <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> fixation with open <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> fixation in the treatment of calcaneal fractures revealed statistical significance in the incidence of complications after operation [RR =  0. 32, 95 % CI (0. 20, 0. 5), p    0. 05] and calcaneal Gissane angle [WMD = − 3. 21, 95 % CI (− 6. 75, 0. 33), p >  0. 05], nor statistical significance in the rate of good foot function after operation [RR =  0. 95, 95 % CI (0. 90, 1. 00), p >  0. 05]. Conclusion: For the treatment of calcaneal fractures, percutaneous poking <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> fixation is superior to open <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> fixation in terms of the incidence of postoperative complications.

5|$|When Randall {{returned}} to Washington in 1881 {{to begin his}} term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield's assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had {{returned to}} his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few Democrats in the House to support the it. The bill {{that emerged from the}} Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more <b>reductions,</b> <b>and</b> his constituents at home, who wanted less.|$|E

25|$|Many {{complexity}} {{classes are}} defined using {{the concept of}} a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem X can be solved using an algorithm for Y, X is no more difficult than Y, and we say that X reduces to Y. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> Levin <b>reductions,</b> <b>and</b> the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions.|$|E

40|$|Background: Fractures of distal radius {{continue}} to be the most common skeletal injury treated by orthopedic surgeons. The treatment of distal end radius fracture has changed over period. The aim of treatment of distal radius fracture is to obtain a good anatomical <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> fixation and finally a good functional outcome. Objective: To study comparative evaluation in the measurement of the radial height, radial inclination and ulnar variance in fracture distal end radius treated conservatively by closed <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> cast <b>and</b> closed <b>reduction,</b> Kirschner wire <b>and</b> cast. Materials and Methods: In the present prospective study, we are reporting our experience in 30 cases where comparative evaluation in the measurement of the radial height, radial inclination, and ulnar variance was done in fractures distal end radius treated conservatively by closed <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> cast <b>and</b> closed <b>reduction,</b> K- wire, <b>and</b> cast technique. Results: As measured by Mayo functional score, we had 14 satisfactory and 1 poor result in the Group 1 (closed <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> cast) while 8 excellent results and 7 good results in the Group 2 (closed <b>reduction,</b> Kirschner wire <b>and</b> cast). As measured with the modified demerit point system of Saito, in the Group 1 (closed <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> cast), 11 had average results and 4 had fair results; and in our Group 2 (closed <b>reduction,</b> Kirschner wire <b>and</b> cast), 9 had excellent results and 6 had good results...|$|R
