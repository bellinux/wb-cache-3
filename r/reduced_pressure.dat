5|$|With {{regard to}} hurricanes, it was {{hypothesized}} that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide, latent heat would be released. This would promote the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient. Even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane's winds would be beneficial: since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed, a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many {{internal}} fatigue {{cracks and}} fissures {{in the water}} drums of her boilers {{that could not be}} repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure,</b> and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.|$|E

25|$|Short path {{distillation}} is a distillation {{technique that}} involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure.</b> A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, {{without the need for}} a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure)</b> than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost {{on the sides of the}} apparatus. The Kugelrohr is a kind of a short path distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.|$|E

25|$|According to many critics, the {{economic}} crisis in the 1980s worsened environmental degradation in Brazil because it led to overexploitation of natural resources, stimulated settlement in fragile lands in both rural and urban areas, and weakened environmental protection.

25|$|The eternal {{problem with}} {{compounds}} is starting: for all cylinders {{to take their}} weight, it is advisable to have some way of short-circuiting the HP cylinders and getting steam at a <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure</b> directly to the LP cylinder(s); hence many of the patented compound systems are associated with particular starting arrangements. The de Glehn 4-cylinder system is probably still the most sophisticated of all with independent HP & LP cut-off and a rotary valve, called a lanterne allowing independent working or combinations of HP and LP groups. Most other systems employ starting valves of various kinds. Another criterion is whether the valve gears {{of the two groups}} are wholly independent or linked together in some way.|$|E
25|$|Dilute {{nitric acid}} may be {{concentrated}} by distillation up to 68% acid, {{which is a}} maximum boiling azeotrope containing 32% water. In the laboratory, further concentration involves distillation with either sulfuric acid or magnesium nitrate which act as dehydrating agents. Such distillations must be done with all-glass apparatus at <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure,</b> to prevent decomposition of the acid. Industrially, highly concentrated nitric acid is produced by dissolving additional nitrogen dioxide in 68% nitric acid in an absorption tower. Dissolved nitrogen oxides are either stripped {{in the case of}} white fuming nitric acid, or remain in solution to form red fuming nitric acid. More recently, electrochemical means have been developed to produce anhydrous acid from concentrated nitric acid feedstock.|$|E

25|$|In constant-flow {{regulators}} {{the first}} stage is a pressure regulator providing a constant <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the second stage is a plain on/off valve. These are the earliest type of breathing set flow control. The diver must open and close the supply valve to regulate flow. Constant flow valves in an open circuit breathing set consume gas less economically than demand valve regulators because gas flows {{even when it is}} not needed. Before 1939, diving and industrial open circuit breathing sets with constant-flow regulators were designed by Le Prieur, but did not get into general use due to very short dive duration. Design complications resulted from the need to put the second-stage flow control valve where it could be easily operated by the diver.|$|E
25|$|The Passarell process uses reduced {{atmospheric}} pressure rather than heat to drive evaporative desalination. The pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor. The compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure</b> in the evaporation chamber. The compressor centrifuges the pure water vapor {{after it is}} drawn through a demister (removing residual impurities) causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber. The compression of the vapor increases its temperature. The heat is transferred to the input water falling in the tubes, vaporizing {{the water in the}} tubes. Water vapor condenses {{on the outside of the}} tubes as product water. By combining several physical processes, Passarell enables most of the system's energy to be recycled through its evaporation, demisting, vapor compression, condensation, and water movement processes.|$|E

500|$|The {{underside}} of the BT49 is shaped to create downforce through ground effect: air is accelerated under the car, reducing the air pressure beneath it and pushing the tyres down harder onto the track. This provides more grip and thus higher cornering speeds, but compared to conventional wings creates less of the drag that slows the car in a straight line. In its original form, the <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure</b> area under the car was sealed off with sliding skirts which rose and fell with {{the movement of the}} car to ensure no air could leak under it. According to Murray, the aerodynamics were the car's great strength: [...] "It had more [...] than any other car and it all came from the ground effect.

500|$|Most of the {{chlorine}} oxoacids may {{be produced by}} exploiting these disproportionation reactions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. Chlorous acid (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, sodium chlorite is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and {{as a source of}} chlorine dioxide. Chloric acid (HOClO2) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure</b> allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is sodium chlorate, mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp.

Chloride and chlorate may comproportionate to form chlorine as follows: ...|$|E
