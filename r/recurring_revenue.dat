2500|$|When {{companies}} are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make {{the distinction between}} gross attrition and net attrition. Gross attrition {{is the loss of}} existing customers and their associated <b>recurring</b> <b>revenue</b> for contracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation called Recurring Monthly Revenue (or RMR). [...] In the 2000s, there are also a number of business intelligence software programs which can mine databases of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies. More sophisticated predictive analytics software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.|$|E
50|$|Revenue churn is the {{monetary}} amount of <b>recurring</b> <b>revenue</b> {{lost in a}} period divided by the total revenue {{at the beginning of}} the period.

40|$|In slow or no-growth economies, firms cannot rely {{solely on}} {{recurring}} business from large, core customers who often delay or cancel capital investments in belt-tightening times. To achieve growth, firms must lever domain knowledge to expand business markets to find new customers. A core method to accomplish this expansion is through service models that can provide <b>recurring</b> <b>revenues</b> without as much up-front investment for customers. However, in a product-centric firm, the process of transforming a product into a service can be complex, and is the motivation for this research.

40|$|More {{and more}} {{businesses}} today focus on building long-term customer {{relationships with the}} objective to secure <b>recurring</b> <b>revenues</b> in competitive markets. As a result, management philosophies such as Customer Success have emerged, which underlines the importance of knowing your customers {{in order to make}} them stay. A common way of tracking the well-being of a firm's customers is the use of customer health scores. Such tools monitor assembled data and indicate whether a customer is doing fine, or is in the risk zone of ending the business relationship. However, there exists little to no consensus on what customer health actually means, or how to distinguish suitable parameters for measuring this concept. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis has been: To extend the existing knowledge of the business concept customer health, and show how to identify relevant parameters for measuring customer health. To reach this purpose, a study has been conducted at a software-as-a-service company operating in the field of digital marketing; where methods such as semi-structured interviews, ethnography, web survey, data mining execution and statistical analysis have been used. The results show that software usage differs between active and former customers, with the general tendency that a high software usage indicates a higher propensity to stay as a customer. The study concludes that customer health is best defined as "the perceived value a customer experiences when using a product". In addition, the parameters that were found to best indicate customer health at the company studied were linked to customers’ software usage as well as their marketing set-up...|$|R
40|$|Radical {{corporate}} innovation ventures (RCV) can be {{engines of}} renewal and profitable growth. However, their outcome is highly unpredictable. This research explored, how industrial and knowledge intensive RCVs confront reality, deal with uncertainty {{and how they}} control their destiny. In essence, this research project has empirically investigated during the early time-into-market, the market and business development (MBD) of RCVs, through a capabilities (CAP) and dynamic capabilities (DCAP) evolutionary lens; a neglected research space. At {{the end of this}} report, a glossary and an overview of the abbreviations are included. Due to the multi-disciplinary, multi-dimensionality and complexity of the research scope, this study conducted during 3 years, longitudinal field research, studied in-depth 6 cases, involved through face-to-face interviews and focus group sessions, more than 100 managers, applied the triangulation method and analysed extensively the related literature. This research suggests that MBD or developing a market (MD) and developing a business (BD), can be operationalized, as an entrepreneurial market orientation (EMO) CAP (1). During a prospecting and trial phase, an aligned Schumpeterian and driving EMO combination is the better fit (2). In the next phase, defined as acceleration phase, a Kirznerian and driven EMO combination is the better fit (3). This approach can result in a more effective time-into-market, a better MBD learning curve, generate faster <b>recurring</b> <b>revenues</b> and lead to a first prover advantage (FPA) (4). Concurrently, MBD can also be operationalized as a bridging or DCAP with sensing, scaling, collaborating, capturing and leading as dominant DCAPs (5). Moreover, a MBD lead framework could be identified. Basically, lead organisations orchestrate seven interdependent lead elements: lead offerings, lead users, lead customers, lead partners, lead experts, lead markets and lead champions. An optimal lead mix is dependent on external dynamics, organizational DNA and strategic options (6). This research also suggests that MBD CAPs and DCAPs are hardly on the management agenda, are mostly ignored, and are avoided, because they are invisible and perceived as difficult to implement (7). Furthermore, both need to be de-averaged, integrated and dynamically synchronised (8). Finally, limitations have been discussed and avenues for further research determined (9).
