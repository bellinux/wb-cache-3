The natural oils like rice bran oils, soybean oils, sunflower oils, vegetables oils and palm oils can be used as processing oils in rubber compounding [1 - 3]. These natural oils have been reported to have certain advantages compared to the petroleum based processing oils. In this study the potential of epoxidized palm oils (EPO) as additive and processing oils in carbon black filled styrene butadiene rubber was investigated.

Aromatic oil has disadvantages in that, it is hazardous to environment, toxic and has been labeled as carcinogenic. In this research, an epoxidised oil (EO) and {{aromatic oil}} were used to investigate the effect incorporation of oil onto the SBR/NR natural rubber vulcanizates (NR). From the result obtained, EO showed shorter cure time and scorch time as the oil loading were increased up to 20 pphr of EO. Physical properties such as hardness and <b>rebound</b> <b>resilience</b> of NR/EO vulcanisate were also investigated upon exposure to different humidity level in humidity chamber. At room temperature, the hardness of EO loading onto the SBR/NR vulcanisate is lower than AO loadings. Hardness was slightly decreased with increasing rate of humidity. There is great difference in hardness and <b>rebound</b> <b>resilience</b> values between AO and EO. Both hardness and <b>rebound</b> <b>resilience</b> were not affected by humidity.

Taking data from various pitch positions, the two measured quantities were shown for the first time, as far as we are aware, to be inversely related for both natural turf pitches.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the molecular dynamics {{as well as the}} composition and the structures of different types of industrial polymers such as thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) and filled raw EPDM samples. The NMR measurements were restricted to transverse relaxation of the magnetization and DQ NMR experiments, done on a low field spectrometer (0. 5 T) at a proton Larmor frequency of 20 MHz. The measurement temperatures were varied, depending on the glass transition temperature of the investigated materials. A measurement temperature 100 ° C above the glass transition temperature provides a high molecular mobility and an enhanced contrast in the NMR signal. Moreover, thermal (DSC) and mechanical (<b>rebound</b> <b>resilience,</b> hardness and tensile testing) tests have been done on the TPU materials, and their macroscopic properties have been determined. The purpose of investigating the TPU samples is a better characterization of these materials by combining a set of measurements, in particular differential scanning calorimetery, <b>rebound</b> <b>resilience,</b> hardness, tensile testing, and NMR techniques. The mechanical and the thermal properties of thermoplastic polyurethanes, as well as their chain dynamics determined by NMR are influenced by the number average molecular weight of the segments, the type and the amount of the hard and soft segments, the interaction between these two phases and by the capacity of soft segments to crystallize. The good correlation between the macroscopic properties as determined by classical methods and the microscopic properties determined by NMR recommends low-field NMR as a potential method for quality control, with the particular of being fast, inexpensive and partially non-destructive. The influence of the filler amount and activity on the unvulcanized EPDM polymer matrices was investigated via transverse relaxation NMR experiments. The results were interpreted using both the Sotta, Fülber, Demco, Blümich, Spiess and the Gotlieb-Fedotov-Schneider models. The sensitivity of the determined effective relaxation times in both models is discussed, for varying the composition of the fillers. Moreover, the values of the average dipolar coupling results from the relaxation and double-quantum build up experiments are compared and discussed. These studies have led to a phenomenological description of the changes in the chain mobility and order {{under the influence of the}} composition. The interpretation of the results has been given based on the available theory for polymers and on the cumulative information obtained from all measurements done on these materials. The NMR methods employed are relatively easy and highly sensitive to the changes in the chain mobility and segmental order of matter, factors which recommend them as applicable to all kinds of polymeric materials, for which microscopic parameters and phase compositions shall be determined. The investigation of these materials as a function of time and temperature can provide additional information regarding the chain mobility, segmental order and phase composition before and after thermal transitions, thus helping to improve the processing parameters.

Specifically, the crystallizability and melting temperature (Tm) decreased with FDCA content 0 – 50 mol%, but rose again at FDCA content 75 – 100 mol%. And, the glass transition temperature (Tg) increased continuously with increasing FDCA content. Consequently, the tensile modulus and strength decreased but the ultimate elongation increased at lower FDCA content (0 – 50 mol%), which were converse at higher FDCA content (75 – 100 mol%).

Over the period 1998 to 2003 a total of 92 County Championship match pitches were nominated. A standardised range of measurements were made on pitches including bounce, hardness and friction. Visual analysis was made of soil and turf features. The playing characteristics reported by umpires were assessed in relation to the pitch properties recorded. High speed video (HSV) recordings were made on twenty three of the pitches. A comparison between umpires' pitch ratings of bounce and HSV analysis indicated that umpires' assessments are quite reliable.

Test specimens were exposed to two different sand media at different mass loadings ranging from 0. 1 to 20 g/cm^ 2. The tools of characterization used on the pristine polyurethane are once again used on the eroded specimens, with the goal to compare pre- and post- erosion results. The comparison of FTIR results on pre-eroded and eroded films reveal the removal of macromolecular bonds corresponding to soft segments in the micro scale. The reduction of the crystalline portion of the soft segment observed from DSC results supports the FTIR findings. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the eroded specimens are used to correlate the sequence of the damage due to erosion. The observations revealed that after initial ductile deformation of the soft segments on the surface, brittle cracks are formed on the hard segments. The increased exposure to sand particles leads to formation of fragments containing mainly soft segments with cracks in the hard segments propagating in a brittle manner. As exposure increases, cracks intersect and material on the surface gets removed which mainly contains the soft segments as revealed by the FTIR and DSC results...|$|E
40|$|The oils are {{generally}} {{added in the}} rubber compounds to improve processing properties, low temperature properties, dispersion of fillers, and to reduce cost. The conventionally widely used oils in tire compounds are Distillate Aromatic Extract (DAE) oils, which contain {{a high concentration of}} Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs that can be released from tires by tire wear are harmful to health and environment, so safe process oils are needed to replace aromatic oil in tire compounds. This thesis comparatively studies the influences of PAH-free petroleum based extender oils, i. e. Treated Distillate Aromatic Extract (TDAE) and Mild Extracted Solvate (MES), versus the DAE oil on the properties of NR-based truck tire tread compounds and NR/SBR-based passenger tire tread compounds. Oil characterization data are analyzed, and the influence of the oils on the properties of unfilled compounds is also elucidated. The different chemical structures and compositions of DAE-, TDAE- and MES-oils that affect on their characteristics, have influences on their compatibility with rubbers and the properties of the corresponding rubber compounds. The theoretical predictions based on differences in solubility parameters (Δδ) and the experimental swelling study agree well in that MES is less compatible with NR and SBR compared with TDAE and DAE. The difference of cure characteristics, due to the presence of nitrogen-and sulfur-heterocyclic species in DAE oil, as observed in unfilled compounds, is diminished in the carbon black-filled compounds. The mechanical properties of both unfilled and carbon black filled compounds are little influenced by the change of oil types, but the properties are changed according to the oil loadings, basically due to the dilution effect. The different glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the oils affect the Tg’s of the rubber vulcanizates and hence the viscoelastic-related properties, i. e. abrasion resistance, <b>rebound</b> <b>resilience,</b> heat build-up and loss tangent. The replacement of toxic DAE by safe TDAE and MES enhances the elastic response of the materials. Based on the processing properties of the uncured compounds and mechanical as well as dynamic properties of the vulcanizates, TDAE oil provides better overall properties as replacement for DAE oil than MES...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{four different}} studis describing the characteristics and processing opportunities of two widely available biopolymers: chitosan and wheat gluten. The {{interest in these}} materials is mainly because they are bio-based and obtained as co- or by-products in the fuel and food sector In the first study, high solids content chitosan samples (60 wt. %) were successfully extruded. Chitosan extrusion has previously been reported but not chitosan extrusion with a high solids content, which decreases the drying time and increases the production volume. An orthogonal experimental design {{was used to assess}} the influence of formulation and processing conditions, and the optimal formulation and conditions were determined from the orthogonal experimental analysis and the qualities of the extrudates. The mechanical properties and processing-liquid mass loss of the optimized extrudates showed that the extrudates became stable within three days. The changes in the mechanical properties depended on the liquid mass loss. In a separate study, monocarboxylic (formic, acetic, propionic, and butyric) acid uptake and diffusion in chitosan films were investigated. It is of importance {{in order to be able}} to optimize the production of this material with the casting technique. The time of the equilibration uptake in the chitosan films exposed to propionic and butyric acid was nine months. This long equilibration time encouraged us study the exposed films further. The uptake and diffusivity of acid in the films decreased with increasing acid molecular size. A two-stage absorption curve was observed for the films exposed to propionic acid vapour. The films at the different stages showed different diffusivities. The acid transport was also affected by the structure of the chitosan films. X-ray diffraction suggested that the crystal structure of the original films disappeared after the films had been dried from their acid-swollen state, and that the microstructure of the dried films depended on the molecular size of the acid. Compared with the original films, the dried films retained their ductility, although a decrease in the molecular weight of the chitosan was detected. The water resistance of the acid-exposed films was increased, even though the crystallinity of these films was lower. The third study was devoted to chitosan/wheat gluten blend films cast from aqueous solutions. Different solvent types, additives and drying methods were used to examine their effects on the microstructures of the blended films. Chitosan and wheat gluten were immiscible in the aqueous blend, and the wheat gluten formed a discrete phase, and the homogeneity of the films was improved by using a reducing agent, compared with films prepared using only water/ethanol as cast media. Adding urea and surfactants resulted in a medium homogeneity of the films compared to those prepared with the reducing agents or with only water/ethanol. An elongated wheat gluten phase was observed in a film using glyoxal, in contrast to pure chitosan/wheat gluten blends. The opacity of the different films was studied. The mechanical properties and humidity uptake of the films increased with increasing chitosan content. The films containing 30 wt. % of wheat gluten showed the most promising mechanical properties, close to those of the pristine chitosan films. The final part describes the preparation and properties of a bio-foam composed of a blend of chitosan and wheat gluten. This foam was prepared without any porogen or frozen liquid phase to create porosity. A unique phase distribution of the chitosan and wheat gluten solutions formed without any agitation, and the foam was obtained when the liquid phase were withdrawn under vacuum. These foams showed high mass uptake of n-hexane and water in a short time due to their open pores and high porosity. The maximum uptake of n-hexane measured was 20 times the initial mass of the foam. The foams showed a high <b>rebound</b> <b>resilience</b> (94 % at 20 % compression strain) and they were not broken when subjected to bending.    QC 20150825 </p...|$|E
