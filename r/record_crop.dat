Then one morning Prescott sat somewhat moodily in the saddle of his binder which a powerful team hauled {{along the edge of}} the wheat. The great stretch of grain blazed with color as it swayed with a harsh rustle of warm-tinted ears before the breeze, but now and then broad cool shadows sped across it as the white-edged clouds drove by. Behind him followed two more teams and machines, half covered by falling sheets of yellow grain, while their whirling wooden arms flashed in the dazzling sunlight as they flung out the sheaves. Bare-armed and very scantily attired men came after them, piling the stocks together. Disturbed as he was, Prescott felt cheered by the prospect of harvesting a <b>record</b> <b>crop.</b>|$|E

Pastoralists farmed over 21 million sheep, only 15% of which were used for local meat consumption. Wool production remained a major industry in 1914, boosted by sales to European countries preparing for the possibility of war. Wheat production was down however, and the state was not self-sufficient in cereals. Of most concern to food production was the lack of agricultural labourers in Queensland.|$|E

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2005, Washington field enumerators successfully showed that handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers could be utilized for the Agricultural Resource Management Survey Phase II and for the June Area Survey. Next, the Washington Field Office and the Research and Development Division investigated if GPS receivers could assist field enumerators with the Wheat Objective Yield Survey. Currently, Wheat Objective Yield Survey field enumerators go to specified areas of the sampled wheat fields, lay out two objective yield units and <b>record</b> various <b>crop</b> counts. Every month until the fields are harvested, the enumerator returns to the same units and <b>records</b> <b>crop</b> counts. Sometimes a field enumerator has difficulty finding the same location again or a different field enumerator may need to enumerate the field and is unable to find the same location. This costs NASS in field enumeration time, and in those instances where the units were unable to be found, the data quality suffers...|$|R

50|$|After {{a record}} grain harvest of 466 {{million metric tons}} in 1995, another <b>record</b> <b>crop</b> of 475 million metric tons was {{expected}} in 1996. This yield was anticipated despite torrential summer rains throughout China that flooded 32,500 square kilometres (8 million acres) of cropland, caused thousands of deaths, left millions homeless, and cost billions of yuan in damage. The Yellow River crested at its highest recorded level, inspiring fears of a catastrophic dike breach. Nevertheless, over the past 50 years, natural disasters on average had reduced China's harvests by approximately 1% annually. Work proceeded on the world's largest flood-control and hydroelectric project, the controversial Three Gorges Dam on the Chang Jiang (Yangtze River) above Yichang. Chinese planners were considering huge water-diversification projects to channel excess water from the Chang Jiang to arid northern regions.|$|E

5000|$|Heavily indebted {{and with}} {{conditions}} worsening, Scullin and Theodore took many novel steps {{in an attempt}} to turn the economy around. Appeals were made, both to the Australian public and on overseas markets, to bolster confidence and boost government bond subscriptions. A [...] "Grow More Wheat" [...] campaign was launched in 1930 to encourage farmers to plant a <b>record</b> <b>crop</b> and attempt to improve Australia's serious trade deficit, although ultimately Scullin was unsuccessful in convincing the Senate or the Commonwealth Bank to support this program through price guarantees. At the same time unemployment had hit a record high of 14.6 in the March quarter of 1930. Scullin's election promise of unemployment insurance was discussed in this period, but with dire predictions for government finance the promise was continually stalled. Scullin made major proposals to change the constitutional amendment process; expand Commonwealth powers over commerce, trade and industry; and to break apart the Commonwealth Bank to separate out its reserve bank and trading bank functions. The Senate blocked them all, or made amendments which rendered them unrecognisable. A double dissolution was threatened, though for various reasons both practical and political, Scullin never took this step. In June 1930 the government suffered a heavy loss when Theodore was forced to resign after he was criticised by a Royal Commission enquiring into a scandal known as the Mungana affair, claims of corrupt deals dating back to Theodore's time as Premier of Queensland. Scullin took over the Treasury portfolio in the interim while Theodore went to Queensland to face charges, and was compelled to bring down the 1930 budget personally.|$|E
