25|$|In 1854, {{during the}} Crimean War, Armstrong {{read about the}} {{difficulties}} the British Army experienced in manoeuvring its heavy field guns. He decided to design a lighter, more mobile field gun, with greater range and accuracy. He built a breech-loading gun with a strong, <b>rifled</b> <b>barrel</b> made from wrought iron wrapped around a steel inner lining, designed to fire a shell rather than a ball. In 1855 he had a five-pounder ready for inspection by a government committee. The gun proved successful in trials, but the committee thought a higher calibre gun was needed, so Armstrong built an 18-pounder on the same design.|$|E
25|$|A {{recoilless}} rifle (RCLR) or recoilless gun is a lightweight weapon that fires a heavier projectile {{that would be}} impractical to fire from a recoiling weapon of comparable size. Technically, only devices that use a <b>rifled</b> <b>barrel</b> are {{recoilless rifle}}s. Smoothbore variants are recoilless guns. This distinction is often lost, and both are often called recoilless rifles. The key difference from rocket launchers (whether man-portable or not) is that the projectile of the recoilless rifle has no propulsion of its own - once out of the rifle, it does not accelerate further, like a missile or rocket would. Normally used for anti-tank roles, the first effective system of this kind was developed during World War II by William Kroeger and Clarence Musser.|$|E
50|$|Rarer {{were the}} {{drillings}} that used two <b>rifle</b> <b>barrels</b> {{and a single}} shotgun barrel. These were harder to make, since, like a double <b>rifle,</b> the <b>rifle</b> <b>barrels</b> must be very carefully regulated, that is, aligned during manufacture to shoot to the same point of aim at a given distance. This requires more precision than regulation of double-barreled shotgun barrels, which are used at shorter ranges with wide patterns of shot where a small misalignment won't be significant. If the <b>rifle</b> <b>barrels</b> were the same caliber, then the three barrels were generally arranged in a triangle, both <b>rifle</b> <b>barrels</b> on top, or one rifle and the shotgun barrel on top (this being known as a cross-eyed drilling). If the <b>rifle</b> <b>barrels</b> differed in caliber, generally the layout would be an over/under using the shotgun and a centerfire <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel,</b> with a rimfire <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> mounted between and to one side. These configuration, with shotgun/centerfire/rimfire barrels, are the most desirable configuration for modern collectors.|$|R
5000|$|Vierling are {{especially}} rare, they generally have two side-by-side 12 gauge barrels, a [...]22 Long <b>Rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> {{on top and}} a center-fire <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> below the shotgun barrels.|$|R
5000|$|Another, less {{commonly}} encountered type of break-action shotgun is {{the combination}} gun, which is an over and under design with one shotgun <b>barrel</b> and one <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> (more often <b>rifle</b> on top, but rifle on bottom was not uncommon). There is also a class of break action guns called drillings, which contain three barrels, usually two shotgun barrels of the same gauge and a <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel,</b> though the only common theme is {{that at least one}} barrel be a shotgun barrel. The most common arrangement was essentially a side-by-side shotgun with the <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> below and centered. Usually a drilling containing more than one <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> would have both <b>rifle</b> <b>barrels</b> in the same caliber, but examples do exist with different caliber barrels, usually a [...]22 long rifle and a centerfire cartridge. Although very rare, drillings with three and even four (a vierling) shotgun barrels were made.|$|R
2500|$|The heavy, cold hammer-forged barrel is screwed {{into the}} {{receiver}} and {{is equipped with a}} slotted [...] "bird cage" [...] type flash suppressor that is also used to launch rifle grenades (using standard, live ammunition) or attach a knife bayonet (the bayonet is supported by a lug located {{at the base of the}} gas block). The <b>rifled</b> <b>barrel</b> has 6 right-hand grooves and the Swiss Army specification 254mm (1:10 in) rifling twist rate is optimized for Swiss military GP 90 ammunition. An export-oriented barrel with a 178mm (1:7 in) twist rate is also available, designed to stabilize 5.56Ã—45mm NATO rounds with the heavier SS109 and tracer projectiles.|$|E
2500|$|The gun used metal {{stamping}} and pressing, spot welding and seam welding extensively in its construction, {{reducing the number}} of man-hours required to assemble a unit. Only the barrel, bolt and firing mechanism were precision machined. The receiver consisted of two sheet metal halves welded together to form a cylinder. At the front end was a knurled metal cap which was used to retain the removable barrel. The cold-swaged, <b>rifled</b> <b>barrel</b> had 4 right-hand grooves. [...] M3 and M3A1 submachine guns could be fitted with an optional, detachable flash hider, though none saw any service in World War II. [...] A later production flash hider designated Hider, Flash M9 was produced in time to see service during the Korean War. [...] It proved popular in combat, as frequent night engagements emphasized the need to reduce flash signatures on small arms. [...] In Korea, U.S. soldiers equipped with automatic weapons were taught to look above the flash of their weapon during night firing, a tactic that sometimes prevented the detection of crawling enemy infiltrators and sappers.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the advent}} of shaped projectiles, such as the First Strike, and the {{resulting}} development of magazine fed markers, a considerable increase in range, accuracy and MILSIM realism was gained. [...] Functionally speaking, magazine-fed markers are no {{different than any other}} paintball marker, with one exception. [...] Instead of paintballs being gravity fed from a bulky hopper, which sits above the marker, shaped projectiles (or paintballs) are fed from a spring-loaded magazine {{from the bottom of the}} marker. [...] The caliber of both the gravity fed and magazine fed markers are the same (.68 caliber) and the velocities are also generally the same. [...] The increased range and accuracy of the shaped projectile comes from the higher ballistic coefficient that the shaped projectile has, and the gyroscopic spin imparted onto the projectile from a <b>rifled</b> <b>barrel</b> and fins on the projectile itself. [...] Magazine fed markers and shaped projectiles have allowed marker designs to more closely approximate the styling and functionality of actual (real steel) firearms, which intern has given paintball a better avenue to compete with Airsoft in the MilSiM environment.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, {{after the}} Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co., modifying the pistol {{to accept the}} <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> and/or stock, or modifying the <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> or stock to fit the pistol is legal {{so long as you}} do not have the rifle stock {{attached}} {{at the same time as}} the pistol barrel. It is legal (as a pistol) to have the <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> attached with the pistol grip; there is no federal maximum pistol barrel length.|$|R
5000|$|Vierlings {{generally}} {{consist of}} two matching shotgun barrels, a [...]22 caliber rimfire <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> and a centerfire <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel.</b> Although, {{they can come}} in a variety of configurations.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of training with real-time auditory feedback in precision shooting. Top-level shooters (N= 9) were randomly assigned to the feedback or non-feedback group. Each group performed a pre-test, a 4 -week training intervention and a post-test. The feedback group was provided with augmented real-time auditory feedback based on postural and <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> stability during training sessions. Increases in performance were measured through changes in postural stability, <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> stability, shot outcome and shot group diameter. Real-time auditory feedback did not increase postural or <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> stability in the feedback group. No meaningful differences were found related to shot outcome or shot group diameter in air rifle testing. The feedback group was able to reduce shot group diameter during smallbore testing. In summary, the augmented real-time auditory feedback did not improve postural or <b>rifle</b> <b>barrel</b> stability. Future research should focus on examining the effects of auditory feedback on smallbore performance...|$|R
