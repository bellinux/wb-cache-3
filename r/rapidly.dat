5|$|Historically the {{population}} of Manchester began to increase <b>rapidly</b> during the Victorian era, peaking at 766,311 in 1931. From then {{the population}} began to decrease <b>rapidly,</b> due to slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Manchester City Council after the Second World War such as Hattersley and Langley.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dolores was {{regarded}} as the worst hurricane to strike Acapulco since 1938. Developing on June13, 1974, the system <b>rapidly</b> organized into a tropical storm the next day off the southern coast of Mexico. Over the following day, Dolores developed an eye-like feature and attained hurricane status. With peak winds of 80mph (130km/h), the storm made landfall near Acapulco. Once onshore, Dolores <b>rapidly</b> dissipated and was last noted on June17.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, <b>rapidly</b> decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and <b>rapidly</b> decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression was first observed 300mi (485km) southeast of Socorro Island on September29. The depression <b>rapidly</b> intensified, {{and was a}} Category1 hurricane only twelve hours after being first observed. Peaking as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane, Hurricane Six tied Hurricane Four as the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. After reaching its peak intensity, Hurricane Six <b>rapidly</b> weakened, and passed 70mi (125km) southeast of Socorro Island with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Further weakening occurred, and the storm had dissipated on September 30.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to <b>rapidly</b> growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a <b>rapidly</b> growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E

5|$|By June29, a trough, {{moving through}} the westerlies, <b>rapidly</b> {{approached}} the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90mi (95 and 140km) from the center. Convection became displaced {{from the center of}} circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to <b>rapidly</b> moving troughs to the north.|$|E

5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} (CSP) also started to grow <b>rapidly,</b> {{increasing}} its capacity nearly tenfold from 2004 to 2013, albeit from {{a lower level}} and involving fewer countries than solar PV. As {{of the end of}} 2013, worldwide cumulative CSP-capacity reached 3,425MW.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{under the}} socialist Second Republic, French {{instructors}} and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared {{the language of}} instruction and a large cadre of young Malagasy were <b>rapidly</b> trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, populations {{can expand}} <b>rapidly</b> {{after a series}} of mild winters. In lowland Britain, there was an {{increase}} of 48% following the 1970/71 winter, with many pairs spreading into deciduous woodlands where they would not normally breed.|$|E
5|$|Cortés {{arrived in}} Honduras in 1525, {{bringing}} livestock with him. Cortés claimed jurisdiction over Honduras, although its extent was still unknown. He <b>rapidly</b> imposed his {{authority over the}} rival Spanish factions there, {{as well as some}} native groups. He founded the settlement of Natividad de Nuestra Señora near Puerto de Caballos, settled fifty colonists there, and placed Diego de Godoy in charge. Cortés then sailed on to Trujillo. Conditions in Natividad were unhealthy, and half of the Spanish settlers <b>rapidly</b> succumbed to disease. With the permission of Cortés, the rest moved inland to the fertile Naco Valley, where Sandoval had securely established a Spanish presence.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Fanele was {{the first}} cyclone of {{tropical}} cyclone status to strike western Madagascar since Cyclone Fame one year prior. It formed on January18, 2009 in the Mozambique Channel, and <b>rapidly</b> organized as it remained nearly stationary. Fanele ultimately turned toward the southwest Madagascar coastline, reaching peak winds of 185km/h (115mph), according to the Réunion Météo-France office (MFR). It weakened before moving ashore in Menabe Region southwest of Morondava, and <b>rapidly</b> weakened over land. Fanele briefly re-intensified after reaching open waters, only to become an extratropical cyclone by January23.|$|E

5|$|During {{the great}} housing {{boom of the}} late 1930s, Giffnock began to grow <b>rapidly.</b> Between 1930 and 1940, as many as 3,000 {{dwellings}} were constructed, and the population rose dramatically, from 1,425 to 3,471 in 1939 and 9,144 in 1951.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{something}} unexpected happened: a roadblock {{on the road}} that had to be used by the brigade had to be dismantled. Zero hour was once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were <b>rapidly</b> discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt <b>rapidly</b> out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E

5|$|Felling, like nearby Deckham, is a <b>rapidly</b> {{growing area}} {{with more and}} more people from other {{countries}} settling in the area. In 2011, 7.7% of Felling's population were non White British compared with only 3.4% in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Following {{activation}} with antigen, B cells {{begin to}} proliferate <b>rapidly.</b> In these <b>rapidly</b> dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains {{of the heavy}} and light chains undergo {{a high rate of}} point mutation, by a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM results in approximately one nucleotide change per variable gene, per cell division. As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.|$|E
5|$|Gill Sans <b>rapidly</b> {{became very}} popular. Its success was aided by Monotype's {{sophisticated}} marketing, led by Gill's supporter (and sometime lover) Beatrice Warde, {{and due to}} its practicality and availability for machine composition in a very wide range of sizes and weights.|$|E
5|$|Historians Hitchcock and Downs {{emphasized}} the far-reaching {{effects of the}} ongoing depression, inflation, <b>rapidly</b> increasing commodity prices, and mass unemployment, {{as well as the}} failure of the strikers to appreciate that these conditions affected the employer as well as the employee.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alberto {{caused the}} worst {{flooding}} in western Cuba in 32years. The first tropical storm and hurricane of the 1982 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto developed from a tropical disturbance on June 2 {{in the southern}} Gulf of Mexico. It <b>rapidly</b> organized and attained hurricane status the following day, the earliest date for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970. Shortly after reaching peak winds off 85mph (140km/h), Alberto <b>rapidly</b> weakened due to approaching upper-level winds. Initial forecasts predicted the hurricane would continue northeastward into Florida; it turned sharply westward and drifted erratically for several days across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, before dissipating on June 6.|$|E
