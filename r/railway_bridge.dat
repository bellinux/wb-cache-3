50|$|London's {{abundance}} of river tunnels has {{resulted from a}} number of factors. For historical reasons, the city centre has relatively few <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> (or for that matter main-line railway stations). Only three <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> exist in central London, only one of which provides through services across the capital. Consequently, railway builders have had to tunnel under the river in the city centre rather than bridge it. By contrast, <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> are relatively common {{to the west of the}} inner city.|$|R

5|$|The first <b>railway</b> <b>bridge</b> to Montreal Island was the Grand Trunk <b>Railway</b> <b>bridge</b> {{across the}} Ottawa River East Channel. Along with another bridge built {{simultaneously}} across the West Channel, this bridge provided the first fixed link from Montreal to the mainland. It {{was not until}} 1925, however, that a fixed road link, formed by Galipeault Bridge and Taschereau Bridge, was built across the Ottawa River from Montreal Island. Perrot Island {{was the only way}} out of Montreal to the West before the construction of Île aux Tourtes Bridge, which goes directly to Vaudreuil across the Lake of Two Mountains.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{accurately}} determine {{the weight of}} <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> parts, for <b>railway</b> concrete girder <b>bridge</b> case, this thesis is based on analysing the construction features of the <b>railway</b> concrete girder <b>bridges</b> and destructive characteristic of seismic damage and proposes a detailed method, which adopts combination of the analytic hierarchy process and the fuzzy synthetical evaluation. The weight of <b>railway</b> concrete girder <b>bridges</b> can be confirmed, by utilizing its logical and pairwise comparison method, Studies show {{that this is an}} effective method to confirm the weight of <b>railway</b> concrete girder <b>bridges.</b> It is of great value to quickly evaluate earthquake loss of <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> in the earthquake stricken areas...|$|R
40|$|Performance of {{the railway}} {{transportation}} network {{depends on the}} reliability of <b>railway</b> <b>bridges,</b> which can be affected by various forms of deterioration and extreme environmental conditions. More {{than half of the}} <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> in US were built before 1950 and many show signs of distress. There is a need for efficient methods to evaluate the safety reserve in the <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> by identification of the most sensitive parts of the bridge. ^ An accurate estimation of remaining fatigue life of a structural component is very important in prioritizing bridge rehabilitation and replacement. However, existing procedures to evaluate the fatigue behavior of bridges are based on estimation rather than the exact formulas because the load and the resistance models contain many uncertainties. Therefore, probabilistic methods are the most convenient way to provide levels of safety for various design cases. ^ The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a reliability model for <b>railway</b> <b>bridges,</b> in particular for the fatigue and strength limit states. It will be demonstrated on two through-plate girder structures. The research involved nonlinear finite element method (FEM) analysis of typical <b>railway</b> <b>bridges,</b> development of statistical parameters of live load and resistance, and calculation of a reliability index for various considered conditions. The findings of this research with final conclusions will serve as a basis for the development of more rational provisions for the design and evaluation of <b>railway</b> <b>bridges.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{successful}} completion of the Forth <b>Railway</b> <b>Bridge</b> in 1890, Fowler was created a baronet, taking {{the name of his}} Scottish estate as his territorial designation.

40|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>Bridges</b> {{deteriorate}} {{over time}} due to different critical factors including, flood, wind, earthquake, collision, and environment factors, such as corrosion, wear, termite attack, etc. In current practice, {{the contributions of}} the critical factors, towards the deterioration of <b>railway</b> <b>bridges,</b> which show their criticalities, are not appropriately taken into account. In this paper, a new method for quantifying the criticality of these factors will be introduced. The available knowledge as well as risk analyses conducted in different Australian standards and developed for bridge-design will be adopted. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is utilized for prioritising the factors. The method is used for synthetic rating of <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> developed by the authors of this paper. Enhancing the reliability of predicting the vulnerability of <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> to the critical factors, will be the significant achievement of this research...|$|R

5|$|Just before Godnow Swing Bridge, the {{northern}} soak drain {{crosses to the}} north side of the railway. As the canal approaches Ealand there are some large lakes to the north, which are now used for sailing. Crowle Bridge carries the A161 road over the railway and the canal, and Crowle railway station is sandwiched between the canal and the North Soak Drain. A little further east are the remains of Crowle <b>railway</b> <b>bridge.</b> It carried the Axholme Joint Railway over the canal, and consisted of four arches built from bricks, with a central swinging section, to allow keels to sail along the canal. The bridge was retained after the railway was closed in 1966, because stators from Keadby Power Station were too heavy to be transported over the A161 road bridge. The stators were carried by road to Ealand, loaded onto the railway, and crossed the bridge to Belton, where they were transferred back to a road vehicle. The process became unnecessary when Lindsey County Council rebuilt the A161 bridge in 1970, and the <b>railway</b> <b>bridge</b> was demolished in 1972.|$|E

30|$|The {{minimum depth}} of cover {{criterion}} was fundamentally developed to avoid problems associated with soil failure above the crown of a soil-steel bridge (Mohammed et al. 2002). Although this criterion may be sufficient for the serviceability of highway bridges, some revisions may be essential for <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> (due to heavier axle loads and relevant dynamic effects), especially for long-span conditions (Peck and Peck 1984). On the other hand, the serviceability and the riding comfort criteria for <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> have remarkable importance compared with highway bridges. From the structural design aspect of long-span <b>railway</b> <b>bridges,</b> the critical sections must be stiffened either by stiffening metal sheets or by utilizing sandwich panels as concrete-filled metal sections. The serviceability criteria of the soil-steel <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> with spans larger than 8 m that use stiffened panels have not been previously examined and are the main subject of this paper. Therefore, for this study, the CHBDC (2006) equations for minimum cover depth were modified to define the minimum required cover depth for <b>railway</b> <b>bridges</b> based on the two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) FE analysis results using the well-known PLAXIS codes for the aforementioned cases.|$|R
