5|$|President Fernando de la Rúa {{resigned}} {{after the}} December 2001 riots {{that had been}} caused by the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression. As his vice president Carlos Álvarez had resigned as well months before, Congress called for a special assembly to designate a new president. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá became president after being elected with 169 votes to 138. He {{was supported by the}} PJ and smaller right-wing parties such as <b>Republican</b> <b>Force</b> and Action for the Republic. The Unión Cívica Radical (UCR) and Alternative for a Republic of Equals voted against him. He was replaced in the governor's office by vice-governor María Alicia Lemme, and took office on December 23, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Rising electoral {{success was}} {{accompanied}} by factional in-fighting, with a leadership contest emerging in the ASP between the incumbent Alejo Véliz and Morales, who had the electoral backing of the social movement's bases. The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (Instrumento Político por la Soberanía de los Pueblos – IPSP). The movement's bases defected en masse to the IPSP, leaving the ASP to crumble and Véliz to join the centre-right New <b>Republican</b> <b>Force</b> (Nueva Fuerza Republicana – NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the cocalero cause. Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another cocalero march from El Chapare to la Paz, and came under increasing criticism from the government, who repeatedly {{accused him of being}} involved in the cocaine trade and mocked him for how he spoke and his lack of education.|$|E

25|$|A rebel force under Colonel Alfonso Beorlegui Canet, sent by General Mola and Colonel Esteban García, {{undertook}} the Campaign of Gipuzkoa from July to September. The {{capture of}} Gipuzkoa isolated the Republican provinces in the north. On 5 September, the Nationalists closed the French border to the Republicans {{in the battle}} of Irún. On 15 September San Sebastián, home to a divided <b>Republican</b> <b>force</b> of anarchists and Basque nationalists, was taken by Nationalist soldiers.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} motley force {{gathered at}} Saumur {{together with their}} own representatives on mission. Santerre's Paris battalions were in a perpetual state of disorder, while recently promoted officers strolled the streets with prostitutes. On 7 June 1793 the Vendeans defeated Leigonyer at Doué-la-Fontaine and chased the Blues right into Saumur. Deeming the Republican position too strong, the White army temporarily pulled back while their leaders planned an attack. Hearing that Salomon was marching north from Thouars, a column of Vendeans fell on his division at Montreuil-Bellay and wiped out half the <b>Republican</b> <b>force,</b> sending the survivors fleeing south to Niort. On 11 June the Whites defeated the Blues in the Battle of Saumur. The Vendeans numbered about 20,000 with 100 cannon while the Republicans counted 16,000 soldiers plus some reinforcements. Guy Coustard de Saint-Lo directed the right flank, Santerre the center and Berthier the left, while Jacques-François Menou commanded troops in the town. Recently appointed the army chief of staff, Berthier repulsed the first assault, but Coustard was threatened by his own men and Santerre's troops threw down their muskets and ran away. Menou and Berthier, who were both wounded, tried to lead a cavalry charge, but the horsemen joined the rout. The Blues lost 8,000 men and 46 artillery pieces. After reorganizing the beaten division at Tours, Berthier soon reoccupied Saumur.|$|E

50|$|After Tang's flight, the <b>republican</b> <b>forces</b> {{continued}} {{to resist the}} Japanese in Taiwan {{under the leadership of}} Liu Yung-fu. The <b>republican</b> <b>forces</b> were no match for the Japanese, however, and the republic eventually collapsed with the Japanese occupation of Tainan on 21 October 1895. Like Tang, Liu Yung-fu also abandoned his soldiers and fled to the mainland to escape capture.|$|R

2500|$|The Republic {{was quick}} to respond, {{dispatching}} over 45,000 troops to the area. The first pitched battle was {{on the night of}} 19 March. A Republican column of 2,000, under [...] general , moving from La Rochelle to Nantes, was intercepted north of Chantonnay near the Gravereau bridge (Saint-Vincent-Sterlanges), over the river le Petit-Lay. After six hours of fighting, rebel reinforcements arrived and routed the Republican forces. In the north, on 22 March, another <b>Republican</b> <b>force</b> was routed near Chalonnes-sur-Loire.|$|E
60|$|On the seventeenth, {{their whole}} force being now {{concentrated}} there, {{they were about}} to move forward towards Beaupreau; when the advanced guard was hotly attacked and, in a short time, the combat became general. For a time the Vendeans bore down all opposition, but as the whole of the <b>Republican</b> <b>force</b> came into action, their advance was arrested.|$|E
60|$|When {{the column}} left Angers {{it had been}} {{intended}} to march to Saumur and cross there, but the news arrived that a strong <b>Republican</b> <b>force</b> had gathered there; and it was determined to change the course, and to march through La Fleche to Le Mans. By this sudden and unexpected movement, Rochejaquelein hoped to gain time to give his followers two days' rest.|$|E

60|$|The Vendeans had {{marched through}} Cande and Chateau-Gontier, and had without {{difficulty}} driven out the <b>Republican</b> <b>force</b> stationed at Laval. L'Echelle, the commander-in-chief, was profoundly ignorant, supine, and cowardly; and owed his position {{solely to the}} fact that he belonged to the lower class, and was not, like Biron and the other commanders-in-chief, of good family. Remaining always at a distance from the scene of operations, he confused the generals of divisions by contradictory orders, which vied with each other in their folly.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding the {{difficulties}} of the place, {{it was decided that}} Larochejaquelin should take two hundred of his men and endeavour to make his way through the water, and while he was doing this, de Lescure was to force his passage over the bridge at Fouchard, and if possible, carry the gate of the town; in doing this he would pass under the heights of Bournan, and to this point M. d'Elbée was to accompany him with the great bulk of the army, so as to secure his flank from any attack from the <b>republican</b> <b>force,</b> which still retained their position there, and which had hitherto kept up an intercourse with the town across the bridge of Fouchard.|$|E
