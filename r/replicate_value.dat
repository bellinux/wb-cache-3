40|$|The {{strategy}} of accumulating valuable assets {{guided by the}} firm’s intellectual right is often not enough to support a significant performance in a rapidly changing environment. Hence, in such an environment, superior performance relies upon {{the ability of a}} firm to integrate, build and reconfigure those resources, the process of which is termed as dynamic capabilities. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate the mediating role of dynamic capabilities on the relationship between intellectual capital and manufacturing firm performance in a turbulent business setting. The data was gathered from 124 manufacturing enterprises in Nigeria and analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The analyzed data supported all the hypothesized relationships of the study. Hence, the study found that there is positive relationships between all the dimensions of intellectual capital and dynamic capabilities and also dynamic capabilities mediate the relationship between intellectual capital and performance. Consequently, this study concluded that managers need to deploy not only valuable resources but also dynamic capabilities by re configuring their existing resources to conceive of and implement difficult to <b>replicate</b> <b>value</b> adding strategies. Finally, the study outlined some limitations that opened the avenues for future research...|$|E

40|$|Natural graphs, such {{as social}} networks, email graphs, or instant {{messaging}} patterns, have become pervasive through the internet. These graphs are massive, often containing {{hundreds of millions of}} nodes and billions of edges. While some theoretical models have been proposed to study such graphs, their analysis is still difficult due to the scale and nature of the data. We propose a framework for large-scale graph decomposition and inference. To resolve the scale, our framework is distributed so that the data are partitioned over a sharednothing set of machines. We propose a novel factorization technique that relies on partitioning a graph so as to minimize the number of neighboring vertices rather than edges across partitions. Our decomposition is based on a streaming algorithm. It is network-aware as it adapts to the network topology of the underlying computational hardware. We use local copies of the variables and an efficient asynchronous communication protocol to synchronize the <b>replicated</b> <b>values</b> in order to perform most of the computation without having to incur the cost of network communication. On a graph of 200 million vertices and 10 billion edges, derived from an email communication network, our algorithm retains convergence properties while allowing for almost linear scalability in the number of computers...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{questions}} that we address in this paper are the following. In {{the context of the}} particular DSGE model with labour market frictions, do animal spirits expectations and rational expectations yield qualitatively and quantitatively different outcomes in the face of supply and demand shocks? Does the optimal monetary policy response differ for the two types of expectation? Does there exist a simple rule such as the Taylor rule that can replicate the outcomes for all variables obtained when monetary policy is set optimally? How do these <b>replicating</b> <b>values</b> depend on the degree of the labour market and expectations imperfections? Under what circumstances should the central bank be targeting inflation and/or economic activity? Should it smooth its interest rate responses? Findings: We find qualitatively different outcomes for an 'animal spirits' expectations heuristic to rational expectations after supply and demand shocks. Provided monetary policy is optimally set, major differences arise only for supply shocks. A Taylor rule can replicate optimal monetary policy outcomes regardless of the degree of imperfections under demand shocks, however this is not true under supply shocks. We argue that the persistence of the interest rate typically found in practice is optimal in the presence of supply shocks, since demand shocks can be perfectly accomodated by changing the interest rate immediately. 2 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The IB {{literature}} {{informs us}} of {{several ways to}} measure firms’ degree of internationalization. In this paper we make the argument that in fact none of the existing indices really measure firms’ degree of "global specialization", that is, to what extent their allocation of resources is multidomestic or global. As argued, all the existing measures may gauge a purely multidomestic firm as having a high degree of internationalization, whereas a truly global firm may be ranked low. In order to remedy this we introduce a complementary index measuring how firms are configuring their value chains – whether they are <b>replicating</b> <b>value</b> chain activities from country to country or locating them in globally specialized units in order to exploit an international division of labor. In addition to mathematical modeling and numerical examples, we examine the relevance of the new index of global specialization on data of Danish MNCs by looking at the correlation between the new global specialization index and existing indices of firms’ degree of internationalization. We find that the index is able to identify a distinct group of firms with significantly higher degrees of global value chain configuration. Key words: Internationalization, value chain, global configuration. JEL Codes: F 02, F 23, L 22, L 2...|$|R

40|$|Understanding and {{quantifying}} the large, unexplained {{variability in}} soil erosion data {{are critical for}} advancing erosion science, evaluating soil erosion models, and designing erosion experiments, We hypothesized {{that it is possible}} to quantify variability between replicated soil erosion field plots under natural rainfall, and thus determine the principal factor or factors which correlate to the magnitude of the variability: Data from replicated plot pairs for 2061 storms, 797 annual erosion measurements, and 53 multi-year erosion totals were used. Thirteen different soil types and site locations were represented in the data. The relative differences between replicated plot pair data tended to be lesser for greater magnitudes of measured soil loss, thus indicating that soil loss magnitude was a principal factor for explaining variance in the soil loss data. Using this assumption, we estimated the coefficient of variation of within-treatment, plot <b>replicate</b> <b>values</b> of measured soil lass. Variances between replicates decreased as a power function (r(2) = 0. 78) of measured soil loss, and were independent of whether the measurements were event-, annual-, or multi-year values. Coefficients of variation ranged on the order of 14 % for a measured soil loss of 20 kg/m(2) to greater than 150 % for a measured soil loss of less than 0. 01 kg/m(2) These results have important implications for both experimental design and for using erosion data to evaluate prediction capability for erosion models. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth rates}} and {{buoyancy}} properties of 3 oceanic diatoms in the genus Rhizosolenia were examined at light levels from 8 to 211 umol quanta m- 2  s- 1. Maximum growth rates ranged from 0. 37 to 0. 78 divisions d- 1  with saturation occurring between 29 and 164 umol quanta m- 2  s- 1. Severe growth rate depressions were noted in R. acuminata and R. formosa at irradiance levels above 50 to 155 umol quanta m- 2  s- 1. In all 3 species {{the percentage of}} positively buoyant cells was inversely related to light intensity. In R. formosa both growth rate and tolerance to high light levels decreased substantially as cell size decreased. Batch culture C:chlorophyll ratios (130 to 261) <b>replicated</b> <b>values</b> found in fieldEthmodiscus and Rhizosolenia mats, and suggest that the elevated C:chlorophyll ratios found in buoyant, oceanic phytoplankton are typical of healthy cells. Calculations suggest that carbohydrate ballasting can account for buoyancy changes and that these reserves are adequate to support dark NO 3 - uptake. Under steady-state conditions in situ, the observed growth and buoyancy properties would lead to subsurface population maxima in all 3 species. However, the dynamic light-related buoyancy changes probably occur on a shorter time scale than these batch culture experiments. These results indicate that vertical migration is a property basic to these diatoms life history strategy, and, like multispecies Rhizosolenia mats, solitary Rhizosolenia chains transport new nitrogen to the euphotic zone in oligotrophic seas...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that due to}} memory failures retrospective survey questions tend {{to be prone to}} measurement error. However, the proportion of studies using such data that attempt to adjust for the measurement problem is shockingly low. Arguably, to a great extent this is due to both the complexity of the methods available and the need to access a subsample containing either a gold standard or <b>replicated</b> <b>values.</b> Here I suggest the implementation of a version of SIMEX capable of adjusting for the types of multiplicative measurement errors associated with memory failures in the retrospective report of durations of life-course events. SIMEX is a method relatively simple to implement and it does not require the use of replicated or validation data so long as the error process can be adequately specified. To assess the effectiveness of the method I use simulated data. I create twelve scenarios based on the combinations of three outcome models (linear, logit and Poisson) and four types of multiplicative errors (non-systematic, systematic negative, systematic positive and heteroscedastic) affecting one of the explanatory variables. I show that SIMEX can be satisfactorily implemented in each of these scenarios. Furthermore, the method can also achieve partial adjustments even in scenarios where the actual distribution and prevalence of the measurement error differs substantially from what is assumed in the adjustment, which makes it an interesting sensitivity tool in those cases where all that is known about the error process is reduced to an educated guess...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to validate Calu- 3 cell line as a model for screening respiratory irritation and toxicity of drugs and excipients. Eighteen test compounds were selected according to their irritation potential and European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) guidelines. Cell toxicity and irritation was determined using MTT assay. Data analysis and interpretation were done using modified ECVAM approach; where <b>replicate</b> <b>values</b> met acceptance criteria if percent relative standard deviation (RSD) of the raw data is < 18 %. Compounds with mean relative viability values of 50 % and below were classified as irritant (I); those above 50 % were non-irritant (NI). At low concentration (0. 2 % w/v) and 1 h incubation, the Calu- 3 cell culture model accurately predicted the toxicity of most test compounds. The specificity of our proposed model (percentage of in vivo non-irritants correctly predicted), concordance (percentage of compounds correctly predicted) and sensitivity (percentage of in vivo irritants correctly predicted) at 0. 2 % w/v and 60 min exposure were 100 %, 72 %, and 44 %, respectively. In conclusion, the Calu- 3 cell line in conjunction with MTT assay appears to be a potentially useful tool for screening drugs and excipients for respiratory mucosa irritation and toxicity. However, as the data reported in this study were solely based on MTT assay, additional studies are needed using other toxicity-/irritation-indicating methods to confirm the observed trend...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Post-genomic {{molecular}} biology {{has resulted in}} an explosion of data, providing measurements for large numbers of genes, proteins and metabolites. Time series experiments have become increasingly common, necessitating the development of novel analysis tools that capture the resulting data structure. Outlier measurements at one or more time points present a significant challenge, while potentially valuable replicate information is often ignored by existing techniques. Results We present a generative model-based Bayesian hierarchical clustering algorithm for microarray time series that employs Gaussian process regression to capture {{the structure of the}} data. By using a mixture model likelihood, our method permits a small proportion of the data to be modelled as outlier measurements, and adopts an empirical Bayes approach which uses replicate observations to inform a prior distribution of the noise variance. The method automatically learns the optimum number of clusters and can incorporate non-uniformly sampled time points. Using a wide variety of experimental data sets, we show that our algorithm consistently yields higher quality and more biologically meaningful clusters than current state-of-the-art methodologies. We highlight the importance of modelling outlier values by demonstrating that noisy genes can be grouped with other genes of similar biological function. We demonstrate the importance of including replicate information, which we find enables the discrimination of additional distinct expression profiles. Conclusions By incorporating outlier measurements and <b>replicate</b> <b>values,</b> this clustering algorithm for time series microarray data provides a step towards a better treatment of the noise inherent in measurements from high-throughput genomic technologies.

40|$|The Three Rivers area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania {{has more}} {{combined}} sewer overflow (CSO) release points than any other city in the United States. CSOs and sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) release untreated waste directly into receiving water during wet weather events such as rain or snow. A wide range of estrogenic agents is contained in municipal wastewater, including pharmaceutical estrogens, plastic additives, pesticides and detergent breakdown products such as nonyl-phenol. The goal of this analysis was to examine estrogenicity of channel catfish fillet tissue in areas significantly impaired by CSO/SSOs compared to store-bought catfish and catfish from up-river areas on the Allegheny River that are less impacted. Estrogenicity {{was based on the}} ability of catfish fillet tissue to proliferate MCF 7 human breast cancer cells.
