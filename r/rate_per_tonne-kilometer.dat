25|$|With limited {{industrial}} capacity in Tibet, the Tibetan economy heavily relies on industrial products from more developed parts of China. Transport of goods {{in and out}} of Tibet was mostly through the Qingzang Highway connecting Tibet to the adjacent Qinghai province, which was built in the early 1950s. The length and terrain have limited the capacity of the highway, with less than 1 million tons of goods transported each year. With the construction of the Qingzang railway, the cost of transportation of both passengers and goods should be greatly reduced, allowing for an increase in volume—the cost <b>per</b> <b>tonne-kilometer</b> will be reduced from 0.38 RMB to 0.12 RMB. It is projected that by 2010, 2.8 million tons will be carried to and from Tibet, with over 75% carried by the railway. This is expected to help support the Tibetan economy.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modeling and computational study on particle erosion in curved ducts. It is {{found that the}} average erosion <b>rates</b> <b>per</b> impact range from 4. 2 x 10 ⁻⁷ to 9. 5 x 10 ⁻³ mm³/g under current conditions. For each doubled inlet velocity, the increases of erosion <b>rates</b> <b>per</b> impact are 2 – 14 times. The erosion <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> impact varies with particle diameter with “√” shape through bends, {{which is similar to}} the particle deposition behavior in duct flows. The erosion <b>rate</b> curves <b>per</b> injected particle show the shapes of a 90 -degree anticlockwise rotated “S” and a wide open “V,” respectively, for three larger and smaller inlet velocities. The average erosion <b>rates</b> <b>per</b> injected particle are 1. 4 – 18. 9 times those <b>rates</b> <b>per</b> impact due to huge amounts of impacting, especially for those depositing particles. It is obvious that the erosion <b>rate</b> distribution <b>per</b> impact is similar to a “fingerprint” with five clear stripes and a lower “cloud” along the bend deflection angle for the three largest particles; yet, for other smaller particles, the erosion rate distributions are much like an entire “cloud. ”Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Since 2005, {{road safety}} in the U. S. has {{improved}} substantially. Of interest {{in this study was}} road {{safety in the}} individual U. S. states and the District of Columbia, both in terms of the current status and recent changes. The analysis included the use of two primary measures: fatality <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> distance driven, and fatality <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> population. The data for two years were analyzed: 2012 (the latest available year) and 2005. The results indicate that the fatality <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> distance driven varies greatly. In 2012, the lowest fatality <b>rates</b> <b>per</b> 1 billion miles were in the District of Columbia (4. 20), Massachusetts (6. 24), and Minnesota (6. 93). The highest rates were in West Virginia (17. 63), South Carolina (17. 60), and Montana (17. 25). Similarly, the percentage change in this rate between 2005 and 2012 exhibited a wide range. On one extreme were the District of Columbia (- 67. 5 %), Nevada (- 48. 0 %), and Idaho (- 39. 0 %). On the other extreme were Vermont (+ 12. 7 %), North Dakota (+ 3. 8 %), and Maine (+ 2. 0 %). The variability of the fatality <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> population is even greater than that of the fatality <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> distance driven. In 2012, the lowest fatality <b>rates</b> <b>per</b> 100 thousand people were in the District of Columbia (2. 37), Massachusetts (5. 25), and New York (5. 97). The highest rates were in North Dakota (24. 30), Wyoming (21. 34), and Montana (20. 40). As was the case for the fatality <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> distance driven, the percentage change between 2005 and 2012 in the fatality <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> population exhibited a wide range. On one extreme were the District of Columbia (- 72. 8 %), Nevada (- 47. 1 %), and Idaho (- 40. 1 %).

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the atomization process of a liquid jet across a high-speed airstream, the spray shape, the mass flow <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> unit {{area and the}} Sauter mean diameter were measured.

30|$|Hosta ventricosa racemes in {{the open}} patch {{produced}} larger floral displays than racemes in the forested patch, a common result reflecting differences in overall plant resource status between patches (Kato and Hiura 1999; Meagher and Delph 2001). In population BYS, both light availability and floral display had positive effects on pollinator visitation <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> flower; in population SNC, however, only light availability had positive effects on pollinator visitation <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> flower. Therefore, indirect effects on visitation rate through display size in population BYS must be interpreted with some caution. For example, Kilkenny and Galloway (2008) reported that both light environment and floral display had positive effects on pollinator visitation <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> flower in Campanulastrum americanum plants growing in sunny and shady areas of a natural population, but visitation <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> flower responded positively to light levels and {{did not respond to}} display size in experimental arrays. Similar experimental arrays with different display sizes and light levels may verify whether floral display had an effect on visitation <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> flower in H. ventricosa.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} fact that {{physiological}} root activity of rice, i. e., α－naphthylamine oxidation, {{is related to the}} dry weight of rice plant. It indicates that the growth of rice plant might be controlled by the physiological root activity of rice. Bleeding rate is one of the indexes of physiological root activity. However, there is little information about relationship between bleeding rate and dry matter increasing rate of rice plant. The objective {{of this study is to}} clarify the relationship between bleeding <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> panicle or per top dry weight and top dry matter increasing <b>rate.</b> Bleeding <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> panicle or per top dry weight did not relate to CGR, NAR, and RGR. There was no relationship between bleeding <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> panicle and panicle dry matter increasing rate. But, bleeding <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> top dry weight related to panicle dry matter increasing rate at ５% level. This fact suggests that cultivation management to get high yield of rice might be supported by bleeding <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> top dry weight. 　キーワード：水稲，出液速度，稲乾物加速度　Key Words : rice, bleeding rate, panicle dry matter increasing rat...|$|R
