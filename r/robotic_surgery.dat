25|$|On October 15, 2013, Dr. Tewari {{was named}} the Chairman of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Previously he served as Director of the Lefrak Institute of <b>Robotic</b> <b>Surgery,</b> Director of Prostate cancer, {{as well as the}} Director of Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer-Urologic Oncology Outcomes at the Brady Urology Foundation of Weill Medical College. He is a tenured Professor of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. In addition, Tewari directs a {{fellowship}} program in Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer Outcomes that has conducted research comparing <b>robotic</b> <b>surgery</b> outcomes versus those of laparoscopic and open surgeries. Tewari is an Attending physician at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{circumstances}} when anesthesia {{needs to be}} altered for special circumstances due to the procedure (such as in cardiac surgery, cardiothoracic anesthesiology or neurosurgery), the patient (such as in pediatric anesthesia, geriatric, bariatric or obstetrical anesthesia) or special circumstances (such as in trauma, prehospital care, <b>robotic</b> <b>surgery</b> or extreme environments).|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the da Vinci Surgical System, the advent of <b>robotic</b> <b>surgery</b> using a laparoscopic approach has significantly changed the way prostate cancer surgery and prostatectomy procedures in general are performed as compared to the traditional 'open' methodology. Much of Tewari's research projects serve to promote <b>robotic</b> <b>surgery</b> as opposed to open procedures. For example, Tewari has shown that the operating field has become more visible to the surgeon, unobscured by the copious amounts of blood encountered in traditional surgery and is thus able to view the urological structures under three-dimensional, enlarged magnification. Patients reap even greater benefits. Due to the minimally invasive nature of the procedure, they experience minimized pain, minimized blood loss, less scarring and fewer complications. Post-surgery recovery is accelerated and patients experience quicker return to urinary continence and sexual function. Some of Tewari's current research is focused on comparing the benefits of robot-assisted surgery with traditional open prostatic surgery.|$|E

40|$|<b>Robotic</b> {{colorectal}} <b>surgery</b> {{has gradually}} been performed {{more with the}} help of the technological advantages of the da Vinci system. Advanced technological advantages of the da Vinci system compared with standard laparoscopic colorectal surgery have been reported. These are a stable camera platform, three-dimensional imaging, excellent ergonomics, tremor elimination, ambidextrous capability, motion scaling, and instruments with multiple degrees of freedom. However, despite these technological advantages, most studies did not report the clinical advantages of <b>robotic</b> colorectal <b>surgery</b> compared to standard laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Only one study recently implies the real benefits of <b>robotic</b> rectal cancer <b>surgery.</b> The purpose of this review article is to outline the early concerns of <b>robotic</b> colorectal <b>surgery</b> using the da Vinci system, to present early clinical outcomes from the most current series, and to discuss not only the safety and the feasibility but also the real benefits of <b>robotic</b> colorectal <b>surgery.</b> Moreover, this article will comment on the possible future clinical advantages and limitations of the da Vinci system in <b>robotic</b> colorectal <b>surgery...</b>|$|R
25|$|By {{equipment}} used: Laser surgery involves {{use of a}} laser {{for cutting}} tissue instead of a scalpel or similar surgical instruments.

40|$|<b>Robotic</b> cardiac <b>surgery</b> {{utilizes}} {{the most}} advanced surgical technology to offer patients a minimally invasive alternative to open surgery {{in the treatment of}} a broad range of cardiac pathologies. Although robotics may offer substantial benefits to physicians, patients and healthcare institutions, there are important barriers to its adoption that includes inadequate funding, competition from alternate therapies and challenges in training. There is a growing body of evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of <b>robotic</b> cardiac <b>surgery.</b> Technological innovations are improving patient safety and expanding the indications for <b>robotic</b> cardiac <b>surgery</b> beyond the treatment of mitral valve and coronary artery disease. <b>Robotic</b> cardiac <b>surgery</b> is rapidly becoming a feasible, safe and effective option for the definitive treatment of cardiac disease in the context of 21 st century challenges to healthcare provision such as diabetes, obesity and an aging population...|$|R
25|$|Until recently, people labeled as obese {{were not}} {{considered}} appropriate candidates for renal transplantation. In 2009, the physicians at the University of Illinois Medical Center performed the first robotic kidney transplantation in an obese recipient and have continued to transplant people with Body Mass Index (BMI)’s over 35 using <b>robotic</b> <b>surgery.</b> As of January 2014, over 100 people {{that would otherwise be}} turned down because of their weight have successfully been transplanted.|$|E
25|$|CO2 {{laser surgery}} is also {{another form of}} treatment. Transoral laser {{microsurgery}} allows surgeons to remove tumors from the voice box with no external incisions. It also allows access to tumors that are not reachable with <b>robotic</b> <b>surgery.</b> During the surgery, surgeon and pathologist work together to assess the adequacy of excision (“margin status”), minimizing the amount of normal tissue removed or damaged. This technique helps give the person as much speech and swallowing function as possible after surgery.|$|E

The pavilion is staffed by 200 surgeons and provides technology to perform surgeries not possible elsewhere in the county. These include minimally invasive surgeries to treat cancer and obesity; microsurgeries to restore voice, hearing, and facial function; MRI-guided gene therapy for brain cancer; heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy for abdominal cancer; spine and joint reconstruction; and <b>robotic</b> <b>surgery</b> for several cancers. The technologies at work include the region's only four intraoperative MRI machines, which allow real-time imaging of tumors and gene therapies during surgery to ensure complete treatment, as well as the nation's only Restriction Spectrum Imaging technology, which color code brain fibers to better plan for complex surgeries in advance. The area also includes three Intensive Care Units with 36 private rooms.|$|E
