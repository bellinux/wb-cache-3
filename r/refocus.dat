It became his fourth number-one on the Top Latin Albums chart the week ending 22 October 2011; {{and within a}} week went Gold in Chile, United States and Mexico; and Platinum in Venezuela and Argentina. Independiente was his first release as an independent artist, appearing on his Metamorfosis label, a company he created to <b>refocus</b> his career. The album was distributed by Warner. Billboard noted that although other groups have decided to go independent after working with major record labels, Arjona {{was by far the}} most important artist in Latin pop to do so. By the end of 2012, the album sold more than 75,000 copies in the United States and 400,000 copies worldwide.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>refocusing</b> {{and strong}} <b>refocusing</b> of light rays in a space-time. A strongly <b>refocusing</b> space-time is <b>refocusing.</b> The converse is unknown. We construct examples of space-times which are <b>refocusing,</b> but not strongly so, {{at a particular}} point. These space-times are strongly <b>refocusing</b> at other points. The geometrization conjecture proved by Perelman implies that a globally hyperbolic <b>refocusing</b> space-time of dimension ≤ 4 admits a strongly <b>refocusing</b> Lorentz metric. We show that the possibly empty set of points at which a strongly causal space-time is <b>refocusing</b> is closed. We prove that a Lorentz covering space of a strongly causal <b>refocusing</b> space-time is a strongly causal <b>refocusing</b> space-time. This generalizes the result of Chernov and Rudyak for globally hyperbolic space-times. Comment: 23 page...|$|R

Still incomplete in Trieste, Impero was captured by the Germans, who used the hulk for target practice.

Due to the rarity of Atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements, plans were made to move Stormfury to the Pacific and experiment on the large number of typhoons there. This action required many of the same safety requirements as in the Atlantic, but had the advantage of a much higher number of potential subjects.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to <b>refocus</b> projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E

Right: Created image, <b>refocused</b> on the person in the right. This paper explores an image {{processing}} method for synthesizing <b>refocused</b> images from a single input photograph containing some defocus blur. First, we restore a sharp image by estimating and removing spatially-variant defocus blur in an input photograph. To do this, we propose a local blur estimation method able to handle abrupt blur changes at depth discontinuities in a scene, and we also present an efficient blur removal method that significantly speeds up the existing deconvolution algorithm. Once a sharp image is restored, <b>refocused</b> images can be interactively created by adding different defocus blur to it based on the estimated blur, so that users can intuitively change focus and depth-offield of the input photograph. Although information available from a single photograph is highly insufficient for fully correct <b>refocusing,</b> the results show that visually plausible <b>refocused</b> images can be obtained. 1...|$|R
5|$|During the {{preliminary}} round at the World Championships, Sacramone {{qualified for the}} event finals on floor and vault {{and contributed to the}} top-qualifying position of the American team. She also posted a score on beam that would have been high enough to qualify her to the beam final. However, due to an International Federation of Gymnastics rule allowing only two athletes per country to participate in each event final, Sacramone was unable to compete for a beam medal, because teammates Liukin and Shawn Johnson qualified ahead of her. In the team final, she competed on vault, beam and floor, earning scores of 15.750, 15.600 and 15.325, respectively. When the American team faltered after a difficult beam rotation, in which two gymnasts made major errors, Sacramone gathered the team for a pep talk to <b>refocus</b> them for floor. The American team earned 184.400 points overall, which was good enough to secure the gold medal ahead of China and Romania.|$|E
5|$|Early {{work was}} {{promising}} {{and by the}} fall of 1976 the project was building momentum. Fans organized a mail campaign that flooded the White House with 400,000 letters, influencing President Gerald Ford to rechristen the Space Shuttle Constitution to Enterprise. Bryant and Scott's proposal became the first accepted by the studio in October; Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to <b>refocus</b> on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and producers were swamped with grateful fan mail. By the start of 1977 the project's official title was changed to Star Trek—The Motion Picture (a title reapplied to the eventually released 1979 film). The elation was short-lived; the first draft of the completed script was not finished until March 1, 1977, and pressure was mounting for Paramount to either begin production or cut its losses and cancel the project. Producer Jerry Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators to complement the script.|$|E
5|$|Tri-Star Pictures {{had planned}} to release the film using a {{platform}} technique which involved opening it in select cities before releasing it nationwide. The studio was confident that the limited theatrical run would generate strong-word-of-mouth interest and awards consideration for the film. Birdy opened in limited release on December 21, 1984 in New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto. The film's failure to garner any award nominations during the limited run resulted in Tri-Star cancelling a wide release scheduled for late January 1985. In response, A Films prompted the studio to <b>refocus</b> the film's marketing campaign. Tri-Star adjusted its promotional focus on the friendship between Birdy and Al, while Parker, Modine and Cage heavily promoted the film by personally visiting critics, journalists and radio reporters. Birdy was a box office bomb, grossing only $1,455,045 in the United States and Canada, well below its estimated budget of $12 million.|$|E

This model captures the basic features of all those situations in which a signal is either <b>refocused</b> by a repeater for long distance communication, or it is focused on a detector prior to the information decoding process. Introducing a general method for linear optical systems, we compute the communication capacity of the <b>refocusing</b> apparatus.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in computational photography enabled {{variation of the}} optical focus of a plenoptic camera after image exposure, also known as <b>refocusing.</b> Existing ray models in the field simplify the camera’s complexity {{for the purpose of}} image and depth map enhancement, but fail to satisfyingly predict the distance to which a photograph is <b>refocused.</b> By treating a pair of light rays as a system of linear functions, it will be shown in this paper that its solution yields an intersection indicating the distance to a <b>refocused</b> object plane. Experimental work is conducted with different lenses and focus settings while comparing distance estimates with a stack of <b>refocused</b> photographs for which a blur metric has been devised. Quantitative assessments over a 24 m distance range suggest that predictions deviate by less than 0. 35 % in comparison to an optical design software. The proposed <b>refocusing</b> estimator assists in predicting object distances just as in the prototyping stage of plenoptic cameras and will be an essential feature in applications demanding high precision in synthetic focus or where depth map recovery is done by analyzing a stack of <b>refocused</b> photographs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A time-reversal mirror is, roughly speaking, {{a device}} which {{is capable of}} {{receiving}} a signal in time, keeping it in memory and sending {{it back into the}} medium in the reversed direction of time. A brief mathematical review of the time-reversal theory is presented {{in the context of the}} linear shallow water equations. In particular an explicit expression is given for the <b>refocused</b> pulse in the simplest time-reversal case. The explicit expression for the power spectral density of the reflection process is used to construct the highpass filter which controls the <b>refocusing</b> process. Time-reversal numerical experiments in the (effectively) linear regime are used to validate the nonlinear shallow water code. The numerically <b>refocused</b> pulse is compared with the theoretical predicted shape. Further numerical experiments illustrate the robustness of the theory. In particular the time-reversal <b>refocusing</b> with smaller cutoff windows, the self-averaging property and finally <b>refocusing</b> when the nonlinear term is small but not negligible...|$|R
5|$|After the {{repeated}} German counterattacks prevented any lasting roadblock Truscott finally allowed reinforcements from the 45thDivision to support Dahlquist at Montélimar, {{as he felt}} the successful operations further south at the French ports allowed him to <b>refocus</b> to the north. At the same time, the Germans also reinforced their fighting force. Over the next days a stalemate emerged, with the Allies unable to block the retreat route and the Germans unable to clear {{the area of the}} Allied forces. Both sides became increasingly frustrated during the fighting, with attack, counterattack, and spoiling attacks, which made it hard for the 36thDivision to launch a decisive offensive. Whilst the 36thDivision had surrounded the 19thArmy, they themselves were almost surrounded, too, during the chaotic fighting, with only a thin supply route to the east open, resulting in their having to fight to the front and the rear. As the 36thDivision was seemingly making no progress, an angry Truscott arrived at Dahlquist's headquarters on 26August to relieve him of command. However, on seeing the heavy terrain and shattered forces, he refrained and left the headquarters again. Finally, during 26–28August, the majority of the German forces were able to escape, leaving behind 4,000 burnt-out vehicles and 1,500 dead horses. On 29August the Allies captured Montélimar, and the final German troops trying to break out surrendered. The Germans suffered 2,100 battle casualties plus 8,000 POWs, while the Americans had 1,575 casualties. Total POW losses of the 19thArmy now amounted to 57,000.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Citys {{marketing}} campaign {{was designed to}} reach an audience outside of superhero fans and appeal to consumers who are attracted to games like the first-person shooter series Call of Duty. Warner Bros.'s marketing team decided that Batman's status as a cultural icon and superhero was unavoidable, {{so they decided to}} emphasize other elements of the character that could appeal to fans of first-person shooters and action games. Black-and-white photographs of iconic personalities like inventor Steve Jobs and actor James Dean served as inspiration and a basis for the final {{marketing campaign}} used in advertisements and the game's cover art. The imagery, highlighted with blood and bathed in light was considered {{to move away from the}} classic superhero image and <b>refocus</b> on Batman's humanity. The black and white campaign was featured on 120 magazine covers and was targeted towards approximately 15 million consumers across a variety of social media and Warner Bros. products, in addition to a series of viral marketing videos and stunts involving actors in costume attending press-related events. By April 2012, three gameplay trailers had gained approximately 6 million views. The viral segment of the campaign involved several audio recordings between characters from the game including Hugo Strange, Quincy Sharp, Riddler, and the Penguin; each recording could be found by solving a puzzle. The entire campaign spent more than a year in development, producing artwork, videos, DLC, printed advertisements, billboards, and events, and was estimated to have cost at least $10 million.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the landing at Porton Plantation, the planned Australian advance into the Bonis Peninsula was called off. The Australian high command decided to <b>refocus</b> their efforts upon the drive towards Buin in the south and as a result the effort in the north was reduced to that of a holding action as further {{resources}} were transferred out of the sector. Following the withdrawal, the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion continued fighting along the Ratsua front before being relieved on 28 June by the 8th Infantry Battalion and withdrawing to Torokina, where they remained {{until the end of the}} war. The 23rd Brigade under Brigadier Arnold Potts took over control of the sector, and for a period of four weeks along the Ratsua front the 8th and 27th Infantry Battalions carried out patrolling operations before the Australians decided to withdraw to the Buoi Plantation in mid-July, by which time the Japanese forces in the area, boosted by their victory at Porton, had begun to seize the initiative through the use of harassment tactics. Following this several small-scale actions continued along the front until offensive action was discontinued on 11 August 1945 as the war came to a conclusion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Refocusing</b> {{for time}} {{reversed}} waves propagating in disordered media {{has recently been}} observed experimentally and studied mathematically. This surprising effect has many potential applications in domains such as medical imaging, underwater acoustics, and wireless communications. Time <b>refocusing</b> for one-dimensional acoustic waves is now mathematically well understood. In this paper the important case of one-dimensional dispersive waves is addressed. Time reversal is studied in reflection and in transmission. In both cases we derive the self-averaging properties of time reversed <b>refocused</b> pulses. An asymptotic analysis allows us to derive a precise description of the combined effects of randomness and dispersion. In particular, we study an important regime in transmission, where the coherent front wave is destroyed while time reversal of the incoherent transmitted wave still enables <b>refocusing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Motion during diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) {{introduces}} phase {{errors that}} can cause significant artifacts in brain images. One method of correcting these errors uses additional navigator data to measure the phase corruptions. Standard navigator methods correct for rigid-body motion but cannot correct for nonrigid deformations of the brain related to the cardiac cycle. This work derives a generalized reconstruction that corrects for nonrigid motion based on a least-squares formulation. Since this reconstruction has the disadvantage of being computationally expensive, an approximation is presented, called a <b>refocusing</b> reconstruction. The <b>refocusing</b> reconstruction is both efficient and straightforward. Each readout is multiplied in image space by the phase conjugate of the navigator image, and these rephased readouts are then summed. The conditions under which the <b>refocusing</b> reconstruction is sufficient are considered and methods {{to improve the quality}} of <b>refocused</b> images are discussed. In particular, synchronization of the acquisition to the cardiac cycle can provide data that is well-conditioned to the <b>refocusing</b> reconstruction without incurring the large time penalty traditionally associated with cardiac gating. These methods are applied to steady-state DWI, a promising pulse sequence that is particularly sensitive to motion-induced phase artifacts. The <b>refocusing</b> reconstruction is shown to significantly improve SS-DWI over standard rigid-body corrections...|$|R
