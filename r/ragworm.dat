The estuary wetlands are home to migrating birds such as the ringed plover, redshank and whimbrel, while the Eurasian curlew, dunlin and grey plover winter in the area. The birds feed on <b>ragworm,</b> lugworm and other invertebrates. Saltmarsh is found along {{the fringes of the}} coast. Beds of eelgrass occur on the more sheltered mud- and sandbanks. In 1976, in recognition {{of the importance of the}} estuary as a wetland used by migrating birds, an area of 247 km2 (95 sq miles) was designated a Ramsar site. In 1988 the Severn Estuary was designated a Special Protection Area. The same year an area of 99 km2 (38 sq miles) was notified as a SSSI and designated as such the following year; in 1995, this was extended to cover the whole of the Ramsar site.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ragworms</b> are {{predominantly}} marine organisms that may occasionally swim upstream to rivers and even climb to land (for example Lycastopsis catarractarum). They are {{commonly found in}} all water depths, foraging in seaweeds, hiding under rocks or burrowing in sand or mud. <b>Ragworms</b> are mainly omnivorous but many are active carnivores. Nereids only breed once before dying (semelparity) {{and most of them}} morph into a distinct form to breed (epitoky).|$|R

5000|$|Hediste diversicolor, {{commonly}} known as a <b>ragworm,</b> is a polychaete worm in the family Nereidae. It lives in a burrow in the sand or mud of beaches and estuaries in intertidal zones in the north east Atlantic. This species is used in research but its classification is in dispute and in the literature it is often classified as Nereis diversicolor (O.F. Müller, 1776). Its specific name [...] "diversicolor" [...] refers {{to the fact that}} its colour changes from brown to green as the breeding season approaches.|$|E
50|$|Hediste diversicolor {{can grow}} up to 10 cm in length and may have from ninety to one hundred and twenty {{segments}} when mature. The head has a pair of palps, two pairs of antennae, four pairs of tentacles and four eyes. Each body segment has a pair of bristly appendages known as perapods which are used for walking and swimming. There is a prominent blood vessel running along the dorsal surface of the animal. This <b>ragworm</b> is pale brown but changes to green as the gonads mature and the breeding season approaches.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{habitat of}} the grey gull is sandy beaches and mudflats {{along the western}} coasts of South America where it probes with its beak in the {{sediment}} for invertebrate prey, particularly mole crabs.

40|$|For many fish, {{olfaction}} {{is important}} in food search and consumption. Amino acids are known to elicit feeding behaviour in several species. The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the contribution of amino acids to the odour of a natural prey organism of the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). Both whole-body macerates and substances released to the water by living <b>ragworms</b> (Hediste diversicolor) were fractionated by molecular weight filtration followed by solid-phase extraction (SPE), and the olfactory activity of the resultant fractions was assessed by the electro-olfactogram (EOG) in the sole. The amino acid concentrations of the macerate and water were determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC–MS). In the macerate, the majority of odorants were small molecular weight compounds (b 500 Da) which were not retained by C- 18 SPE cartridges. An artificial mixture of amino acids at the same concentrations as found in the macerate had similar olfactory potency. The odorants released to the water by living <b>ragworms</b> were also small molecular weight compounds (b 500 Da) but the majority of olfactory activity could be extracted by C- 18 SPE cartridges. The concentrations of amino acids in these samples were too low to contribute greatly to its olfactory potency. These results suggest that, whilst olfactory sensitivity to amino acids may explain most of the potency of the macerate, living <b>ragworms</b> are releasing additional odorants other than amino acids which may be equally important in chemosensory food location in the sole...|$|R

Passage East also has a natural mussel bed in which you can dig for <b>ragworm</b> and also the beach produces good hauls of lug. Lug can be dug all the way along the coast to Woodstown.|$|E
50|$|Fishing is not {{commonly}} practised in Langland these days, {{either from}} the beach or from the rocky shore. A strikingly marked large rock {{on the western side}} of the bay called Cross Rock used to be a popular spot to fish at high tide in the summer months with float and soft crab as bait. Catches included bass, sea bream and dogfish. Langland Point held similar promise, but the use of spinners or feathers here sometimes delivered mackerel as well as bass. Occasional Common dab and European plaice were caught with lugworm or <b>ragworm</b> from the beach, although the worm population of the beach has always been small.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} dredged {{sediment}} reuse {{on the production}} and bioconcentration of monomethylmercury (MMHg) was investigated by examining sediments and <b>ragworms</b> found in dredge material banks and surrounding sites in the Venice Lagoon, Italy. Total Hg concentrations in the surface 20 cm of sediments {{were higher in the}} banks than in the surrounding sites, but MMHg concentrations were similar, which suggests reduced MMHg production in the banks. Monomethylmercury content in <b>ragworms</b> was significantly lower (p ?<? 0. 05) in the banks than in the surrounding sites. In pore water, concentrations of both sulfate and Fe decreased with depth in the upper 20 cm of the dredge banks. In contrast, sulfate concentrations were constant with depth and large amounts of dissolved Fe occurred in the upper 20 cm of sediments of surrounding sites. Continuous sulfate reduction and possible precipitation of iron sulfide may decrease the production and bioconcentration of MMHg in the dredge material banks compared to the surrounding sites. Overall, the production of MMHg in sediments and its bioconcentration in benthic organisms were connected to the process of sediment diagenesis of organic matter through the control of pore water and sediment geochemistry involving iron and sulfur...|$|R
50|$|Hediste diversicolor {{has been}} found to have a {{deleterious}} effect on the establishment of saltmarshes. When tests were undertaken in southern England on establishing the seagrass Zostera noltei, it was found that efforts were more successful when the <b>ragworm</b> was excluded from the area of transplanted material. In another planting trial, the pioneering cordgrass Spartina anglica, used to prevent coastal erosion, was similarly adversely affected. In the laboratory, ragworms were seen to pull leaves of the grasses into their burrows where they fed on them, and the disturbance to the substrate caused by their burrowing activities was also thought to contribute to the reduced establishment rates.|$|E
50|$|In Britain, surfcasting {{is often}} called beachcasting. It is a popular form of fishing which is carried out all around {{the coast of the}} British Isles. Beachcasters use very long fishing rods, usually between 12 and 16 feet. The beachcaster will stand on a beach or {{shoreline}} and cast out to sea with either a water filled float, or a lead weight weighing between 120g and 200g. Bait used in this form of fishing might include limpets, mussels, lugworm, <b>ragworm,</b> sandeel, mackerel strip, squid, peeler crab or razor fish. Additionally, artificial flies or even spinners may be used for species such as mackerel or bass. It is a common pastime in coastal areas of Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland and often results in the capture of large specimens of many species of fish, including: flatfish, bass, cod, whiting, pollack, black bream, dogfish, smooth hound, bull huss, rays and tope.|$|E

40|$|Elimination {{kinetics}} of six tetra-, penta- and hexachlorobiphenyls {{were investigated}} in Nereis diversicolor from two {{populations of the}} Weser Estuary by laboratory experiments. Elimination half-lives increased in the order 101, 52, 87, 44, 95, 153 (IUPAC Nos.) indicating the importance of PCB structure. At appropriate salinities, 10 ppt and 25 ppt, <b>ragworms</b> from the possibly more contaminated mesohaline site eliminated these components considerably faster than those from the polyhaline site. Worms from the mesohaline site also had considerably more polar transformation products of No. 52, which had been applied super(14) C-labelled. This indicates that the faster PCB elimination in this population was generally due to increased biotransformation. PCB elimination was not significantly changed after animals of the polyhaline site had been acclimated to 10 ppt salinity. Relative elimination rates of the components {{were in accordance with}} PCB patterns determined in environmental samples of Nereis diversicolor, i. e. selective elimination strongly influences the levels of PCB components. Besides No. 101, hexa- and heptachlorobiphenyls with Cl substitution in 2, 3, 4, 5 -position of one phenyl ring were under-represented. Tetra- and pentachlorobiphenyls predominated in <b>ragworms</b> of the mesohaline site, while hexa- and heptachlorobiphenyls did so in those of the polyhaline site.

40|$|Common sole {{fed with}} {{commercial}} pellets develop anaemia and are restricted in their growth performance. The anaemia {{can be the}} result of a difference in feed intake, a nutritional deficiency, an inflammatory response to infection or combinations of these aspects. In this study, it was investigated whether feeding <b>ragworm</b> would alleviate the anaemia and stimulate growth. Sole were fed one of three diets: a commercial feed, a commercial feed treated with <b>ragworm</b> extract or chopped <b>ragworm.</b> By comparing groups, three hypotheses were tested: (1) feeding <b>ragworm</b> alleviates the anaemia and positively affectS the sole’s metabolic performance reflected in feed intake, feed efficiency and growth; (2) anaemia is alleviated by a higher feed intake when feeding <b>ragworm</b> and (3) anaemia is caused by an inflammatory response to infection. The sole fed with a commercial diet suffered from anaemia. Feeding sole with <b>ragworm</b> alleviated the anaemia as the average haematocrit level nearly doubled in these fish as compared to fish fed pellets. Investigation of the expression of genes in the liver indicated that the anaemia in sole fed pellets is a nutritional anaemia and not an anaemia due to an inflammatory response. Sole fed <b>ragworm</b> showed improved growth which may be a consequence of the higher haematocrit levels in these fish increasing their oxygen carrying capacity.

40|$|Scientifically, {{this study}} aimed to {{validate}} the potential of <b>ragworm</b> to alleviate anaemia in common sole and to identify the dietary requirements of common sole to alleviate this anaemia. At {{the same time it}} was aimed to explain part of the difference in growth between sole fed a commercial pellet and sole fed <b>ragworm.</b> Practically, this study aimed to develop a diet that achieves similar growth rates in sole as when fed <b>ragworm.</b> Sole fed commercial pellets developed nutritional anaemia. Feeding <b>ragworm</b> or mussel alleviates this nutritional anaemia. It is suggested that the ability of mussel or <b>ragworm</b> (meal) to alleviate anaemia and improve growth in sole can be explained by  heme iron and high B 12 levels. Yet, iron absorption in sole is high and independent of iron source. Still, heme increases the absorption of copper. The high absorption of iron and copper in sole fed heme does not affect the haematocrit (Hct) and haemoglobin (Hb) levels, which indicates the anaemia in sole is not an iron or a copper deficiency anaemia. The Hct and Hb levels in sole are affected by dietary B 12. Yet, the applied levels are unable to alleviate the anaemia in sole induced by feeding commercial pellets. More options to alleviate the nutritional anaemia in common sole are discussed. Nutrients as vitamin C, B 1, B 2, B 5 and a possible role of dietary EPO are discussed. It is suggested that the slow growth of pellet-fed sole might be due to the low Hct and Hb levels, which hampers the uptake of oxygen, and thus also the overall metabolic capacity, including the scope for growth. Discussed is a 7 °C difference in the “optimal” temperature between sole fed <b>ragworm</b> and the 2 nd generation pellet and that the “worm effect” is dependent on temperature. However, the growth rate of sole fed the 3 rd generation pellet at 18. 4 °C was comparable to the growth rate of sole fed <b>ragworm,</b> which could not have been the consequence of increasing Hct and Hb levels as these were comparable to levels found in sole fed commercial pellets. Yet, B 12 levels in blood plasma of sole are up to 200 times those of other (fish) species. Hence, we inferred on the possibility of a specific metabolic function of B 12 in respiration in sole. In addition, the economic and practical impact of the improved growth rate in sole culture is discussed. Finally, several suggestions for future research are given...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} effect of food type (formulated diet vs. natural food) and fish size on protein and energy {{utilization}} efficiencies for growth in common sole, Solea solea (L.). Replicate groups of common sole (mean initial body weight ± SD was 45. 7 g ± 2. 1 and 111. 2 g ± 4. 2) received the diets at five (natural feed) or four (formulated diet) feeding levels. The protein utilization efficiency for growth (kgCP) was higher (P > 0. 001) in common sole fed <b>ragworms</b> than in common sole fed the formulated diet (respectively, 0. 40 and 0. 31). Likewise, the energy utilization efficiency for growth (kgGE) was higher (P = 0. 001) in common sole fed <b>ragworms</b> than in common sole fed the formulated diet (respectively, 0. 57 and 0. 33). The protein maintenance requirement was not different between food types (P = 0. 64) or fish size (P = 0. 41) being on average 0. 82 g kg− 0. 8 day− 1. The energy maintenance requirement was not different between food type (P = 0. 390) but differed between fish size (P = 0. 036). The gross energy maintenance requirement of small common sole was 35 kJ g− 0. 8 day− 1. The gross energy maintenance requirement of large common sole was 25 kJ g− 0. 8 day− 1.
