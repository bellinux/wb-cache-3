40|$|U članku se donosi opis zaštitnih arheoloških istraživanja na zapadnom dijelu splitske Rive koja su provedena tijekom 2006. i 2007. godine. Otkriveni su ostatci mletačkog Kaštela iz prve polovice 15. st., podzidana linija mletačke obale i Mali mul, zatim ostatci baroknog bastiona Bernardi i ulice, te novovjekovni kanali za vodu i popločani prostori. The {{so-called}} protective archaeological {{research on}} the west portion of the Split Riva was initiated by the recent construction-decoration works on the Riva. The remnants of a Venitian castle, dated to {{the first half of}} the 15 th century, were discovered, together with the channels and the paved area situated at the west portion of the castle. The research also revealed the existence of the underpinned portion of the Venitian-built coast line and the locality called Mali mul, which were presumably constructed either at the end of the 16 th or in {{the first half of the}} 17 th century. The remains of the baroque bastion Bernardi were also discovered at the site. The ancient Split harbour was formed during the construction of Diocletian’s Palace and was situated at its front. The medieval coast line expanded towards the north whereas the Venetian line expanded towards the north and the west end of the ancient harbour. In the first half of the 15 th century, the Castle was built. The west portion of the today’s central part of the harbour was a silty shallow cove. The construction works at this site had not started until the 19 th century when the harbour was expanded towards the west under the French rule. During the Austrian rule, precisely in the mid- 19 t century, the French portion of the coast is expanded to create more definite stone coast line. The Venitian Castle of colossal proportions was erected right by the medieval defensive city walls in the 15 th century. The Castle, that closed the entrance into the ancient harbour on its west side, was pentagonal in shape with four octagonal towers on the north side. Today, only the main big tower and the nearby smaller one on the north-east side are preserved together with the connecting wall between them. In the course of the archaeological research in 2006 and 2007, the following architectural remnants of the south portion of the Castle were revealed: the outer defensive walls on the south, east and west side, known as Z 3, Z 6 and Z 10; the pavement – P 1, built at the outer rims of the defensive wall. A very interesting wall, known as Z 9, was revealed inside the Castle. This wall, that is 3 metres wide and 19, 50 metres long, is positioned in the east-west direction. Both the width of the wall and inclination of its outer portion (scarpa) imply that it was, in fact, a defensive wall. This defensive wall is presumed to have been built before the 15 th century Castle. The historical resources from the early 14 th century, particulary the Split City Statute from 1312 and the Town Council notes, reveal the existence of several constructions in this period. These are, as follows: the court known as Curia Sabachi, the locality called Sendare, the defensive city wall, the Monastery of St. Claire. The mistery of The Scarpa, or the Z 9 wall, is yet to be unravelled, since it was not built before the 15 th century and the Castle had already been erected without it. Archaeological research revealed the remnants of the underpinned portion of the Venitianbuilt coast line that was 120 metres long. The end west portion of the coast goes along the pavement (P 1) of the south defensive wall of the Castle (Z 3) and continues east, towards the entrance into the subterranian passages of Diocletian’s Palace. The coastal wall was built using big blocks of stone connected by waterproof binder. The red colour of the binder reveals its two main components: the binder is the mixture of red soil and, so-called, Santorini earth. The underpinned portion of the coast was presumably built at the end of the 16 th or in the early 17 th century. At this time, that is, after the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the threat of any possible attack of the Ottoman fleet was removed and the Castle lost its primary purpose: the defense of the harbour. Mali mul is situated in front of the Castle and the Venitian-built coast. It is presumed that Mali mul is dated to the same period as the Castle, since the same <b>red</b> <b>binder</b> was used to connect the walls. Two massive walls, Z 19 and Z 21, were discovered on the north portion of Mali mul. The north west Z 19 wall is dated to the first half of the 19 th century, whereas the north east Z 21 wall is considered to be a remnant of the east portion of Mali Mul from the first half of the 17 th century. Several intersecting walls were discovered between the two aforementioned walls. It is believed that these intersecting walls belonged to two healthcare buildings: the first building was erected in the early 18 th century and the second one that was called Šanitada and designed by Vicko Andrić in 1824, was demolished in 1875. The baroque bastion Bernardi was built on the south west portion of the defensive city walls in 1664. The bastion walls are made of stone blocks that are preserved in its lower portions. The filler is completely preserved and reaches the foundations of the two houses built on the bastion: the neo-reneissance Andrić and Gillardi houses. It is important to stress that only preliminary conclusions have been made concerning the issue of the Split harbour. More definite conclusions will be reached after a thourough analysis of the archaeological findings...|$|E

30|$|Careful {{study and}} {{analysis}} of Islamic manuscripts and folios at the Harvard Art Museums is revealing a wealth of detail about the production of these works {{and the range of}} materials used. It is hoped that this study can join others to deepen an understanding of Islamic works on paper collections worldwide. Some colors, such as red and brown, show little variation in the pigments used over the full chronological period studied. Other pigments, in particular the greens and yellows, vary considerably. Indian yellow was found in a few Islamic works, representing the first known such identification. Further study is required to understand the rare use of this vibrant yellow pigment outside of India. Introduction of “industrial” pigments occurs in some 19 th century works but in others traditional pigments similar to those used in the preceding centuries were employed. The occasional and sporadic use of pigments such as azurite and realgar–pararealgar has been demonstrated but requires further exploration to more fully understand the variations seen. Continued study of art works from Bukhara is planned due to the limited number of such art works examined to date and the diversity of materials found in these. Further work is required for the identification of the organic components, such as organic <b>reds</b> and <b>binders.</b> Such identification may, however, be limited by the need for micro-sampling, which is only possible where existing damage is present and often does not allow for sampling of all, or even the most desired, areas and hence colors.|$|R
30|$|Briquetting is {{the process}} of {{compressing}} loose fuel material to form a high densified product. As a result, physical, chemical and combustion properties of the material are much improved [9, 10, 11]. In addition, transportation and storage is enhanced. Numerous research [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] have been done on briquette production and characterization. A lot of efforts have been made to study briquettes from different sources [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Properties such as volatile matter, calorific value, relaxed density, compressed density, ash content, durability, fixed carbon, dimensional stability, compressive strength, etc., vary with raw material, binder type, compacting pressure and temperature. Therefore, these properties cannot be generalized. During briquette making, some biomass naturally binds when subjected to favourable temperatures and pressures because they have lignin [4, 22, 23]. However, if these conditions are not met then a binder is required to complete the process. Some of the binders which are normally used include starch, molasses, clay, dung, gum, among others. These binders have impact on briquette properties. For instance, Ngusale et al. [4] reported that charcoal briquettes made from clay and <b>red</b> soil as <b>binders</b> emit a lot of smoke during combustion.|$|R

40|$|The primary work {{reported}} in this thesis is concerned mainly {{with the effects of}} different mixing methods and RAP materials on homogeneity and mechanical properties of hot recycled asphalt mixtures. The recycled asphalt mixture conforms to the requirement of BS 4987 - 1 (2005) for dense bitumen macadam size 10 mm (DBM 10 mm). The proportion of RAP in the recycled mixture is 40 %. RAP materials are artificially aged and processed in the laboratory to prevent the variability of RAP gradation, bitumen content, and the origin. Laboratory RAP is also used to assure that every single RAP particle is an agglomerate of RAP aggregate and binder. The mixing procedures include Black Rock (BR), Complete Blending (CB), the SHRP procedure, and a newly developed field simulation method (FS). The primary difference between these methods is the mixing mechanism. The BR case implies the situation in which there is completely no interaction between RAP and virgin binder. On the contrary, RAP and virgin binder are fully interacted in the CB case. The mixing procedures for BR and CB cases conform to those for conventional asphalt mixtures. However, the bitumen for BR case is pure virgin bitumen. In addition, the bitumen for CB is the blend between RAP and virgin binder. The RAP/virgin binder proportion is 4 / 6. In the SHRP method, RAP is preheated at 110 oC for two hours before being mixed with virgin aggregate and binder for 2 minutes at 130 oC. In the FS method on the contrary, the mixing procedure duplicates what occurs in the asphalt mixing plant. RAP is mixed with superheated virgin aggregate (215 oC) for different durations before this combination is blended with virgin bitumen for 2 minutes at 130 oC. The RAP/superheated virgin aggregate mixing duration starts from short mixing time where RAP still exists at approximately original size and gradually increases until the change in RAP lump size is insignificant. Depending on the size of RAP used, RAP/superheated virgin aggregate mixing duration varies from 1 to 8 minutes. The homogeneity of hot recycled asphalt mixture is examined by using virgin binder with a different colour from that of RAP binder. The colour of virgin binder is obtained by mixing clear binder (Shell Mexphalt C 160 / 220 Pen) with iron oxide pigment. The proportion of pigment is 10 % by weight of the binder making this <b>binder</b> <b>red.</b> The use of virgin binder with different colour from that of RAP binder helps to clearly differentiate the locations of RAP and virgin materials. Surfaces of slices cut from compacted recycled specimens are photographed by digital camera. The analysis of these surfaces in vertical order allows the locations of RAP material to be qualitatively identified in a 3 D manner. Stiffness modulus values of samples for homogeneity assessment are also determined by indirect tensile stiffness test. The stiffness test is carried out in four directions along the circumference of each specimen with 45 o angular increments. The experimental results show that the stiffness measurement in four directions can indicate the heterogeneity of recycled mixture. The variation in stiffness values in different measured directions will be substantial for heterogeneous mixtures and minor in the case where recycled mixtures are homogeneous. The results indicate there are mutual relations between mixing effort, homogeneity, and stiffness values of recycled asphalt mixtures. The longer mixing time will enhance the homogeneity and reduce the variation in stiffness values of recycled mixture. In addition, as more RAP and virgin binder are incorporated, the stiffness values of recycled mixture generally increase once the mixing time is extended. As the clear <b>binder</b> is dyed <b>red</b> by 10 % by weight of iron oxide, the proportion of the pigment certainly alters the flow characteristic of binder. This might affect the mixing process and rejuvenating effect between virgin and aged binder. Therefore, the effects of mixing methods and RAP sizes on mechanical performance of hot recycled asphalt mixtures are further investigated using normal straight run bitumen 160 / 220 Pen as virgin binder. The assessment indicators include stiffness modulus, resistance to fatigue damage, and resistance to permanent deformation. The experimental results indicate that the conventional laboratory mixing method (SHRP) tends to overestimate the mechanical properties of recycled asphalt mixture. The long RAP preheating time that never exists in the industry coincidentally enhances the reaction between RAP and virgin binder. The long RAP preheating time also slightly alters the properties of RAP binder. For the FS method, the increase in mixing duration significantly improves the homogeneity level of recycled mixtures. The homogeneity level is also substantially affected by the size of RAP material. For the same mixing effort, the mixtures comprised of small RAP are generally more homogeneous than those made from larger RAP. The more homogeneous the mixture, the more interaction between RAP and virgin binder. Therefore, recycled mixtures become stiffer and have better resistance to permanent deformation and fatigue failure. A slightly linear increase in stiffness can result in an exponential increase in fatigue life of the recycled mixture. The mechanical properties including stiffness modulus, resistance to fatigue damage, and resistance to permanent deformation of hot recycled asphalt mixtures are not {{similar to those of the}} BR or CB mixtures, even at the favourable condition where RAP is preheated for 2 hours at 110 oC in the SHRP method and 8 minutes mixing duration in the FS method. This implies that RAP does not act as Black Rock. In addition, the assumption that RAP and virgin binder are fully blended also never exists in the recycled asphalt production process.
