The present research, however, demonstrated the capture using a sophisticated design. In Experiment 1 the immediate effect was confirmed, and in Experiment 2 {{the persistence of the}} effect after eyes were closed was demonstrated. While subjects lightly touched a vibrating cylinder with their index finger (s), their hand (s) and arm(s) were moved passively in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Looking through a left-right <b>reversing</b> <b>prism,</b> all 12 subjects perceived the direction of their hand movements based on visual information despite being aware of the visual transposition (Experiment 1).

40|$|Dorsal {{posterior}} {{parietal cortex}} (PPC) has been implicated through single-unit recordings, neuroimaging data, and studies of brain-damaged humans in the spatial guidance of reaching and pointing movements. The present study examines the causal effect of single-pulse {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) over {{the left and right}} dorsal posterior parietal cortex during a memory-guided ‘reach-to-touch ’ movement task in six human subjects. Stimulation of the left parietal hemisphere significantly increased endpoint variability, independent of visual field, with no horizontal bias. In contrast, right parietal stimulation did not increase variability, but instead produced a significantly systematic leftward directional shift in pointing (contralateral to stimulation site) in both visual fields. Furthermore, the same lateralized pattern persisted with left-hand movement, suggesting that these aspects of parietal control of pointing movements are spatially fixed. To test if the right parietal TMS shift occurs in visual or motor coordinates, we trained subjects to point correctly to optically reversed peripheral targets, viewed through a left-right Dove <b>reversing</b> <b>prism.</b> Following prism adaptation, the horizonta...|$|E
40|$|Upon {{return from}} spaceflight, a {{majority}} of crewmembers experience motion sickness (MS) symptoms. The interactions between crewmembers' adaptation to a gravitational transition, the performance decrements resulting from MS and/or use of promethazine (PMZ), and the constraints imposed by mission task demands could significantly challenge and limit an astronaut's ability to perform functional tasks during gravitational transitions. No operational countermeasure currently exists to mitigate {{the risks associated with}} these sensorimotor disturbances. Stochastic resonance (SR) can be thought of simply as "noise benefit" or an increase in information transfer by a system when {{in the presence of a}} non-zero level of noise. We have shown that low levels of stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) improve balance and locomotor performance due to SR (Goel et al. 2015, Mulavara et al. 2011, 2015). Additionally, a study in a 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) hemi-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease demonstrated improvements in locomotor activity after low-level SVS delivery possibly due to an increase in nigral gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release in a dopamine independent way (Samoudi et al. 2012). SVS specifically increased GABA release on the lesioned, but not the intact side. These results suggest that SVS can cause targeted alterations of GABA release to affect performance of functional tasks. Activation of the GABA pathway is important in modulating MS and promoting adaptability (Cohen 2008). Magnusson et al. (2000) supported this finding by showing that the administration of a GABAB agonist caused a reversal of the symptoms that is normally seen after unilateral labyrinthectomy. Thus, GABA could play a significant role in reducing MS and promoting adaptability. We have taken advantage of the SR mechanism as a modulator of neurotransmitters to develop a unique SVS countermeasure system to mitigate MS symptoms and improve functional performance after landing. Healthy subjects (n= 20) participated in two test sessions, one in which they received +/- 400 microA of SVS and one where they received no stimulation (0 microA); the study design was counterbalanced. Subjects began by performing a series of four functional tasks 3 - 5 times as baseline measurements of task performance. Then, to induce MS, subjects walked an obstacle course with up-down reversing prisms. If they completed the course before achieving our pre-determined level of MS, they were asked to read a poster while making large up-down head movements to a metronome while still wearing the <b>reversing</b> <b>prism</b> goggles. Subjects were stopped every two minutes and asked to report their MS symptoms. Using the Pensacola Scale for motion sickness, test operators evaluated the level of MS of each subject. Once a subject reached an 8 on this scale, which is equivalent to mild malaise, or 30 minutes had passed since the start of the MS induction, this protocol was stopped. Finally, immediately after MS induction, subjects were asked to complete the four functional tasks again. Although, 100 % of our subjects experienced at least one MS symptom, only 55 % of our subjects experienced stomach awareness to any degree. Without SVS, only 40 % of subjects lasted the full 30 -minute MS induction protocol, while 65 % of subjects lasted the full 30 minutes with SVS, which is nearly a significant increase (p= 0. 056). In addition, subjects showed significant improvement from baseline when performing a tandem walk and a prone-to-stand test immediately after the MS induction protocol was stopped but the stimulation level was continued. The results are promising and future work includes comparing MS progression between PMZ and SVS directly in subjects that are provoked to a minimum of nausea. Low levels of SVS stimulation may serve as a non-pharmacological countermeasure to replace or reduce the PMZ dosage requirements and concurrently improve functional performance during transitions to new gravitational environments after spaceflight...|$|E
40|$|<b>Reversing</b> <b>prisms</b> {{are known}} to produce {{symptoms}} of motion sickness, and {{have been used to}} provide a chronic stimulus for training subjects on symptom recognition and regulation. However, testing procedures with <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms</b> have not been standardized. A set of procedures were evaluated which could be standardized using prisms for provocation and to compare the results between Right/Left <b>Reversing</b> <b>Prisms</b> (R/L-RP) and Up/Down <b>Reversing</b> <b>Prisms</b> (U/D-RP). Fifteen subjects were tested with both types of prisms using a self paced walking course throughout the laboratory with work stations established at specified intervals. The work stations provided tasks requiring eye-hand-foot coordination and various head movements. Comparisons were also made between these prism tests and two other standardized susceptibility tests, the KC- 135 parabolic static chair test and the Staircase Velocity Motion Test (SVMT). Two different types of subjective symptom reports were compared. The R/L-RP were significantly more provocative than the U/D-RP. The incidence of motion sickness symptoms for the R/L-RP was similar to the KC- 135 parabolic static chair test. Poor correlations were found between the prism tests and the other standardized susceptibility tests, which might indicate that different mechanisms are involved in provoking motion sickness for these different tests...|$|R
40|$|Overall, {{the results}} {{obtained}} in both the U. S. and the Russian space programs indicate that most space crews will experience some symptoms of motion sickness (MS) causing {{significant impact on the}} operational objectives that must be accomplished to assure mission success. At this time the primary countermeasure for MS requires the administration of Promethazine. Promethazine is not a benign drug, and is most frequently administered just prior to the sleep cycle to prevent its side effects from further compromising mission objectives. Clearly other countermeasures for SMS must be developed. Currently the primary focus is on two different technologies: (1) developing new and different pharmacological compounds with less significant side effects, (2) preflight training. The primary problem with all of these methods for controlling MS is time. New drugs that may be beneficial are years from testing and development, and preflight training requires a significant investment of crew time during an already intensive pre-launch schedule. Granted, motion sickness symptoms can be minimized with either of the two methods detailed above, however, {{it may be possible to}} develop a countermeasure that does not require either extensive adaptation time or exposure to motion sickness. Approximately 25 years ago Professor Geoffrey Melvill Jones presented his work on adaptation of the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) using optically <b>reversed</b> vision (left-right <b>prisms)</b> during head rotations in the horizontal plane. It was of no surprise that most subjects experienced motion sickness while wearing the optically <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms.</b> However, a serendipitous finding emerged during this research showing that the same subjects did not experience motion sickness symptoms when wearing the <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms</b> under stroboscopic illumination. The mechanism, by which this side-effect was believed to have occurred, is not clearly understood. However, the fact that no motion sickness was ever noted, suggests the possibility of producing functionally useful adaptation during space flight without the penalty of disabling motion sickness by controlling the rate of the adaptive process by means of an appropriate stroboscopically presented environment. After several recent meetings with Professor Melvill Jones, we were encouraged to repeat the motion sickness portions of his and Mandl's 1981 stroboscopic experiment. In conducting this experiment we used a randomized cross-over design where subjects were randomly assigned to either a stroboscopic flash or no strobe for their first exposure in the experimental design. Twenty subjects (19 subjects completed the study) read a short passage from Treasure Island mounted on the wall approximately 1 m from their eyes while wearing left-right <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms.</b> The strobe on time of 3 microseconds and flash frequency of 4 Hz was set to equal that used in the original study. Motion sickness was scored using a modified Miller and Graybiel scale that we constructed to include symptoms that may be elicited under conditions where <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms</b> are worn. On this scale a score of 5 represented Malaise IIa (mild motion sickness) and a score of 8 or above is approaching frank sickness. Symptoms were tracked and recorded every 5 min during the task. Testing was limited to 30 min unless the subject had reached the MIIa score, at which time the test was terminated. Performance under stroboscopic illumination was significantly better than when the subjects read under normal room illumination while wearing the left-right <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms.</b> Based on these results we developed a goggle system using LCD material that can be strobed. To evaluate the effectiveness of stroboscopic goggles we tested an additional 9 subjects in addition to retesting 10 used in the stroboscopic pilot study described above. These 19 subjects wore a pair of strobing LCD goggles that could be cycled at 4 Hz. These subjects wore the goggles while also wearing left-right reversg prisms. Results while wearing the goggles showed that none of the 19 subjects scored at the MIIa level on the motion sickness rating scale. When the goggles did not flash (no strobe), 11 of the 19 developed symptoms above the MIIa criteria. As a countermeasure the goggles seem to be effective, even with an on time of 10 msec (time the goggles are clear). We have also collected anecdotal data, from our personnel in the Neuroscience Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center, suggesting that the goggles may effective in preventing carsickness...|$|R
40|$|The human {{vestibulo-ocular reflex}} (VOR) {{is known to}} undergo major plastic {{modification}} in coping with sensory conflict brought about by optical <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms.</b> The first phase of this study proposes a simple model to account for this modifiability in terms of known neurophysiology. To study the phenomenon further two series of experiments were conducted on long-term vision-reversed cats. For this a new computer technique was developed to analyse oculomotor responses. The first series studied the time course and amplitude dependence of adaptation; the second, the frequency response of the fully adapted system. The adaptive process exhibited strict limitations, the functional effectiveness of which is quantitatively defined. The findings as a whole suggest that adaptive mechanisms other than the VOR are at play and that far more complex interactions exist between vestibulo- and visual-motor mechanisms than originally envisaged...|$|R
40|$|Posterior {{parietal cortex}} (PPC) {{participates in the}} {{planning}} of visuospatial behaviors, including reach movements, in gazecentered coordinates. It is not known if these representations encode the visual goal in retinal coordinates, or the movement direction relative to gaze. Here, by dissociating the intrinsic retinal stimulus from the extrinsic direction of movement, we show that PPC employs a visual code. Using delayed pointing and eventrelated functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified a cluster of PPC regions whose activity was topographically (contralaterally) related to {{the direction of the}} planned movement. We then switched the normal visual [...] motor spatial relationship by adapting subjects to optical left/right <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms.</b> With prisms, movement-related PPC topography reversed, remaining tied to the retinal image. Thus, remarkably, the PPC region in each hemisphere now responded more for planned ipsilateral pointing movements. Other non-PPC regions showed the opposite world- or motor-fixed pattern. These findings suggest that PPC primarily encodes not motor commands but movement goals in visual coordinates...|$|R
40|$|Results {{obtained}} from space flight indicate that most space crews will experience some symptoms of motion sickness causing {{significant impact on}} the operational objectives that must be accomplished to assure mission success. Based on the initial work of Melvill-Jones, we have evaluated stroboscopic vision as a method of preventing motion sickness. Methods: Nineteen subjects read text while making +/- 20 deg head movements in the horizontal plane at 0. 2 Hz while wearing left-right <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms</b> during exposure to 4 Hz stroboscopic or normal room illumination. Testing was repeated using LCD shutter glasses as the stroboscopic source with an additional 19 subjects. Results: With Strobe, motion sickness was significantly lower than with normal room illumination. Results with the LCD shutter glasses were analogous to those observed with environmental strobe. Conclusions: Stroboscopic illumination appears to be effective where retinal slip is a factor in eliciting motion sickness. Additional research is evaluating the glasses efficacy for, carsickness, sickness in parabolic flight and seasickness. There is evidence from pilot studies showing that the glasses reduce saccade velocity to visually presented targets by approximately half of the normal values. It {{is interesting to note that}} adaptation to space flight may also slow saccade velocity...|$|R
40|$|Two {{critical}} and unresolved human factors issues in VR systems are: 1) potential "cybersickness", {{a form of}} motion sickness which is experienced in virtual worlds, and 2) maladaptive sensorimotor performance following exposure to VR systems. Interestingly, these aftereffects are often quite similar to adaptive sensorimotor responses observed in astronauts during and/or following space flight. Most astronauts and cosmonauts experience perceptual and sensorimotor disturbances during and following space flight. All astronauts exhibit decrements in postural control following space flight. It {{has been suggested that}} training in virtual reality (VR) may be an effective countermeasure for minimizing perceptual and/or sensorimotor disturbances. People adapt to consistent, sustained alterations of sensory input such as those produced by microgravity, and experimentally-produced stimulus rearrangements (e. g., <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms,</b> magnifying lenses, flight simulators, and VR systems). Adaptation is revealed by aftereffects including perceptual disturbances and sensorimotor control disturbances. The purpose of the current study was to compare disturbances in postural control produced by dome and head-mounted virtual environment displays. Individuals recovered from motion sickness and the detrimental effects of exposure to virtual reality on postural control within one hour. Sickness severity and initial decrements in postural equilibrium decreases over days, which suggests that subjects become dual-adapted over time. These findings provide some direction for developing training schedules for VR users that facilitate adaptation, and address safety concerns about aftereffects...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen days {{of active}} head {{movements}} in microgravity appear {{to modify the}} gain and neural adaptation properties of the horizontal semicircular canals in the rhesus monkey. This is the first demonstration of adaptive plasticity in the sensory receptor. <b>Reversing</b> <b>prisms,</b> for example, do not modify the gain of the primary afferent response. Pulse yaw rotation, sinusoidal rotation, and sum of sinusoidal rotation testing during the first day following recovery revealed that the gain of a sample of afferents was significantly greater than the gain derived from afferent responses obtained during pre-flight and control monkey testing. There was no strong evidence of tilt sensitivity in the sample of afferents that we tested either during the pre-flight or control tests or during the first day post-flight. Two irregular afferents tested on postflight day 2 showed changes with tilt but the responses were not systematic. The spontaneous discharge did not change following flight. Mean firing rate and coefficient of variation remained constant during the post flight tests and was near the value measured during pre flight tests. The change in gain of horizontal canal afferents might be adaptive. The animals were required {{to look at a}} target for food. This required active head and eye movements. Active head movements {{have been shown to be}} hypometric and eye movements have been shown to be hypermetric during the first few days of past Cosmos flights (see introduction). It might be that the increased gain in the horizontal semicircular canals permit accurate target acquisition during hypometric head movements by driving the eyes to greater angles for smaller angles of head movement. The mechanism by which the semicircular canals recalibrate (increase their gain) is unknown. The efferent vestibular system is a logical candidate. Horizontal nystagmus during rotation about an earth vertical axis with the horizontal semicircular canals in the plane of rotation produced the same response during postflight day 1 and post-flight day 9. But when the head was pitched down 45 ? the nystagmus slow phase velocity was greater and the duration was about twice during post-flight day 1. Apparently, this response involving the interaction of the horizontal and vertical semicircular canals and the otoliths did not recalibrate during post-flight day 1. The 'DC' bias of the slow phase velocity of the horizontal nystagmus during constant velocity horizontal axis rotation was roughly 4 times for one flight monkey and roughly 2 times for the other on post-flight day 1 compared to post-flight day 9. These results suggest that the otolith mediated response during constant velocity rotation also did not recalibrate on post-flight day 1...|$|R

40|$|Astronauts {{experience}} sensorimotor disturbances {{during the}} initial exposure to microgravity and during the readapation phase following {{a return to a}} gravitational environment. These alterations may lead to disruption in the ability to perform mission critical functions during and after these gravitational transitions. Astronauts show significant inter-subject variation in adaptive capability following gravitational transitions. The way each individual's brain synthesizes the available visual, vestibular and somatosensory information is likely the basis for much of the variation. Identifying the presence of biases in each person's use of information available from these sensorimotor subsystems and relating it to their ability to adapt to a novel locomotor task will allow us to customize a training program designed to enhance sensorimotor adaptability. Eight tests are being used to measure sensorimotor subsystem performance. Three of these use measures of body sway to characterize balance during varying sensorimotor challenges. The effect of vision is assessed by repeating conditions with eyes open and eyes closed. Standing on foam, or on a support surface that pitches to maintain a constant ankle angle provide somatosensory challenges. Information from the vestibular system is isolated when vision is removed and the support surface is compromised, and it is challenged when the tasks are done while the head is in motion. The integration and dominance of visual information is assessed in three additional tests. The Rod & Frame Test measures {{the degree to which a}} subject's perception of the visual vertical is affected by the orientation of a tilted frame in the periphery. Locomotor visual dependence is determined by assessing how much an oscillating virtual visual world affects a treadmill-walking subject. In the third of the visual manipulation tests, subjects walk an obstacle course while wearing up-down <b>reversing</b> <b>prisms.</b> The two remaining tests include direct measures of knee and ankle proprioception and a functional movement assessment that screens for movement restrictions and asymmetries. To assess each subject's locomotor adaptability subjects walk for twenty minutes on a treadmill that oscillates laterally at 0. 3 Hz. Throughout the test metabolic cost provides a measure of exertion and step frequency provides a measure of stability. Additionally, at four points during the perturbation period, reaction time tests are used to probe changes in the amount of mental effort being used to perform the task. As with the adaptive capability observed in astronauts during gravitational transitions, our data shows significant variability between subjects. To aid in the analysis of the results, custom software tools have been developed to enhance in the visualization of the large number of output variables. Preliminary analyses of the data collected to date do not show a strong relationship between adaptability and any single predictor variable. Analysis continues to identify a multifactorial predictor outcome "signature" that do inform us of locomotor adaptability...|$|R

30|$|At {{the same}} time, {{it would be}} {{incorrect}} to characterise the texts that we have discussed as ‘revivalist’, if the term implies a wholesale retrieval of the ancient Hindu dharma and the classical Dharma-śāstras and the smṛti commentaries, and a rejection of all western influences, for they adopted varying stances regarding the restoration of specific dimensions of the Vedic heritages. Even Pandit Sasadhar Tarkachudamani, the champion of traditional Hindu views on marriage during {{the controversy over the}} Age of Consent Bill, was familiar with some aspects of western thought, and his 1883 lectures on dharma were, in fact, criticised for teaching ‘Anglo Vernacular religion’ (Sen 2010 : 133). Therefore, Sen (1993 : 405) points out that ‘Hindu revivalism was a fragmented body of thought partly because the contemporaneity of older ideas and institutions was understood and explained in diverse ways. While at one level there remained a broad consensus {{about the fact that the}} past per se could not be brought back to life, there was evidently no such agreement on what elements within that past could be reinvigorated and to what extent’. The reason why these texts often have a ‘revivalist’ tone is because of the systematic nature in which they envision, interrogate, and re-evaluate both Europe and the Hindu dharma through the lenses of Hindu devotionalism and Advaita Vedānta, with the result that often sweeping conclusions are drawn from their scriptural-theological premises. Thus, for both Mukhopadhyay and Chandranath Basu, the Advaitic basis of the Hindu dharma is presented as the conceptual foundation for the whole gamut of Hindu values, ranging across universality, tolerance, hospitality, peace, harmony, compassion, inner strength, and spirituality, all of which are inflected by an emphasis on social conservativism and karmic gradualism. All the standard western Orientalist and Christian missionary critiques of Hindu polytheism, ritual idolatry, servile weakness, gross immorality, cultural degradation, cosmic pessimism, life-negating apathy, and social insularity are received and interrogated, and occasionally <b>reversed,</b> through dhārmika <b>prisms.</b> While Basu is perhaps the first Bengali author of a book with the term hindutva in its title, Chatterjee too, as we have seen, could employ it to encapsulate the distinctive qualities, modes of thought, and ways of living of the Hindus. Their hindutva, configured in the second half of the nineteenth century, has not yet become entangled with the colonial politics of electoral representation (Thapar 1989), and is primarily a mode of cultural assertiveness which seeks to stem the inflow of cetain kinds of European norms through, among other routes, the writings of the English-educated Bengalis. The values of their hindutva also support the idealised configurations of barṇa as an organic system of interdependent groups, consisting of individuals whose natures (prakṛti) have been karmically structured. These values would continue to be presented in subsequent decades as the core of the Hindu dharma which is posited in distinction to ‘religions’ such as Christianity, Islam, and others (Halbfass 1988 : 334 – 48). Unlike these ‘religions’ which are characterised as sectarian, dogmatic, and intolerant, the Hindu dharma is presented not as a religion but as the deepest significance of religion itself, understood as the quest for the spiritual reality that encompasses all humanity. Hindu Dharmera Śreṣṭhatā, Dharmatattva, Sāmājika Prabandha, and Hindutva can be read as four distinctive moments in the formation, at the dynamic intersections of east and west in the volatile crucibles of colonial Bengal, of the Hindu dharma, whose contested genealogies continue to inform its ongoing receptions, rejections, and reconfigurations.|$|R
