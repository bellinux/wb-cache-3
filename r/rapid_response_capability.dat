He overhauled recruitment methods, and oversaw the rapid deployment of thousands of UN volunteers to crisis zones, where they became the front-line link between relief and aid delivery agencies such as UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP, UNDP, and WHO and suffering war victims, refugees and internal displacees. The effort saved lives during the years 1992–1994 in Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan and other war-torn countries during the inter-ethnic wars that succeeded the Cold War's proxy conflicts. True life stories from the field featured in Volunteers Against Conflict, a book praised by former presidents Nelson Mandela, Mary Robinson, Jimmy Carter, and Nobel Peace Laureate Rigoberta Menchu Tum.

Their ability to operate autonomously of a host vessel makes them well suited to exploration of extreme environments, from the World’s deepest hydrothermal vents to beneath polar ice sheets. They have revolutionized our ability to image the seafloor, providing higher resolution seafloor mapping data than can be achieved from surface vessels, particularly in deep water. This contribution focuses on the major advances in marine geoscience that have resulted from AUV data. The primary applications are i) submarine volcanism and hydrothermal vent studies, ii) mapping and monitoring of low-temperature fluid escape features and chemosynthetic ecosystems, iii) benthic habitat mapping in shallow- and deep-water environments, and iv) mapping of seafloor morphological features (e. g. bedforms generated beneath ice or sediment-gravity flows). A series of new datasets are presented that highlight the growing versatility of AUVs for marine geoscience studies, including i) multi-frequency acoustic imaging of trawling impacts on deep-water coral mounds, iii) collection of high-resolution seafloor photomosaics at abyssal depths, and iii) velocity measurements of active submarine density flows.

40|$|A recent {{advance in}} the {{discipline}} of Structural Engineering is {{in the field of}} smart or intelligent structures. This broad field is attracting much attention as structures exceed historic limitations on span and height. Structures are now required to have service deflections much smaller than previously thought possible to satisfy their unique function. To comply with these increasingly stringent design parameters, engineers have developed structural motion control systems, which are based on passive, active, or adaptive strategies. This thesis evaluates the application of both time-invariant active and adaptive control systems to a single degree of freedom (SDOF) structure. The time-invariant active control algorithm relies on the <b>rapid</b> and low-power <b>response</b> <b>capability</b> available from magnetorheological (MR) fluid dampers, which provides semi-active feedback. The adaptive control algorithm realizes successful and realistic implementation by combining the semi-active damper with an active variable stiffness (AVS) system.

40|$|Objective: This review {{aimed to}} (a) {{examine the effects}} of <b>rapid</b> <b>response</b> on behavioral, cognitive, and weight-gain {{outcomes}} across the eating disorders, (b) determine whether diagnosis, treatment modality, the type of <b>rapid</b> <b>response</b> (changes in disordered eating cognitions or behaviors), or the type of behavioral outcome moderated this effect, and (c) identify factors that predict a <b>rapid</b> <b>response.</b> Method: Thirty-four articles met inclusion criteria from six databases. End of treatment and follow-up outcomes were divided into three categories: Behavioral (binge eating/purging), cognitive (EDE global scores), and weight gain. Average weighted effect sizes(r) were calculated. Results: <b>Rapid</b> <b>response</b> strongly predicted better end of treatment and follow-up cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Moderator analyses showed that the effect size for <b>rapid</b> <b>response</b> on behavioral outcomes was larger when studies included both binge eating and purging (as opposed to just binge eating) as a behavioral outcome. Diagnosis, treatment modality, and the type of <b>rapid</b> <b>response</b> experienced did not moderate the relationship between early response and outcome. The evidence for weight gain was mixed. None of the baseline variables analyzed (eating disorder psychopathology, demographics, BMI, and depression scores) predicted a <b>rapid</b> <b>response.</b> Discussion: As there is a solid evidence base supporting the prognostic importance of <b>rapid</b> <b>response,</b> the focus should shift toward identifying the within-treatment mechanisms that predict a <b>rapid</b> <b>response</b> so that the effectiveness of eating disorder treatment can be improved.

However, most existent literatures in supply networks do not pay much attention to the topological characteristics, which, as revealed by Complex Networks, have close relations with their behaviors in various complex systems. This paper introduces a novel topological structure evolving model of complex supply networks from the perspective of Complex Networks. After investigating supply networks typical structural characteristics and formation mechanisms, Complex Supply Networks Evolving Model (CSNEM) are proposed to mimic these structural characteristics. Then, three statistical properties are investigated. To validate CSNEM, three real supply chain networks are introduced. The results indicate that CSNEM is consistent with the real-world supply networks.
