40|$|Abstract. Iron {{deficiency}} and Plasmodium {{falciparum malaria}} {{are the two}} main causes of anemia in young children in region endemic for this disease. The impact on iron status of prophylactic oral iron supplementation (2 mg/kg/day from two to six months of age) and the duration of this effect were assessed {{in a group of}} 832 Tanzanian infants exposed to P. falciparum malaria. Iron parameters and <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>indices</b> were assessed at 2, 5, 8, and 12 months of age. Infants who received iron supplements had a significantly lower prevalence of iron deficiency (P < 0. 01 at 5 months and P < 0. 001 at 8 and 12 months). <b>Red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>indices</b> (mean corpuscular volume, mean cell hemoglobin, and mean cell hemoglobin concentration) were increased in children receiving iron supplementation and they did not differ between those pro-tected and unprotected against malaria. The prevalence of ferropenia was similar in children protected against malaria and in those who were not protected and did not receive iron supplements (34. 7 % versus 37. 3 % at 12 months of age). We concluded that iron supplementation between the ages of 2 − 6 months improves iron status at least up to 12 months of age. Malaria infection does not contribute to iron deficiency...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} growth, menstrual status, and calcium supplementation on iron status were studied over 4 y in 354 girls in pubertal stage 2 who were premenarcheal at {{baseline}} (x – – SD age: 10. 8 – 0. 8 y). Girls {{were randomly assigned}} to placebo or treatment with 1000 mg Ca/d as calcium citrate malate. Anthropometric characteristics, bone mass, and nutritional status were measured biannually; ferritin was measured annually; and <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>indexes</b> were determined at 4 y. The simultaneous effects of iron intake and menstrual status on serum ferritin, after change in lean body mass (LBM) was controlled for, were evaluated in subjects in the upper and lower quartiles of cumulative iron intake. The average maximal accumulation of LBM (386 g/mo; 95 % CI: 372, 399) occurred 0. 5 y before the onset of menarche. Change in LBM {{was a significant predictor of}} serum ferritin (P < 0. 0001), with a negative influence on iron status (t ratio = 24. 12). The 2 fitted mathematical models representing ferritin concentrations of subjects in the upper and lower quartiles of cumulative iron intake were significantly different (P < 0. 018). The regression line of the ferritin concentration in menstruating girls with high iron intakes had a less negative slope than the line fit to serum ferritin concentrations in girls with low iron intakes (NS). Serum ferritin concentrations at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 y were not significantly different between groups. In addition, there was no significant difference between groups in any of the <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>indexes.</b> In summary, growth spurt and menstrual status had adverse effects on iron stores in adolescent girls with low iron intakes (< 9 mg/d), whereas long-term supplementation with calcium (total intake: < 1500 mg/d) did not affect iron status.

40|$|Background: TfR 2 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in iron regulation during <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> maturation and hepcidin production. Deficiency of iron intake depletes iron storages in the human body, which subsequently result in anemia. Pregnant women are one of the highest risk population that suffers iron deficiency anemia (IDA) because older gestational age has more blood dilution. Some studies have indicated that polymorphism of TfR 2 gene decreases hepcidin levels in blood circulation, leading to iron overload. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between frequency and type polymorphism of exon 4 TfR 2 gene and incidence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women in Boyolali. Methods: This observational analytic study was conducted in four primary health centers in Boyolali regency with cross sectional research design. Purposive sampling was used to recruit pregnant women who full filled research criteria. Anemia or IDA status was determined using Hb levels and <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> <b>indexes</b> with cyanmethemoglobin and routine hematology methods respectively. PCR and sequencing were performed to determine the TfR 2 gene polymorphism. All sequencing data were analyzed by using a Bioedit software version 7. 0, 5. The independent student t test was used to compare average of Hb levels and <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> <b>indexes</b> between anemia and non anemia groups while the odd ratio test was used to analyze correlation between polymorphism and anemia or IDA. Results: A total of 325 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. There are 68 pregnant women with anemia including 13 with IDA and others with non anemia. Four types of TfR 2 gene polymorphism (A 630 T, T 632 C, C 633 G and C 633 T) were observed and T 632 C polymorphism was found in a majority of pregnant women. CC genotype is a risk factor for anemia (p = 0, 973, OR 1, 029) and a protective factor for IDA (p = 0, 389, OR 0, 313). Conclusion: T 632 C is the most common polymorphism of exon 4 TfR 2 gene and has different effects on anemia and IDA. Determination of ferritin, hepcidin and erythropoietin levels is required for confirming whether or not this polymorphism is associated with anemia or IDA.

Among 277 LAM patients, severe disease was associated with hypoxia and elevated <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>indexes</b> that accompanied reduced pulmonary function. Because high red <b>cell</b> <b>indexes</b> could result from hypoxemia-induced erythropoietin (EPO) production, and EPO is a smooth muscle cell mitogen, we investigated effects of EPO in human cells with genetic loss of tuberin function, {{and we found that}} EPO increased proliferation of human TSC 2 −/−, but not of TSC 2 +/−, cells. A discrete population of cells grown from explanted lungs was characterized by the presence of EPO receptor and loss of heterozygosity for TSC 2, consistent with EPO involvement. In LAM cells from lung nodules, EPO was localized to the extracellular matrix, supporting evidence for activation of an EPO-driven signaling pathway. Although the high red cell mass of LAM patients could be related to advanced disease, we propose that EPO, synthesized in response to episodic hypoxia, may increase disease progression by enhancing the proliferation of LAM cells...|$|R

RBC indices revealed both a significant decrease of RBC count and an increase of MCV in the runner group. Hb, PCV, MCH and MCHC were not significantly different. This aspect may be caused by an increase of the erythropoietic activity compensating for a mild haemolysis. Such events could induce an increase of the number of young RBC with a mean enhancement of some glycolytic substrates, such as 2, 3 -DPG. The failure to find and increase of P 50 could be attributed to a greater than normal oxygen extraction by an improvement of mithocondria activity...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite large populations {{carrying}} traits for thalassemia {{in countries}} implementing universal iron fortification, {{there are few}} data on the absorption and utilization of iron in these persons. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether iron absorption or utilization (or both) in women heterozygous for beta-thalassemia, alpha-thalassemia 1, or hemoglobin E (HbE) differed from that in control subjects and compound HbE/beta-thalassemia heterozygotes. DESIGN: In Thai women (n = 103), <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>indexes,</b> iron status, non-transferrin-bound iron, and growth differentiation factor 15 were measured, and body iron was calculated. Fractional iron absorption was measured from meals fortified with isotopically labeled ((57) Fe) Fe sulfate, and iron utilization {{was measured by the}} infusion of ((58) Fe) Fe citrate. RESULTS: Iron utilization was approximately 15 % lower in alpha-thalassemia 1 or beta-thalassemia heterozygotes than in controls. When corrected for differences in serum ferritin, absorption was significantly higher in the alpha- and beta-thalassemia groups, but not the HbE heterozygotes, than in controls. HbE/beta-thalassemia compound heterozygotes had lower iron utilization and higher iron absorption and body iron than did controls. Nontransferrin-bound iron and growth differentiation factor 15 were higher in the compound heterozygotes, but not in the other groups, than in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: In alpha-thalassemia 1 and beta-thalassemia heterozygotes with ineffective erythropoesis, dietary iron absorption is not adequately down-regulated, despite a modest increase in body iron stores. In populations with a high prevalence of these traits, a program of iron fortification could include monitoring for possible iron excess and for iron deficiency...|$|R

Twenty-five obese patients consumed for 2 wk a VLED containing 70 g protein after a 1 -wk period during which total daily energy intake was progressively reduced to 1. 26 MJ. Serum iron fell sharply by approximately equal to 50 % (P < 0. 0001), and despite a small decrease in total-iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation decreased from 30 +/- 11 % to 18 +/- 5 % (P < 0. 0001). Serum ferritin did not change significantly but serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), an indicator of iron deficiency, increased progressively from 4630 +/- 1110 to 6070 +/- 1390 micrograms/L (P < 0. 0001). Changes in sTfR correlated inversely with prior changes in serum iron. Changes in iron metabolism did not translate into changes in erythropoiesis or red <b>cell</b> <b>indexes,</b> but the white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count decreased from 7. 3 +/- 1. 6 to 6. 2 +/- 1. 9 x 10 (9) /L (P < 0. 002).

40|$|We {{examined}} whether hemorheology and {{platelet function}} are affected in essential hypertensives (EHTs) of the World Health Organization stage I when complicated with metabolic syndrome (Mets). In 156 untreated EHTs, blood viscosity and platelet surface markers were determined. Blood viscosity was significantly elevated in 54 subjects with Mets compared with 102 subjects without Mets. Hematocrit and plasma viscosity {{increased in the}} group with Mets, although <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> rigidity <b>index</b> “k” did not differ between groups. As a whole group, blood viscosity correlated positively with hematocrit and plasma viscosity. Additionally, plasma viscosity correlated positively with plasma leptin, triglyceride, homeostasis model assessment index, C-reactive protein, and plasma fibrinogen, but negatively with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In contrast, no differences were seen in platelet surface markers between groups. In conclusion, EHTs of the early stage complicated with Mets are characterized by increased blood viscosity due to hemoconcentration and increased plasma viscosity...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> aggregation and the ratio of hematocrit to blood viscosity (HVR), an index of the oxygen transport potential of blood, might consid-erably modulate blood flow dynamics in the microcirculation. It thus seems likely that these factors could {{play a role in}} sickle cell disease. Design and Methods We compared <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> aggregation characteristics, <b>blood</b> viscosity and HVR at dif-ferent shear rates between sickle cell anemia and sickle cell hemoglobin C disease (SCC) patients, sickle cell trait carriers (AS) and control individuals (AA). Results Blood viscosity determined at high shear rate was lower in sickle cell anemia (n= 21) than in AA (n= 52), AS (n= 33) or SCC (n= 21), and was markedly increased in both SCC and AS. Despite differences in blood viscosity, both sickle cell anemia and SCC had similar low HVR values compared to both AA and AS. Sickle cell anemia (n= 21) and SCC (n= 19) sub-jects had a lower <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> aggregation <b>index</b> and longer time for <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> aggre-gates formation than AA (n= 16) and AS (n= 15), and a 2 to 3 fold greater shear rate require...|$|R

40|$|Background: Malaria is {{a widely}} {{prevalent}} parasitic disease caused by the Plasmodium species. The parasite mainly infects the erythrocytes and causes various hematological abnormalities like anemia, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Aim: To evaluate and compare the hematological parameters between vivax and falciparum malaria. Settings and design: A cross sectional, prospective study in the hospital laboratory. Materials and methods: Blood samples from 889 febrile patients were tested for malaria by the rapid malaria antigen detection test and peripheral blood smear study. The hematological investigations included study of platelet counts, white and red blood cell counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin and <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>indices</b> using an automated cell counter. Results: Out of the 889 patients screened, 81 patients tested positive for malaria. Fifty four patients (66. 67 %) had P. vivax infection, while 22 (27. 16 %) were infected with P. falciparum and five (6. 17 %) had mixed infection. Thrombocytopenia was seen in 95. 06 % patients. All five patients who had mixed infection, 96. 29 % of vivax malarial patients and 90. 90 % of patients with P. falciparum had thrombocytopenia. Anemia was seen in 34 cases (41. 97 %).

40|$|Abstract: Haematological indices provide {{information}} on various aspects of fish health when exposed to environmental contaminants. We evaluated the effects of cadmium, methyl mercury (MeHg), and Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) on the haematological parameters of a tropical fish. One hundred and eighty (180) mature individuals of the freshwater fish Rastrienobola argentea were exposed to dietary subchronic doses of Cd (4 µg g g 1 CaCl 2), MeHg (0. 1 CH 3 HgCl µg g 1) and PCBs (0. 2 µg g 1). After 45 days, blood was sampled from exposed and control groups to evaluate haematological effects of contaminants on erythrocytes, total leukocytes and differential leukocytes counts, haematocrit, heemoglobin concentration, <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>indices,</b> mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), and {{mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration}} (MCHC). Results showed that red blood cells counts, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, leukocytes, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells counts, significantly (P 0. 05) increase between control groups with the Cd, MeHg and PCB tested groups. The present study shows that changes in haematological parameters were detectable at sub-chronic exposure to contaminants, but their application in field biomonitoring using R. argentea will need more detailed studies...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} lentiviral {{delivery}} of human γ-globin gene under β-globin regulatory control elements in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) results in sufficient postnatal fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression to correct {{sickle cell anemia}} (SCA) in the Berkeley “humanized” sickle mouse. Upon de-escalating the amount of transduced HSCs in transplant recipients, using reduced-intensity conditioning and varying gene transfer efficiency and vector copy number, we assessed critical parameters needed for correction. A systematic quantification of functional and hematologic <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> (RBC) <b>indices,</b> organ pathology, and life span {{was used to determine}} the minimal amount of HbF, F cells, HbF/F-cell, and gene-modified HSCs required for correcting the sickle phenotype. We show that long-term amelioration of disease occurred (1) when HbF exceeded 10 %, F cells constituted two-thirds of the circulating RBCs, and HbF/F cell was one-third of the total hemoglobin in sickle RBCs; and (2) when approximately 20 % gene-modified HSCs repopulated the marrow. Moreover, we show a novel model using reduced-intensity conditioning to determine genetically corrected HSC threshold that corrects a hematopoietic disease. These studies provide a strong preclinical model for {{what it would take to}} genetically correct SCA and are a foundation for the use of this vector in a human clinical trial...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. General {{parameters}} of <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and immunity (including minor lymphocyte subpopulations) were determined in 196 healthy children from Chita City and 5 districts of the Chita Region, preceded by preselection of the subjects, using multi-step health evaluation schedules. When analyzing data on <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> erythrocyte color <b>index</b> {{was found to}} become stable {{by the age of}} 3 years, followed by stabilization of blood hemoglobin content by the age of 7 years. RBC indices become stable at later ages [...] Basic leukocyte populations reach stability by 11 years, except for the numbers of neutrophilic granulocytes (by 15 years). All the T-cell subpopulations including the minor ones (NKT, HLA-DR+) continue to mature until 18 years, except for T-helpers, that become constant in their numbers after 7 years. Serum IgG levels stabilize by the age of 7 years; IgA and IgM amounts – by 18 years. (Med. Immunol., 2011, vol. 13, N 2 - 3, pp 261 - 266)  </p...|$|R
