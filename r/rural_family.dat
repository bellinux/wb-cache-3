40|$|Abstract Background Catastrophic health {{expenditure}} (CHE) puts a heavy disease burden on patients’ families, aggravating income-related inequality. In {{an attempt to}} reduce the financial risks of <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> incurring CHE, China began the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) on a trial basis in 2003 and has raised the reimbursement rates continuously since then. Based on statistical data about <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> in sample area of Jiangsu province, this study measures the incidence of CHE, analyzes socioeconomic inequality related to CHE, and explores the influences of the NCMS on the incidence of CHE. Methods Statistical data were acquired from two surveys about rural health care, one conducted in 2009 and one conducted in 2010. In 2009, 1424 <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> were analyzed; in 2010, 1796 <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> were analyzed. An index of CHE is created to enable {{the evaluation of the}} associated financial risks. The concentration index and concentration curve are used to measure the income-related inequality involved in CHE. Multiple logistic regression is utilized to explore the factors that influence the incidence of CHE. Results The incidence of CHE decreased from 13. 62 % in 2009 to 7. 74 % in 2010. The concentration index of CHE was changed from − 0. 298 (2009) to − 0. 323 (2010). Compared with <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> in which all members were covered by the NCMS, <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> in which some members were not covered by the NCMS had a lower incidence of CHE: The odds ratio is 0. 65 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 43 to 1. 00. For <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> in which all members were covered by the NCMS, the increase in reimbursement rates is correlated to the decline in the incidence of CHE if other influencing factors were controlled: The odds ratio is 0. 48 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 36 to 0. 64. Conclusions Between 2009 and 2010, the incidence rate of CHE in the sampled area decreased sharply, CHE was more concentrated among least wealthy and inequality increased during study period. As of 2010, the poorest <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> still had high risk of experiencing CHE. For <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> in which all members are covered by the NCMS, the rise in reimbursement rates reduces the probability of experiencing CHE...|$|R

25|$|The Vietnam War hastened the {{modernisation}} and Westernisation of Thai society. The American {{presence and}} {{the exposure to}} Western culture that came with it {{had an effect on}} almost every aspect of Thai life. Before the late 1960s, full access to Western culture was limited to a highly educated elite in society, but the Vietnam War brought the outside world face to face with large segments of the Thai society as never before. With US dollars pumping up the economy, the service, transportation, and construction industries grew phenomenally as did drug abuse and prostitution. The traditional <b>rural</b> <b>family</b> unit was broken down as more and more rural Thais moved to the city to find new jobs. This led to a clash of cultures as Thais were exposed to Western ideas about fashion, music, values, and moral standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} to the Corporation (a forerunner of the present Brighton & Hove City Council) was completed in January 1933, after which the building was {{opened to the public}} as a museum of Edwardian life, showing how a wealthy <b>rural</b> <b>family</b> would have lived and entertained at that time. As stipulated by Ellen Thomas-Stanford, Henry Roberts became Curator of Preston Manor and he and his family took up residence in the west wing. In 1936 the Preston Road frontage was set back and the main road widened. At this time the lodge, stables and gardener's cottage were demolished and the grounds to the north and west were laid out with grass and shrubs. In 1939 the Macquoid Bequest was installed in what had been Sir Charles's library and is now known as the Macquoid Room. During the Second World War Preston Manor became an Air Raid Precaution report centre, control centre and a base for a mobile First Aid post. In November 1945 HRH Princess Elizabeth came to tea at Preston Manor at the invitation of the Mayor of Brighton. It was her first public occasion. On 20 July 1947 a funeral tea was held in the drawing room for Christiana (Lily) Macdonald, with the Manor closed to the public that afternoon in respect. In 1951 Henry Roberts died and his daughter Margery became honorary curator of Preston Manor, a position she held until 1970. The Victorian servants' quarters in the semi-basement were restored and opened to the public in 1988. The walled garden was restored in the 1990s with money from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The way Preston Manor is presented to the public today reflects the way of life of a rich gentry family and their servants in the period before and after the First World War.|$|E

Method: Qualitative study guided by Symbolic Interactionism as a theoretical framework and Grounded Theory as a methodological framework. Six <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> (18 participants) undergoing the experience of having a relative with cancer participated in the interview. Results: Constant comparative analysis of data allowed the elaboration of an explanatory substantive theory, defined by the main category Caregiving to support the family world, which represents the family's symbolic actions and strategies to reconcile care for the patient and care for family life. Final considerations: Throughout the experience, <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> seek to preserve the interconnected symbolic elements that provide support for the family world: family unit, land, work and care...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to survey income {{distribution}} among the agricultural and non-agricultural <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> in Ghoochan town, Khorasan province. Data was collected by filling out questionnaires, and having interviews with 265 <b>rural</b> <b>families,</b> selected by stratified random sampling. And the obtained data was analysed through Gini ratios, comparison of the quintiles, Lourenz curve and income ratios. The results showed that the income distribution among the non-agricultural families was higher than that among agricultural families. The Gini ratio for agricultural families was 0. 57 and for non-agricultural families was 0. 45. The lowest Gini ratio was among the families employed for both agricultural and non-agricultural activities (GR= 0. 38). Therefore, it seems that income inequalities can be improved by making <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> in Ghoochan work in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors...|$|R

But soon her parents found that her abilities were far beyond her years. Constantia was tutored in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, English, and French by her local vicar, but was mostly self-educated. According to one editor she was [...] "a most excellent scholar, not only in Greek and Roman literature, but in history, divinity, philosophy, and mathematics: and what makes her character the more remarkable is, that she died so early as the age of 27, and that she acquired this great learning merely by the force of her own genius, and continual application."

Data were from 174 <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> participating in three waves of data collection in <b>Rural</b> <b>Families</b> Speak. χ 2 and multiple logistic regression were utilized. Results revealed only one-third of mothers moved toward economic self-sufficiency over three years. Maternal education, employment status, and weekly work hours were associated with improved economic well-being. Compared to single-parent families, unmarried-couple and married-couple families had increased odds of improving economically. In an analysis of all mothers with partners, married or unmarried, martial status was not significant in economic improvement. Findings suggest the role of marriage in welfare reform for <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> should be reconsidered.

This study applies the Dependency Theory for users who actively seeking information at the expense of their own family resilience towards challenges of the Internet. As such, this study tries to explore the differences between the social media influence on the rural and urban Malay families. The objectives of the study are (1) to compare the social media used for communicating with family members and friends between the rural and urban families; (2) to compare the influence of social media on the rural and urban families; and (3) to differentiate the influence of social media on the <b>rural</b> and urban <b>families</b> on family resilience towards challenges of the Internet. A total of 800 respondents, representing families were surveyed, using the questionnaire for data collection. The results indicate a marked digital divide between the <b>rural</b> and urban <b>families</b> where the <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> use it for e-commerce while the urban families use more of the Internet for chatting, reading online newspaper and other materials while. The <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> use fewer types of the social media than the urban families. The social media influence the <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> positively while the urban families are affected both positively and negatively. As a whole, the <b>rural</b> <b>families</b> are more resilient than the urban families.
