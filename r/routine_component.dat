2500|$|Returning {{all but one}} all but one top {{player and}} adding some {{military}} veterans and players from the freshman team, Gray's 1946–47 Texas team was thought to have a legitimate chance of winning the SWC championship, along with Arkansas, SMU, and defending SWC champion Baylor. Future Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame member and five-time NBA champion guard Slater Martin and forward John Hargis returned to the team to join guards Roy Cox and Al Madsen, who had returned the previous season. All four men, along with three other of that year's letterwinners, {{had served in the}} war. Martin, Cox, and Madsen were dubbed the [...] "Mighty Mice." [...] Though the return of Hargis helped, the Longhorns were again a team not possessed of great size, but they did possess great speed and scoring ability. The Longhorns began the season with four blowout wins, the last and closest coming by a score of 46–34 against the Continental Air Liners of Denver. The game against the Air Liners was the last game Texas would play against a semi-professional team, once a <b>routine</b> <b>component</b> of the nonconference schedule, until the 1955–56 season. Not content to play only overmatched local teams {{for the remainder of the}} nonconference slate, Gray wanted to harden his team for the season ahead, and the Longhorns next embarked upon a 10-day, 4,000-mile train trip to face Canisius in Buffalo, Long Island in New York City, and DePaul in Chicago. Texas defeated Canisius 52–46 before traveling to New York for the most-anticipated contest of the trip, the game in Madison Square Garden against Clair Bee's LIU Blackbirds, who were averaging 90 points per game and had recently defeated defending national champion Oklahoma A In front of a strongly pro-LIU crowd of 18,453, the Longhorns upset the Blackbirds, 47–46. Texas next traveled to Chicago to face the DePaul Blue Demons of Ray Meyer, whose team had won the NIT two years earlier, and won the final game of their road trip in a rout, 61–43. Before returning to Austin, the 7–0 Longhorns stopped in Oklahoma City to play in the All-College Tournament. Texas dominated the Missouri Tigers 65–46 before falling to Oklahoma A, the two-time defending national champion, in the semifinal by a single point, 40–39. The Longhorns defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in the third-place game the following night by a score of 62–50. Texas was only occasionally challenged during the remainder of the regular season, winning its three remaining nonconference games by 29, 24, and 12 points and seven of its first 10 conference games by 12 or more points (and the first 10 SWC contests by an average of 16.6 points). The Longhorns entered the final weekend of the conference season needing only one win in two games against the second-place Razorbacks. In front of more than 8,000 fans at Gregory Gym, Arkansas led for most of the first game before Slater Martin led a late surge to secure the win and the outright conference championship for Texas, 49–44. The pressure to win the SWC championship thus relieved, the Longhorns easily dispatched the Razorbacks the following night, 66–46, to finish the regular season 24–1 overall and 12–0 in SWC play for their first undefeated conference season since Doc Stewart's 1923–24 team finished 23–0. Texas traveled to Kansas City to face Wyoming in the first game of the NCAA Tournament. Four players from each team had been on the 1943 teams that faced off in the Final Four on Wyoming's way to the NCAA championship. Texas trailed until the final minutes of the second matchup, and Martin's long shot with 35 seconds remaining provided the margin of victory, with the Longhorns winning 42–40 to advance to the Final Four for the second time, where they would face Oklahoma. Despite having defeated the Sooners earlier in the season by 12 points, the Longhorns trailed 53–49 in the final minute of their second contest. Texas scored five points to take a 54–53 lead with seconds remaining, but OU scored on a 40-foot shot as time expired to deal the Longhorns a heartbreaking defeat, 55–54. Texas returned to Madison Square Garden to play the City College of New York in the national third-place game prior to the NCAA championship game between OU and Holy Cross (won by the Crusaders, 58–47). Texas defeated CCNY 54–50 to finish the season with 26 wins and two last-second, one-point defeats.|$|E

30|$|In 2003, Autor, Levy and Murnane (ALM) {{proposed}} a task-based framework to investigate how {{the adoption of}} computer technology changes job tasks and employer demand for human skills. This approach focuses on determining the tasks that computers are best suited to perform and whether computer-performed tasks serve as complements or substitutes for human job skills (Autor et al. 2003, p.  1280). The authors affirm that computers substitute for cognitive and manual tasks that have large <b>routine</b> <b>components.</b> At the same time, computers also complement complex non-routine problem-solving tasks and complex communications tasks. Conversely, low-skilled, manual, non-routine jobs are not directly affected by computerization. Therefore, their hypothesis is that computerization leads {{to a decline in}} the demand for middle-education workers and leads to an increase in the relative demand for both the most educated and least educated workers. Studies for the U.S., Great Britain and certain European countries suggest that the relative demand trends for skilled workers have been polarized since the 1990 s (Autor et al. 2006, 2008; Goos and Manning 2007; Spitz-Oener 2006; Dustmann et al. 2009 and Goos et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|Several {{compelling}} aruguments {{have been}} advanced {{in support of}} expanding the use of "behavioral teratology" evaluations as <b>routine</b> <b>components</b> of toxicologic screening procedures.

Within the context, several research strategies for behavioral teratology studies are concisely posed and evaluated. These include: (1) clinical hypothesis testing, where particular effect(s) of a given agent are evaluated based on hypotheses derived from clinical or epidemiological observations; (2) comprehensive screening approaches, where multifaceted, long-term longitudinal neurobehavioral evaluations are employed to assess whether any {{of a large number}} of possible deletarious effects are exerted by an agent and at what threshold exposure levels; (3) alternative screening heuristics, by which adequate assessments of neurobehavioral toxicity of various agents may be accomplished without completion of more exhaustive, but also more expensive and time-consuming comprehensive screening protocols...|$|R

The flavor substance test was done by addition of standard samples. The flavor constituents in cigarette smoke condensate were separated by simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE) and capillary gas chromatography (GC). The flavor constituents were identified and determined quantitatively by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC. The flavors studied were methylpyrazine, furaldehyde, 5 -methylfuraldehyde, benzaldehyde, 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, trimethylpyrazine, 2 -acetylpyridine, phenylacetaldehyde, acetophenone, linalool, b-phenylethyl alcohol, isophorone, oxoisophorone, benzyl acetate, menthol, ethyl octanoate, b-damascenone, b-damascone, geranylacetone and b-ionone.

The current paper provides an empirical example {{of the use of}} the engineering-inspired multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) to build a remotely delivered responsive parenting intervention to prevent obesity among children of low-income mothers with and without depressive symptoms. Methods Participants were 107 mothers with (n[*]=[*] 45) and without (n[*]=[*] 62) depressive symptoms who had a child aged 12 to 42  months participating in the Women, Infants and Children program. Participants were randomized to one of sixteen experimental conditions using a factorial design that included a combination of the following eight remotely delivered intervention components: responsive feeding curriculum (given to all participants), parenting curriculum, portion size guidance, obesogenic risk assessment, personalized feedback on mealtime routines, feeding curriculum counseling, goal setting, mobile messaging, and social support. This design enabled efficient identification of components with low feasibility and acceptability. Results Completion rates were high (85 %) and did not statistically differ by depressive symptoms. However, mothers with depressive symptoms who received obesogenic risk assessment and personalized feedback on mealtime <b>routines</b> <b>components</b> had lower completion rates than mothers without depressive symptoms. All intervention components were feasible to implement except the social support component. Regardless of experimental condition, most participants reported that the program increased their awareness of what, when, and how to feed their children. Conclusions MOST provided an efficient way to assess the feasibility of components prior to testing them with a fully powered experiment. This framework helped identify potentially challenging combinations of remotely delivered intervention components.

40|$|Low {{implementation}} of cost-effective health technologies results in inefficient {{use of resources}} in a health system. Despite this, estimates of implementation or diffusion are not <b>routine</b> <b>components</b> of analyses performed within health technology assessments (HTA), potentially {{due to a lack}} of a) methods to obtain diffusion estimates and b) understanding of the impact of diffusion estimates on health economic outcomes. This thesis contributes a) a method to estimate health technology diffusion prior to HTA and b) a modelling framework that assesses the potential impact of diffusion estimates on cost-effectiveness and expected value of information and implementation (EVII) analysis using modelling, qualitative and elicitation methods. These were illustrated in a preterm birth (PTB) screening case study. The modelling framework included extensions to an existing EVII model to make it dynamic and allow research to affect implementation; and the development of a dynamic cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA) model that reflects price changes precipitated by diffusion and hence, the reimbursement decision. Drivers of diffusion were identified for the case study technology, aiding the design of implementation strategies. The developed method for predicting diffusion requires transformation of elicited expert beliefs to inform an existing diffusion model. Application in the PTB screening model showed that the dynamic EVII method can 1.) help more accurately assess the losses the health care payer incurs when there is decision uncertainty and low implementation and 2.) provide more realistic assessments of implementation strategies and evidence generation schemes. The applied DCEA model showed that changes in price triggered by technology diffusion significantly affect cost-effectiveness results. The method for predicting health technology diffusion and the EVII and DCEA frameworks are foreseen to be relevant in the context of HTAs of medical devices, diagnostics and drugs; particularly when there is low implementation or there is potential for future price changes conditional on diffusion...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess whether (and to what extent) physicians' perceptions of genomic medicine as an innovation influence their likelihood of adopting this innovation into primary care. The study's sample consists of 400 primary care physicians in Texas and employs a survey design. Based on Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations Theory, the perceived characteristics of genomic medicine - Relative Advantage, Compatibility, Complexity, Trialability, and Observability - are the study's independent/predictor variables. Likelihood of PCPs Adopting Genomic Medicine is the dependent variable. The nature of the social system (private or group practice) is examined as a possible moderator variable. The study suggests that Texas PCPs who are likely to adopt genomic medicine strongly perceive its clinical uses (such as genetic testing for carrier status or susceptibility to common diseases, testing an embryo for genetic disorders before it is implanted, and supplementing a family history) to be highly advantageous. For half of the PCPs, genetic services such as genetic counseling and genetic testing are not compatible with current practice. Perceived complexity of the innovation is the strongest predictor of likelihood of PCPs adopting genomic medicine. Many PCPs find it difficult to stay updated on genomic medicine and locate genetic services. Although Texas PCPs feel genomic medicine can be gradually incorporated into primary care practice, most are not presently observing their colleagues adopting genomic medicine or assisting their patients to make decisions regarding genetic services. Future efforts to advance the use of genomic medicine in primary care will require more emphasis on genetics in medical school curriculum and continuing education programs. Links with specialists trained in genetic counseling and health education will be essential to translate relevant information to patients and families...|$|R
