40|$|In the {{presented}} thesis we {{deal with}} the generalized linear models framework in a claims reserving problem. Claims reserving in non-life insurance is firstly described and the considered class of models is introduced. Consequently, this branch of stochastic modelling is implemented in the reserving setup. For computation of the risk associated with claims reserving, we need a predictive distribution of future liabilities in order to evaluate risk measures such as Va- lue at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk. Since datasets in non-life insurance commonly consist of a small number of observations and estimation of predictive distributions can be complicated, we adopt a bootstrap method for this purpose. Model fitting, simulations and consequent measuring of the <b>reserving</b> <b>risk</b> are performed within the use of real-life data. Based on this, an analysis of fitted models and their comparison together with graphical outputs is included. ...|$|E
40|$|Schedule P is {{a complex}} section of the Annual Statement, {{demanding}} much expertise to complete and to understand. The cross checks performed by the NAIC compare the Schedule P figures within its various parts, with other pages of the Annual Statement, and with Schedule P data from the preceding year. The NAIC uses Schedule P Summary data for three of the Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS') tests, and it uses the detailed line of business data to determine the <b>reserving</b> <b>risk</b> and the written premium risk charges in the risk-based capital formula. Investment analysts and rating agencies use the schedule to measure the adequacy of a company's held reserves and thereby estimate its financial strength and expected market value. The IRS uses the schedule to determine loss reserve discounts, anticipated salvage and subrogation, and the discounts for anticipated salvage and subrogation. Actuaries and accountants need {{a thorough understanding of}} this Schedule, both to complete it for their own company or client and to evaluate the performance of peer companies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we want to motivate and analyse a wide family of reserving models, called linear {{stochastic}} reserving methods (LSRMs). The main idea behind them {{is the assumption that}} the (conditionally) expected changes of claim properties during a development period are proportional to exposures which depend linearly on the past. This means the discussion about the choice of reserving methods can be based on heuristic reasons about exposures driving the claims development, which in our opinion is much better than a pure philosophic approach. Moreover, the assumptions of LSRMs do not include the independence of accident periods. We will see that many common reserving methods, like the Chain-Ladder-Method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson-Method and the Complementary-Loss-Ratio-Method, can be interpreted in this way. But using the LSRM framework you can do more. For instance you can couple different triangles via exposures. This leads to reserving methods which look at a whole bundle of triangles at once and use the information of all triangles in order to estimate the future development of each of them. We will present unbiased estimators for the expected ultimate and estimators for the mean squared error of prediction, which may {{become an integral part of}} IFRS 4. Moreover, we will look at the one period solvency <b>reserving</b> <b>risk,</b> which already is an important part of Solvency II, and present a corresponding estimator. Finally we will present two examples that illustrate some features of LSRM...|$|E

40|$|Motivation. The {{paper will}} {{address the issue of}} {{estimating}} the uncertainty in the run off of individual large claims in insurance portfolios, which is often the primary source of uncertainty in the <b>reserving</b> <b>risk</b> component of insurance risk. Method. The paper begins by reviewing current methodologies for estimating the uncertainty in loss reserves. Methods until now have focused on aggregate modeling of gross or net of reinsurance loss reserves, and no direct connection between the distribution of gross and net reserves. The paper develops a non-parametric framework to simulate the distribution of ultimate position of large claims, both reported and large IBNR claims. The method samples the development of individual claims based on the historic development of large claims, incorporating information at an aggregate level surrounding reserving strength. The model also predicts when claims will setde, and the dining of claim payments. Results. The method developed is not intended to replace existing aggregate modeling, but is an improvement to traditional methods which estimate the variability of gross of reinsurance loss reserves, and is a useful tool to allow for reinsurance recoveries more accurately. By indix 4 dually projecting the ultimate position of large claims, we can explicidy allow for policy or contract limits. Further, we can apply any reinsurance program structure to the gross results, including allowance for aggregate deductibles, incomplete placements, retrocessions to captive reinsurers, indexation clauses, and different treat 3, attachment rules (ie Losses Occurring During vs Risks Attaching). The paper then shows how the variability of attritional claims can be estimated using traditional stochastic methods, and the attritional and large results can be combined to estimate the variability of the aggregate portfolio of loss reserves...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the study for this {{dissertation}} {{is the relationship between}} pricing and reserving risks for property-casualty insurance companies. Since the risk characteristics of insurers differ based on their structure, objectives and incentives, segmenting the insurers into subgroups would allow for a better understanding of group-specific risks. Based on this approach to analyzing insurer financial risks, we find that, in a given accident year, the pricing and reserving errors are positively correlated, especially in long-tailed lines of business. Large insurers, stock insurers, and multi-state insurers, in general, exhibit a strong correlation between accident-year price and reserve errors. However, only size of insurers appears to be a factor that influences the interaction between price changes and the calendar year loss reserve adjustments. Furthermore, we find that the pricing risk and <b>reserving</b> <b>risk</b> are marginally more homogenous within a market segment when size, type and number of states are employed as criteria for market segmentation, hence insurance regulators should consider the refined market segments for the RBC formula. The empirical results also indicate that, in general, Chain-Ladder reserving method likely contributes to loss reserve errors when there is a change in the loss development pattern and the magnitude of the errors is worse for large insurers. Finally, we find that our proposed measurement method for the product diversification benefit provides support for the notion that the diversification benefit on the incurred losses increases with the number of lines in the portfolio. Yet, the diminishing returns tend to decrease the diversification benefit on the incurred losses for insurers that write the business in more than six of the selected lines. To the contrary, our proposed measure does not provide clear evidence that writing business in many product lines increases the product diversification benefit with respect to adverse loss development. We do find that the diversification benefit for both incurred losses and loss development is higher for larger insurers. Hence, for risk management and regulatory purposes, a stronger case can be made for considering firm size than product diversification...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five papers, presented in Chapters A-E, on topics {{in life and}} disability insurance. It is naturally divided into two parts, where papers A and B discuss disability rates estimation based on historical claims data, and papers C-E discuss claims <b>reserving,</b> <b>risk</b> management and insurer solvency. In Paper A, disability inception and recovery probabilities are modelled in a generalized linear models (GLM) framework. For prediction of future disability rates, it is customary to combine GLMs with time series forecasting techniques into a two-step method involving parameter estimation from historical data and subsequent calibration of a time series model. This approach may in fact lead to both conceptual and numerical problems since any time trend components of the model are incoherently treated as both model parameters and realizations of a stochastic process. In Paper B, we suggest that this general two-step approach can be improved in the following way: First, we assume a stochastic process form for the time trend component. The corresponding transition densities are then incorporated into the likelihood, and the model parameters are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In Papers C and D, we consider a large portfolio of life or disability annuity policies. The policies {{are assumed to be}} independent conditional on an external stochastic process representing the economic-demographic environment. Using the Conditional Law of Large Numbers (CLLN), we establish the connection between claims reserving and risk aggregation for large portfolios. Moreover, we show how statistical multi-factor intensity models can be approximated by one-factor models, which allows for computing reserves and capital requirements efficiently. Paper C focuses on claims reserving and ultimate risk, whereas the focus of Paper D is on the one-year risks associated with the Solvency II directive. In Paper E, we consider claims reserving for life insurance policies with reserve-dependent payments driven by multi-state Markov chains. The associated prospective reserve is formulated as a recursive utility function using the framework of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE). We show that the prospective reserve satisfies a nonlinear Thiele equation for Markovian BSDEs when the driver is a deterministic function of the reserve and the underlying Markov chain. Aggregation of prospective reserves for large and homogeneous insurance portfolios is considered through mean-field approximations. We show that the corresponding prospective reserve satisfies a BSDE of mean-field type and derive the associated nonlinear Thiele equation. QC 20151012 </p...|$|E

In this context, this work aims at estimating the undertaking specific parameters (USP) for <b>reserve</b> <b>risk,</b> for Motor Vehicle Liability and Motor Others. In a long term perspective, alternative models were applied to the estimation of the ultimate <b>reserve</b> <b>risk.</b> For Solvency Capital Requirements, a short-term perspective, it is necessary to estimate the one-year <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> factors, which was done by applying the three different methods presented and allowed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} the parameter risk {{in the context of}} internal modelling of the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> under Solvency II. We discuss two opposed perspectives on parameter uncertainty and point out that standard methods of classical reserving focusing on the estimation error of claims reserves are in general not appropriate to model the impact of parameter uncertainty upon the actual risk of economic losses from the undertakings's perspective. Referring to the requirements of Solvency II we assess methods to model parameter uncertainty for the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> by comparing the probability of solvency actually attained when modelling the solvency risk capital requirement based on the respective method to the required confidence level. Using the simple example of a normal model we show that the bootstrapping approach is not appropriate to model parameter uncertainty according to this criterion.

Following the recent legislative changes, the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> has been redefined from ultimate claim horizon to a one-year risk horizon.

40|$|Stochastic {{models for}} {{outstanding}} claims valuation have been recently developed {{with the aim}} to obtain either a variability coefficient or the probability distribution of the reserve, useful {{for the assessment of}} the <b>Reserve</b> <b>Risk</b> capital requirement. Different methodologies, like Bootstrapping or Bayesian methods, allow to determine the prediction error and the claims reserve distribution under some assumptions based on the data figured out in the run-off triangle. The International Actuarial Association (IAA) proposed a different way to analyse out-standing claim reserve, focused on a paper by Meyers, Klinker and Lalonde where the overall reserve of a single LoB (without any distinction among different accident years) is described as a compound mixed poisson process, by a similar approach used for aggregate amount of claims when premium risk is to be estimated. In the present paper we extend this approach assuming that each single cell of {{the lower part of the}} run-off triangle follows a Compound Poisson Process (either Pure or Mixed). This assumption leads, under independence constraint, to obtain quite easily the exact moments of the reserve distribution only through the knowledge of the characteristics of the two main random variables (number and claim size of future payments). Furthermore, Monte Carlo methods allow to simulate outstanding claims distributions for each accident year, for both the overall reserve until complete run-off and the next calendar year only (in case of a one-year time horizon as prescribed in Solvency II). Model s parameters are calibrated from observed data and through a deterministic model (in the present paper an average cost method is used, namely Fisher-Lange method) based on the separate estimate of number of claims to be paid and future average costs for each cell of the lower triangle to be estimated. Finally, we analyze the one-year <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> in the perspective adopted by Solvency II.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple actuarial {{rationale}} for the non-life economic capital formula proposed for Solvency II in QIS 3. On the statistical side we improve on the methodology in QIS 3 by defining company specific estimators for all quantities of interest including premium <b>risk</b> and <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> volatilities as well as correlation coefficients at the granularity level of lines of business. We develop the non-life Solvency II economic capital formula applying both the value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) risk measures under a log-normal distribution of the portfolio combined ratio, which {{is defined as the}} ratio of incurred claims inclusive “run-off ” to the premium and reserve volume. We determine confidence levels under which both methods yield approximately identical practical results. Moreover, we point out that economic capital modeling should neither be restricted to a log-normal distribution assumption nor to the VaR and CVaR risk measures and refer to the actuarial literature for various extensions on this. The portfolio combined ratio is decomposed in a weighted sum of the premium risk ratio and the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> ratio as suggested in QIS 3. Based on the basic portfolio risk ratio model summarized in the Appendix, we propose simple weighted estimators for all volatilities and correlation coefficients of interest.

These new requirements will come in force since 1 st January 2014 and will be by far more risk-sensitive than Solvency I capital requirements (firstly introduced in the Seventies and only slightly modified in 2002), thus enabling a better coverage of the real risks run by any insurer.
