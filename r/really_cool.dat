40|$|Abstract. The cooling cores of {{clusters}} of galaxies {{are among the}} brightest thermal X-ray line sources in the universe. High resolution X-ray spectra would allow individual line fluxes to be measured. The fluxes of low ionization X-ray lines in cooling flows should be directly proportional to the cooling rate at relatively cool temperatures, and {{could be used to}} determine whether large amounts of gas are <b>really</b> <b>cooling</b> out of the X-ray band (below ∼ 10 6 K). By comparing the fluxes of many X-ray lines, we could determine the amounts of gas at different temperatures and densities. This would allow one to test the idea that cooling flows are highly inhomogeneous, as required to explain their surface brightness profiles. High resolution X-ray spectra can be used to determine velocities in the hot gas in cooling flows. If the gas is homogeneous, significant inflow velocities are expected. However, if the gas is as inhomogeneous as we currently believe, the inflow velocities are likely to be rather low (vr ∼ < 30 km s− 1). The hot gas in cooling flows is probably strongly turbulent, and turbulence is likely to be more important than either inflow or thermal broadening in determining the shapes of lines. Most of the central galaxies in cooling flows host radio sources, and it appears that the radio lobes are expanding against, displacing, and compressing th...|$|R
