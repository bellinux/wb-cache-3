The particles may accelerate with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> but the center of mass of the system will not accelerate.

5|$|The non-sliding {{logarithmic}} scale, Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E
5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12Å wide. The width of the major groove means that {{the edges of the}} bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|E

Earlier, we have described new phenomena in this model in one spatial dimension, not found in analogous systems without taxis: reflecting and self-splitting waves.

25|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{the notion}} of an inertial frame. For example, an observer confined in a free-falling lift will assert that he himself is a valid inertial frame, even if he is accelerating under gravity, so long as he has no knowledge about anything outside the lift. So, strictly speaking, inertial frame is a relative concept. With this in mind, we can define inertial frames collectively as a set of frames which are stationary or moving at constant velocity with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> so that a single inertial frame is defined as an element of this set.|$|E

25|$|In any {{analysis}} of spacetime, evidence of gravitation requires that one observe the relative accelerations of two bodies or two separated particles. In Fig.5‑1, two separated particles, free-falling in the gravitational {{field of the}} Earth, exhibit tidal accelerations due to local inhomogeneities in the gravitational field such that each particle follows a different path through spacetime. The tidal accelerations that these particles exhibit with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> do not require forces for their explanation. Rather, Einstein described {{them in terms of}} the geometry of spacetime, i.e. the curvature of spacetime. These tidal accelerations are strictly local.
