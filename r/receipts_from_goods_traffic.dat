50|$|Residents in Walthamstow {{complained that}} {{vibrations}} <b>from</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> {{on the line}} were causing damage to their houses.|$|R
50|$|There was a siding {{provided}} here <b>from</b> 1921 for <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Serving a {{population}} of approximately 195,000, with over 675 beds, it brings lots of traffic through Bodelwyddan and benefits <b>from</b> Bodelwyddan's <b>good</b> <b>traffic</b> links and proximity to the A55 Road.|$|R
5000|$|Traffic volume had {{increased}} {{to the point}} where, in 1874, passenger services from Lyttelton had been separated <b>from</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b> By this time, the station was considered inadequate for requirements. The general manager for the provincial railways commented in August 1874 that “The present station is generally inconvenient and much too small and cramped for the present passenger traffic. It must be enlarged {{if it is to}} remain where it is … As the building is old, enlargement would mean constructing anew.” ...|$|R
50|$|Profits for {{the half}} {{year to the}} end of 1864 were £53 11s 1d, with <b>receipts</b> <b>from</b> {{passengers}} and <b>goods</b> about equal. It was obvious that the warning by the GWR in 1859 that income would barely cover costs, was true.|$|R
50|$|The Neukölln - Mittenwalde line, in contrast, profited <b>from</b> {{increased}} <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> {{after the}} West Berlin power company, Bewag, built {{a power plant}} at Rudow. Within the city, its passenger stations were demolished, while outside the city, in the GDR, the rails were taken up but the station buildings remained.|$|R
25|$|The early 1880s began {{badly for}} the GNR {{for a number}} of reasons: Coal strikes and poor harvests reduced income <b>from</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b> Floods forced the {{complete}} closure of the Spalding to Bourne line from 9 October 1880 until 1 February 1881, this was a Midland & Eastern line worked by the GNR, and the GNR found themselves paying the lease on a line they could derive no revenue from; and worst of all, Sutton Bridge Docks opened on 14 May 1881, into which the GNR had invested £55,000, but within a few days the docks began to subside due to being built on unstable ground. The engineers could find no remedy and the investment was written off.|$|R
50|$|Freight {{traffic from}} a nearby quarry {{continued}} to run until 1978 when the contract for the traffic expired. <b>From</b> then onwards, <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was solely for railway civil engineering use, with the final train running in 1986.|$|R
500|$|The {{station was}} heavily {{used during the}} {{construction}} of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild's estate at Waddesdon Manor in the 1870s and 1880s. [...] The brickworks at Brill sent 25,000 bricks per week along the Brill Tramway, and 7,000tons (7,100t) of Bath Stone were shipped from Corsham. Aside <b>from</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> associated with the building of Waddesdon Manor, the station was little used other than for shipping milk from nearby farms to Aylesbury and London. Inconveniently sited away from any nearby towns and villages, and with the far more frequently served Quainton Road and Waddesdon Manor stations within easy walking distance, the station saw very little passenger use. In 1932, {{the last year of}} private operation, Waddesdon Road station saw only 281 passengers and made only £4 (about £ in [...] ) in passenger receipts over the entire year.|$|R
50|$|The {{availability}} of surplus Class 37 and 47 locomotives {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s displaced the Class 26s from passenger workings and <b>from</b> most <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> north of Inverness. However, the type continued to operate goods trains throughout the whole of Scotland, taking over duties previously carried out by Class 25 and 27 locomotives. Most of the class were refurbished in the 1980s to extend their lives, being chosen in preference to the newer Class 25 and 27 due to the better reliability of the Class 26s' lower powered engines.|$|R
50|$|On 8 August 1852 the Maryport and Carlisle Railway {{opened a}} west-to-north curve from Forks Junction to Citadel, {{enabling}} {{direct access to}} Carlisle without reversal; <b>from</b> this time <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> also used this new connection. The new approach crossed the Canal line on the level; the M&CR were required to appoint a person to make signals at the passage of trains.|$|R
50|$|The track layout at {{the station}} was {{gradually}} increased from a single track, to a double track layout up to 1961, and finally a three road arrangement which persisted {{to the end of}} regular traffic, albeit in a truncated layout <b>from</b> 1973. Regular <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> ceased in 1972, though fuel oil was transported to a facility at the pier until 1983. Regular passenger services ceased in 1987.|$|R
50|$|The GWR was nationalised into British Railways in 1948 and <b>from</b> 1964, when <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was {{withdrawn}} on 6 July, {{the line was}} run down until it was eventually closed on 4 January 1971. The line was reopened as a heritage railway operated by the West Somerset Railway on 28 March 1976. The signal box was moved to Minehead in 1977 but the goods yard is now home to the railway’s civil engineering team.|$|R
50|$|By 1869 the Caledonian and the NBR {{were once}} again at loggerheads; the main issue now was the Waverley Route, and the {{proportion}} of traffic attributable to it. It emerged that the Caledonian had secretly concluded a pact with the London and North Western Railway in 1867; the arrangement excluded the North British <b>from</b> nearly all <b>goods</b> <b>traffic,</b> and its revelation damaged good feeling: indeed the Caledonian were doing what they could to make the Waverley Route the source of the difficulties. By late 1869 the revenue sharing agreement was a dead letter.|$|R
40|$|Adaptation in {{the face}} of {{performance}} degradation is the hallmark of well-behaved network traffic. For sufficiently robust applications, we propose distinguishing <b>good</b> <b>from</b> bad <b>traffic</b> {{on the basis of the}} response to artificial performance impairments. We explain the basic requirements for our scheme, and show how it could be generically applied at different levels in the protocol stack. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{third rail}} {{electrification}} was at 630v dc, and power {{was taken from}} the 33kV public supply through three new substations. Because of the low headroom in the Ryde tunnel, no British Railways electric train stock was suitable, and 43 second hand tube cars were purchased <b>from</b> London Transport. <b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> would not be conveyed. 19 of the UCC and MCCW cars dated from 1927 - 1934, 14 Cammell-Laird cars were from 1927 and 10 MCWF cars were from 1925. All were from the Piccadilly and Northern lines, although some had run on the Northern City Line. They were altered to have running rail traction current return instead of fourth rail. They were made up into four-car sets (Motor - trailer - trailer - motor) and three-car sets (control trailer - trailer - motor).|$|R
25|$|Before the {{highways}} were upgraded {{to the extent}} that they permitted trans-Canada commercial shipping by road within Canada, and did not require trucking companies to dip below the 49th parallel to traverse the Great Lakes, and prior to the emergence of the airlines as a preferred mode of passenger travel and freight carriage, the railways were, as Sir John A. Macdonald’s National Policy had envisaged, at first the sole and for long the principal conduit linking Canada together. In Regina the warehouses were commercial depots for the <b>receipt</b> of <b>goods</b> <b>from</b> eastern Canada and the USA. With the eclipse of the railroads by {{the highways}} the Warehouse District lost its original raison d’être and for a time the warehouses seemed in danger of becoming white elephants.|$|R
50|$|It was {{determined}} that the volume of <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was insufficient to warrant retention of facilities at Kopuaranga, and with alternatives available at Opaki and Mauriceville, closure to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was recommended. The Department consulted with the local branch of Federated Farmers in April 1966 who were agreeable to the proposal. Kopuaranga was consequently closed to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> in wagon lots from 1 August 1966.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was {{important}} with a flour mill, and china clay and stone traffic, and a tarmacadam plant. The china clay works near the station closed in 2008/09. Public <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> ceased on 1 June 1964.|$|R
5000|$|Because of its [...] "isolation", Lyttelton was {{for many}} years {{operated}} as a railway port. The wharves had tracks running on to them from the Lyttelton yards, and cargo was loaded on and off ships at the wharves directly to and <b>from</b> <b>goods</b> trains. Much of the <b>goods</b> <b>traffic,</b> especially inwards general cargo, was only consigned as far as Christchurch. This often {{had the effect of}} causing serious congestion at the Christchurch station goods yard, with wagons frequently being used for storage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was {{significant}} with a banana packing factory (operated by Geest, and served by trains from Southampton and Avonmouth docks), and Air Ministry and Royal Engineers depots were rail served. Ordinary <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was withdrawn in 1973.|$|R
5000|$|From opening, {{the line}} carried {{a mix of}} <b>goods</b> and {{passenger}} <b>traffic.</b> Superphosphate and livestock were the main goods carried, and superphosphate in particular was responsible for keeping the line operational long past the closure of similar branch lines. Initial passenger traffic was locomotive hauled 'mixed' trains of passenger and goods cars until the introduction of CPH railmotors from 1926. Two return daily railmotor services were provided allowing day return travel in either direction. Steam power was replaced with diesel from 1961. <b>From</b> the mid-1970s, <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> began to decline in competition with road transport. Passenger traffic ceased in 1974, and by the 1980s freight traffic had dwindled to such unprofitable levels that the last train operated in 1985. The last passenger train to operate on the line was hauled by steam locomotives 3001 and 3102 on 25 August 1985 with both being turned on 's turntable. The final train out of Crookwell was in September 1985, A 48 Class locomotive hauling the last freight wagons from Crookwell yard. The points connecting the line to the Main South line at Goulburn were removed in September 1989 and the line listed as [...] "out of use". The branchline has not been formally closed.|$|R
25|$|Thorverton {{closed to}} {{passenger}} traffic {{with the rest}} of the Exe Valley line on 7 October 1963. <b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> ceased on 4 May 1964. Both the station and the stationmaster's house remain in use as houses, the former extended using stone <b>from</b> the demolished <b>goods</b> shed.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} open to {{passengers}} on 20 August 1856 and to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> on 1 January 1857. The station closed in 1952 but passenger services on the line continued until 4 July 1966 and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> continued until 1981.|$|R
50|$|Eight sidings are {{provided}} for <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was ceased on 4 January 1965.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was {{ended on}} 27 June 1960.|$|R
5000|$|Arms trafficking, {{explosives}} smuggling {{and hazardous}} <b>goods</b> <b>trafficking.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} World War I (1914-1918) {{resulted}} in a huge upsurge in <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> at Carlisle, and the dispersed goods depots of the individual companies resulted in heavy traffic in trip workings between them. Some beneficial co-ordination was achieved by a (<b>goods</b> <b>traffic)</b> Joint Control Committee from 1916.|$|R
500|$|Dunster {{railway station}} {{is on the}} West Somerset Heritage Railway, though the station is over {{a mile from the}} village. The station was opened on 16 July 1874 by the Minehead Railway. The line was {{operated}} by the Bristol and Exeter Railway which was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1876. The Minehead Railway was itself absorbed into the GWR in 1897. A small signal box stood at the [...] end of the platform, but was demolished in 1926 when this was extended. In 1934 a new signal box {{at the opposite end of}} the station, brought second-hand from Maerdy, was put into use when the line from Dunster to [...] was doubled in 1934. The GWR was nationalised into British Railways in 1948 and <b>from</b> 1964, when <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was withdrawn on 6 July, the line was run down until it was eventually closed on 4 January 1971. The line was reopened as a heritage railway operated by the West Somerset Railway on 28 March 1976. The signal box was moved to Minehead in 1977 but the goods yard is now home to the railway’s civil engineering team. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|R

50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{which always}} had a greater {{significance}} on the railway than passenger traffic, was largely sustained by the timber industry of the region.
