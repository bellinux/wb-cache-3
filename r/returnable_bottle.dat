50|$|Jolly Cola {{maintained}} {{this market}} share until the 1980s.There are several explanations for Jolly Cola’s success. However, {{the most important}} one is that ‘Dansk Coladrik’ could make use of the brewing industry’s comprehensive network, distributing system and knowledge of the Danish market. Another reason is that it was only possible to buy Coca-Cola in Copenhagen and a few larger cities in Jutland {{in the early years of}} the hectic ‘cola war’. Hence, it was not until the 1960s that it was possible to buy Coca-Cola nationwide. This ensured that Jolly Cola was a well-established product in many places when Coca-Cola finally ventured into the market. Thirdly, it was due to great marketing. Dansk Coladrik had tapped their cola in regular soft drink bottles. This made it easier for the retail industry to administer the <b>returnable</b> <b>bottle</b> system, but it also made it possible to launch Jolly Cola as “The Big Cola” (a slogan that not by coincidence resembled Pepsi’s success-slogan about the big 12 ounce bottle from the 1930s USA). A Danish soft drink bottle contained exactly 25 cl, whereas the characteristic ‘chubby’ Coca-Cola bottle only contained 19 cl. The argument about value for your money was important in a time where a soft drink was considered to be a luxury product. (The story of Jolly Cola is based on the work of Klaus Petersen and Niels Arne Sørensen from the Institute of History, Culture and Society).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{described}} new effective {{glass bottle}} fracture process for glass recycling by underwater shockwave. The high-speed fracture behaviors of glass bottles by explosive energy were discussed. In the proposed technique, the washing {{process can be}} skipped because the bottle crushing process execute in water. As a result, the recycling cost can be decreased. In order to clarify the behaviors of glass bottle fracture, the bottle was painted by 5 colors. The crushing experiment was executed under four explosive conditions. The influence of various explosive conditions on the cullet sizes were calcified by using painted bottle. Introduction. The glass bottles are widely used as the container for water, alcoholic drink and medicine. Many of these glass bottles were reused as <b>returnable</b> <b>bottle</b> or recycled as the raw material of glass bottle, which is called ‘Cullet’. ‘Cullet ’ is the small crushing fragments[1].

40|$|Bottle Co. was unique. An {{outgrowth}} of the Ohio Bottle Co., {{it was the first}} of the large conglomerates, setting a tone that would be followed two decades later by giants like the Knox Glass Bottle Co. and the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. American Bottle set the standard for small-mouth bottle production in the beer and soda bottle field and forced competitors to invent or adopt semiautomatic machines (and eventually gob feeders to make them fully automatic) to try to keep up. The company pioneered the use of date codes to establish the year a bottle was produced, but their markings were so cryptic that many of them have been misidentified, misunderstood, or ignored by researchers for decades. Ironically, most of the marked bottles associated with American Bottle are the result of hand – not machine – production, and the company refrained from using date codes on machine-made bottles until 1916. The American Bottle Co. initiated the placement of date codes on the heels of bottles, a device for tracking the number of round trips that a soda or beer bottle makes. Because these bottles were intended to be returnable, the number of trips between the bottling plant and the consumer affects the profit margin. As financial planning became more important to the beverage industry, attention to the number of round trips became more important. By the mid- 1920 s, most <b>returnable</b> <b>bottle</b> manufacturers used date codes; by the 1950 s, it was a standard throughout the industry. American Bottle initiated the practice in 1906...|$|E

Though the Dublin plant is not the only Dr Pepper bottler to have used cane sugar instead of HFCS as a sweetener, the Dublin plant was the most well-known plant to not make the change. Dr Pepper containing cane sugar carried the Imperial Sugar logo and thus the variant became popularly known as [...] "Dublin" [...] Dr Pepper.In addition to Dr Pepper products, the Dublin plant also produced Sun Crest Orange, Triple XXX, and NuGrape in 9-10 ounce <b>returnable</b> <b>bottles.</b> To purchase drinks in the 9-10 ounce <b>returnable</b> <b>bottles,</b> the buyer must first have provided their own crate of empty bottles in order to make an exchange.|$|R
