Although Pearson, at Knight's insistence, sat for the {{portrait}} holding a rifle, the finished painting shows her holding a <b>respirator.</b> As WAAF personal were not allowed to carry arms on duty, Knight had to paint over the rifle.|$|E
5|$|At the Greene farm, Hershel {{reveals that}} Carl needs major surgery to live, {{and that he}} will need a <b>respirator.</b> Otis {{suggests}} that they might find supplies at a nearby high school—where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a trailer—although the place is likely overrun with walkers. Otis and Shane decide to get the supplies, while Maggie retrieves Lori from the group and brings her to the Greene home. Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic; Rick believes there is no cure, while Hershel has faith that there could be one.|$|E
5|$|The British Armed Forces use CS gas {{annually}} {{to test their}} CBRN equipment. During initial training they introduce recruits to CS gas by introducing them into a small enclosed space known as a <b>Respirator</b> Testing Facility (RTF) and igniting chemical tablets to induce CS production. After recruits have carried out their CBRN drills, they must remove their respirators {{so that they are}} exposed to the CS for up to 20 seconds to experience its effects and become confident their respirators work.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: {{to compare}} the {{behavior}} of perioral muscles in nasal, oral and oronasal <b>respirators.</b> Methods: a sample consisting of three distinct groups, equally subdivided into Nasal, Oral and Oronasal <b>Respirators.</b> The behavior of the orbicular muscle of the mouth (upper part) and mentual one was measured by surface electromyography at rest, swallowing and labial isometry. Results: in all situations investigated, the orbicular muscle of the mouth (upper part) and mental muscle showed {{no significant difference in}} relation to Root Means Square, that is, average electrical activity between Oral and Oronasal <b>Respirators.</b> The data showed a significant difference in In Nasal <b>Respirators,</b> as compared to the other groups. Conclusion: similarity was seen in the comparison of perioral muscles behavior between oral and oronasal <b>respirators,</b> however, a significant difference in relation to nasal <b>respirators...</b>|$|R

5|$|The fire, {{caused by}} the {{malfunction}} of a backup solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between 90 seconds and 14 minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} <b>respirator</b> masks initially worn were broken. Fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} modules were immovable. The fire occurred during a crew rotation, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three. Access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats was blocked, which would have prevented escape by half of the crew. A similar incident had occurred on an earlier Mir expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for only a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of <b>respirator,</b> which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} <b>respirator,</b> nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E
50|$|Comparison of {{the results}} of tests of various types of <b>respirators</b> in the {{laboratories}} and in the workplaces showed that laboratory tests do not allow to properly assess the real effectiveness of <b>respirators</b> (even if they are applied without interruption).

5|$|Diving at Wookey resumed {{in early}} June 1946 when Balcombe used his {{homemade}} <b>respirator</b> and waterproof suit {{to explore the}} region between the resurgence and first chamber, {{as well as the}} underground course of the river between the third and first chambers. During these dives, the Romano-British remains were found and archaeological work dominated the early dives in the cave. The large ninth chamber was first entered on 24 April 1948 by Balcombe and Don Coase. Using this as an advance dive base, the 10th and then 11th chambers were discovered. The way on, however, was too deep for divers breathing pure oxygen from a closed-circuit rebreather. The cave claimed its first life on 9 April 1949 when Gordon Marriott lost his life returning from the ninth chamber. Another fatality was to occur in 1981 when Keith Potter was drowned on a routine dive further upstream.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an {{intrusive}} {{public works}} inspector (Carter Jahncke) tests {{the air quality}} at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee that everything is fine. The next day, however, Gee goes upstairs and finds a team wearing protective <b>respirator</b> suits removing hazardous asbestos from the wall. Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) for not informing the detectives about the work, and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine and the car he plans to build. Crosetti feigns disinterest, but the next day presents Lewis with a rear-view mirror as a gift.|$|E
5|$|Several {{accidents}} occurred which {{threatened the}} station's safety, {{such as the}} glancing collision between Kristall and Soyuz TM-17 during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents occurred during EO-23. The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO-22 to EO-23, when a malfunction occurred in the backup Vika system, a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG). The Vika malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut Jerry Linenger insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} <b>respirator</b> masks initially worn were broken. Some of the fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} newer modules were immovable.|$|E

5|$|Maria never {{approached}} any land areas while {{a tropical}} system, but tracked toward northern Europe after becoming an extratropical storm on September 10. The first land effects were felt in Iceland on September 12, where tropical storm-force winds were reported. The strongest winds {{were recorded in}} Vestmannaeyjar where sustained winds in excess of 67mph (107km/h) were reported {{as well as a}} minimum pressure of 979 mbar. The storm then brushed the northernmost part of Scotland, with no reported damage there either. The extratropical Maria merged with another system and this storm made landfall in Norway. This storm brought tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall to that country, and caused flooding and several mudslides, particularly around Bergen, the most important of which occurred in Hatlestad. One person was killed immediately, at least nine others were injured, and numerous homes were destroyed. Marine interests were also affected, as a large number of ferries were docked in the Baltic Sea. On September 18, a woman died of injuries. Her daughter died on February 7, 2006, after having been kept alive in a <b>respirator</b> since the accident.|$|E
25|$|Employees use a <b>respirator</b> several times. The average {{protection}} {{factor of}} the <b>respirator</b> {{in one of}} the workers (who always used a <b>respirator</b> in a timely and accurately), proved to be 26 times greater than that of all other workers.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} categories: the air-purifying <b>respirator,</b> which forces {{contaminated}} air through a filtering element, and the air-supplied <b>respirator</b> in which fresh air is delivered alternatively. Different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.|$|E
2500|$|... (2000) The authors {{studied the}} {{filtering}} half-mask <b>respirators.</b> The workers used different models: part of <b>respirators</b> had forced supply of {{air from the}} cleaning unit, and a part was the usual negative pressure half masks. The results showed that if the workers use <b>respirators</b> intermittently, their efficiency are low, and significantly lower than expected: In the first type <b>respirators</b> 85-91% values of protection factors were lower than expected Assigned PF = 50; and {{the second type of}} RPE provide protection factor in 82-89% of cases lower than the expected APF = 10.|$|R
25|$|In some cases, {{there was}} no {{information}} on the effectiveness for <b>respirators</b> of specific design (type) in the workplace. This {{is due to the}} fact that the measurement of workplace PF is very difficult, time consuming, and expensive work, which was carried out not very often. For these types of <b>respirators</b> experts used the results of WPF measurements of other types of <b>respirators,</b> which are similar. For example, the effectiveness of the Supplied Air <b>Respirators</b> (SARs, with hose) was considered similar to the efficiency of Powered Air Purifying <b>Respirators</b> (PAPRs), if they have the same facepieces and the same air supply mode. Finally, in the absence of this information, specialists could use the results of Simulated WPF measurements; or estimates of competent experts.|$|R

25|$|Initially, the {{effectiveness}} of <b>respirators</b> were evaluated with their tests in the laboratories. But detection of cases of excessive exposure of harmful agents on those workers who properly used and maintained approved <b>respirators</b> (with high efficiency filters), has prompted experts to change their opinions.

2500|$|... (2000) The authors {{studied the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>respirators</b> (they measured the styrene concentrations outside the mask, and under the mask); and the real effectiveness of the protection of workers (styrene concentration in the urine). It turned out that {{the effectiveness of}} the protection of workers (with impermanent usage of <b>respirators)</b> is significantly lower than the effectiveness of <b>respirators</b> themselves: the people's exposure decreased by only 5-60%, and exceeded the limit.|$|R
25|$|Measurement of {{workplace}} protection factors surprisingly revealed the low efficiency of some designs of <b>respirators,</b> and that results {{have led to}} a sharp tightening of the requirements for application limits for <b>respirators</b> of such designs.|$|R

For this purpose, two thermistor (one in the facepiece, {{the other on the}} belt) were used; over-heating PTC with expired air was a sign of wearing a mask. Because convenience of the <b>respirators</b> affect on the timeliness of its usage, scientists have studied the opinion of the miners on the use of <b>respirators.</b> A detailed report was published before the publication of the article.|$|R
