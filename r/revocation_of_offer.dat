50|$|<b>Revocation</b> <b>of</b> an <b>offer</b> must be {{received}} and understood by the offeree before it comes into effect. An acceptance by the offeree before they receive notice <b>of</b> the <b>revocation</b> will be considered valid.|$|R
50|$|The {{posting rule}} {{does not apply}} to option {{contracts}} or irrevocable offers where acceptance is still effective only upon receipt. This is because the offeree no longer needs protection against subsequently mailed <b>revocations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>offer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{posting rule}} {{applies only to}} acceptance. Other {{contractual}} letters (such as one revoking the offer) do not take effect until the letter is delivered, as in Stevenson, Jacques & Co v McLean (1880) 5 QBD 346. The implication {{of this is that}} it is possible for a letter of acceptance to be posted after a letter <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>offer</b> has been posted but before it is delivered, and acceptance will be complete {{at the time that the}} letter of acceptance was posted—the offeror's revocation would be inoperative.|$|R
40|$|Background. There are no internationally {{recognized}} guidelines regarding HIV for employees on cruise ships. The {{aim of the}} study was to survey and compare current practices for crews in the cruise industry regarding HIV testing and prevention. Material and methods. Medical representatives from cruise companies were invited to com-plete a questionnaire on their company’s practices regarding HIV-related issues. Results. Fifteen of 18 invited representatives completed the questionnaire on behalf of 24 com-panies with a total of 155 ships. All 8 companies with a medical department had a written HIV policy, versus 4 of 16 companies that handled medical crew issues through independent medi-cal consultant services. Thirteen companies required pre-sea HIV testing, 12 had a written HIV policy regarding HIV testing and prevention, and 18 had free condoms for the crew. A positive HIV test would result in <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the employment <b>offer</b> from 5 companies and in another 6 companies establish HIV as a pre-existing condition. Eight companies required HIV+ seafarers to demonstrate stability at regular intervals as a condition for sailing. Conclus ions. Cruise companies have different practices regarding HIV in crew.

50|$|The {{provision}} {{allowing for}} <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> naturalisation {{as a consequence}} of residence abroad has been criticised as creating two classes of Liberian citizens and for reducing the capabilities of naturalised Liberians to pursue employment and educational opportunities abroad. The provision for the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> a minor's naturalisation following the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the father's naturalisation has been criticised as unfair to the child.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{naturalisation}} awarded to children {{on the basis of}} a father's naturalisation, the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the father's naturalisation entails the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the child's naturalisation unless the child has reached age 21.|$|R
