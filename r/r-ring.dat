40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to study the Ext ring {{associated}} to a Koszul <b>R-ring</b> and to use it to provide further characterisations of the former. As such, for R being a semisimple ring and A a graded Koszul <b>R-ring,</b> we will prove that there is an isomorphism of DG rings between E(A) :=Ext^∙_A(R,R) and ^∗-grT(A) ≃E(^∗-gr A). Also, the Ext <b>R-ring</b> will prove to be isomorphic to the shriek ring of the left graded dual of A, namely E(A) ≃ (^∗-gr A) ^!. As an application, these isomorphisms will be studied in the context of incidence R-(co) rings for Koszul posets. Thus, we will obtain a description and method of computing the shriek ring for ^c[P], the incidence R-coring of a Koszul poset. Another application is provided for monoid rings associated to submonoids of Z^n. Comment: 9 pages, 2 figures; changed title, added a Lemma, changed a proo...|$|E
40|$|Let R be a semisimple ring. A pair (A,C) {{is called}} almost-Koszul if A is a {{connected}} graded <b>R-ring</b> and C is a compatible connected graded R-coring. To an almost-Koszul pair one associates three chain complexes and three cochain complexes such {{that one of}} them is exact if and only if the others are so. In this situation (A,C) is said to be Koszul. One proves that a connected <b>R-ring</b> A is Koszul if and only if there is a connected R-coring C such that (A,C) is Koszul. This result allows us to investigate the Hochschild (co) homology of Koszul rings. We apply our method to show that the twisted tensor product of two Koszul rings is Koszul. More examples and applications of Koszul pairs, including a generalization of Fröberg Theorem, are discussed in {{the last part of the}} paper.

40|$|The {{nucleolar}} {{channel system}} (NCS) is a well-established ultrastructural {{hallmark of the}} postovulation endometrium. Its transient presence {{has been associated with}} human fertility. Nevertheless, the biogenesis, composition, and function of these intranuclear membrane cisternae are unknown. Membrane systems with a striking ultrastructural resemblance to the NCS, termed R-rings, are induced in nuclei of tissue culture cells by overexpression of the central repeat domain of the nucleolar protein Nopp 140. Here we provide a first molecular characterization of the NCS and compare the biogenesis of these two enigmatic organelles. Like the R-rings, the NCS consists of endoplasmic reticulum harboring the marker glucose- 6 -phosphatase. <b>R-ring</b> formation initiates at the nuclear envelope, apparently by a calcium-mediated Nopp 140 -membrane interaction, as supported by the calcium-binding ability of Nopp 140, the inhibition of <b>R-ring</b> formation by calcium chelators, and the concentration of Nopp 140 and complexed calcium in R-rings. Although biogenesis of the NCS may initiate similarly, the reduced presence of complexed calcium and Nopp 140 suggests the involvement of additional factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{minor axes}} of, and the normals to, the {{polarization}} ellipses that surround singular lines of linear polarization in three dimensional optical ellipse fields are {{shown to be}} organized into Möbius strips and into structures we call “rippled rings ” (<b>r-rings).</b> The Möbius strips have two full twists, and can be either right- or left-handed. The major axes of the surrounding ellipses generate cone-like structures. Three orthogonal projections {{that give rise to}} 15 indices are used to characterize the different structures These indices, if independent, could generate 839, 808 geometrically and topologically distinct lines; selection rules are presented that reduce the number of lines to 8, 248, some 5, 562 of which have been observed in a computer simulation. Statistical probabilities are presented for the most important index combinations in random fields. It is argued that it is presently feasible to perform experimental measurements of the Möbius strips, <b>r-rings,</b> and cones described here theoretically. 2 I...|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} bicategory {{in which the}} 0 -cells are the entwinings over {{variable}} rings. The 1 -cells are triples of a bimodule and two maps of bimodules which satisfy an additional hexagon, two pentagons and two (co) unit triangles; and the 2 -cells are the maps of bimodules satisfying two simple compatibilities. The operation of getting the “composed coring ” from a given entwining, is promoted here to a canonical morphism of bicategories from a bicategory of entwinings to the Street’s bicategory of corings. 1. Algebras, coalgebras, corings 1. 1. The results in this manuscript hold {{in one of the}} following two generalities. In the first case we consider entwinings (R, A, C, ψ: C ⊗R A → A ⊗R C) between R-algebras A and R-coalgebras C over (variable) commutative unital ring R ([4]); in the latter case the entwinings are between <b>R-rings</b> A (monoids in R − Bimod) and R-corings C (comonoids in R − Bimod) over (variable) not necessarily commutative ring R.

However, they do not exhaust all differential operators. In a general setting, Schwartz distributions on sections of compact support of a vector bundle Y over a smooth manifold X are considered. They constitute a C∞(X) -module. We follow a generic algebraic notion of differential operators on a module over a commutative <b>R-ring</b> C∞(X). Such a differential operator on Schwartz distributions is {{proved to be the}} transpose of a differential operator on sections of Y → X if and only if it is continuous...|$|E

Assume {{given the}} {{structure}} of a C-category on the category RM of left R-modules; that is, the monoidal category C is assumed to act on the category RM by a coherently associative bifunctor ♢:C×RM→RM. We assume that this bifunctor is right exact in its right argument. In this setup we show that every algebra A (respectively coalgebra C) in C gives rise to an <b>R-ring</b> A♢R (respectively an R-coring C♢R) whose modules (respectively comodules) are the A-modules (respectively C-comodules) within the category RM. We show that this very general scheme for constructing (co) associative (co) rings gives conceptual explanations for the double of a quasi-Hopf algebra as well as certain doubles of Hopf algebras in braided categories, each time avoiding ad hoc computations showing associativity...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} issue of bidder ring {{formation}} in single and multi-unit Vickrey auctions. We address this issue in a bargaining game set up under the assumption that valuation of bidders is commonly known only amongst themselves. In the single unit case, we show that the equilibrium coalition structure can only be an order preserving <b>r-ring,</b> that includes the winner and the top (r- 1) losers. In the multiple units case, we specify sufficient conditions for formation of an interesting class of equilibrium coalition structures, which we call single winner ring with free riding, where exactly one winner colludes with all the losers and generates maximum possible bidders' surplus, and, depending on the protocol, the remaining winners free ride either by staying alone or by colluding in pairs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Jets of modules over a {{commutative}} ring {{are well}} known {{to make up the}} representative objects of linear differential operators on these modules. In noncommutative geometry, jets of modules provide the representative objects only of a certain class of first order differential operators. As a consequence, a generalization of the standard Lagrangian formalism on smooth manifolds to noncommutative spaces is problematic. Let K be a commutative ring and A a commutative K-ring. Let P and Q be A-modules and J r (P) the module of r-order jets of P. There is a A-module isomorphism Hom A(J r (P), Q) = Diff r(P, Q), (1) where Diff r(P, Q) is the module of r-order Q-valued linear differential operators on an A-module P [4]. It follows that the jet module J r (P) is the representative object of the functor Q → Diff r(P, Q). In particular, let A = C ∞ (X) be the <b>R-ring</b> of smooth real functions on a smooth manifold X. If P is a projective C ∞ (X) -module of finite rank, it is isomorphic to the module Y (X) of global sections of some vector bundle Y → X. In this case, J r (P) is the module of global sections of the r-order jet bundle J r Y → X of Y → X. Furthermore, let Y → X b...|$|E
40|$|Let R be a ring (associative, with 1), and let R > {{denote the}} power-series <b>R-ring</b> in two non-commuting, R-centralizing variables, a and b. Let A be an R-subring of R > and B be an R-subring of R>, and let α denote the natural map A _R B → R >. This article {{describes}} some situations where α is injective and some {{where it is}} not. We prove that if A is a right Ore localization of R[a] and B is a right Ore localization of R[b], then α is injective. For example, the group ring over R of the free group on { 1 +a, 1 +b} is R[(1 +a) ^± 1] _R R[(1 +b) ^± 1], which then embeds in R >. We thus recover a celebrated result of R H Fox, via a proof simpler than those previously known. We show that α is injective if R is Π-semihereditary, that is, every finitely generated, torsionless, right R-module is projective. The article concludes with some results contributed by G M Bergman that describe situations where α is not injective. He shows that if R is commutative and w. gl. dim R > 2, then there exist examples where the map α' A _R B → R >_R R > is not injective, and hence neither is α. It follows from a result of K R Goodearl that when R is a commutative, countable, non-self-injective, von Neumann regular ring, the map α" R >_R R > → R> is not injective. Bergman gives procedures for constructing other examples where α" is not injective. Comment: 19 page...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Any leafwise {{connection}} on a {{fibre bundle}} over a foliated manifold is proved {{to come from}} a connection on this fibre bundle. Mathematics Subject Classification (2000) : 53 C 05, 53 C 12 Let (Z, F) be a foliated manifold, where F denotes a regular foliation of Z. Let Y → Z be a fibre bundle over Z. A leafwise connection on Y → Z is defined as a partial connection along the leaves of a folition F. Obviously, each connection on Y → Z yields a leafwise connection. We show that any leafwise connection on Y → Z is of this type. This fact is important, e. g., for geometric quantization of symplectic foliations. We start from the notion of a leafwise differential calculus on a foliated manifold. All manifolds throughout are smooth, real, finite-dimensional, Hausdorff, paracompact, and connected. If (Z, F) is a (regular) foliated manifold, there is an adapted coordinate atlas ΨF = {(U; z α; z A) }, α = 1, [...] .,dim F, A = dim F + 1, [...] ., dim Z, (1) of Z such that, for every leaf F of a foliation F, the connected components of F ∩ U are described by the equations z A =const., and transition functions of coordinates z A are independent of the remaining ones [3]. The tangent spaces to leaves of a foliation F assemble into an involutive distribution T F → Z on Z called the tangent bundle to F. Its global sections constitute the real Lie algebra T F(Z) of vector fields on Z subordinate to T F. This Lie algebra is a left C ∞ (Z) submodule of the derivation module of the <b>R-ring</b> C ∞ (Z) of smooth real functions on Z. Let SF(Z) be the kernel of T F(Z), acting on C ∞ (Z). It consists of functions, constant on leaves of F (i. e., foliated functions in the terminology of [4]). Then T F(Z) is the Lie SF(Z) -algebra of derivations of C ∞ (Z), seen as a SF(Z) -ring. Let us consider the Chevalley–Eilenberg differential calculus over the SF(Z) -ring C ∞ (Z). It is defined as a cochain subcomple...|$|E
