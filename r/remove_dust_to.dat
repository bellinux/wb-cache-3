We observed these molecular emissions in some of the ChemCam spectra and report the first detection of chlorine and fluorine with ChemCam. It is also the first time ever that fluorine has been detected on the surface of Mars. Among all the F-bearing observations, one third are observed in the Kimberley outcrop.

40|$|The Apollo {{missions}} {{to the moon}} showed that lunar dust can hamper astronaut surface activities due to its ability to cling to most surfaces.

In this paper, we report on our efforts to develop and electrodynamic <b>dust</b> shield <b>to</b> prevent the accumulation of dust on surfaces and <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>dust</b> already adhering <b>to</b> those surfaces. The parent technology for the electrodynamic dust shield, developed in the 1970 s, has been shown to lift and transport charged and uncharged particles using electrostatic and dielectrophoretic forces. This technology has never been applied for space applications on Mars or the moon due to electrostatic breakdown concerns. In this paper, we show that an appropriate design can prevent the electrostatic breakdown at the low Martian atmospheric pressures. We are also able to show that uncharged dust can be lifted and removed from surfaces under simulated Martian environmental conditions. This technology has many potential benefits for <b>removing</b> <b>dust</b> from visors, viewports and many other surfaces as well as from solar arrays. We have also been able to develop a version of the electrodynamic dust shield working under. hard vacuum conditions. This version should work well on the moon...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that plasmas can be induced by the {{radioactive}} decay of dust particles. The associated charging can {{be strong enough to}} levitate the particles in small electric fields. Significant amounts of dust exist in magnetic confinement fusion devices. In future fusion reactors the radioactive decay of Tritium, which is incorporated into the dust particles, will occur. In this paper we analyze some of the possible consequences. Charging of tritiated carbonaceous dust particles can be large enough to levitate them in an electric field of a few 10 " 3 Vm"-" 1. The emitted #beta#-particles may induce a plasma in the Deuterium/Tritium working gas of the fusion device. On the one hand, this may offer a novel way <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>dust</b> and <b>to</b> control part of the Tritium inventory in fusion devices. On the other hand, the formation of a nuclear induced plasma before discharge breakdown may lead to unwanted effects, e. g. during the start-up phase of the fusion plasma. (orig.)

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration {{plans to}} begin {{construction}} of a lunar base soon {{after the turn of}} the century.

The physical properties of lunar dust were characterized and energy methods for <b>removing</b> the <b>dust</b> were identified. Eight alternate designs were developed <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the <b>dust.</b> The final design uses a brush and gas jet <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the <b>dust.</b> The brush bristles are made from Kevlar fibers and the gas jet uses pressurized carbon dioxide from a portable tank.

40|$|Mars {{is covered}} with a layer of dust that has been homogenized by global dust storms. Dust, levitated by these storms {{as well as by the}} {{frequent}} dust devils, is the dominant weather phenomenon on Mars. NASA's Mars exploration rovers have shown that atmospheric dust falling on solar panels can decrease their efficiency to the point of rendering the rover unusable. Dust covering the surface of the moon is expected to be electrostatically charged due to the solar wind, cosmic rays, and the solar radiation itself through the photoelectric effect. Electrostatically charged dust has a large tendency to adhere to surfaces. The Apollo missions to the moon showed that lunar dust adhesion can hinder manned and unmanned exploration activities. In this paper, we report on our efforts to develop and electrodynamic <b>dust</b> shield <b>to</b> prevent the accumulation of dust on surfaces and <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>dust</b> already adhering <b>to</b> those surfaces. The technology uses electrostatic and dielectrophoretic forces <b>to</b> carry <b>dust</b> particles off surfaces and to generate an electrodynamic shield that prevents further accumulation of dust. The concept of the electrodynamic dust shield was introduced by NASA in the late 1960 s and later reduced to practice during the 1970 s for terrestrial applications. In 2003, our laboratory, in collaboration with several universities, applied this technology to space applications, specifically <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>dust</b> from solar panels on Mars. We show how, with an appropriate design, we can prevent the electrostatic breakdown at the low Martian atmospheric pressures. We are also able to show that uncharged dust can be lifted and removed from surfaces under simulated Martian environmental conditions. We have also been able to develop a version of the electrodynamic dust shield working under hard vacuum conditions that simulate the lunar environment. We have implemented the electrodynamic dust shield on solar arrays, optical systems, spectrometers, viewports, thermal radiators, batteries, and power systems, as well as on fabrics for spacesuits. We present data on the design and optimization of the electrodynamic dust shields and provide data on the performance of the different implementations of the technology for lunar and Martian exploration activities...|$|R
