5|$|The game's {{heads-up display}} simulates {{the inside of}} Samus' helmet, and {{features}} a <b>radar,</b> <b>map,</b> ammunition gauge and health meter. The player can change visors to enable new abilities such as X-ray vision, collecting information on many items, creatures and enemies, and interfacing with certain mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. Corruption also includes a hint system that periodically displays on-screen instructions and navigation assistance. The game also has {{the addition of the}} Hypermode, a feature in which health is drained to give temporary invincibility and more powerful attacks. After a certain amount of time, the player will enter Corrupt Hypermode, and if not stopped leads to a non-standard game over due to Samus being overtaken by Phazon. Another new feature is the Command Visor, which allows Samus to summon remotely her gunship from a suitable landing site to save the game, or travel to another destination quickly. During the progress of the game, new abilities can be obtained to allow it to perform aerial attacks against enemy targets and transport heavy objects.|$|E
25|$|In a radar set, the magnetron's {{waveguide}} {{is connected}} to an antenna. The magnetron is operated with very short pulses of applied voltage, resulting in a short pulse of high power microwave energy being radiated.

40|$|Lunar radar {{mappings}} {{carried out}} in the late 1960 s and 1970 s have provided several valuable insights into lunar surface processes. These radar mappings used the delay-Doppler technique and needed the narrow antenna beams now available with large radio telescopes. Two-element radar interferometers have provided resolution of the delay-Doppler ambiguity at meter wavelengths and provided topographic information at centimeter wavelengths. These techniques have provided high resolution lunar <b>radar</b> <b>maps</b> at 3. 8 -cm, 70 -cm, and 7. 5 -m wavelengths, a set of wavelengths which span the window available for earth-based <b>radar</b> <b>mapping</b> of the moon. These <b>radar</b> <b>maps</b> have been used along with other earth-based and Apollo orbital measurements to define surface units. The <b>radar</b> <b>maps</b> and these other data can describe physical properties such as small-scale blockiness and surface chemistry...|$|R
40|$|The X-band radar {{installed}} in Turin {{was used to}} analyze extreme events. About 3 years of <b>radar</b> <b>maps</b> have been analyzed in comparisons with about 30 years of measurements made by rain gauges located in the same area. The entire monitored area was divided into 4 subareas considering the complex orography near Turin, namely the flatlands, mountains, hills and urban areas. For each subarea, the Generalized Extreme Values (GEV) distributions are estimated considering rain gauges data and X-band <b>radar</b> <b>maps.</b> <b>Radar</b> <b>maps</b> are properly processed to be comparable with rain gauges measurements considering reference areas of different size centered over each available gauge. It is shown that a limited temporal availability of X-band <b>radar</b> <b>maps</b> can be sufficient to obtain a good GEV distribution estimation, and that X-band weather radars are a good instrument to analyze extreme rain events where a dense rain gauge network is not available...|$|R
25|$|Other {{important}} advances {{occurred in}} the technical field. The first navigation aid, GEE, was introduced to help pilots to find their targets. Window, small metal strips dropped from aircraft, was introduced to help confuse the German radars. Planes also got their own radar, the H2S radar system. It provided a <b>radar</b> <b>map</b> of the ground beneath the aircraft, allowing navigation with more accuracy to cities like Berlin which were at that time beyond the effective range of systems like Gee. However, {{probably the most important}} innovation to improve targeting accuracy was tactical, not technical. It was the introduction of the pathfinder system. Pathfinders were groups of specially trained aircrews who flew ahead of the main raid and marked the target. Their use greatly improved the accuracy and destructiveness of raids.|$|E

50|$|The Goodyear Aircraft Corporation ATRAN (Automatic Terrain Recognition And Navigation) {{system for}} the MGM-13 Mace was the {{earliest}} known TERCOM system. In August 1952, Air Materiel Command initiated the mating of the Goodyear ATRAN with the MGM-1 Matador. This mating resulted in a production contract in June 1954. ATRAN was difficult to jam and was not range-limited by line-of sight, but its range was restricted by the availability of <b>radar</b> <b>maps.</b> In time, it became possible to construct <b>radar</b> <b>maps</b> from topographic maps.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the absence}} of <b>radar</b> <b>maps,</b> in late April 1944 six PR Mk.XVI de Havilland Mosquito {{aircraft}} in the 482nd Bomb Group were equipped with H2X equipment.

Three aircraft were subsequently lost in training, and the project was discontinued. A further twelve PR Mk.XVI Mosquitos of the 25th Bomb Group (Reconnaissance) of the Eighth Air Force were fitted with H2X and beginning in May 1944 flew <b>radar</b> <b>mapping</b> night missions until February 1945.|$|R

The different <b>radar</b> <b>maps</b> indicate the size of surface rocks, as was demonstrated for the strewn fields of centimeter-sized rubble (the Type II anomaly).
