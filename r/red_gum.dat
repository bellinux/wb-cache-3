5|$|River {{channels}} {{in the region}} support River <b>Red</b> <b>Gum</b> (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and River Cooba (Acacia stenophylla) communities. Nearby higher areas contain Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens) woodlands and a salt-tolerant grass, saltbush and daisy understorey. Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora) and Grey Box (Eucalyptus microcarpa) occur along with Cypress Pine (Callitris glaucophylla) on areas rarely subjected to flooding. The area away from the rivers often consists of treeless plains, consisting of various saltbush (Atriplex) species, Cotton Bush (Maireana aphylla) and varieties of Danthonia and Austrostipa native grasslands.|$|E
5|$|While {{the suburb}} still {{contains}} a notable amount of native vegetation, {{and has not}} been exposed to invasive introduced species like other areas have, much of it was originally cleared for grazing and has yet to grow back to the same extent. Before European Settlement Grey Box, SA Blue Gum, Sheoak, Manna Gum and River <b>Red</b> <b>Gum</b> trees were native to and grew in the area, particularly on the slopes leading down to the Adelaide Plains.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the river has been dually known by the {{indigenous}} Kaurna people's name of Karra wirra-parri (meaning river of the <b>Red</b> <b>Gum</b> forest), referring to the dense eucalyptus forest that lined its banks prior to clearing by early settlers. This name, alternatively Karra-weera, only referred to the lake section of the river, between Adelaide and North Adelaide. It was known as Karrundo-ingga at Hindmarsh, Witoingga near the reed beds, and Yertala everywhere when in flood, which has survived as Yatala in the naming of various places in Adelaide.|$|E

5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii fruits singly or {{in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} grass or among leaf litter. It is {{typically}} found in eucalypt forest and subtropical rainforests. It has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. In southwest Australia it is found in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forests, where fruiting usually occurs in late autumn and early winter. The fungus appears to prefer disturbed ground, as it is often found at roadsides by forests, on lawns, grassy areas of parks, and among the slash of thinned karri regrowth forests. It is common in river <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) woodlands. M.clelandii also occurs in New Zealand, where it is found in mixed mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), kānuka (Kunzea ericoides), and kauri (Agathis) forest, and in conifer plantations. It is the smallest and most slender of the Macrolepiota species that occur there.|$|E

25|$|By 1850, {{the whole}} area had been taken up for grazing. Dandenong Creek was first bridged in 1840.

A township was surveyed in 1852. Milling of the <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> timber became an important industry, and charcoal burning, tanning, quarrying and brick making also flourished.

Migratory species under the Japan–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA), the China–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA) and the Republic of Korea–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (ROKAMBA) that have been recorded to regularly use wetlands within the Yanga National Park and surrounding areas include the Caspian tern, Latham’s snipe, cattle egret, and the black-tailed godwit.|$|E
25|$|Before European Settlement in South Australia {{much of the}} Adelaide Plains was {{swamps and}} woodland. In {{what was to become}} Burnside, plains leading out to Unley hosted the large Black Forest of Grey Box woodland, to the north the {{floodplains}} of First and Second Creeks there was Blue Gum and River <b>Red</b> <b>Gum.</b> Nearer to the foothills, in Mount Osmond and Waterfall Gully a more diverse range of plant species existed; Manna Gum and Blue Gum were predominant however. With colonisation underway, much of the native foliage was cut down to be used for crops and grazing. Market Gardens in the Adelaide Hills lowered the amount of water flowing down the creeks and some of the Hills Face was used for quarrying. Early crops grown included olive groves, grapes for winewaking, wheat and barley. Agriculture greatly declined and only vineyards survive today in Magill and Waterfall Gully.|$|E
