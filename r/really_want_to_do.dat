25|$|The obituaries {{shortly after}} Lawrence's death were, with the {{exception}} of the one by E. M. Forster, unsympathetic or hostile. However, there were those who articulated a more favourable recognition of the significance of this author's life and works. For example, his long-time friend Catherine Carswell summed up his life in a letter to the periodical Time and Tide published on 16 March 1930. In response to his critics, she claimed:"In the face of formidable initial disadvantages and lifelong delicacy, poverty that lasted for three quarters of his life and hostility that survives his death, he did nothing that he did not <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and all that he most wanted to do he did. He went all over the world, he owned a ranch, he lived in the most beautiful corners of Europe, and met whom he wanted to meet and told them that they were wrong and he was right. He painted and made things, and sang, and rode. He wrote something like three dozen books, of which even the worst page dances with life that could be mistaken for no other man's, while the best are admitted, even by those who hate him, to be unsurpassed. Without vices, with most human virtues, the husband of one wife, scrupulously honest, this estimable citizen yet managed to keep free from the shackles of civilization and the cant of literary cliques. He would have laughed lightly and cursed venomously in passing at the solemn owls—each one secretly chained by the leg—who now conduct his inquest. To do his work and lead his life in spite of them took some doing, but he did it, and long after they are forgotten, sensitive and innocent people—if any are left—will turn Lawrence's pages and will know from them what sort of a rare man Lawrence was."Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However, the most influential advocate of Lawrence's literary reputation was Cambridge literary critic F. R. Leavis, who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that The Rainbow, Women in Love, and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later, the obscenity trials over the unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover in America in 1959, and in Britain in 1960, and subsequent publication of the full text, ensured Lawrence's popularity (and notoriety) with a wider public.|$|E
500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's {{very hard for me}} to relate to people asking questions that are not only boring but don't {{have anything to do with}} my life ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E
5000|$|Manny Coto, showrunner of Star Trek: Enterprise, {{stated in}} an {{interview}} for StarTrek.com that he had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> feature the cloud city of Stratos in the fourth season of that series: [...] "There was one I <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> set on Stratos, the Cloud City [...] "The Cloud Minders".

500|$|Initially {{intended}} to be a made-for-TV film, the film's producer Kenith Trodd upgraded his original plan to a cinema feature. The original working title for the film was [...] "Falling Man". Playwright Simon Gray was commissioned to write the screenplay, and Pat O'Connor chosen to direct. In contrast to the book, which is narrated as a recollection by Birkin as an old man, the film is set entirely in the 1920s, except for a brief moment towards the end. In initial drafts of the screenplay, Gray had included a narrator, but O'Connor felt this was not the correct way to present the story:I felt that if I couldn’t do it in the present, suggesting internal pain by performance, then I wouldn’t <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it at all.|$|E
500|$|Because Johnston was {{believed}} to be safe at the ColdwaterII observation post, the fact that he died shocked his friends and co-workers alike. However, most of his colleagues and family asserted that Johnston died [...] "doing what he wanted to do." [...] His mother stated in an interview shortly after the eruption, [...] "Not many people get to do what they <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in this world, but our son did.... He would tell us he may never get rich but he was doing what he wanted. He wanted to be near if the eruption came. In a phone call on Mother's Day, he told us it's a sight very few geologists get to see." [...] Dr. Stephen Malone agreed that Johnston died doing what he loved, and stated that he [...] "was very good at his work".|$|E
500|$|Cher {{signed with}} Liberty Records' Imperial imprint {{in the end}} of 1964, and Sonny became her producer. The single [...] "Dream Baby", {{released}} under the name [...] "Cherilyn", received airplay in Los Angeles. Encouraged by Imperial, Cher worked with Sonny on her second solo single on the label, a cover version of Bob Dylan's [...] "All I Really Want to Do", which peaked at number 15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1965. Meanwhile, the Byrds had released their own version of the same song. When competition on the singles charts started between Cher and the Byrds, the group's record label began to promote the B-side of the Byrds' single. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds commented, [...] "We loved the Cher version... We didn't want the hassle. So we just turned our record over." [...] Cher's debut album, All I <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> (1965), reached number 16 on the Billboard 200; it was later described by AllMusic's Tim Sendra as [...] "one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era".|$|E
50|$|It {{was during}} a novice pair seminar in Oberstdorf, and in particular, {{watching}} a pair performing warm up lifts, {{that she and}} her sister decided that what they <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was Pair skating.|$|R

500|$|Black Flag's {{change in}} musical style and {{appearance}} alienated {{many of their}} original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone. Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote [...] "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to them." [...] During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that [...] "his powerful physique was {{a metaphor for the}} impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself." [...] Rollins has since replied that [...] "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Damien Leith stated how {{his debut}} studio album wanted to pan out: [...] "I didn't <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anybody else's songs... I just wanted this album to be mine". Immediately after Australian Idol concluded, he {{convinced}} {{the producers of}} the show to break from protocol by giving him longer time to record the album. The protocol was that the Australian Idol winners had only {{one week after the}} competition ended to record their first album. He decided to work on his first studio album for the next few months. Leith was aware of the little success of the previous two Idol winners, Casey Donovan and Kate DeAraugo, so he decided to turn something more palpable than the previous winners by producing an album of original songs. He comments, [...] "I suppose the main thing for me was trying to establish myself as a songwriter out of it because that's something that hasn't really been promoted in the past." [...] He was determined to create as much original material as possible for the album, and create songs that truly represent who he was. He also wanted the themes in the lyrics to not only be personal, but broad enough so that listeners can relate to them.|$|E
500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength {{to come back here}} – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said three or four months ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will be up there with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E
50|$|The {{motion picture}} was filmed {{in the state}} of Durango. Parrish and Lea first asked Henry Fonda, then Gregory Peck to take the {{starring}} role. But, Mitchum <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the film, and after Fonda and Peck said no, Mitchum took over production.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{never did}} it in our family. Father always said that if we <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> right we could find the way." [...] Gregory looked daunted, and then he frowned darkly. [...] "Are you {{provoked}} with me? Do you think what I have said is wrong?" ...|$|R

500|$|Actress Natalie Dormer, who {{was cast}} to play Queen Margaery Tyrell in the show's second season, also made her final {{appearance}} {{as a main}} cast member for the series. In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job you <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and I think it was just the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E
500|$|Retrospective reviews {{have been}} more negative. In 2014, David Sims of The Wire listed Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut in his list of [...] "directors' cuts messed up their own movies". Sims disliked the lack of {{ambiguity}} in Kelly's new version, and argued that [...] "crowbarring [...] into his director's cut made for a lesser movie". Similarly, Tom Hawking of Flavorwire felt that the director's cut ruined the [...] "enduring ambiguity" [...] of the original. Hawking included Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut in his 2010 list of [...] "10 director's cuts that are worse than the original". Writing in Collider.com {{for a review of}} the 10-year anniversary Blu-ray, Scott Wampler said that he felt [...] "let-down" [...] by the director's cut, and that it was [...] "right in line with the sort of choices [...] made as a filmmaker since releasing Donnie Darko". In the Total Film book The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, where the original cut of Donnie Darko was listed at number 87, Jonathan Dean also criticized this loss of ambiguity, remarking: [...] "Unwisely building concrete bypasses over gossamer plot strands, [...] steers us through a spaghetti junction of possible meanings when all we <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is get lost." [...] In a 2016 retrospective review, Germain Lussler of io9 stated that the director's cut [...] "simply isn't as good" [...] and [...] "feels less magical". He argued that the inclusion of The Philosophy of Time Travel [...] " [...] the film from being a text that the viewer could read into whatever they wanted".|$|E
2500|$|On 10 August 2013, in an {{interview}} reported by John Bleasdale, Kitano revealed his current plans for a sequel to Outrage Beyond and an untitled personal film project.

2500|$|Burke herself {{described}} the song as [...] "reggae meets R." [...] According to the singer, {{the song was}} inspired by her British Jamaican background and new convertible. Burke told The Sun, [...] "I really {{wanted to have a}} tune I could take down my roof to, drive along and be proud of. I didn't <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a ballad. I love the summer and this is the perfect track to dance to." [...] "Start Without You" [...] is an uptempo R song which draws from reggae fusion and dancehall influences, with a length of three minutes and thirty-three seconds, penned by RedOne, Bilal Hajji, Savan Kotecha, and Julian Bunetta. It is infused with power pop melodies in the chorus. Many critics have noted the song's resemblance to a nursery rhyme, that is Polly Wolly Doodle, but the mood reminds of Boney M's Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday.|$|E
2500|$|Lucas had story {{treatments}} for episodes VII, VIII and IX which {{he turned over}} to Disney chairman Bob Iger around the time Lucasfilm was sold to Disney in 2012. However, during an interview with Cinemablend in January 2014 to promote the upcoming release of the Lucasfilm animated movie Strange Magic, Lucas revealed that ultimately, Disney chose {{not to use the}} story treatments which he had written and turned over with the acquisition, and that the company chose to create brand new stories for the upcoming movies instead: [...] "The ones that I sold to Disney, they came up to the decision that they didn't <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> those.

2500|$|Another famous fantasy {{episode was}} [...] "Atomic Shakespeare," [...] which {{featured}} the cast performing {{a variation of}} The Taming of the Shrew, with David {{in the role of}} Petruchio, Maddie as Katharina, Agnes as Bianca, and Herbert as Lucentio. The episode featured Shakespearean costumes and mixed the Shakespearean plot with humorous anachronisms and variations on Moonlightings own running gags, including David riding in as Petruchio on a horse with BMW logos embroidered on its saddle blanket and repeatedly launching into the wrong Shakespearean soliloquy until the rest of the cast corrects him on which play he is in, and the Blue Moon office itself serving as Petruchio and Katharina's estate. The characters perform the Shakespearean dialogue in iambic pentameter, and the episode was wrapped by segments featuring a boy imagining the episode's proceedings because his mother forced him to do his Shakespeare homework instead of watching Moonlighting, which the mother described as [...] "That show about two detectives? A man and a woman? And they argue all the time and all they <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is sleep together? Sounds like trash to me!" ...|$|E

She also wrote [...] "Don't Doubt Yourself Babe" [...] for Mr. Tambourine Man, the 1965 debut album of The Byrds. Her music at this stage was heavily influenced by the American West Coast sounds and folk music. Staying briefly in England in 1965, DeShannon formed a songwriting partnership with Jimmy Page, {{which resulted in the}} songs [...] "Dream Boy" [...] and [...] "Don't Turn Your Back on Me". DeShannon also wrote material for singer Marianne Faithfull, including her Top Ten UK and US hit [...] "Come and Stay With Me", which became Faithfull's biggest UK hit, peaking at #4 in 1965.
