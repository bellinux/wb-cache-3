5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to the length of}} the instrument, which dictates the fundamental pitch, tubas also vary in overall width of the tubing sections. Tuba sizes are usually denoted by a quarter system, with [...] designating a normal, full-size tuba. Larger <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> are known as kaisertubas and are often denoted [...] Larger piston tubas, particularly those with front action, are sometimes known as grand orchestral tubas (examples: the Conn 36J Orchestra Grand Bass from the 1930s, and the current model Hirsbrunner HB-50 Grand Orchestral, which is a replica of the large York tubas owned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra). Grand orchestral tubas are generally described as [...] tubas. Smaller instruments may be described as [...] instruments. No standards exist for these designations, and their use is up to manufacturers who usually use them to distinguish among the instruments in their own product line. The size designation is related to the larger outer branches, and not to the bore of the tubing at the valves, though the bore is usually reported in instrument specifications. ( [...] Tuba may make different sounds when dented in different spots of the instrument.)The quarter system is also not related to bell size, at least across manufacturers. The largest tuba is the contrabass tuba (Besson) and is the lowest.|$|E

A questionnaire survey was conducted that explored general and specific issues concerning <b>rotary</b> NiTi <b>instruments</b> and techniques. An assessment of response rate and non-response bias was made by analysing responses to a question requiring a simple yes/no answer.

Respondents to the questionnaire indicated many different reasons for adoption or non-adoption of the new technology, which could be interpreted as demonstrating behavioural differencesbetween adopters and non-adopters. Analysis of the discarded instruments indicated that the differences in technical ability between the endodontists was a more important clinical consideration in defect and fracture rates of <b>rotary</b> NiTi <b>instruments</b> than the perceived fragility of the instruments themselves.

40|$|Background: Nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> {{files are}} {{important}} devices in Endodontics in root canal preparation. Ni-Ti file breakage {{is a critical}} and problematic issue and irrigation techniques were applied to decrease risk of file failure root. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the temperature gradient change of different irrigation solutions with Ni-Ti <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> system during root canal preparation and also to define their effects on the file failure. Materials and Methods: A novel computerized instrumentation was utilized and thirty standard (ProFile # 25 /. 04) files were divided into three groups and subjected to a filing in the root canal test. Changes in temperature on teeth under constant instrumental conditions with custom-designed computerized experimental apparatus were measured by using a temperature sensor bonded to the apical hole. A <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> for canal preparation in three series of solution was used and the changes in temperature after each solution were compared. Finally, the file failure results were mentored according to each step of test. Comparisons were performed between group status clinically by using ANOVA (t) test, once the sample showed up normal and differences of P< 0. 01 were considered significant. All data collected were computerized and analyzed for frequency, distribution, and statistical description. Results: There was a decrease in the temperature of the instruments, which were immersed in 5 % NaOCl, when compared with the water group (P< 0. 01). There was also a decrease in the temperature of the instruments immersed in water, when compared with the no solution group (P< 0. 01).

Methods: Forty five human single-rooted mandibular premolar teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups. The teeth in 3 groups were instrumented until reaching the working length with K 3, Protaper <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> and K-type stainless steel instruments with manual step-back technique, respectively. Debris extruded from the apical foramen was collected into centrifuge tubes and the amount was determined. The data obtained were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U tests, with P=. 05 as the level for statistical significance. Results: Statistically significant difference was observed between K 3, Protaper and step-back groups in terms of debris extrusion (P<. 05).

Air rotor performance was based on the time required to cut a standardized path through the substrate. The performance change that occurred from diamond instrument to instrument during the simulated test was attributed to air rotor degradation.

Forty-three human mandibular second molars with a C-shaped canal configuration were prepared with a crown-down approach to an apical dimension of size 30 by {{using a combination of}} ProFile and HERO instruments. Micro-computed tomography was used to examine the canal diameter and the remaining thickness of the dentin wall along the root canal. Results showed that only isolated regions in cross section of the C-shaped canal were physically prepared by the <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments.</b> The furcal wall (concave aspect of the "C" in cross section) of all clinically identifiable canals had a similar thickness at a distance 1 - 7 mm from the apical constriction both before and after instrumentation. More dentin was removed from the outer (convex aspect of the "C") than the furcal aspect at the apical region, but the converse was true more coronally.

40|$|Aim To {{examine the}} fatigue {{behaviour}} using a strain-life approach, {{and to determine}} the effect of water on the fatigue life of a NiTi <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument.</b> Methodology Instruments of one brand of NiTi engine-file (size 25, ProFile 0. 04 and 0. 06) were subjected to rotational bending either in air or under water, the number of revolutions to fracture (Nf) being recorded using an optical counter and an electronic break-detection circuit. The effective surface strain amplitude (εa) for each specimen was determined from the curvature of the instrument (on a photograph) and the diameter of the fracture cross-section (from a scanning electron micrograph of the fracture surface). Strain was plotted against fatigue life and the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) region identified. Values were examined using two-way analysis of variance for difference between various instrument-environment combinations. Results A total of 212 instruments were tested. A strain-life relationship typical of metals was found. Nf declined with an inverse power function dependence on εa. A fatigue limit was present at about 0. 7 % strain. The apparent fatigue-ductility exponent, a material constant for the LCF life of metals, was found to be between - 0. 45 and - 0. 55. There was a significant effect of the environmental condition on the LCF life, water being more detrimental than air.

40|$|Introduction: Fractured rotary nickel-titanium (NiTi) {{instruments}} {{have been}} classified into those that fail {{as a result}} of cyclic flexural fatigue or torsional failure or a combination of both. Clinically, NiTi <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> are subjected to both torsional load and cyclic fatigue, and ongoing research aims to clarify the relative contributions of both factors to instrument separation. Methods: To date, there is no specification or international standard to test cyclic fatigue resistance of endodontic <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments.</b> As a consequence, several devices and methods have been used to investigate in vitro cyclic fatigue fracture resistance of NiTi rotary endodontic instruments. In nearly all studies reported in the endodontic literature, the rotating instrument was either confined in a glass or metal tube, in a grooved block-and-rod assembly, or in a sloped metal block. Results: There has been no mention of the "fit" of the instrument in the tube or groove. As the instrument is likely to be fitting loosely, the description of the radius of curvature in those studies is likely to be overstated (ie, the file was actually bent less severely than reported, adding a variability in the amount of flexural stress). Conclusions: This review analyzed several devices that have been used in endodontic literature for cyclic fatigue testing and found that differences in the methodology affected the fatigue behavior of <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> and, consequently, the outcome of these studies. An international standard for cyclic fatigue testing of NiTi <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> is required to ensure uniformity of methodology and comparable results. © 2009 American Association of Endodontists...|$|E

Materials and Method: 60 short and long head pear-shaped TC and 18 round <b>rotary</b> diamond <b>instruments</b> {{that had been used}} to prepare than 5 and > than 10 cavities were selected from the 3 rd & 4 th year dental students, Dental Faculty, University of Malaya. 12 cylindrical and flame <b>rotary</b> diamond <b>instruments</b> were also selected from the 5 th year students. The rake angle of TC was measured and surfaces of diamond instruments were evaluated using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). Each test group comprised of 10 samples and new burs constituted the control group. The data were analysed descriptively and statistically using Two-way ANOVA, SPSS version 12. Results: The rake angles of control, than 5 groups were significantly higher compared to > than 10 groups, p than 10 teeth showed blunt and dislodged diamond particles.

40|$|Background/purpose: The {{aim of the}} {{this study}} was to compare the amount of debris apically {{extruded}} during endodontic retreatment using two <b>rotary</b> nickel–titanium (NiTi) <b>instruments</b> (K 3 and R-Endo) and Hedström files. Materials and methods: Forty-five extracted human mandibular premolar teeth were used in this study. Root canals of the teeth were filled before being randomly assigned to three groups. In group 1, gutta-percha was removed with K 3 (SybronEndo, West Collins, CA, USA) <b>rotary</b> NiTi <b>instruments.</b> In group 2, gutta-percha was removed with R-Endo (Micro-Mega, Besançon, France) <b>rotary</b> NiTi <b>instruments.</b> In group 3, gutta-percha was removed using Hedström files (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). Debris extruded from the apical foramen was collected into Eppendorf tubes. The liquid inside the tubes was dried, and the debris in each group was weighed and compared. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, and Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney U test. Results: Although all retreatment techniques resulted in apical extrusion, groups 1 and 2 produced significantly less apical extrusion than group 3 (P 0. 05). Conclusion: All retreatment techniques produced extruded debris during endodontic retreatment; however, both rotary NiTi systems were associated with less apical extrusion than manual instrumentation with Hedström files...|$|R

In the intervention group the cavities were prepared with Erbium:YAG laser 2940 nm and in the control group with conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments,</b> without anaesthesia. After cavity preparation patient’s subjective acceptance was assessed by a questionnaire concerning primary stress triggers. Results: The annoyance factor (vibration) was found as a stress trigger in the majority of control children (86. 7...|$|E
40|$|The use of Ni-Ti alloys in the {{practice}} of endodontic comes from their important properties such as shape memory and superelasticity phenomena, good corrosion resistance and high compatibility with biological tissues. In the last twenty years a great variety of nickel-titanium <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments,</b> with various sections and taper, have been developed and marketed. Although they have many advantages and despite their increasing popularity, a major concern with the use of Ni-Ti <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> is the possibility of unexpected failure in use due to several reasons: novice operator handling, presence manufacturing defects, fatigue etc. Recently, the use of an aqueous gel during experimental tests showed a longer duration of the instruments. The aim of the present work is to contribute {{to the study of the}} fracture behavior of these endodontic <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> particularly assessing whether the use of the aqueous lubricant gel can extend their operative life stating its reasons. A finite element model (FEM) has been developed to support the experimental results. The results were rather contradictory, also because the Perspex (Poly-methyl methacrylate, PMMA) cannot simulate completely the dentin mechanical behavior; however the results highlight some interesting points which are discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} number of uses, angle and radius of curvature and type of instrument on the fracture of ProTaper <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> when used by undergraduate students. Study design: Three hundred and seventy-six molars, {{with a total of}} 1114 root canals, extracted were instrumented by undergraduate students using ProTaper instruments according to the manufacturer´s recommendations. When fracture occurred, data were collected concerning the number of uses, type of instrument, level of fracture, angle and radius of curvature. ANOVA test were used to determine the influence of type of instrument in the incidence of instrument fracture. Logistic regression model was used to determine the influence of number of uses, angle and radius of curvature in the incidence of instrument fracture. Significance was set at p< 0. 05. Results: A total of 37 Ni-Ti <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> fractured during the treatment. Fracture occurred in 9. 84 % (37 / 376) of the teeth treated and 3. 32 % of the canals prepared with Ni-Ti <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> (37 / 1114). A decrease in the radius of curvature of the canal significantly increased the likelihood of fracture (p= 0. 0001). Instrument fracture significantly increased as the number of uses increased (p= 0. 0037). No significant differences were found betwee...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if the alloy composition shares an influence with the geometric design on the physical behavior of nickel-titanium <b>rotary</b> endodontic <b>instruments.</b> ProTaper, HERO, and K 3 files were selected. After sterilized and cleaning with alcohol, surface analysis was performed using energy dispersive spectroscopy. Measurements were performed on the active part and on the shank. SEM images of fractured instruments were also obtained and assessed. All three types of instruments were composed mainly of Nickel (54. 3 %, SD +/- 0. 8) and Titanium (45. 2 %, SD +/- 0. 9). SEM images revealed similar aspect with the presence of Kirkendall voids regularly distributed in the alloy. The results indicate that the difference in properties and behavior of these three endodontic <b>rotary</b> shaping <b>instruments</b> is solely related to the respective geometric characteristics of the instrument designLebanese Universit...|$|R
