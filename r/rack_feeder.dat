The Aviator is a floor-free working {{warehouse}} vehicle, {{which gives}} a third {{alternative to the}} market of stacker cranes that consist also of the narrow aisle stacker and the <b>rack</b> <b>feeder.</b> Officially introduced as Transfaster in 2002, this full-automatic working system has been realized several times. This article will give an overview concerning {{the structure of the}} system and its functionality, and will compare it to conventional systems regarding advantages, disadvantages and performance. Therefore ways of calculating cycle times are introduced. Introduction to the Aviator system In recent time a new kind of warehouse trucks has been available on the market. This device is called Aviator (AV) (Fig. 1) and it consists of a positioning unit (1), moving horizontally by the means of rails (5). These are attached at the inside of the rack at the adjusted shelf level. Via four steel wire ropes (4) the lift platform (2) - including the load suspension device (3) - is connected t...|$|E
40|$|Telescopic {{systems of}} {{structural}} members with clearance {{are found in}} many applications, e. g., mobile cranes, <b>rack</b> <b>feeders,</b> fork lifters, stacker cranes (see Figure 1). Operating these machines, undesirable vibrations may reduce the performance and increase safety problems. Therefore, this contribution has the aim to reduce these harmful vibrations. For a better understanding, the dynamic behaviour of these constructions is analysed. The main interest is the overlapping area of each two sections of the above described systems (see markings in Figure 1) which is investigated by measurements and by computations. A test rig is constructed to determine the dynamic behaviour by measuring fundamental vibrations and higher frequent oscillations, damping coefficients, special appearances and more. For an appropriate physical model, the governing boundary value problem is derived by applying Hamiltonâ€™s principle and a classical discretisation procedure is used to generate a coupled system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations as the corresponding truncated mathematical model. On {{the basis of this}} model, a controller concept for preventing harmful vibrations is developed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a typical {{situation}} arising {{in the assembly}} of printed circuit boards is investi- gated. The planning problem we face is how to assemble boards of di erent types using a single line of placement machines. From a practical viewpoint, the multiplicity of board types adds significantly {{to the complexity of}} the problem, which is already very hard to solve {{in the case of a}} single board type. In addition, relatively few studies deal with the multiple board type case. We propose a solution procedure based on a hierarchical decomposition of the planning problem. An important subproblem in this decomposition is the so-called <b>feeder</b> <b>rack</b> assignment problem. By taking into account as much as possible the individual board type characteristics (as well as the machine characteristics) we heuristically solve this problem. The remaining subproblems are solved using constructive heuristics and local search methods. The solution procedure is tested on real-life instances. It turns out that, in terms of the makespan, we can substantially improve the current solutions. Keywords: heuristics, PCB-assembly, <b>feeder</b> <b>rack</b> assignment problem. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} four straw applications on pigs housed on slatted floors were investigated to determine differences in behavior, straw use and growth. Both {{the type of}} straw used and {{the design of the}} application might influence the attractiveness and effectiveness of the applications. To this end, four straw applications were tested simultaneously (1 application per pen), presenting them during two weeks to six pigs. This experimental set-up was repeated three times. The four applications tested were a straw dispenser (Funbar) with fully chopped straw, a MIK Toy (in rolls pressed chopped straw), a rack (long-stemmed straw) and a straw feeder (long-stemmed straw). All pigs (total n = 96) had ad libitum access to straw from one of the applications. Behavior was recorded using video cameras and analyzed per individual pig for week 1 and week 2 of each experimental set-up separately using the logistic mixed model. The <b>rack</b> and straw <b>feeder</b> were explored and manipulated the most (P = 0. 02). In addition, the duration of sustained contact with the application was longer in presence of these applications (P = 0. 0009). This result might be related to the use of long straw. The straw use in presence of the rack was very high, with an average straw use of 2 kg per pen (6 pigs) per week. For all applications, direct contact with the application decreased during the second week compared to the first week. However, this decrease was the smallest in pens with the MIK Toy. Synchronized use of the applications was seen to a small extent, as in most cases not more than two pigs showed application interaction simultaneously. The presence of the Funbar (straw dispenser) was associated with a higher frequency of belly-nosing (P = 0. 03), nosing other body-parts of pen mates (P = 0. 06) and manipulating pen fittings (P = 0. 0002). It has been shown that the use of chopped straw might be related to a higher frequency of manipulating pen-mates, {{but it is not clear}} whether the type of straw explains this result. Growth and the presence of skin lesions did not differ between the applications. It can be concluded that the straw <b>rack</b> and <b>feeder</b> attract 35 pigs to a larger extent. In addition, these applications are associated with longer durations of sustained contact. Straw use however is very high in presence of the rack. The Funbar straw dispenser is the least preferred application regarding behavioral effects. It seemed that this application did not offer growing pigs the same distraction as the other applications. status: publishe...|$|R
