2500|$|Following the {{invention}} of coal gas early in the 19th century, {{it was discovered that}} numerous organic and inorganic chemicals could be obtained when purifying the gas. Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry – the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry – came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year [...] of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and dyes. Sulphur from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers. Subsequently the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies. A purpose-built chemical works, Beckton Products Works, was constructed in 1879. It was the largest tar and ammonia by-products works in the UK, possibly in the world. Besides millions of gallons of <b>road</b> <b>tar,</b> products included phenol, the cresols and xylenols, naphthalene, pyridine bases, creosote, benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha, ammonium sulphate and ammonia solution, sulphuric acid, picolines, quinoline, quinaldine, acenaphthene, anthracene and dicyclopentadiene. Since the Products works was dependent on by-products of gas manufacture it could not long survive the introduction of natural gas. The last train carrying chemical products, a load of pitch, left the works on 1 June 1970.|$|E

5000|$|A tar works {{site was}} {{established}} by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1843 {{at the bottom of}} Troopers Hill, known for its distinctive chimney. It provided creosote {{to be used as a}} preservative for railway sleepers and by 1863 had passed into the ownership of Brunel's manager, William Butler. At the turn of the 20th century, the works were used to manufacturer tarmac for roads, which became its main use. British Steel Corporation (BSC) took over running of the tar works in 1970. Under their ownership, it expanded to be one of the most modern in Europe, allowing a continuous 24/7 production of creosote, <b>road</b> <b>tar</b> and smokeless fuel, among other products. [...] It continued to operate until 1981, by which time it had stopped producing <b>road</b> <b>tar</b> and become primarily a distillation unit. After closure, the works lay derelict for some years, until the area was redeveloped as Quayside Village in 1989.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{railroad}} was to haul semi-bituminous coal from the mines {{on the east side of}} the remote Broad Top Mountain plateau to the Pennsylvania Railroad in Mount Union. The railroad also carried substantial amounts of ganister rock, lumber and passengers with some agricultural goods, concrete, <b>road</b> <b>tar</b> and general freight. In its first three decades the railroad supplied much of its coal to the Rockhill Iron Furnace, operated by the railroad's sister company, the Rockhill Iron and Coal Company, and in turn hauled the pig iron from the furnace.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{methods of}} {{increasing}} braking power for rim brakes include rubbing {{a very thin}} layer of roofing or <b>road</b> <b>tar</b> on the braking surface of a smooth rim. This works by effectively sticking the brake pads to the rim and for this reason, much harder pads than are suitable for ground rims {{can be used with}} good results and excellent pad durability compared to ground rims. Since the pads stick to the rim, the brake often doesn't release as cleanly as a ground brake or a disk however.|$|E
5000|$|Though Barry {{acknowledged}} that other companies had products that {{were similar to}} his, he ensured that the firm jealously protected its trademark and that it never fully revealed the components used in its manufacture to the public.

50|$|Between 1891 and 1929 about 20 {{oil wells}} were drilled {{in and around}} Los Gatos, {{starting}} a minor oil-drilling boom. About 1861 smallamounts of oil were discovered in streams, springs, and waterwells in the Santa Cruz Mountains {{in the vicinity of}} MoodyGulch, about 6.5 km south of the Los Gatos Post Office. An intense search for oil ensued,resulting in the drilling of many wells and establishment ofthe Moody Gulch oil field. TheMoody Gulch oil field, however, never met expectations, andit was abandoned about 1938 after producing a total of about 98,000 barrels of oiland 44 million ft3 of gas. In 1891, one of the Moody Gulch drillers, R.C.McPherson, found oil in a well along San Jose Road (now LosGatos Boulevard) in the Santa Clara Valley flatlands, about 3 km northeast of the Los Gatos Post Office. Although commercial production was never established, small amounts of oilwere produced for use as fuel, lubricant, and <b>road</b> <b>tar</b> by localresidents.|$|E

5000|$|Eventually Teju felt it {{was time}} to leave his {{executive}} position at WNTV-WNBS. He made note that [...] "Anytime you don't feel you're contributing sufficiently to a job… it's time to leave".When he joined Total in 1973, he started as an Assistant Operations Manager. However, in a span of six years and five promotions, he had risen to the rank of general manager, which in this scenario was the equivalent to chief operating officer. He held this position for another six years, until 1984. His experience as general manager at Western Nigeria Television was not a waste when it came to climbing the ranks. He explained during our interview, [...] "No experience is lost if you value it well".Prior to him, no other Nigerian had risen to that level in the organisation. At the time he joined Total they were ranked number three in Nigeria in terms of productivity amongst the petroleum companies. Eleven years later when he was promoted from his position as general manager (In this scenario he was the chief operating officer), the brand had risen to be number one in Nigeria.For his next assignment, Engineer Oyeleye was asked to help set up several new ventures (similar to incubator companies) for Total. For the three years he spent in the role of Group Executive Director of Total Nigeria Subsidiaries, Engr. Oyeleye formed several successful subsidiaries that grew significantly in size. The Nigerian Gas Cylinder Manufacturing company was the first of its kind in Nigeria and manufactured gas cylinders that were used for cooking in almost every home. Another highly successful subsidiary supplied bitumen (<b>road</b> <b>tar)</b> and lubricants to the country. Teju Oyeleye retired from Total in 1991, but remained on the board of directors until 1994. He was succeeded as general manager by Sunny A. Olu Jegede.|$|E

Since {{the turn of}} the century, cancer had been steadily growing as a major cause of death. Naturally, researchers looked first to envi-ronmental factors, particularly agents of the Industrial Age, such as asbestos, <b>road</b> <b>tar,</b> ionizing radiation, and synthetic dyes. Since then, however, attention has been diverted away from such important environmental causes of cancer, espe-cially where economic interests are at stake, according to Dr. Devra Davis in The Secret History of the War on Cancer (1).

40|$|A polyphasic {{taxonomic study}} was {{performed}} on a pink-coloured unknown bacterium isolated from discarded <b>road</b> <b>tar.</b> Comparative analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence demonstrated that the isolate belongs phylogenetically to the genus Azospirillum with Azospirillum lipoferum, A. melinis and A. rugosum as its closest phylogenetic relatives (96. 7, 96. 6 and 96. 6 % similarity to the respective type strains). The generic assignment was confirmed {{on the basis of}} chemotaxonomic data, which revealed a fatty acid profile characteristic for the genus Azospirillum, consisting of straight-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, with C 18 : 1 v 7 c as the major unsaturated non-hydroxylated fatty acid, and C 16 : 0 3 -OH as the major hydroxylated fatty acid, and a ubiquinone with ten isoprene units (Q- 10) as the predominant respiratory quinone. On the basis of both the phenotypic and molecular genetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown isolate should be classified within a novel species of the genus Azospirillum, for which the name Azospirillum picis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IMMIB TAR- 3 T (5 CCUG 55431 T 5 DSM 19922 T). The genus Azospirillum was proposed by Tarrand et al. (1978) for strains of the root-associated nitrogen fixe...|$|E
