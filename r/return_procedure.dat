Only on the condition that the migrant cooperates with the <b>return</b> <b>procedure</b> will shelter be provided by the national government in a Freedom Restricted Location (VBL). Placement in a VBL is coupled to a freedom-restricting measure under article 56 of the Aliens Act (Legal Advisor Refugee Law, Dutch Refugee Council, personal communication, 3 March 2017). The location is geared towards effectuating a return within 12  weeks, although this can only be partly carried out. 6 However, if someone continues to cooperate, this period may be extended. “In principle, the alien stays at the VBL for 12 weeks, as long as he is willing to actively work on his return” (Researcher, European Migration Network, personal communication, 3 February 2017).|$|E
30|$|These {{estimated}} numbers {{suggest that}} in both countries the policy tool implies a strong discursive component directed towards the voting population (see Van Oorschot, 2009). It is {{a signal to the}} general public that welfare for “unwanted migrants” is provided only on a conditional basis. In fact, it has to be earned individually by demonstrating the willingness to cooperate with the <b>return</b> <b>procedure.</b> The underlying rationale is that only good and needy migrants may be rewarded with basic social services. No doubt the tool aims at clearing away practical barriers against effectuating removals, but the effects are demonstrated less in numbers than in political discourse. Distinct gaps, tensions and ambiguities remain: between immigration control and welfare policy networks, between the stages of legislation and implementation, and between national, sub-national and international actors. These gaps occur, however, in different intensity in the two country contexts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- For retail {{small to}} medium {{enterprises}} (SMEs) product returns {{have often been}} seen as an irritant, a cost centre and an area of potential customer dissatisfaction. The paper reports that product returns in retail SMEs {{can no longer be}} ignored in the current economic climate. Fierce competition coupled with small profit margins means that retailers find it increasingly difficult to ignore lost revenue from product returns. The paper introduces and details product <b>return</b> <b>procedures</b> normally used in retail SMEs. A focussed look at two similar retail SMEs (Alpha and Beta) in the consumer electronics market reveals very similar product return practices that under close scrutiny appear to be inefficient. Previous research reveals little or no work has been done to model and simulate product <b>return</b> <b>procedures</b> in retail SMEs. The research study uses discrete event simulation (DES) to model and simulate the effects of product returns in SMEs and explore strategies to reduce their affect on the supply chain. Witness simulation software has been used to develop a base model representing product <b>return</b> <b>procedures</b> from which inefficiencies were identified and reduced to produce an efficient simulation model. The results of this study have been well received with collaborating SMEs Alpha and Beta...|$|R

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of the bilateral cooperation on migration control between individual European Union Member States and third countries, this article examines whether the implementation of readmission agreements hampers access to protection for asylum-seekers subjected to a <b>return</b> <b>procedure.</b> It concludes that no issue of incompatibility with refugee and human rights law seems to stem from the text of readmission agreements – administrative tools used to articulate the procedures for a smooth return of irregular migrants and rejected refugees to countries of origin or transit. Nonetheless, instances of informal practices of border control, especially in situations of emergency and mass influxes demonstrate how the existence of a readmission agreement may boost the use of swift and accelerated identification and return procedures in dissonance with international human rights and refugee law. As readmission agreements do not generally include separate provisions on refugees, a real risk exists of removing asylum-seekers, as unauthorised migrants, to allegedly “safe third countries”. The paper hails, therefore, as an added value, the insertion of both non-affection clauses and procedural human rights clauses creating extra safeguards for removable asylum-seekers. To this end, a number of concrete proposals of draft provisions are put forward as a platform for further discussion among legal scholars and policy-makers...|$|E

Nutritional service is the one for fulfilling the nutrition requirement of hospital, both for out- and inpatient for the body metabolism need, health improvement as well as rehabilitative and preventive attempts. Nutrition service should give the best quality to the patient because it will very helpful in the recovery process. For that reason, it should be supported by a good system and procedure. One {{of them is the}} internal control system of nutrition installation both in acquiring and usage. The research aims to find out as well as to evaluate the implementation of internal control system of nutrition installation purchasing and supply in Nirmala Suri Hospital. The research also aims to obtain the evidence of the strength and weakness of internal control system of nutrition installation in Nirmala Suri Hospital. Evaluation on internal control system conducted encompasses the firmly separation of functional responsibility, authority system and registration procedure giving adequate protection on the wealth, debt, income and expense as well as evaluation on the employees with the quality corresponding to their responsibility. From the research conducted, it can be concluded that the nutrition installation purchasing and supply in Nirmala Suri Hospital, has not been adequate. There are some weaknesses leading to the difficulty of achieving the objective of internal control. There are function doubling of reception and storage functions, there is no debt record procedure, <b>return</b> <b>procedure</b> about the nutrition installation purchase, there is no usage procedure, return as well as adjustment for the damaged products.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Although {{there has}} been a rapid growth in online apparel sales and online apparel {{shopping}} during the last several years, consumers still have concerns when they purchase apparel products online (ComScore, 2007; Dunne & Lusch, 2005; ITFacts E-commerce, 2007). From the online apparel shoppers’ perspective, online apparel shopping involves a considerable level of risk because they cannot inspect and try on apparel products before the purchase. If consumers are not satisfied with the fit, color, or quality of the product after it is delivered, they will most likely want to return the product (Taylor & Cosenza, 2000). The research question of the present study is why some dissatisfied consumers decide to continue online shopping and why others decide to discontinue online shopping when presented with an unsatisfactory online shopping and return experience. Based on the concepts of distributive, procedural, and informational justice, this study examined the direct effect of compensation on distributive justice, the direct effect of efficient return procedures on procedural justice, and the direct effect of information availability of return on informational justice, and the direct effects of perceived distributive, procedural, and informational justice on post-recovery satisfaction. Indirect effects on post-purchase intentions after an unsatisfactory online apparel shopping and return experience were also examined. Furthermore, the present study examined the moderating effect of perceived seriousness of product failure on the relationship between compensation and distributive justice, the relationship between efficient <b>return</b> <b>procedure</b> and procedural justice, and the relationship between information availability for return and informational justice. The moderating effects of shopping orientations, perceived performance risk, and previous experience with online apparel shopping on the relationships between three types of perceived justice and post-recovery satisfaction, and on the relationship between post-recovery satisfaction and post-purchase intentions were also examined. The present study employed a combined experimental and a survey-based method. For the experiments, five scenarios were developed using projective technique. The convenience sampling was conducted. 148 students at Oregon State University participated. Subjects read a scenario in the third person perspective about a consumer returning a product. They were then asked to assess evaluative criteria including distributive justice, procedural justice, informational justice, post-recovery satisfaction, post-purchase intentions, perceived seriousness of product failure, convenience shopping orientation, economic shopping orientation, recreational shopping orientation, perceived performance risk, and previous experience with online apparel shopping. The findings indicated that participants who read a scenario in which a consumer received higher levels of distributive, procedural, and informational justices indicated the consumer would be more satisfied with the service recovery and would develop positive post-purchase intentions. In other words, consumers who had an unsatisfactory online apparel shopping and return experience were perceived as being willing to develop positive post-purchase intentions from the same online store if the e-retailer provided high levels of post-recoveries such as free return shipping fee, both store return option and mail return option, and information availability about return shipping fee. The results supported that the concepts of distributive, procedural, and informational justice may be applicable for understanding consumers who had an unsatisfactory online apparel shopping and return experience. The findings have managerial implications for e-return policies and return procedures. If e-retailers provide high levels of service recoveries with return policies and return procedures in which consumers perceive fair, those consumers may be satisfied with those return policies and return procedures, and then are likely to repurchase apparel products from the same online apparel store. Future research needs to examine the impacts of other factors such merchandise credit, cash refunds, and online help options on perceived justice...|$|E
40|$|Real estate {{taxation}} {{has been}} intensely debated lately. The main issue concerns {{the formation of}} taxable values based on the current cadastral incomes. More specifically, the point is made against the iniquity that the current surveyed values generate in the fiscal system, thus the necessity of overcoming it. It is known that the iniquity depends on the failed revision of valuation fees (related to the two-year period 1988 - 1989) and on the classification (sometimes still related to the urban cadastral) {{as well as on}} the modalities used to calculate the taxable basis through the multipliers (the IMU ones, particularly). These are the expression of a conventional (and certainly distorting) rate of <b>return</b> <b>procedure</b> which have become tools for the income variation. During the last twenty years, the Government and the Parliament have found the solution to the problem of iniquity in the revision of the current cadastral incomes. Nevertheless, they never managed to start a veritable reform process. In fact, during these years, they have just managed to introduce temporary measures as for instance paragraph 335 e 336 of article 1 of Law 311 of December 30 th for the revision of the classification of some territorial backgrounds or of some real estate units, thus managing to control the most evident iniquities. Some other norms were approved in order to conduct remote surveys to identify properties which were never listed in the cadastre office. More than once, other possible suitable solutions have been discussed which could have been, with a fast implementation and low use of resources, a first step towards the recovery of an equity of real estate taxation. Unfortunately, these came out to be temporary measures all the same. Last in order and worth of mention is the Ministry of Economic and Finance document by the Finance and Economy Department (hereinafter MEF) named “Ipotesi di revisione del prelievo sugli immobili” (Revision of real estate taxation proposal, August 2013) in which there is a list of all the different kind of interventions on real estate taxation, together with quantitative and qualitative valuations among which the use of the databases of the Observatory of real estate market to update the taxable basis of the Imposta municipale unica (IMU, Municipal one-tax). The solution eventually adopted by the Parliament is an overall revision capable of reforming the entire current cadastral valuation system without resorting to intermediate solutions. In fact, it has recently approved the Enabling Law 23, of 11 th March, containing «Dispositions for a more equal, transparent and growth-oriented fiscal system» in which, in the article 2, a reform of the cadastral valuation system is taken into account. It is important to notice how any contrary vote has been expressed against the Enabling Law’s text while its first reading prior to the vote in the Chamber of Deputies on September 25 th 2013, as well as in the final vote which took place on February 27 th 2014. Only during the first reading and vote in the Senate (February 4 th 2014), 12 contrary votes were registered. These elements show how the awareness of the urgency to restore an equal real estate taxation system is largely spread and accepted. What emerges from the Parliamentary debate is that different political forces are fully aware of the necessity to restore an equal real estate taxation system as well as of the complexity of the reform and its long implementation process. The auspice is to have this system implemented as soon as possible, possibly before a five-year period. About this delicate issue, also the experts in the field and the scientific world of reference have participated in the debate about the necessity of a cadastral reform through several studies. On the one hand, they want to provide empirical proof of the taxation iniquity caused by the current system; on the other hand, they want to propose possible solutions to correct this situation. Among these studies, there is the recent paper by Rocco Curto, Elena Fregonara, Patrizia Semeraro (2014) “Come rendere più eque le rendite catastali in attesa della revisione degli estimi?”(How can land registry values be made fairer pending a review of valuations?) in which a rapid and simple methodology to vary the current real estate rent through corrective coefficients of location is proposed. In this way, the taxable basis on real estate fees is re-defined in order to reduce the current fiscal iniquity caused by the obsolescence of the incomes based on the current cadastre office. However, a temporary correction to implement while waiting for the reform of the entire cadastral system. In particular, in their paper, Curto et al. (2014) propose to multiply the value of the current income by a coefficient obtained as a ratio between the average prices of a given census microzone and a reference index that “the ratio between an index price which most accurately sums up property values in individual municipalities or aggregations of municipalities in the case of the smallest municipalities (determined on the basis of market observations constituting the entire statistical sample) and the corresponding price indices of the values of each Microzone, defined on the basis of market observations (sub-samples) ” (p. 62). In the remainder of the paper, the methodology underlying the hypothesis contained in the MEF’s “Revision of real estate taxation proposal”(August 2013) is explained. Secondly, the methodological differences of corrections of real estate incomes proposed in the cited document by the MEF and in Curto et al. (2014) ’s article are then compared. Subsequently, some empirical proof is supplied relating to the two taxable-basis equity recovery methods. Lastly, further consideration on the effective and generalized implementation of the proposed methods will be made...|$|E

To date {{there are only a few}} studies that have described the legal and social situation of third-country nationals pending deportation in Europe (Bolhuis, Battjes, & Wijk, 2017; Cantor, Wijk, Singer, & Bolhuis, 2017; Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), 2013; Heegaard Bausager et al., 2013; Rosenberger & Küffner, 2016; Spencer, 2016). According to international and European legal frameworks, the mere presence of these individuals urges the liberal state to take some responsibility for their well-being. More precise, the right to an adequate standard of living is to be upheld regardless of one’s residency status (see Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), 2017; (FRA, 2013)).

30|$|Analytically, {{the paper}} is {{informed}} by policy analysis literature which deals with policy instruments or policy tools 1 as devices that governments use to implement policies (Howlett & Ramesh, 2003). Migration studies dealing with social welfare tools often refer to the stratified-rights approach (Morris, 2010). In this paper, we deal with CWR as a policy instrument of migration control, which is simultaneously employed as a prerequisite for gaining the precarious status of being non-removable, and accessing housing and social allowances. We expect that social benefits, coupled with cooperation in the <b>return</b> <b>procedures,</b> are intended as the “inducements” (Howlett & Ramesh, 2003, p. 90) to attain migration control aims rather than cuts in welfare expenses. Nevertheless, strict implementation of the instrument may lead to problematic, unintended consequences in social welfare such as homelessness and destitution (Spencer, 2016). Within this tension between migration control and welfare aims, we trace how these policy fields work together or against each other (Rhodes, 2008).|$|R
