5|$|In {{the total}} {{synthesis}} of rocaglamide, epoxidation of a vinyl alkoxyallenyl stannane likewise generates a pentadienyl cation via <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> of the resultant epoxide.|$|E
5|$|By extension, any pentadienyl cation {{regardless}} of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov cyclization. There have been {{a large number of}} examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements. One such example involves the silver catalyzed cationic <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> of allylic dichloro cylopropanes. The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride.|$|E

5|$|Because they overstabilize the pentadienyl cation, β-electron {{donating}} substiuents often severely impede Nazarov cyclization.

25|$|The second {{route is}} {{ring-opening}} polymerization of laurolactam at 260-300˚C. <b>Ring</b> <b>opening</b> {{can be carried}} out by cationic or anionic initiators, although cationic initiators have not been used commercially due to the product being less stable and oxidized relatively quickly in comparison to those produced by activated anionic polymerization (monomer casting). Ring-opening polymerization is the preferred route for commercial production.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} step, {{and usually}} the last, in {{the synthesis of}} β-blockers consists of adding a propanolamine side chain. This can be done following two paths which both involve alkylation of an appropriate phenoxide with epichlorohydrin (ECH). The first way is shown as the upper way in figure 5. It consists of phenoxide reacting at the oxirane and resulting in an alkoxide, that displaces the adjacent chloride {{to form a new}} epoxide ring. The second way is shown as the lower route in figure 5. It consists of displacement of the halogen directly with a SN2 reaction to give the same glycidic ether. When following both pathways, the central chiral carbon preserves its configuration, which is an important part to consider when synthesizing enantiomerically defined drugs. The <b>ring</b> <b>opening</b> of the epoxide ring in glycidic ether is done with an appropriate amine, such as isopropyl amine or tert-butylamine, and leads to the aryloxypropanolamine compound that consist of a secondary amine. This amine is typically known as the structural requirement for the β-adrenergic blocking activity.|$|E

500|$|The {{migration}} of a divalent group, such as O, S, N R or C R2, {{which is part}} of a three-membered ring in a bicyclic molecule, is commonly referred to as a walk rearrangement. This can be formally characterized according to the Woodward-Hofmann rules as being a (1, n) sigmatropic shift. An example of such a rearrangement is the shift of substituents on tropilidenes (1,3,5-cycloheptatrienes). When heated, the pi-system goes through an electrocyclic ring closing to form bicycleheptadiene (norcaradiene). Thereafter follows a [...] alkyl shift and an electrocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>opening.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Overman's {{synthesis}} of strychnine represents a useful {{example of the}} preparation of precursors necessary for the aza-Cope/Mannich rearrangement, representing effective usage of an epoxide <b>ring</b> <b>opening.</b> [...] The key steps of the {{synthesis of}} the rearrangement substrate leading to the starting materials necessary for the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction included a Stille reaction to piece together two precursors, an epoxidation of a double bond using tert-Butyl hydroperoxide, a Wittig reaction to convert the ketone to an alkene, and a cyclization step. [...] Amine alkylation (not shown), transforms the molecule to the rearrangement substrate. [...] Significantly, this molecule shows the enantiomeric precision of the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction, as a simple enantiomeric starting material dictates the final enantiomer: the enantiomer of strychnine was produced by using the enantiomer of the starting material.|$|E
2500|$|Cif is an epoxide {{hydrolase}} (EH) {{with unique}} substrate selectivity. [...] Cif {{is the first}} example of an EH serving as a virulence factor. Based on structural comparison, {{it appears that the}} enzyme utilizes a catalytic triad of residues Asp129, Glu153 and His297, with accessory residues His177 and Tyr239 coordinating the epoxide oxygen during <b>ring</b> <b>opening.</b> [...] Cif is also the first example of an EH utilizing a His-Tyr pair to coordinate an epoxide substrate, rather than the canonical Tyr-Tyr pair. In the proposed enzyme mechanism, Asp129 nucleophilically attacks a carbon of the epoxide moiety of a substrate, forming an ester linked enzyme-acyl intermediate. The preference for which carbon is attacked varies depending upon the substrate. In the second step of the reaction, a water molecule is activated by the charge-relay His297-Glu153 pair, and undergoes nucleophilic attack on the Cγ of Asp129. This hydrolyzes the ester group, liberating the hydrolysis product as a vicinal diol.|$|E

A series of hydrocarbon-like polynuclear lactones were explored with the intent of establishing a connection between polynuclear aromatics and aflatoxins. Such studies of heteroatomic polynuclears led him to propose a [...] "newer picture" [...] of a carcinogenic hydrocarbon, helping the generalise the classical K-region hypothesis.|$|E
