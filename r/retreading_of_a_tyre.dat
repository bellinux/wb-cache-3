40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{eigenfrequencies}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deformed <b>tyre</b> exhibit <b>a</b> mutual repulsion behaviour if the rotation velocity is increased. This phenomenon is known as frequency loci veering and is induced by the a-periodicity resulting from the tyre deformation due to {{the weight of the}} car. The corresponding eigenmodes interact in the transition zones and finally interchange. This is not the case for the undeformed tyre, where {{it is well known that}} rotation splits the eigenfrequencies around the eigenfrequencies of the non-rotating tyre. The change in eigenfrequencies is linearly related to the rotation velocity and is determined by the circumferential wavenumber and tyre radius only. For the undeformed tyre no modal interaction occurs as <b>a</b> consequence <b>of</b> rotation. Furthermore, modal interaction increases as tyre load increases and decreases as material damping increases. In previous work a methodology to model tyre vibrations has been developed, exploiting a modal base determined in a standard FE package and including rotational effects by a coordinate transformation. Major advantages of this approach are that the complex build-up <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tyre</b> is retained and that the large (nonlinear) deformations and small (linear) vibrations are treated separately. In the present paper, the effects of deformation on the eigenfrequencies <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rotation <b>tyre</b> are examined using this methodology. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Simulation results, such as the load-deflection characteristics and the load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are compared with mixed success to those obtained experimentally.
