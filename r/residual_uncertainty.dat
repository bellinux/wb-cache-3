Of the eleven experts polled, all but two concluded that the alpha-mode failure issue was resolved from a risk perspective, meaning that this mode of failure is of very low probability, that it is of little or no significance to the overall risk from a nuclear power plant, and that any further reduction in <b>residual</b> <b>uncertainties</b> is not likely to change the probability in an appreciable manner. To a lesser degree, discussions also took place on the broader FCI issues such as mild quenching of core melt during non-explosive FCI, and shock loading of lower head and ex-vessel support structures arising from explosive localized FCIs. These latter issues are relevant with regard to determining the efficacy of certain accident management strategies for operating reactors as well as for advanced light water reactors. The experts reviewed the status of understanding of the FCI phenomena in the context of these broader issues, identified <b>residual</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in the understanding, and recommended future research (both experimental and analytical) to reduce the uncertainties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Reduced-{{reference}} (RR) {{image quality}} assess-ment (IQA) aims to use less {{data about the}} reference image and achieve higher evaluation accuracy. Recent research on brain the-ory suggests that the human visual system (HVS) actively predicts the primary visual information and tries to avoid the <b>residual</b> <b>uncertainty</b> for image perception and understanding. Therefore, the perceptual quality relies to the information fidelities of the primary visual information and the <b>residual</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel RR IQA index based on visual information fidelity. We advocate that distortions on the primary visual information mainly disturb image understanding, and distortions on the <b>residual</b> <b>uncertainty</b> mainly change the comfort of perception. And we separately compute the quantities of the primary visual information and the <b>residual</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of an image. Then the fidelities of {{the two types of}} information are separately evaluated for quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed index uses few data (30 bits) and achieves high consistency with human perception...|$|E
