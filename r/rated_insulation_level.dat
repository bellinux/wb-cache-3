This could lead to heatrelated problems ranging from thermal-discomfort and productivity-reduction to illness as well as death. From the indoor-overheating point of view, the sensitivity of 9, 216 Dutch dwelling-case to the climate change is quantified and ranked using detailed simulation and post-processing calculations. The results show that the sensitivity depends significantly on the dwelling’s design/operation characteristics. Minimally-ventilated dwellings are the most sensitive ones.

40|$|In devising viable energy {{efficiency}} policies that {{can reduce the}} greenhouse gas emissions of existing dwellings (e. g. UK׳s Green Deal), data are required on current <b>insulation</b> <b>levels</b> and its influences. One such data source is the seldom used UK Energy Saving Trust׳s Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED), which this paper investigates using Norfolk UK local authorities as a case study. The HEED׳s reactive and longitudinal data collection strategies contribute to underlying biases, which is the likely reasoning for its differences with the English Housing Survey and UK 2001 Census. These differences had a cascading effect in that they manifested themselves in the indicative financial and carbon assessments undertaken. Similarly, sampling concerns also implicated correlations surrounding influences of current dwelling <b>insulation</b> <b>levels.</b> Providing one is transparent about potential biases and data concerns, the HEED can play a substantial role in guiding policy decisions and understanding dwelling stock characteristics (e. g. what makes dwellings ‘Hard to Treat׳).

The main goal of this article is to perform a comprehensive energy and environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) of the roof retrofit of a Portuguese single-family house integrating thermal dynamic simulation. A life-cycle model was developed to assess 27 alternative retrofit scenarios combining three types of insulation material (rock wool, extruded polystyrene and polyurethane foam), three <b>insulation</b> <b>levels</b> (40, 80 and 120 mm) and three types of frame material (wood, light steel and lightweight concrete). The functional unit selected for this study was 1 square meter of living area over a period of 50 years. Life-cycle (LC) impact assessment results were calculated for six categories showing that wood scenarios had the lowest impacts (all categories). The use phase accounted for 60 – 70 % of the LC impacts in all categories. The results also showed that for insulation thicknesses of 80 mm or more, the reduction in operational energy, due to a further increase of 40 mm, is not significant (5 % or less), while the embodied impacts increase from 6 to 20 %. This article shows the importance of addressing the entire life-cycle of building retrofit to reduce environmental impacts by quantifying the marginal LC benefit of additional <b>insulation</b> <b>levels</b> and provides recommendations for optimal <b>insulation</b> <b>levels</b> for Mediterranean climates...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} aerial thermography data to discriminate loft (attic) <b>insulation</b> <b>levels</b> in residential housing, with ventilated pitched roofs, in the UK. Quantitative techniques from the fields of remote sensing, GIS, building physics and atmospheric science were used to develop a methodology and analyse survey data flown over Nottingham in 2001. The quantitative techniques were applied to real survey data using the most up to date atmospheric propagation models. A new model of the heat loss through the ceiling, loft and roof was developed for this study, based on the most recent methods. The limitations of these techniques were explored. A complete methodology, valid for any future study, was defined. It was found that, measuring roof surface temperature from the thermal image was complicated by roof material properties, the intervening atmosphere and the surrounding topography. Relating roof surface temperature to insulation thickness was further complicated by loft space ventilation and the outside surface heat balance. The additional data, needed to quantify the results, produced inaccuracies caused by measurement error. Analysis of the uncertainties, by simulation, indicated that loft <b>insulation</b> <b>level</b> could not be discriminated by aerial thermography. This was confirmed by comparing the results, calculated from the survey data, with the actual <b>insulation</b> <b>level</b> {{for a number of}} houses in test areas of the city.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} cost minimizing thermal wall designs in residential buildings by the two fold approach of determining optimal <b>insulation</b> <b>levels</b> and utilizing the effectiveness of the ground as a thermal barrier. To approach the problem cost and savings functions were defined to simulate the experimental wall's structural and thermal characteristics. Insulated wall structures up to 20 inches thick were examined so costs resulting from each change in <b>insulation</b> <b>level</b> within the wall reflected any additional expenditures necessitated by thickened wall designs. The savings generated by each additional <b>level</b> of <b>insulation</b> were estimated by engineering procedures recommended by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers. When net savings from insulation and wall grounding were optimized together, a provision was made in the mathematical model to place the walls deeper in the ground in steps of 10 percent of the total wall height. Such an approach defined a systematic manner of examining the use of the ground as a thermal barrier. Fuel savings resulting from applications of wall insulation were distinguished from those attributable to the placement of the wall in relation to the ground level in the following way: Reductions in heat flow across any section of the model home's thermal envelope which resulted as successive <b>insulation</b> <b>levels</b> were applied to that portion of the wall, were attributed to the thermal insulation.

The minimization of suitably defined performance indices, which relate the failures caused by lightning in a transmission line to both line <b>insulation</b> <b>level</b> and tower footing resistance, is aimed. Optimum values for both line <b>insulation</b> <b>level</b> and tower footing resistance are calculated. The method is applied on several operating Hellenic transmission lines of 150 and 400 kV, respectively, carefully selected among others, due to their high failure rates during lightning thunderstorms. Special {{attention has been paid}} on open loop lines, where a possible failure could bring the system out of service causing significant problems. The obtained design parameters, which reduce the failure rates caused by lightning, are compared with the existing design parameters of the transmission lines leading up to useful conclusions. The proposed optimization method can be proved a valuable tool to the studies of electric power systems designers, intending to reduce the failure rates caused by lightning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
