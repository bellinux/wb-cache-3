40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Perhaps {{the most}} {{positive}} aspect of the current HVAC conditions at the Library involve {{the interest of the}} University Operations and Maintenance and their willingness to work with the Law Library to find solutions. This department has previously taken steps (such as the installation of a <b>recording</b> <b>hygrometer)</b> to address some of the issues in the Law Library. A second positive area is the interest in the Dean of the Law School to identify the funds necessary to make improvements. These are situations not found on every campus and they suggest that the Library 2 ̆ 7 s problems, no matter how large they may seem, can be brought under control. Equally positive is the interest in preservation {{on the part of the}} Library 2 ̆ 7 s director, Ann Puckett, Esq. I encourage the Library to maintain the current momentum. The Library does have a variety of serious problems relating to the current environmental conditions and to any efforts to achieve and maintain a preservation environment. Foremost among these problems are (1) the design of the current HVAC system, which is not intended to maintain adequate humidity control, (2) the absence of adequate moderate or long-term environmental monitoring records, and (3) the very poor level of building cleanliness. These problems are currently manifested in what appear to be high levels of mold in the building and a system which cannot adequately control the humidity level of the building and collections. It is likely that the solution to these issues will require a two pronged approach of capital improvement - - replacing and/ or modifying HVAC equipment - - and an overall building cleaning program - - sufficient to reduce the mold load in the collections. While delayed maintenance programs may be a necessary approach to classrooms and dorms, it is shortsighted to delay maintenance of the Library considering its houses a 19 + million investment in books and other educational materials. The loss or damage of this collection could create a situation from which the University would have trouble recovering. Every effort possible should be taken to protect this in vestment. For the bulk of the recommendations offered below there is also some indication of the urgency of the proposed work. Virtually all of the proposed modifications and changes can be accomplished within a 5 -year plan and many are of such significance to the well-being of the collection that they should be implemented within the next year...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Measurements {{of sweat}} rate in {{tropical}} and Japanese subjects were perform-ed in an environmental control chamber (room temperature 28 •Ž, humidity 60 %). Local thermal sweating responses. The indicators of thermoregulatory heat loss responses such as sweat onset time, threshold oral temperature for sweating and sweat volumes (for 20 min during heat load, for 5 min after heat load) etc. were simultaneously measured by using thermography and capacitance hygrometer-sweat capture capsule method. By analyzing {{the data of}} tropical inhabitants and Japanese (sportsmen and non-sportsmen), the central and peripheral mechanism of heat acclimatization were investigated. In this study, a new quantitative calibration by using capacitance hygrometer-sweat capture capsule method was devised, i. e., {{on the top of}} the capsule fixed to the skin of sub-ject, a small hole was made, through which, subject's sweat or 30 •Ž 0. 45 % NaCl solu-tions (0. 01, 0. 02, 0. 03 and 0. 04 ml) were precisely dropped into the capsule with a micropipette and hole sealed. Relative humidity changes (%RH) of the capsule were con-tinuously <b>recorded</b> by capacitance <b>hygrometer.</b> By calculating the absolute numidity from relative humidity, sweat rate (mg/cm 2 •Emin) could be obtained and sweat volum...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} contribution of observed changes in lower stratospheric water vapour to stratospheric temperature variations {{over the past}} three decades using a comprehensive global climate model (GCM). Three case studies are considered. In the first, the net increase in stratospheric water vapour (SWV) from 1980 – 2010 (derived from the Boulder frost-point <b>hygrometer</b> <b>record</b> using the gross assumption that this is globally representative) is estimated to have cooled the lower stratosphere by up to ∼ 0. 2 K decade− 1 in the global and annual mean; this is ∼ 40 % of the observed cooling trend over this period. In the Arctic winter stratosphere there is a dynamical response to the increase in SWV, with enhanced polar cooling of 0. 6 K decade− 1 at 50 hPa and warming of 0. 5 K decade− 1 at 1 hPa. In the second case study, the observed decrease in tropical lower stratospheric water vapour after the year 2000 (imposed in the GCM as a simplified representation of the observed changes derived from satellite data) is estimated to have caused a relative increase in tropical lower stratospheric temperatures by ∼ 0. 3 K at 50 hPa. In the third case study, the wintertime dehydration in the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex (again using a simplified representation of the changes seen in a satellite dataset) is estimated to cause a relative warming of the Southern Hemisphere polar stratosphere by up to 1 K at 100 hPa from July–October. This is accompanied by a weakening of the westerly winds on the poleward flank of the stratospheric jet by up to 1. 5 m s− 1 in the GCM. The results show that, if the measurements are representative of global variations, SWV should be considered as important a driver of transient and long-term variations in lower stratospheric temperature over the past 30 years as increases in long-lived greenhouse gases and stratospheric ozone depletion...|$|R
