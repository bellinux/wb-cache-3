5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap shrouds, elevators, rudders and sections of the fins. The skin panels are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown that this type of panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater <b>rolling</b> <b>moment</b> and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{gradient}} is also {{a hazard}} for aircraft making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident. The <b>rolling</b> <b>moment</b> generated by the different airflow over each wing can exceed the aileron control authority, causing the glider to continue rolling into a steeper bank angle.|$|E

50|$|A {{positive}} {{sideslip angle}} generates empennage incidence {{which can cause}} positive or negative roll moment depending on its configuration. For any non-zero sideslip angle dihedral wings causes a <b>rolling</b> <b>moment</b> which tends to return the aircraft to the horizontal, as does back swept wings.

5000|$|Roll creates counter {{rotational}} {{forces on}} both starboard and port wings whilst also generating such forces at the empennage.

40|$|The {{decay of}} three wake vortex pairs of B- 747 {{aircraft}} in a convectively driven atmospheric boundary layer is investigated {{by means of}} large-eddy simulations (LES). This situation is considered as being hazardous as the updraft velocities of a thermal may compensate the induced descent speed of the vortex pair resulting in vortices stalled in the flight path. The LES results, however, illustrate that (i) the primary rectilinear vortices are rapidly deformed {{on the scale of}} the alternating updraft and downdraft regions; (ii) parts of the vortices stay on flight level but are quickly eroded by the enhanced turbulence of an updraft; (iii) longest living sections of the vortices are found in regions of relatively calm downdraft flow which augments their descent. Strip theory calculations are used to illustrate the temporal and spatial development of lift and <b>rolling</b> <b>moments</b> experienced by a following medium weight class B- 737 aircraft. Characteristics of the respective distributions are analysed. Initially, the maximum <b>rolling</b> <b>moments</b> slightly exceed the available roll control of the B- 737.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{of the literature on}} large aircraft wake-vortex encounters in flight and in flight simulators has furnished an estimate of the level to which the vortex-induced <b>rolling</b> <b>moments</b> must be reduced in order to be perceived as nonhazardous at a 2 -n. mi. separation distance. The criteria are based on the ratio of the vortex-induced acceleration in roll to the aileron-induced roll acceleration.

Measurements of the vortex-induced <b>rolling</b> <b>moments</b> of the probe aircraft showed that the predicted alleviation did occur. The effects of landing gear extension, increased lift coefficient, idle thrust, and sideslip were investigated, and all had an adverse effect on the alleviated condition as evidenced by increased induced <b>rolling</b> <b>moments</b> of the T- 37 B probe aircraft.

5000|$|The <b>rolling</b> <b>moment</b> {{created by}} the {{side-slip}} (labelled as [...] "P") tends to roll the aircraft back to wings level. More dihedral effect tries to roll the wings in the [...] "levelling" [...] direction more strongly, and less dihedral effect tries to roll the wings in the [...] "levelling" [...] direction less strongly. Dihedral effect helps stabilise the spiral mode by tending to roll the wings toward level {{in proportion to the}} amount of side-slip that builds up. It's not the whole picture however. At the same time that angle of side-slip is building up, the vertical fin is trying to turn the nose back into the wind, much like a weathervane, minimizing the amount of side-slip that can be present. If there is no side-slip, there can be no restoring <b>rolling</b> <b>moment.</b> If there is less side-slip, there is less restoring <b>rolling</b> <b>moment.</b> Yaw stability {{created by the}} vertical fin opposes the tendency for dihedral effect to roll the wings back level by limiting side-slip.|$|E

5000|$|In aeronautics, keel {{effect is}} the result of the sideforce-generating {{surfaces}} being above (or below) the center of mass (which coincides with the center of gravity) in any aircraft. Examples of such surfaces are the vertical stabilizer, rudder, and parts of the fuselage. When an aircraft is in a sideslip, these surfaces generate sidewards lift forces. If the surface is above or below the center of gravity, the sidewards lift forces generate a <b>rolling</b> <b>moment.</b> This [...] "rolling moment caused by sideslip" [...] is [...] "dihedral effect". Keel effect is the contribution of these side forces to <b>rolling</b> <b>moment</b> (as sideslip increases), i.e. keel effect is the contribution of the side forces to dihedral effect. Sideforce producing surfaces above the center of gravity will increase dihedral effect, while sideforce producing surfaces below the center of gravity will decrease dihedral effect.|$|E

40|$|Vortex wake {{alleviation}} {{studies were}} conducted in a wind tunnel and a water towing tank using a multisegmented wing model which provided controlled and measured variations in span load. Fourteen model configurations are tested at a Reynolds number of one million and a lift coefficient of 0. 6 in the Langley 4 - by 7 -Meter Tunnel and the Hydronautics Ship Model Basin water tank at Hydronautics, Inc., Laurel, Md. Detailed measurements of span load and wake velocities at one semispan downstream correlate well with each other, with inviscid predictions of span load and wake roll up, and with peak trailing-wing <b>rolling</b> <b>moments</b> measured in the far wake. Average trailing-wing <b>rolling</b> <b>moments</b> {{are found to be}} an unreliable indicator of vortex wake intensity because vortex meander does not scale between test facilities and free-air conditions. A tapered-span-load configuration, which exhibits little or no drag penalty, is shown to offer significant downstream wake alleviation to a small trailing wing. The greater downstream wake alleviation achieved with the addition of spoilers to a flapped-wing configuration is shown to result directly from the high incremental drag and turbulence associated with the spoilers and not from the span load alteration they cause...|$|R
40|$|The random {{motions of}} the vortex {{elements}} behind a wing that sheds a disturbed, translating array of vortices are analyzed. The analysis indicates that the wake would diffuse and decay rapidly when viscosity is present and would produce small <b>rolling</b> <b>moments</b> on encountering aircraft.

5000|$|Keel {{effect is}} also called [...] "Pendulum Effect" [...] because a lower {{center of gravity}} {{increases}} the effect of sideways forces (above the center of gravity) in producing a <b>rolling</b> <b>moment.</b> This is because the moment arm is longer, not because of gravitational forces.

50|$|Dihedral {{effect of}} an {{aircraft}} is a <b>rolling</b> <b>moment</b> {{resulting from the}} vehicle having a non-zero angle of side-slip. Increasing the dihedral angle of an aircraft increases the dihedral effect on it. However, many other aircraft parameters also have a strong influence on dihedral effect.
