In this method, the integrated water vapor amount on a pixel by pixel basis {{is derived from the}} 0. 94 micron and 1. 14 micron water vapor absorption features. The transmission spectra of H 2 O, CO 2, O 3, N 2 O, CO, CH 4, and O 2 in the 0. 4 - 2. 5 micron region are simulated. The scattering effect due to atmospheric molecules and aerosols is modeled with the 5 S computer code. The AVIRIS radiances are divided by solar irradiances above the atmosphere to obtain the apparent <b>reflectances.</b> The scaled surface <b>reflectances</b> are derived from the apparent <b>reflectances</b> using the simulated atmospheric gaseous transmittances and the simulated molecular and aerosol scattering data. The scaled surface <b>reflectances</b> differ from the real surface <b>reflectances</b> by a multiplicative factor. In order to convert the scaled surface <b>reflectances</b> into real surface <b>reflectances,</b> the slopes and aspects of the surfaces must be known...|$|R

Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum.

5|$|The Moon has an {{exceptionally}} low albedo, {{giving it a}} <b>reflectance</b> that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun.

5|$|The most {{frequently}} used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the <b>reflectance</b> of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface <b>reflectance,</b> {{which has led to}} other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, {{it is important to have}} continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.|$|E

25|$|Earth's surface albedo is {{regularly}} estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA's MODIS instruments {{on board the}} Terra and Aqua satellites, and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite <b>reflectance</b> measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical <b>reflectance</b> and bi-hemispherical <b>reflectance</b> (e.g.,). These calculations {{are based on the}} bidirectional <b>reflectance</b> distribution function (BRDF), which describes how the <b>reflectance</b> of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle.

SEVIRI, the MSG main radiometer, measures the reflected solar radiation within three spectral bands centered at 0. 6, 0. 8 and 1. 6 m, and within a broad band similar to the VIS channel of MVIRI, the radiometer on-board the first generation of METEOSAT satellites. The operational calibration of these channels relies on modelled <b>reflectances</b> over bright desert sites, as no in-flight calibration device is available.

Provided that the atmosphere is reasonably transparent at the wavelengths, the aerosol burden is reasonably light, 0. 64 -m optical depth less than 0. 2; the particles constituting the aerosol are reasonably large, {{as is the case}} for marine aerosols; and the solar zenith angle is less than about 35 °, the linear relationships between <b>reflectances</b> at different wavelengths are rather insensitive to the factors that govern the <b>reflectances</b> themselves. The relationships are remarkably insensitive to atmospheric composi-tion, surface wind speed and direction, illumination, and viewing geometry. The slopes and offsets of the linear relationships are used to assess the relative accuracies of the calibrations of the different channels.

40|$|This {{methodology}} {{assesses the}} accuracy with which remote data characterizes a surface, {{as a function}} of Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM). The purpose is to identify the best remote data that improves the characterization of a surface, evaluating the number of bands in the spectral range. The first step creates an accurate dataset of remote simulated data, using in situ hyperspectral <b>reflectances.</b> The second step evaluates the capability of remote simulated data to characterize this surface. The spectral similarity measurements, which are obtained using classifiers, provide this capability. The third step examines the precision of this capability. The assumption is that in situ hyperspectral <b>reflectances</b> are considered the “real” <b>reflectances.</b> They are resized with the same spectral range of the remote data. The spectral similarity measurements which are obtained from “real” resized <b>reflectances,</b> are considered “real” measurements. Therefore, the quantity and magnitude of “errors” (i. e., differences between spectral similarity measurements obtained from “real” resized <b>reflectances</b> and from remote data) provide the accuracy {{as a function of}} FWHM. This methodology was applied to evaluate the accuracy with which CHRIS-mode 1, CHRIS-mode 2, Landsat 5 -TM, MIVIS and PRISMA data characterize three coastal waters.
