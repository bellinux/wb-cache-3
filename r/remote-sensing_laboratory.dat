40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{acquisition}} and processing of Bistatic SAR data using SABRINA-X, and with TerraSAR-X as the transmitter of opportunity. SABRINA-X is an X-band receiver {{system that has}} been recently designed at the UPC <b>Remote-Sensing</b> <b>Laboratory,</b> while TerraSARX is a German satellite for SAR-based active remote-sensing. Prior to the particular case of acquiring TerraSAR-X signals, the hardware aspects of SABRINAX have been investigated further, and improved as necessary (or suggested for up-gradation in future). Two successful data acquisitions have been carried out, to obtain bistatic SAR images of the Barcelona harbor, with the receiver set-up at the close-by Montjuïc hill. Each acquisition campaign necessitated an accurate prediction of the satellite overpass time and precise orientation of the antennas to acquire the direct signal from the satellite and the backscattered signals off the viewed terrain. The thesis also investigates {{the characteristics of the}} acquired signals, which is critical as regards the subsequent processing for imaging and interferometric applications. The hardware limitations, combined with ‘off-nominal’ transmissions of the satellite, necessitate improved range processing of the acquired signals. The thesis expounds the possible range compression techniques, and suggests ways for improved compression, thereby improving the quality of the subsequently processed images...|$|E
40|$|Critical to {{spectral}} {{interpretations of}} geologic surfaces on the Earth and Mars is {{an understanding of}} the relationship between the composition of weathered rock surfaces and whole-rock mineralogy. In this study, thermal infrared spectroscopic and remote-sensing analyses were used to determine the composition of weathered granitoid rock surfaces in the Sacaton Mountains, Arizona. A linear spectral deconvolution approach was employed to determine the mineralogies of naturally exposed, weathered surfaces and artificially exposed, fresh rock surfaces. Deconvolution results from fresh rock surfaces yield similar bulk mineralogy to results from point counting of rock slabs and thin sections. Deconvolution of weathered rock spectra indicate that compared to fresh samples, weathered surfaces are deficient in plagioclase feldspar and are enriched in clay minerals. The differential weathering of feldspar minerals impacts the interpretation of whole-rock mineralogy and the spectral classification of bedrock geology, which, for plutonic rocks, is dependent on the relative proportions of different feldspars. Deconvolutions of multispectral <b>remote-sensing</b> or <b>laboratory</b> data show a deficiency of total feldspar in the weathered rock units but lack sufficient spectral resolution for the discrimination between different feldspars. These results demonstrate that the differential breakdown and removal of primary minerals in rock surfaces due to weathering can affect the interpreted rock petrology from remote-sensing studies. The relationships observed in our granitic samples could be applied to any rock type and may be important to consider for remote sensing of Mars. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.

30|$|Analyses of {{returned}} samples {{provide the}} opportunity to overcome the constraints imposed by remote-sensing and in situ studies of bodies {{in our solar system}} (Gaffey et al. 1989). Recently, the Hayabusa mission collected surface regolith samples (unconsolidated surface deposits) from the S-type near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa and returned them to Earth for laboratory study. More than 1500 particles were identified, ranging in size from 3 to 180  μm (Nakamura et al. 2011). Mineralogical and oxygen isotope analyses revealed that the composition of the particles is consistent with LL 5 - 6 chondrite composition (Nakamura et al. 2011; Yurimoto et al. 2011; Nakashima et al. 2013). The return of the Hayabusa samples has provided us the strongest evidence that the most common meteorites in our collections, the ordinary chondrites, are derived from the S-type asteroids (Nakamura et al. 2011; Thompson et al. 2014). The Hayabusa samples are the second extraterrestrial regolith, after the lunar samples, which can give us information about surface modification processes on airless bodies such as energetic particle irradiation and micrometeoroid impacts. The resulting optical, physical, and chemical effects of these processes are collectively known as space weathering (Clark et al. 2002; Thompson et al. 2014). Understanding space weathering on asteroids can connect <b>remote-sensing</b> observations with <b>laboratory</b> studies and can lead {{to a better understanding of}} the evolution of asteroid soils (e.g. Clark et al. 2002). Micrometeoroid impacts, which are the most important agents of space weathering on the Moon, cause melting, vaporization, and recondensation of the target and projectile (Thompson et al. 2014). Microcraters, shock lamellae, and splash features that were formed by micrometeoroid impacts have been found on the surfaces of regolith grains from Itokawa, although previous studies concluded that they are rare compared to these features found on lunar regolith (Nakamura 2012). Solar wind produced radiation-damaged rims on the surfaces of Itokawa particles, first found in the lunar soil (Keller and McKay 1997), imply that space weathering due to solar-wind irradiation is also significant on asteroids (Noguchi et al. 2014; Thompson et al. 2014). Small circular surface bubbles or “blisters” on Itokawa particles provide evidence of solar-wind irradiation (Matsumoto et al. 2014) on timescales of hundreds to tens of thousands of years (Assonov et al. 1998). The low surface gravity of asteroid Itokawa (~ 10 − 4  m/s 2) compared to the Moon (1.6  m/s 2) may cause micrometeoroid impact residue to be distributed over large areas (Hirata et al. 2009). Evidence for this effect on the surfaces of Itokawa particles would be impact-ejected particles from the target (Itokawa) that traveled far from the impact site. Previous studies suggest that Itokawa dust particles lacking visible microcraters on their surfaces might have still experienced shock metamorphism and were involved in collisional fragmentation that resulted in the formation of regolith (Langenhorst et al. 2014). We analyzed the surfaces of two Itokawa particles using high-resolution techniques to investigate the nature of solar-wind blisters, splash-melt residues, and small adhering particles and the role of micrometeoroid impacts. The goal of this study is to characterize and understand the formation of surface microstructures and adhering particles. We assess whether the adhering particles are contamination from the laboratory or spacecraft, debris from a foreign impactor (micrometeoroid), debris from the target (Itokawa), or lithic fragments resulting from fracturing of regolith particles.|$|R
