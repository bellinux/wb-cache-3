When chiral allylmetals are used for nucleophilic addition reaction to achiral aldehydes, the chirality of the newly generated alcohol carbon is determined by the chirality of the allymetal reagents (Figure 1).

Using a crystal structure of an oxazolidine derivative as a starting point, a thiazolidine ligand family was designed, synthesized and finally employed as catalysts in the asymmetric epoxidation of benzaldehyde. The ligands were prepared starting from L-valine, L-tert-leucine, D-penicillamine and L-cysteine. The differently tuned thiazolidine ligands were demonstrated to catalyze the formation of trans-stilbene oxide with varying enantioselectivities.
