5|$|The Welsh {{were also}} early adopters of <b>roasting</b> cheese. An early {{incarnation}} of Welsh rarebit {{was being made}} in medieval times, and {{by the middle of}} the 15th century Rarebit was considered a national dish. The acid soil of Wales meant that the milk produced by their cattle created a soft cheese, which was not as good for <b>roasting,</b> so Welsh people would trade for harder cheeses such as Cheddar.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is {{obtained}} through extractive metallurgy: it is {{extracted from the}} ore by conventional <b>roasting</b> and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75% purity. In many stainless steel applications, 75% pure nickel can be used without further purification, depending on the impurities.|$|E
5|$|Thallium {{is found}} in the {{minerals}} crookesite TlCu7Se4, hutchinsonite TlPbAs5S9, and lorándite TlAsS2. Thallium also occurs as a trace element in iron pyrite, and thallium is extracted as a by-product of <b>roasting</b> this mineral for the production of sulfuric acid.|$|E

5|$|The {{sulfur dioxide}} {{is used for}} the {{production}} of sulfuric acid, which is necessary for the leaching process. If deposits of zinc carbonate, zinc silicate, or zinc spinel (like the Skorpion Deposit in Namibia) are used for zinc production, the <b>roasting</b> can be omitted.|$|E
5|$|Beer colour is {{determined}} by the malt. The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. Pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke. Coke was first used for <b>roasting</b> malt in 1642, {{but it was not until}} around 1703 that the term pale ale was used.|$|E
5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry <b>roasting</b> and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either <b>roasting</b> (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, vanadinite {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by <b>roasting</b> and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E

5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and <b>roasting,</b> and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E
5|$|Ferrochromium alloy is commercially {{produced}} from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by <b>roasting</b> and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium. Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development was {{the discovery that}} steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, the iron must {{be separated from the}} chromium in a two step <b>roasting</b> and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|E

It also serves pies (cottage pie, shepherd's pie, and others), salads and other traditional dishes.|$|R
50|$|In Korea, <b>roasted</b> barley is {{also often}} {{combined}} with <b>roasted</b> corn, as the corn's sweetness offsets the slightly bitter {{flavor of the}} barley. The tea made from <b>roasted</b> corn is called oksusu-cha (corn tea), and the tea made from <b>roasted</b> corn and <b>roasted</b> barley is called oksusu-bori-cha (corn barley tea). Several similar drinks made from <b>roasted</b> grains include: hyeonmi-cha (brown rice tea), gyeolmyeongja-cha (sicklepod seed tea), and memil-cha (buckwheat tea).|$|R
5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and <b>roasting</b> it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{separation}} of cobalt from copper and nickel. They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. One separation step involves froth flotation, in which surfactants bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent <b>roasting</b> converts the ores to the cobalt sulfate, whereas the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. Leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the arsenates. The residues are further leached with sulfuric acid, yielding a solution of copper sulfate. Cobalt can also be leached from the slag of copper smelting.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{chromate}} {{is produced}} industrially by the oxidative <b>roasting</b> of chromite ore with calcium or sodium carbonate. The dominant species is therefore, {{by the law}} of mass action, determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E
50|$|Common dry <b>roasted</b> foods include peanut butter, {{which is}} made from peanuts that have been dry <b>roasted,</b> tea, {{which is made}} from tea leaves that have been dry <b>roasted</b> (either {{immediately}} after picking or after fermentation), and coffee and chocolate, which are made from <b>roasted</b> coffee beans and <b>roasted</b> cocoa beans, respectively.|$|R

5|$|The starch {{source in}} a beer {{provides}} the fermentable material {{and is a}} key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. Different <b>roasting</b> times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It {{is the first}} element in group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, <b>roasting,</b> and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, {{and with}} some exceptions, lithophile heavy metals can be {{extracted}} from their ores by electrical or chemical treatments, while chalcophile heavy metals are obtained by <b>roasting</b> their sulphide ores to yield the corresponding oxides, and then heating these to obtain the raw metals. Radium occurs in quantities {{too small to be}} economically mined and is instead obtained from spent nuclear fuels. The chalcophile platinum group metals (PGM) mainly occur in small (mixed) quantities with other chalcophile ores. The ores involved need to be smelted, roasted, and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a residue of PGM. This is chemically refined to obtain the individual metals in their pure forms. Compared to other metals, PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E
