40|$|ABSTRACT. Despite {{the recent}} {{increasing}} research {{focus on the}} impact of <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> on economic development, which has been spurred by the improvement of existing regional trade relationship and the introduction of new regional economic cooperation schemes, few quantitative studies on the magnitudes of the efficiency effect of trade integration have been conducted. The current study extends the existing literature by providing a quantitative measure of the efficiency effect of regional integration in the Arab World. The paper studies the effect of <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> {{in the context of a}} neoclassical production function. The empirical results suggest, ceteris paribus, that Arab countries can improve the technical efficiency of their physical stocks and human assets by approximately 14 percent simply by promoting <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> among the countries in the region.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> shifts {{the burden of}} the {{exchange}} rate adjustment towards the less integrated trading partners. Thus, they bear the cost of trade balance expansion, while competitive exchange rate moves vis-a-vis RTA trading partners result in no expansion or deterioration of the overall trade balance. First, using the data on 138 countries since 1990 that have been envolved in <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> through signing regional trade agreements (RTAs), this paper shows that upon a 10 % depreciation towards non-RTA trading partners results in a 4. 4 % improvement of the aggregate trade balance. A similar competitive depreciation towards RTA trading partners has resulted on average 3. 7 % deterioration of the aggregate trade balance. Second, I confirm that RTA participation can act as a good proxy for trade integration, and test the results with alternative measures of trade balance. Third, I use a simple model framework based on the current account adjustments to put the empirical findings into the theoretical frame. Altogether, this paper indicates that <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> in the form of RTA should be taken into account in questions related to the competitive exchange rate effects and trade balance adjustment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirical literature by providing a quantitative measurement {{of the influence of}} <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> on productivity. For this purpose we address the link between trade and productivity thanks to knowledge spillovers in a multi-country model. The interdependence that connects countries in an international web promotes exchanges of goods, services, people, capital and hence ideas, knowledge, innovation, and technology. Economic integration encourages thus both new ideas and their diffusion. We observe that a country’s productivity depends on its own R&D efforts as well as the R&D efforts of its trading partners. These R&D spillovers can then spread across countries and sectors. Thanks to the transfer of technology allowed by bilateral trade and investment, <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> has a positive impact on long-term growth. ...|$|E
40|$|Globalization {{process has}} entailed trade openness, greater {{emphasis}} on foreign direct investment, stabilization policies, redefining {{the role of the}} state, among others. Given that another major global trend observed is one of <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration,</b> the paper explores whether due to this trend there has been any concrete relationship with the growth convergence/divergence outcomes. Tests of Beta-convergence under different model specifications suggest that over time developed and developing countries have not converged in terms of their real per capita GDP though they have converged within their own groups of developed and developing countries. Thus, it is concluded that <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> leads to growth convergence regionally and both openness to global trade and regional trade openness are important. However, the results of the paper need to be interpreted with caution due to the presence of non-stationarity, though the problem is not uniform across variables, tests and regional groupings. A policy inference that can be drawn is that at the global level economic cooperation for economic growth convergence needs to be flagged and appropriate institutional mechanisms created to intensify the processes of trade and FDI integration. Broadly, the results are in consonance with the predictions of the New Growth Theories. globalization, FDI, <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration,</b> economic cooperation for economic growth convergence...|$|E

Although gravity models have been extensively used to measure bilateral trade among countries, they have—to the best of our knowledge—never been used to measure intra-Arab trade. Our results suggest that intra-Arab trade and Arab trade with the rest of the world are lower than what would be predicted by the gravity equation, suggesting considerable scope for regional—as well as multilateral—integration.

This article provides an empirical case study {{of the impact of}} <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> in the Andean Pact in the 1990 s on the strategies and organization of British American Tobacco (BAT), using internal tobacco industry documents. BAT conducted an integrated strategy by lobbying on tax and tariff rates and intellectual property regulations, whilst simultaneously adapting its market strategies and attempting to modify its internal organization. The company incorporated substantial sales in illicit markets into its strategy, and launched new legal export operations within the region, in part to assert ownership over contested trademarks. It attempted to significantly modify its internal organization by better integrating its national operating companies on a regional basis, but was only partially successful in this due to resistance from its powerful Brazilian subsidiary. Changes in intellectual property rules also intensified competition between BAT and its main competitor, Philip Morris, culminating in a legal dispute between the two firms and leading BAT to develop a more coherent strategy on trademark ownership.
