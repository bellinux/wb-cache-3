The intended purpose of these structures is to make the reactant fluxes uniform {{to the edge of the}} wafer and so prevent a larger than desired edge exclusion where useful products cannot be obtained. The wafer-focus <b>ring</b> <b>gap</b> typically 1 mm is a mechanical requirement to allow for the motion of the wafer onto and off of the substrate.

The film thickness data {{was used to evaluate}} {{the extent to which the}} Oil Puddle Theory predicts variations seen in the actual oil consumption. A tritium radiotracer oil consumption measurement system with an accuracy of 94. 6 % was designed and constructed. This was used to perform direct measurements of the test engine oil consumption in two different test matrices. The first evaluated a piston ring configuration with the rings free to rotate. The second evaluated configurations with the top ring and second piston rings pinned to fix the azimuthal location of the end-gap; the azimuth of the top ring was varied. In the second test matrix, the oil film thickness on the piston's second land was measured, and predictions were made on the basis of that measurement. The first test matrix results indicated only a weak speed dependence and a large amount of variability in the oil consumption measurements. The second test matrix results showed an oil consumption speed dependence that was a function of top gap azimuth. Speed normalized results showed that the oil consumption was larger when the end-gap was on the thrust side of the test engine than when on the anti-thrust side. Measured oil consumption differed substantially from that predicted. This was found to be due to difficulties in determining effective <b>ring</b> <b>gap</b> flow areas and due to a previously un-documented azimuthal variation in second land oil film thickness. However, analysis of the results also indicates that the Puddle Theory is still a plausible oil consumption mechanism. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rings</b> and <b>gaps</b> {{are being}} {{observed}} in {{an increasing number}} of disks around young stellar objects. We illustrate the formation of such radial structures through idealized, 2 D (axisymmetric) resistive MHD simulations of coupled disk-wind systems threaded by a relatively weak poloidal magnetic field (plasma-β∼ 10 ^ 3). We find two distinct modes of accretion depending on the resistivity and field strength. A small resistivity or high field strength promotes the development of rapidly infalling `avalanche accretion streams' in a vertically extended disk envelope that dominates the dynamics of the system, especially the mass accretion. The streams are suppressed in simulations with larger resistivities or lower field strengths, where most of the accretion instead occurs through a laminar disk. In these simulations, the disk accretion is driven mainly by a slow wind that is typically accelerated by the pressure gradient from a predominantly toroidal magnetic field. Both wind-dominated and stream-dominated modes of accretion create prominent features in the surface density distribution of the disk, including <b>rings</b> and <b>gaps,</b> with a strong spatial variation of the magnetic flux relative to the mass. Regions with low mass-to-flux ratios accrete quickly, leading to the development of gaps, whereas regions with higher mass-to-flux ratios tend to accrete more slowly, allowing matter to accumulate and form dense rings. In some cases, avalanche accretion streams are observed to produce dense rings directly through continuous feeding. We discuss the implications of <b>ring</b> and <b>gap</b> formation driven by winds and streams on grain growth and planet formation. Comment: 23 pages, 10 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|R

In the {{nucleated}} instability {{picture of}} gas giant formation, {{the final stage}} is the rapid accretion of a massive gas envelope by a solid core, bringing about a tenfold or more increase in mass.

40|$|Radial {{substructures}} in circumstellar disks are now routinely {{observed by}} ALMA. There is also growing observational evidence that such disks can accrete through angular momentum removal by rotating disk winds. We show through idealized 2 D (axisymmetric) simulations that <b>rings</b> and <b>gaps</b> develop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems {{on the scale}} of tens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD effect. In simulations where the magnetic field and bulk neutral matter are only moderately coupled, relatively laminar disk accretion occurs while the spatial distribution of radial electric current is steepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic field sharply reverses polarity in this current layer, generating a large magnetic torque that drives fast accretion and drags the poloidal magnetic field into an elongated radial configuration. The reconnection of this radial field creates magnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux is greatly reduced. The regions with reduced poloidal magnetic flux accrete more slowly creating dense rings and the neighboring regions where the magnetic flux is concentrated accrete faster and form gaps. In better magnetically coupled simulations, we find the continuous development of the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' near the disk surface that render the disk-wind system more chaotic. Nevertheless, prominent <b>rings</b> and <b>gaps</b> are still present. We suggest that they are also produced, at least in part, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal field and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the reconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows. The formation of <b>rings</b> and <b>gaps</b> in rapidly accreting yet laminar disks has interesting implications for dust settling and trapping, grain growth, and planet formation.

40|$|Abstract: Ring and {{cylinder}} bore wear {{may not be}} a problem in most current automotive engines. However, a small change in ring face and {{cylinder bore}} diameter can significantly affect the lubrication characteristics and ring axial motion. This in turn can cause to change inter-ring pressure, blow-by and oil consumption in an engine. Therefore, by predicting the wear of piston ring face and cylinder bore altogether, the changed ring end gap and the changed volume of gas reservoir can be calculated. Then the excessive oil consumption can be predicted. Here, the oil amount through top <b>ring</b> <b>gap</b> into combustion chamber is estimated as engine oil consumption. Furthermore, the wear theories of ring and cylinder bore are included.
