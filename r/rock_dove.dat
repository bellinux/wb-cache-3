5|$|The largest {{range of}} any species {{is that of}} the <b>rock</b> <b>dove.</b> This species had a large natural {{distribution}} from Britain and Ireland to northern Africa, across Europe, Arabia, Central Asia, India, the Himalayas and up into China and Mongolia. The range of the species increased dramatically upon domestication, as the species went feral in cities around the world. The species is currently resident across most of North America, and has established itself in cities and urban areas in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The species is not the only pigeon to have increased its range due to the actions of man; several other species have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity, and other species have increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity.|$|E
5|$|The primary playable {{character}} in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is the human}} protagonist, a boisterous hunter-gatherer {{who lives in a}} cave in the wilderness. Her eight potential love interests in the original version of the game, who together form the rest of the main cast, are Ryouta Kawara, a <b>rock</b> <b>dove</b> and the protagonist's sickly but hardworking childhood friend; Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, a fantail pigeon and snobbish French aristocrat; Sakuya's older half-brother Yuuya Sakazaki, a popular and flirtatious but strangely secretive fantail pigeon; Nageki Fujishiro, a quiet, bookish mourning dove who never seems to leave the library; San Oko, an athletic, hyperactive fantail pigeon who is obsessed with pudding; Anghel Higure, an eccentric Luzon bleeding-heart who behaves as if he were in some kind of fantasy role-playing game; Kazuaki Nanaki, a kind but narcoleptic button quail and the protagonist's homeroom teacher; and Shuu Iwamine, a creepy, antisocial chukar partridge who serves as the school's doctor. Azami Koshiba, a no-nonsense Java sparrow and takoyaki saleswoman, became a possible love interest in the 2014 remake.|$|E

25|$|Because {{cities are}} so highly {{impacted}} by human activities, restoration to the pristine {{state is not}} possible, however there are modifications {{that can be made}} to increase habitat without negatively impacting human needs. In urban rivers, addition of large woods and floating islands to provide habitat, modifications to walls and other structures to mimic natural banks, and buffer areas to reduce pollutants can all increase biodiversity without reducing the flood control and water supply services. Urban green spaces can be re-designed to encourage natural ecosystems rather than manicured lawns, as is seen in the National Wildlife Federation’s Backyard Wildlife Habitat program. Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), which were once endangered by pesticide use, are frequently seen nesting in tall urban buildings throughout North America, feeding chiefly on the introduced <b>rock</b> <b>dove.</b> The steep walls of buildings mimic the cliffs peregrines naturally nest in and the rock doves replace the native prey species that were driven out of urban areas.|$|E
500|$|In {{some respects}} the Hebrides lack {{biodiversity}} {{in comparison to}} mainland Britain; for example, there are only half as many mammalian species. However, these islands provide breeding grounds for many important seabird species including the world's largest colony of northern gannets. Avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, <b>rock</b> <b>dove,</b> kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye, golden eagle and white-tailed sea eagle. The last named was re-introduced to Rùm in 1975 and has successfully spread to various neighbouring islands, including Mull.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effectiveness}} of 74 -kg, white, twisted nylon twine was evaluated for deterring <b>rock</b> <b>doves</b> (Columba livia) from landing on ledges at Colorado State University 2 ̆ 7 s Hughes Stadium {{in a controlled}} experiment during 1990. One, 2, and 3 lines were stretched 8 cm in front and 12 cm above (1 line), 8 and 18 cm above (2 lines), and 5, 12, and 18 cm above (3 lines) the ledges. The proportion of successful landings to attempted landings was reduced from 0. 99 (0 lines) to 0. 23 (1 line), 0. 13 (2 lines), and 0. 10 (3 lines). The number of pretreatment landings per ledge per hour X = 24. 1) was reduced {{to an average of}} 11. 7, 7. 7, and 5. 6 landings per hour with 1, 2, and 3 lines, respectively. The proportion of doves that successfully landed increased from weekends 1 through 4 and from days 1 through 4 within weekends indicating that some <b>rock</b> <b>doves</b> learned to circumvent the lines. <b>Rock</b> <b>doves</b> likely had a greater incentive to land on ledges on our study site compared to most other sites because large roosting and nesting areas were found behind 3 of the ledges. With a lower incentive to land, nylon lines may be even more effective for deterring landings by <b>rock</b> <b>doves</b> at other sites...|$|R
500|$|The {{distinction}} between [...] "doves" [...] and [...] "pigeons" [...] is not consistent. In modern everyday speech, {{as opposed to}} scientific usage or former usage, [...] "dove" [...] frequently indicates a pigeon that is white or nearly white. However, some people use the terms [...] "dove" [...] and [...] "pigeon" [...] interchangeably. In contrast, in scientific and ornithological practice, [...] "dove" [...] tends {{to be used for}} smaller species and [...] "pigeon" [...] for larger ones, but this is in no way consistently applied. Historically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms. The species most commonly referred to as [...] "pigeon" [...] is the species known by scientists as the <b>rock</b> <b>dove,</b> one subspecies of which, the domestic pigeon, is common in many cities as the feral pigeon.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the game is a pun; the wasei-eigo word [...] means [...] "heartful", however it is also phonetically {{identical}} to the Japanese pronunciation of the English word [...] "hurtful". This is referenced in an alternate name for the Bad Boys Love route, Hurtful Boyfriend, {{as well as in the}} subtitle for the full release of the original game, Hatoful Boyfriend: Hurtful Complete Edition. The official English transliteration of the title also incorporates the Japanese word , which means [...] "pigeon" [...] or [...] "dove". Similarly, the names of several characters are puns on the Japanese names of their respective species of bird: for example, Ryouta Kawara is a <b>rock</b> <b>dove,</b> or Nageki Fujishiro is a mourning dove, or Shuu Iwamine is a chukar partridge, or and Kazuaki Nanaki is a button quail, or —the character [...] being present in his last name, [...]|$|E
2500|$|Pigeon keeping {{is the art}} {{and science}} of {{breeding}} domestic pigeons. [...] People have practised [...] pigeon keeping for about 10,000 years in almost {{every part of the}} world. [...] In that time, humans have substantially altered the morphology and the behaviour of the domesticated descendants of the <b>rock</b> <b>dove</b> to suit their needs for food, aesthetic satisfaction and entertainment.|$|E
50|$|Some urban {{species have}} a {{cosmopolitan}} (i.e. nonselective) distribution, {{in some cases}} almost global. They include house mice, cockroaches, silverfish, black rats, brown rats, house sparrows, <b>rock</b> <b>doves,</b> and feral populations of domestic species.|$|R
50|$|Pigeons, {{especially}} homing or carrier breeds, {{are well}} known {{for their ability to}} find their way home from long distances. Despite these demonstrated abilities, wild <b>rock</b> <b>doves</b> are sedentary and rarely leave their local areas.|$|R
50|$|Cliffs, {{islands and}} sea stacks are a habitat for {{breeding}} sea birds such as guillemots, kittiwakes and razor bills, {{as well as}} <b>rock</b> <b>doves</b> which can live inland as well. Peregrine falcons hunt the doves. Estuaries provide a habitat for waders and ducks, especially in winter.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>dove,</b> {{which is}} {{generally}} {{believed to be the}} ancestor of domesticated pigeons, was probably domesticated around ten thousand years ago. There are hundreds of breeds of domesticated pigeons arising from this common ancestor which are currently cultivated by pigeon fanciers. [...] Because of the large number of domesticated breeds, pigeon fanciers find it convenient for certain purposes to group sets of domesticated pigeons into larger groups.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, {{the mint}} {{introduced}} {{a series of}} commemorative coins in honour of the Canadian centennial. [...] Designed by Alex Colville, every coin produced that year featured a creature that is native to Canada: a <b>rock</b> <b>dove</b> on the 1¢ coin, a rabbit on the 5¢ coin, a mackerel on the 10¢ coin, a lynx on the 25¢ coin, a howling wolf on the 50¢ coin, and a Canada goose on the dollar. [...] A commemorative gold $20 coin was also struck for collectors' sets, with a coat of arms on the reverse. It {{is worth noting that}} the Royal Canadian Mint actually wanted to commemorate Canada's 60th anniversary in 1927 with variant coin designs.|$|E
