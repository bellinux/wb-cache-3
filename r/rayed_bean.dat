5000|$|Unlike other Melbourne radio {{stations}} that were {{based in the}} inner city areas, 3MP - as the callsign [...] "MP", which stands for Mornington Peninsula, implies - was based in the south eastern suburb of Frankston, originally from studios in Bayside Shopping Centre. The station first broadcast from a transmitter located at Rowville on 1380 kHz AM, changing to 1377 kHz AM in 1978, with its initial music format being a one-for-one mix of solid gold and current Top 40 music. Developed by the station's first General Manager, <b>Ray</b> <b>Bean,</b> and Operations Manager, Geoff Brown, it was strongly targeted at the 25-39 demographic as a less edgy version of the popular [...] "More Music" [...] 10-17 and 18-24 demographic format employed at the time by #1 rated 3XY.|$|R
50|$|In {{less than}} a year Easton moved to major provincial media, commencing at radio 2CC in Canberra. He also began doing voice-overs and {{presenting}} at Capital 7 television. In less than three-years he began working in metropolitan media after being hired by renowned radio programmer, <b>Ray</b> <b>Bean,</b> to join the on-air line-up at 2WS, in Australia's largest media market - Sydney. However at just 21 years of age, he felt out-of-place with the considerable age-gap between him and his fellow 2WS presenters, as well as the station's older music & news format and transferred to 2 Double O in Wollongong, where he also began presenting a weekly afternoon music segment on WIN Television. Easton's biggest influence and idol in radio was Ron E Sparks so when the Sydney radio legend offered him an opportunity to join the on-air line-up at Sydney's 2UW a year later, he jumped at the chance, beginning a three-year stint at the station.|$|R
5000|$|... 2UW {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{innovative}} AM radio stations in Australia during the mid-1960s through to the early 1970s thanks to the programming of <b>Ray</b> <b>Bean.</b> <b>Ray</b> introduced the NEW2UW '1110' men comprising announcers John Melouney (breakfast), John Thompson (morning), Tony McLaren (afternoon), Ward [...] "Pally" [...] Austin (drive time), Rod Christopher (early evening), and Jeff Hall (late nights and Dial A Hit on Saturday nights). They were later joined by 'Baby' John Burgess, Donnie Sutherland, Phil Hunter, Gary Stewart, Graham Sawyer and a range of others who took Top 40 radio to a new level as part of the NEW2UW format being broadcast from the Kent Street studios in Sydney. The '1110 men' also took their music to the streets with promotions in such places as beaches, parks and shopping centres. One of the most successful promotions was the NEW2UW studio at the Sydney Royal Easter Show at the old RAS showgrounds at Moore Park. This provided a unique opportunity for the radio stations stars to mingle with their listeners. In 1969 the NEW2UW managed to lure announcer John Laws from his drive time slot at 2UE and gave Laws his first morning programme in Sydney radio which was an immediate success, but also brought much confusion to the audience as the radio station went through a series of breakfast announcers and format changes which sought to capitalise on the success of the John Laws programme, while trying to hang on its huge audience - many of whom were not ready for the introduction of talk-back radio by their beloved NEW2UW.|$|R

5000|$|The Collector has a vast {{knowledge}} and {{comprehension of the}} advanced science and technology of numerous alien worlds, {{as well as a}} collection of devices and artifacts from those worlds. His armored battle-suit is made of the alien metal etherion, which amplifies the wearer's strength to superhuman levels, and it has jets that permit flight. He uses various weapons from many time periods and different worlds. Among his arsenal from Earth's past are catapults, Tibetan crystal balls that emit mystical <b>rays,</b> and magic <b>beans</b> that can conjure up warrior giants. He possesses a magic lamp that can summon a four-headed djinn with mystical powers. His [...] "boxes" [...] are rectangular [...] "interdimensional traps" [...] that can weaken a victim's strength or sanity. Other weapons include gigantic robot guards, a stun beam, and stasis beams. The Collector also has zoos of alien beasts which he can release to attack his adversaries. Among this is Snake-Eyes, an enormous alien serpent with hypnotic powers. Other items in his collection include the Obedience Potion, with which the Collector can compel a human victim to do his bidding; the Cosmic Viewer, with which he can monitor events on various worlds; a Kymellian translation/control device resembling a flute, with which he can communicate with other living beings; and a time probe enabling him to find and procure artifacts from other time periods. He uses starships holding museums of his collections, a Temporal Assimilator that allows time travel, Persian [...] "flying carpets" [...] and a [...] "flying cape" [...] that allowed flight. He formerly possessed the Infinity Gem that could control reality, but he did not understand its power.|$|R
