40|$|Trees are {{important}} datatypes {{that are often}} used in representing structured data such as XML. Though trees are widely used in sequential programming, {{it is hard to}} write efficient parallel programs manipulating <b>trees,</b> because <b>of</b> their irregular and ill-balanced structures. In this paper, we propose a solution based on the skeletal approach. We formalize a set of skeletons (abstracted computational patterns) for <b>rose</b> <b>trees</b> (general <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary shapes) based on the theory of Constructive Algorithmics. Our skeletons for <b>rose</b> <b>trees</b> are extensions <b>of</b> those proposed for lists and binary trees. We show that we can implement the skeletons efficiently in parallel, by combining the parallel binary-tree skeletons for which efficient parallel implementations are already known. As far as we are aware, we are the first who have formalized and implemented a set of simple but expressive parallel skeletons for <b>rose</b> <b>trees.</b> Ó 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Introduction Here are two puzzles {{for you to}} solve. First, {{consider}} the binary tree in Figure 1. Take a pencil (I am assuming that this is your personal copy of JFP!) and mark some of the nodes {{in such a way}} that the sum of the values of marked nodes is as large as possible. The catch is that you cannot mark all the nodes: if you mark a node, then you are not allowed to mark its parent. Equivalently, no two marked nodes can be contiguous in the tree. The second puzzle is similar though both the datatype and constraint are dierent. Consider the <b>rose</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> Figure 2 (a <b>rose</b> <b>tree</b> is a tree with arbitrary branching structure). Mark some of the nodes so that all marked nodes are now contiguous in the tree. For example, if you mark the root value 4 and the leaf value 1, then you must also mark the values 5 and 3 along the path from 4 to 1. Again the idea is to maximise the sum of the marked nodes. Of course, if all values were nonnegative, the bes...|$|R

50|$|Until the 1990s, Hickory Hill Park was at {{the edge}} of the city, and the park {{boundaries}} abutted farmlands to the north and east. However, development of the First Avenue extension to the east and Scott Avenue to the north enclosed the park, and new housing and commercial developments within this area greatly reduced the potential expansion area for Hickory Hill. Expansion plans are also limited by the adjacent Oakland Cemetery, St. Joseph’s Cemetery, and Regina High School. Other threats include trail erosion, and invasive species including garlic mustard, multiflora <b>rose,</b> and <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> heaven.|$|R

Then came the wharves and {{building}} yards of Deptford, and beyond them <b>rose</b> the <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> Greenwich Park, while the river below exhibited a forest of masts.

60|$|The {{house was}} Winifred's. Her {{father was a}} man of energy, too. He had come from the north poor. Now he was {{moderately}} rich. He had bought this fair stretch of inexpensive land, down in Hampshire. Not far from the tiny church of the almost extinct hamlet stood his own house, a commodious old farmhouse standing back from the road across a bare grassed yard. On one side of this quadrangle was the long, long barn or shed which he had made into a cottage for his youngest daughter Priscilla. One saw little blue-and-white check curtains at the long windows, and inside, overhead, the grand old timbers of the high-pitched shed. This was Prissy's house. Fifty yards away was the pretty little new cottage which he had built for his daughter Magdalen, with the vegetable garden stretching away to the oak copse. And then away beyond the lawns and <b>rose</b> <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> the house-garden went the track across a shaggy, wild grass space, towards the ridge of tall black pines that grew on a dyke-bank, through the pines and above the sloping little bog, under the wide, desolate oak trees, till there was Winifred's cottage crouching unexpectedly in front, so much alone, and so primitive.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: To enhance {{solubility}} and {{the performance}} of a plant gum (from south peach <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>China,</b> SP gum) as a drilling fluid additive, we explored the potential of Modified SP (MSP) gum by modifying it with epichlorohydrin. The modification conditions, such as the mass ratio of the crosslinking agent, pH and temperature, were optimized and the results show that 56. 40 g/ 100 g mass ratio of the crosslinking agent to SP gum with pH= 10 at the temperature of 50 °C lead to the Modified SP (MSP) gum showed the well performance in the water based drilling fluids. It was discovered that drilling fluids modified with 0. 5 %wt MSP demonstrated more excellent rheology and lower filtration than that of SP treated drilling fluids, which should be contributed to the good clay inhibition obtained from swelling experiment and high inhibitive to the hydration and swell of the mud supported by mud ball immersing experiments...|$|R

Of course, if all values were nonnegative, the best solution would be to mark all nodes. But they aren’t and the maximum sum is obtained only by a judicious choice of marking. Answers to both puzzles are given at the end of the paper. The Maximum Marking Problem (MMP) is the problem of marking the entries of some given data structure {{in such a way that}} a given constraint is satisfied and the sum of the values associated with marked entries is as large as possible. By the end of this pearl, you will be convinced that there is a linear-time solution for both the puzzles described above...|$|R

[(a 1; b 1); (a 2; b 2); :::]. Zip {{is just one of}} a whole family of functions that commute the order of two data structures. Whilst zip commutes a pair of lists into a list of pairs, {{it is not difficult to}} imagine generalising zip to a function that commutes m lists each of length n into n lists each of length m. Indeed, this latter {{function is}} also well known under the name matrix transposition. With a little bit more imagination several other members of the family suggest themselves. For example, there is a function that commutes a <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> lists all of the same length into a list <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> all <b>of</b> the same shape.
