40|$|For high-power/voltage systems, {{particularly}} for high-voltage direct current (HVDC), {{one of the}} most po-tential converter topologies is the modular mutlilevel converter (MMC). Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the switching methods studied in the literature for MMC to simultaneously achieve the three chal-lenging objectives of 1) following the reference of the current waveform requested by upper-level control, 2) mitigating on circulating current, and 3) <b>regulating</b> <b>capacitor</b> voltages of submodules. Since the MPC mod-els proposed in the literature suffers from high computation burdens making the algorithm not applicable to high-frequency switching MMCs, a binary integer programming based MPC has been proposed in this paper to optimize this multi-objective problem with minimum computing effort. The main contribution of the algorithms proposed in this paper is to significantly reduce the computation expenses by cutting the searching space from millions of feasible solutions to the incredibly low number of “ 4 ”, while taking care of the three objectives of MMC control.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. In {{vibratory}} energy harvesting, {{the energy}} flow generally goes through three stages: the external vibration energy is firstly coupled into the device as kinetic energy, which is partially converted to electricity through electromechanical conversion unit (such as electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and electrostatic), then the generated electricity {{is applied to}} the electrical load circuit. The process of such energy flow indicates that the energy coupled in the first stage determines the maximum available energy converted to electricity, while the electricity delivered to the load depends on the characteristics of electrical load circuits. Note that the first stage for coupling energy is achieved by device dynamics. To best understand vibratory energy harvesting, the effects of device dynamics and electrical load circuits on energy harvesting performance are investigated in this dissertation. For the effects of device dynamics, we do the study from four areas: parametric oscillator/device, global resonance, the roles of excitation, and dynamics outside the potential well. At first, we investigate the potential of using a nonlinear parametric oscillator/device to harvest energy. In such device, the excitation appears as a parameter of the dynamical system. Such parameterization of the excitation provides a cross-frequency energy transfer in the excitation, resulting in modifying the frequency content of the excitation, i. e. modulation of the excitation, which enables the device into the orbits of higher-order subharmonic oscillations more easily. A device with a pendulum-type architecture is proposed and used as an illustrative example. The further investigation in device dynamics has proved that for a nonlinear device, there exists a generalized, global resonance condition which requires matching of all of the frequencies between the device and the excitation. Under global resonance, the device performance is optimized with the maximum energy harvesting efficiency, but its corresponding displacement is not the largest because the amplitude of global resonance response is strongly correlated with the fundamental frequency supported by a nonlinear potential well (e. g. potential function). Such results suggest that traditionally relying only on increasing the device response in nonlinear systems can be misleading. The global resonance condition also shows that damping of the device and modulation of the excitation play critical roles in facilitating the frequency match required for resonance. According to the global resonance condition, it is revealed that the potential of nonlinear device in harvesting energy from multi-frequency vibrations benefits from multiple frequency match, not from the wider bandwidth obtained from single-frequency response. To harvest energy from multi-frequency vibration using non- linear devices, a device-design concept based on global resonance is thus proposed. When the global resonance condition is satisfied, the instantaneous power of the excitation is always non-negative, resulting in the maximum device performance. Conversely, when the condition is not satisfied, the excitation does negative work for a duration per cycle, leading to the reduction of the energy harvested. During such duration, the excitation actually takes energy back from the device, acting as a sink. The extent to which the excitation behaves as a sink determines the energy harvesting performance. We find that instantaneously changing device response to ensure the velocity in phase with the excitation can reduce the behavior of the excitation as a sink, resulting in dramatic increase of the energy harvested. Based on our findings, it has shown that an active method based on manipulating the roles of excitation would be more promising in bringing vibration energy harvesting to fruition. Although the responses of a device are usually constrained by its potential well, it is possible for the dynamics of a pendulum-type device to escape from the potential well. Here, we also investigated the possibility of utilizing the dynamics outside the potential well of a device for harvesting energy from vibrations. A pendulum-type device is used as an example. Results show that when the device dynamics is outside the potential well and stays in stable orbits of period-one rotations, the harvested energy is proportional to the energy level of the orbit, neither depending on the natural frequency of the device nor on the intensity of the excitation. For the effects of electrical load circuits, we consider three types of non-resistive loads, such as a resistive load with a rectifier, a resistive load with a rectifier and a <b>regulating</b> <b>capacitor,</b> and a simple charging circuit consisting of a rectifier and a storing capacitor. Numerical results suggest that when the harvested energy is to be stored in capacitors, the ultimate voltages across capacitors are the same as the open- circuit voltage of the device minus the rectifier drop. For charging loads, therefore, the amount of stored energy is determined by the capacitance and the device performance under open circuit. Moreover, a larger capacitor is beneficial for an electromagnetic harvester, but not for a piezoelectrical harvester...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project {{is to develop a}} {{multilevel}} converter topology to be useful in power system applications. Although many topologies are introduced rapidly using a bunch of switches and isolated dc sources, having a single-dc-source multilevel inverter is still a matter of controversy. In fact, each isolated dc source means a bulky transformer and a rectifier that have their own losses and costs forcing the industries to avoid entering in this topic conveniently. On the other hand, multilevel inverters topologies with single-dc-source require associated controllers to <b>regulate</b> the dc <b>capacitors</b> voltages in order to have multilevel voltage waveform at the output. Thus, a complex controller would not interest investors properly. Consequently, developing a single-dc-source multilevel inverter topology along with a light and reliable voltage control is still a challenging topic to replace the 2 -level inverters in the market effectively. The first effort in this project was devoted to the PUC 7 inverter to design a simple and yet efficient controller. A new modelling is performed on the PUC 7 inverter and it has been simplified to first order system. Afterwards, a nonlinear cascaded controller is designed and applied to <b>regulate</b> the <b>capacitor</b> voltage at 1 / 3 of the DC source amplitude and to generate 7 identical voltage levels at the output supplying different type of loads such as RL or rectifier harmonic ones. In next work, the PUC 5 topology is proposed as a remedy to the PUC 7 that requires a complicated controller to operate properly. The <b>capacitor</b> voltage is <b>regulated</b> at half of dc source amplitude to generate 5 voltage levels at the output. Although the 7 -level voltage waveform is replaced by a 5 -level one in PUC 5 topology, it is shown that the PUC 5 needs a very simple and reliable voltage balancing technique due to having some redundant switching states. Moreover, a sensor-less voltage balancing technique is designed and implemented on the PUC 5 inverter successfully to work in both stand-alone and gridconnected mode of operation. Eventually, a modified configuration of the PUC 5 topology is presented to work as a buck PFC rectifier. The internal performance of the rectifier is like a buck converter to generate stepped down DC voltages at the two output terminals while the grid sees a boost converter externally. As well, a decoupled voltage/current controller is designed and applied to balance the output voltages identically and synchronize the input current with grid voltage to have a PFC operation acceptably.

This Ph. D. thesis presents an investigation into fabrication and nanoroughness characterization of nanoscale specimens and MIS (metal-insulator-semiconductor) capacitors with 2 HfO as a high k dielectric. Self-affine curves and Gaussian, non-Gaussian, self-affine as well as complicated rough surfaces were characterized and simulated.

Compared with experimental investigations, these simulations are flexible, low cost and highly efficient. Relevant conclusions were frequently employed in subsequent investigations. A proposal regarding the thicknesses of the deposited films represented by nominal linewidths and pitch was put forward. The MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) process was introduced and AlGaAs and GaAs were selected to fabricate nanolinewidth and nanopitch specimens on GaAs substrate with nominal linewidths of 2 nm, 4 nm, 6 nm and 8 nm, and a nominal pitch of 5 nm. HRTEM (High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy) image-based characterization of LER/LWR (Line Edge Roughness/Line Width Roughness) in real space and frequency domains demonstrated that the MBE-based process was capable of fabricating the desired nanolinewidth and nanopitch specimens and could be <b>regulated</b> accordingly.

40|$|Power Converter with {{capacitive}} input filter is a non-linear load to the Utility AC power lines. There {{are widely}} used as Switch-Mode Power Supplies in office equipment applications ranging from Personal Computers to Office Printers and Copiers. The distorted input current waveform extracted by the capacitive input filter of the power converters produces unwanted harmonics which propagates to other line powered equipments. The harmonic pollutes the AC lines and interferes with the operations of sensitive line powered equipments. The distorted current waveform also leads to inefficient utilization of the available power from the AC outlet. This is because the AC line power is transferred to the load only when each frequency component of the line voltage is an in-phase, scaler related quantity {{with respect to the}} same frequency component of the extracted current. The problems of poor power factor and harmonic distortion are compounded by the proliferation of Switch-Mode power supplies and the situation is rapidly becoming intolerable. The problem of poor quality input current waveform can be described by two quantitative measurements: Power Factor (pf) and Total Harmonic Distortion (thd). Two general approaches are available to remedy the problem. One approach is to install passive filter networks between the Utility AC lines and the capacitive input filter. The second approach is to design active power processors as dedicated Power Factor Correction (pfc) Converters and installed as the front end to the capacitive input filter to shape the distorted current waveform into waveforms which will yield higher power factor. This Thesis first introduce the general concept of PF and harmonic distortion in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 derive the mathematical description of pf based on the concept of real power (pR) and apparent power {pA). Both sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal cases are studied. For comparison and completeness, two popular passive power factor correction filter networks are analyzed in Chapter 3 to derive the maximum achievable power factor for each network along with the corresponding harmonic distortions. Governing equations are derived and presented graphically {{as a function of the}} filter network and load parameters. Chapter 4 provides the analysis of active power factor correction using switch mode Boost Converter. The analysis is carried out for two types of current controllers used as the current modulators for current waveform shaping. The state space averaged modeling approach is employed to derive the mathematical model of the Boost Converter suitable for large signal time domain and small signal frequency domain analysis. The model is further extended to derive the describing equations for the Boost Converter operating as pfc converter. Characteristics of the two current controller functions impacting the pfc operation are studied to expose their relative strength and limitations. The analysis includes the supplementation of the current control loop by an outer voltage control loop to <b>regulate</b> the output <b>capacitor</b> voltage of the pfc converter. The large signal analysis is first investigated forPF, waveform quality and voltage regulation. The small signal analysis follows to extract the frequency domain behavior of the pfc Boost Converter. The limitation of the voltage control bandwidth and its effect on the achievable pf is discussed. Chapter 5 verified the analysis through computer simulation using PSPICE. The original works of Bello[2] based on Berkeley SPICE are modified for PSPICE. The models are extended to implement the PFC control functions and simulated in both large signal time domain and small signal frequency domain. Both the analysis and computer simulation results are compared to a published design of pfc Converter[3]...|$|R
40|$|In recent times, {{power quality}} (PQ) {{issues such as}} current and voltage harmonics, voltage sag/swell, voltage unbalances have become the {{important}} causes for malfunctioning and degradation {{of the quality of}} power. Poor power quality severely affects on electrical equipment and finally results in significant economic losses. Hence, installation of the custom power devices to improve the power quality issues becomes an important consideration. Therefore, this thesis considers the enhancement of power quality for power distribution systems by utilizing unified power quality conditioner (UPQC). An UPQC can adequately handle several power quality problems such as load current harmonics, supply voltage distortions, voltage sags/swells and voltage unbalance. Therefore, the main focus behind this thesis is to develop advanced control strategies that improve the compensation capability of the UPQC so that power quality issues of distribution network are efficiently improved. Firstly, the current harmonics are considered and are compensated by using the shunt active power filter (SAPF). Therefore, two control strategies such as Hysteresis current control (HCC) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) based control algorithms are implemented to compensate current harmonics in the power distribution network. Furthermore, both the current control techniques utilize the Coulon oscillator based PLL (CO-PLL) for extraction of positive sequence signal from the supply voltage and generate the three-phase reference currents by employing PI-controller based DC-link voltage regulation. The performances of both current control techniques for SAPF are evaluated under different source voltage conditions such as balanced, unbalanced and non-sinusoidal. The SAPF effectively compensates currents harmonic, however, it is unable to compensate voltage related problems. To overcome this drawback, this thesis considers the UPQC, which comprises with shunt APF and series APF, can be utilized to compensate both current and voltage related problems. The research on UPQC is carried out progressively by considering different advanced control strategies. Each progress in the research enhances the compensation capabilities of the previous UPQC control system. The simulation and realtime Opal-RT studies are carried out to verify the operating performance of each design concept of UPQC. At first, operating principle and design of UPQC is presented and then a novel control algorithm is introduced with the aid of nonlinear DC-link voltage controller such as nonlinear variable gain fuzzy (NVGF) controller and nonlinear sliding mode controller (NLSMC) with modified synchronous reference frame (SRF) control strategy for improvement of both current and voltage compensation performance of the UPQC. However, existence of large settling time in dc voltage leads to poor dynamic performance of NVGF control technique and hence current harmonics, voltage distortions and voltage disturbance such as voltage sag/swell as well as voltage unbalance compensation capability of this technique is not quite effective in comparison to the NLSMC technique. Moreover, NLSMC is very sensitive to model mismatch and noise. It is quite sluggish in rejecting long drifting grid disturbances. Hence, a suitable control strategy has to be developed in UPQC, which has improved DC-link voltage regulation as well as tracking performance through load and grid perturbations. To overcome this drawback a resistive optimization technique (ROT) incorporated with enhanced phase-locked loop (EPLL) based NVGF hysteresis control strategy and an optimum active power (OAP) technique combined with enhanced phase-locked loop (EPLL) based fuzzy sliding mode (FSM) pulse-width modulation (PWM) control strategy for UPQC have been discussed. ROT-NVGF and OAP-FSMC based UPQC control strategies are adaptive as well as robust and able to mitigate the PQ problems satisfactorily during all dynamic conditions of power system perturbation. However, performances of these controllers are not effective when there is a variation occurring either in the nonlinear load parameter or supply voltage parameter. Thus, UPQC {{may not be able to}} compensate PQ problems satisfactorily. Considering aforesaid problems, this thesis proposes a command generator tracker (CGT) based direct adaptive control (DAC) applied to a three-phase three-wire UPQC to improve the current and voltage harmonics, sag/swell and voltage unbalance in the power system distribution network. CGT is a model reference control law for a linear timeinvariant system with known coefficients and is formulated for the generation of reference signal for both shunt and series inverter. The main advantage of the proposed control algorithm is that no online extraction is needed to perceive the UPQC parameters. Moreover, IV the adaptive control law is designed to track a linear reference model to reduce the tracking error between model reference output and measured signal to be controlled. Additionally, this proposed algorithm adaptively <b>regulates</b> the DC-link <b>capacitor</b> voltage without utilizing additional controller circuit. As a result, the proposed algorithm provides more robustness, flexibility and adaptability in all operating conditions of the power system network. At last, model reference robust adaptive control (MRRAC) technique is proposed for single phase UPQC system. This control strategy is designed with the purpose of achieving high stability, high disturbance rejection and high level of harmonics cancellation. From simulation results, it is not only found to be robust against PI-controller, but also satisfactory THD results have been achieved in UPQC system. This has motivated to develop a prototype experimental set up in the Laboratory using FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based NI (National Instruments) cRIO- 9014. From both the simulation and experimentation, it is observed that the proposed MRRAC approach to design a UPQC system is found to be more effective as compared to the conventional PI-controller. ...|$|R
