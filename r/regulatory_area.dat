40|$|Introduction: Glycoproteins of {{the major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) are an irreplaceable part of immune response regulation and immune homeostasis maintenance. The regulation of the expression {{plays an important role}} in adaptive immune response. Recently, DNA methylation in <b>regulatory</b> <b>areas,</b> crucial for DNA availability to transcription factors, is one of the most researched mechanisms of this type of regulation. The DNA methylation is, among others, related to the aging processes. Increased predisposition age-related immunosenescence in higher age could result from the changes in methylation status of <b>regulatory</b> <b>areas</b> of MHC class II genes. Aims: The aim of this thesis is to analyze the methylation status of <b>regulatory</b> <b>areas</b> of DQB 1 gene and to compare the differences between generations and specific alleles. The differences in the levels of DQB 1 gene mRNA transcription between generations and specific alleles is also compared. Methods: Both DNA and RNA were isolated from blood samples obtained from donors of three different age groups. DNA was genotypized and modified by bisulfite conversion. The <b>regulatory</b> <b>areas</b> of DQB 1 genes were then amplified and subcloned into bacteria. The positive clones were selected and subjected to DNA methylation analysis.

The intent to improve Tanner crab bycatch information is addressed in the restructured observer program, which was implemented in 2013. The Council’s preferred alternative is to close a portion of Marmot Bay northeast of Kodiak Island to the use of trawl gear, except for the use of pelagic trawl gear to target pollock.

40|$|Abstract: This {{analysis}} examines {{proposed changes}} to the management of Pacific halibut in the charter fisheries and commercial setline fisheries in International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Areas</b> 2 C and 3 A in the Gulf of Alaska. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) identified a {{need to develop a}} catch sharing plan (CSP) for the charter and commercial sectors to address conservation and allocation concerns in both areas. These concerns resulted from: 1) increased harvests in the charter halibut fishery, and 2) decreased catch limits in the commercial setline fisheries. There are five proposed alternatives under consideration. The No Action alternative would continue management of the charter halibut sector in these <b>regulatory</b> <b>areas</b> under the Guideline Harvest Level (GHL) Program. Annual amendments to federal regulations have been required in Area 2 C to match the management measure(s) to constrain charter halibut harvests to the GHL. The delayed timeline for implementation of the CSP has resulted in overharvest of the GHL in Area 2 C, except for 2011 when harvest was under the GHL by 30 %. Alternative 2 is the 2008 Preferred Alternative to replace the GHL Program with a catch sharing plan (CSP) for Areas 2 C and 3 A. This CSP would: 1) replace the current GHL program; 2) set initial allocations for each sector; and 3) establish a matrix of management measures to control charter halibu...|$|R
