40|$|The {{incidence}} {{and severity of}} butt rot were assessed in 12 selected Norway spruce seed stands in the Beskidy Mountains, Poland. A semi-invasive technique of sonic tomography {{was used for the}} assessment of rot damage. Stands of different age classes (100 – 120, 130 – 150, 160 – 170 years old) and distinct regions of provenance (Istebna and Orawa) were investigated. Hierarchical analysis of variance was used to determine effects of stand age and stand provenance on butt rot occurrence at a stand level. High incidence of butt rot was noted in all of the studied seed stands (47 % to 87 % of diagnosed tree samples). Stand age had a significant effect on percentage share of ‘damaged wood' on the tomogram. The extent of rot damage was rising with stand age, and the largest was observed in the age category 160 – 170 years. Spruce stands of Istebna provenance were generally more damaged by butt rot than those of Orawa provenance, however, the latter have been growing in forest sites more suitable for spruce in terms of fertility and altitude. Hierarchical analysis of variance did not show a statistically significant relationship between the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> and average share of ‘damaged wood' on the tomogram. Presented results indicate that for stands growing in similar conditions vulnerability to butt rot is determined by stand age.

The first part of the article offers an insight into the work of al-‘Umarī by presenting it in the framework of the encyclopaedic activities that characterize the fourteenth century. It also analyzes a number of special features of the Masālik al-abṣār and provides a detailed presentation of all its contents. The second part focuses on the plants (al-nabāt) which al-‘Umarī discusses along with the animals (al-ḥayawān) and the minerals (al-ma‘ādin). In drafting his encyclopedia, al-‘Umarī used various sources, ranging from Greek authors, such as Dioscorides, to Ibn Sīnā’s Qānūn fī l-ṭibb, Ibn al-Bayṭār’s Ǧāmi‘ and al-Qazwīnī’s ‘Aǧā’ib al-maḫlūqāt. Al-‘Umarī provided a new organization of all the information previously known to botanists of his time.

Total tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and survival rate were measured at 30 years after planting. Both growth and adaptation traits show substantial genetic variation among the tested seed stands. The amplitude of variation depends markedly on trait and testing site. This fact suggests that the best performing seed stands for growth and adaptation traits at each testing site can be selected. Two groups of valuable populations, located in the North and East of Eastern Carpathians (Apuseni Mountains), were identified. Survival rate was negatively correlated with growth traits, the average values in the two field trials were 68 % and 70 %. By analyzing growth and adaptation traits together with stem and wood qualitative traits, the best performing populations will be considered as tested seed sources and the forest reproductive material they can provide will be recommended {{for use in the}} <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> where the two field trials are located. </span...|$|R

40|$|The European Council Directive 1999 / 105 /CE, {{concerning}} {{the marketing of}} forest reproductive material, establishes a <b>Region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Provenance</b> as the basic unity for trading tree reproductive materials (fruits, seeds or plants) and defines it as “the area or group of areas subjected to sufficiently uniform ecological conditions in which stands or seed sources showing similar phenotypic or genetic characters are found”. The identification of Regions of Provenance is a crucial issue for a sustainable management of forests that includes activities linked with forest trees propagation, including afforestation or in situ genetic conservation.

The restricted water supply reduced the water potential of all the families {{as well as their}} growth, both in terms of height and weight. Root development increased whilst leaf area decreased as a result of reduction in number and surface area of individual leaves as well as sprouting rather than through defoliation. Drought stress also modified the morphology of the leaves and the relationships indicating the rate of relative development of the leaves compared {{to the rest of the}} plant. A correlation with the minimum summer rainfall in the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> was observed for several traits. The phenotypic variation observed was greater than expected from progenies of selected fruit cultivars. The results of this study show that (i) phenotypic variation exists between the two origins of variability corresponding to the two identified gene pools; (ii) the Northern group might be considered more tolerant to drought stress when considering plantlets’ ability to recover water potential, though important phenotypic plasticity was found in both origins of variability; and (iii) the pattern of variation found in some physiological and morphological traits suggests that Spanish chestnut stands have great potential to respond to the expected increase in drought in the Iberian Peninsula over the present century...|$|R

This region is also particularly vulnerable to global warming, reduction of precipitations and a long-term negative effect on vegetation. To investigate interactions between the species’ distribution and ecological factors we used 319 plots (1 km grid level), where the species are present in Portugal, characterized with 8 ecological attributes: ombrothermic Index (OI), thermicity Index (TI) and continentality Index (CI), pH, organic matter (OM), sand, topographic position index (TPI), number of fires (NF) and burned area (BA). The obtained matrix was firstly analyzed through PCA to reduce the space of analysis by a construction of synthesis variables (Spearman’s rank correlation matrix) and thus to detect patterns within the data set and possible collinear covariates. Finally, the vulnerability of {{strawberry tree}} {{to the effects of}} global climate change was examined. For that purpose, two ‘representative concentration pathways’ (RCPs) scenarios were predicted (RCP 2. 6 and RCP 6. 0) using climatic data, extracted from WorldClim, for distribution changes characterization in two periods (2050 and 2070). The MaxEnt allowed spatial Interpolation using the 319 1 K plots. The PCA showed that the climatic attributes (OI, and TI) displayed the highest components’ correlation values. The strawberry tree prefers areas with higher TI and lower acidity values within the mesomediterranean and termomediterranean belts. Additionally, with lower correlation values, the presence of the species is explained by lower OI values, OM, BA and NF.

40|$|The European or {{common walnut}} {{is a large}} tree prized as a {{multipurpose}} species: it provides valuable timber and produces a high-quality edible nut. The diffusion of the species in Italy has been largely influenced by the human activity, mainly through germplasm movement, selection of genotypes most suited for wood or fruit production and adaptation induced on fruit crop reproductive materials. As a consequence, genetic variability has been reduced, so that programs aimed at its preservation appear of the utmost importance. 104 walnut plants growing in Piedmont, northwestern Italy, were investigated through genetic variation scored at RAPD loci, yielded by PCR amplification of 10 decamer primers. Among the 101 studied loci, only 53 were polymorphic, showing {{a low level of}} genetic variation within the studied material. Genetic differentiation was estimated both at individual and geographical area level. Only in few cases trees growing in the same area showed to be genetically similar, while the differentiation between areas accounted for about 10 % of the total variation, according to AMOVA. No significant correlation was found between genetic and geographic distances. The results of the study showed that also in Piedmont (such as it was already demonstrated in other parts of Italy) the distribution of common walnut is a direct consequence of the human activity. The selection of individual trees, to be used as basic materials for seed supply, should therefore be based mainly on phenotypic traits, rather than ecological features of the location: in species characterized by artificial diffusion, the adoption of <b>Region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Provenance</b> has a scarce significance and prominence should be given to the phenotype selection...|$|E

40|$|Identification in 1982 on the Dutch Frisian Island of Ameland {{of beach}} sand with;ln {{enhanced}} level of natural radioactivity, due to concentrations of heavy minerals, inspired a multi-disciplinary research project. A joint research effort in geochemistry, sedimentology, hydrodynamics, solid-state physics and nuclear physics has revealed new aspects {{in the use}} of natural radioactivity in heavy-mineral exploration and processing, as well as in understanding sediment transport processes in the coastal zone. This paper describes radiometric methods and techniques, such as thermoluminescence dating and a method known as radiometric fingerprinting. Initially our focus was on relationships between natural radioactivity and grain size, and between radioactivity and mineral species. Additionally the distribution of heavy minerals along the Dutch coast was mapped. One of the first substantial findings was that the concentrations of K, U and Th in light and heavy minerals differ by two orders of magnitude. Thus the total heavy-mineral mass fraction (THM) could be accurately determined radiometrically. Attempts to determine THM radiometrically resulted in identifying <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance,</b> or origin for coastal sand minerals. This stimulated studies of transport processes and their selectivity. Investigations were conducted on the beach, under laboratory conditions and on the seafloor. Moreover, the enhanced radionuclide concentrations in, e. g., zircons make them particularly suitable for thermoluminescence dating young dune and beach sediments. This knowledge may aid better management of coastal zones, and may help to identify the genesis conditions of heavy-mineral placers. The instrumentation development has resulted in MEDUSA a towed detector system used for radiometric seafloor mapping. MEDUSA revealed unknown large quantities of heavy minerals on the Dutch seafloor. These minerals are present in layers up to 40 % in thickness and with concentrations up to 20 %. Radiometric fingerprinting of minerals allows a quantitative assessment of mineral suites during various stages of wet and dry separation.

Another important issue is the lack of a systematic study <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query characteristics across multiple applications. A classification or taxonomy <b>of</b> the <b>provenance</b> queries will not only help to better understand provenance metadata, but will also enable the definition <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query operators. Finally, while provenance for a user or an application is a specific view over all available provenance metadata, a provenance management system that supports provenance storage as views has not been implemented. In this paper we propose a novel <b>provenance</b> algebra consisting <b>of</b> a common <b>provenance</b> model called provenir, defined in description logic based W 3 C Web Ontology Language (OWL-DL), along with a set <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query operators derived from the classification <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> queries. We also introduce a practical provenance storage solution using materialized views over a generic relational database system. Our approach takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query operators and well-defined indices to efficiently process complex provenance queries over very large datasets. To support our claims we present an evaluation of both performance and scalability aspects of our initial implementation. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first provenance management system that supports the complete process from a formal provenance model and query operators to storage and efficient queries over provenance data. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Provenance is {{information}} recording the source, derivation, or history <b>of</b> some information. <b>Provenance</b> tracking {{has been studied}} {{in a variety of}} settings; however, although many design points have been explored, the mathematical or semantic foundations <b>of</b> data <b>provenance</b> have received comparatively little attention. In this paper, we argue that dependency analysis techniques familiar from program analysis and program slicing provide a formal foundation for forms <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> that are intended to show how (part of) the output of a query depends on (parts of) its input. We introduce a semantic characterization <b>of</b> such dependency <b>provenance,</b> show that this form <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> is not computable, and provide dynamic and static approximation techniques. ...|$|R
