It has also been shown that the method may deal with large range shifts from range profile to range profile, unlike the global <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> algorithm.

We have addressed simple simulated examples in which both the global <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> algorithm and the minimum entropy-based technique have problems with local maxima.|$|E
30|$|<b>Range</b> <b>alignment</b> is to {{compensate}} the range shifts of profiles. Without priorknowledge available about the range shifts, <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> is usually realized based on the similarity of high-resolution range profiles (HRRPs). Typical methods for <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> can be sorted into three groups. The first class {{is based on a}} maximum correlation between adjacent profiles [4]. The dominant scatter method tracks a prominent scatter and estimates the range shift. And, the maximum correlation method [4] aligns each HRRP by using the principle that the envelope correlation of two adjacent profiles reaches a maximum when they are aligned. Actually, the principle of maximum correlation of two adjacent profiles can be regarded as a local optimization of alignment. Because the estimation of range shifts between every two adjacent envelopes is independent of each other. As a result, this method is sensitive to target scintillation. And, it is likely to fail when strong noise presents, as the coherence of HRRPs is contaminated seriously. The other group is optimization-based methods [5 – 9]. It is widely accepted that global optimization methods are more robust to reflectivity scintillation and additive noise than maximum correlation method, in which the problem of ISAR <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> is formulated by using some global metrics. Minimum entropy or maximum contrast of the synthetic profile, such as the average range profile (ARP) of the aligned profiles, is used as the criterion to evaluate the performance of <b>range</b> <b>alignment.</b> The synthetic profile usually has the highest sharpness when the profiles are aligned perfectly. Or else, the sharpness of synthetic envelope reduces. It is reasonable to evaluate the sharpness of the synthetic profile by contrast or entropy and establish an optimization for <b>range</b> <b>alignment.</b> In general, the synthetic profile is calculated as the mean of magnitude of the aligned HRRPs. Therefore, the synthetic profile {{can be viewed as a}} non-coherent energy accumulation of aligned profiles, and it can overcome the noise interference in some degree. However, in the situations of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the SNR gain from the non-coherent integrant is not enough to overcome the interference from noise on the synthetic profile, leading to that the consistency between the sharpness of the synthetic profile and the quality of <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> is broken. In this sense, it is still challenging to achieve optimal <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> in presence of strong noise.|$|E
30|$|In general, {{conventional}} error correction for {{inverse synthetic aperture}} radarimaging consists of <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> and phase adjustment, which compensate range shift and phase error, respectively. Minimum entropy-based methods have been proposed to realize <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> and phase adjustment. However, it becomes challenging to align high-resolution profiles when strong noise presents, even using entropy minimization. Consequently, the subsequent phase adjustment fails to correct phase errors. In this article, we propose a novel method for translational motion correction, where entropy minimization is utilized to achieve <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> and phase adjustment jointly. And, a coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization implemented by quasi-Newton algorithm. Moreover, a method for coarse motion estimation is also proposed for initialization in solving the optimization. Both simulated and real-measured datasets are used to confirm {{the effectiveness of the}} joint motion correction in low signal-to-noise ratio situations.|$|E

30|$|The {{method is}} robust against noise, clutter, and target scintillation. Moreover, it {{properly}} solves the error accumulation problem. Its performance {{is similar to}} the state-of-the-art current methods such as the global <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> approach [20] and the minimum entropy-based technique [21], although it provides two clear advantages; it properly solves extreme situations with large range shifts from pulse to pulse (unlike the global <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> algorithm) and it has moreover the ability to produce subinteger fine range adjustments over a wide range of offsets (in contrast to the minimum entropy-based method).|$|E

Initial parameters of the polynomial and Gaussian basis functions are determined by fitting the proposed model to the center of mass curve of the range profile history using the least square curve-fitting algorithm, and the optimum value is found using particle swarm optimization.

30|$|In radar remote sensing, strong noise usually presents, due to {{the signal}} decay from long range and {{absorption}} of transmit medium. The SNR problem {{is among the most}} significant challenges that ISAR imaging systems frequently face. In the presence of strong noise, motion compensation for ISAR imaging inherently encounters some difficulties. Therefore, the technique of motion compensation under low SNR is important, which may furnish imaging capability and improve the effective operating range of some ISAR systems with low power. Based on the fact that both range shift and phase error are directly related {{to the quality of the}} focused image, in this article, we present a novel entropy-based approach to joint <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> and phase adjustment. It should be emphasized that the idea of joint correction of range shift and phase error has been proposed in [14], which motivates this study. In the joint correction, instead of separating motion compensation into the two dependent steps, it estimates the range shift and phase error simultaneously. Therefore, high SNR gain from 2 D coherent integrant is benefited by both <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> and phase adjustment.|$|E
40|$|MOTIVATION: Membrane {{proteins}} {{are both}} abundant and important in cells, but {{the small number}} of solved structures restricts our understanding of them. Here we consider whether membrane proteins undergo different substitutions from their soluble counterparts and whether these can be used to improve membrane protein alignments, and therefore improve prediction of their structure. RESULTS: We construct substitution tables for different environments within membrane proteins. As data is scarce, we develop a general metric to assess the quality of these asymmetric tables. Membrane proteins show markedly different substitution preferences from soluble proteins. For example, substitution preferences in lipid tail-contacting parts of membrane proteins are found to be distinct from all environments in soluble proteins, including buried residues. A principal component analysis of the tables identifies the greatest variation in substitution preferences to be due to changes in hydrophobicity; the second largest variation relates to secondary structure. We demonstrate the use of our tables in pairwise sequence-to-structure alignments (also known as 'threading') of membrane proteins using the FUGUE alignment program. On average, in the 10 - 25 % sequence identity <b>range,</b> <b>alignments</b> are improved by 28 correctly aligned residues compared with alignments made using FUGUE's default substitution tables. Our alignments also lead to improved structural models. AVAILABILITY: Substitution tables are available at: [URL]...|$|R

Furthermore, the method achieves an accurate subinteger refinement for the <b>range</b> profile <b>alignment.</b> This subinteger adjustment is based on an optimization stage which has carefully been designed in order to avoid convergence to undesired local maxima.|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} power transfer systems, the transmitting coil dimensions can substantially affect the transmission <b>range</b> and <b>alignment</b> sensitivity.

Thus, we developed a larger coil (24 ¿¿ 30 cm 2) designed to be embedded {{in the back of}} a vest to power DC pumps for artificial hearts or LVADs. To significantly reduce the required voltage, the coil was divided into 8 segments with resonant capacitors. The coil was operated at 6. 78 MHz and evaluated with a 5. 3 -cm diameter receiving coil. A circuit model for the energy coupling coils was developed to predict the output power and efficiency. Having a coil separation of 7. 7 cm, the output power and efficiency of the energy coupling coils are higher than 48 W and 80 %, respectively. The system was experimentally tested with a DC pump, demonstrating that the proposed coil segmentation technique can significantly reduce the transmitter voltage to a safe level (~ 10 Vrms).

30|$|If <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> is done well, afterwards, phase {{adjustment}} {{is carried out}} to remove the error phase. There are many different schemes to perform phase adjustment, which can be sorted into different groups. The first is based on tracking a phase of dominant scattering centers. Phase gradient autofocus algorithm [10], the multiple dominant scatters algorithm [11], and the weighted least square phase estimation [12] can be classified into this group. These methods usually perform well when dominant scattering centers can be extracted from HRRPs. However, presence of strong noise brings inherent difficulty to precise phase tracking through several dominant scatters. Another group numerically optimizes the phase error correction to improve a global metric consistent with image focus, in which image contrast (IC) [13 – 16] and entropy [17 – 22] are utilized as the cost function to optimize the phase error. Image metric-based approaches are usually able to obtain an optimal solution even {{in the presence of}} strong background noise and clutter. However, successful phase adjustment can only be ensured when perfect <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> is obtained, while if the profiles are misaligned in some cases, such as strong noise situation, even the image metric-based methods fail to correct phase errors. To overcome this problem, in [14], a joint correction scheme for simultaneous <b>range</b> <b>alignment</b> and phase adjustment was proposed based on a two-order polynomial model of the translational range history, and a novel coarse estimation of both velocity and acceleration was also developed to accelerate the motion estimation. In the issue of ISAR motion compensation, adaptive joint time-frequency algorithm (AJTFA) also plays a significant role in ISAR motion compensation and imaging processing [11, 23, 24]. Especially, AJTFA is inherently suitable to dealing with maneuvering targets by projecting the one-dimensional signal onto the two-dimensional (2 D) time-frequency plane, and the motion parameters can be extracted from the time-frequency spectrum of dominant scatters. However, strong noise can easily submerge the time-frequency spectrum degrading its performance in low SNR scenarios.|$|E

To overcome the interference of strong noise and clutter, current methods are usually following a similar principle, in which, estimation of errors is converted into a problem of minimizing (or maximizing) a cost function. And, the cost function is selected such that when it is minimized (or maximized), optimal focusing is achieved. Entropy {{is one of the}} most primary function in error compensation for ISAR imaging. Entropy of 2 D image (or one-dimensional synthetic range profile) represents its sharpness, and generally the “sharpest” image is corresponding to the fully focused image (or aligned HRRPs).

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo compare {{collagen}} fibre alignment angles obtained from polarised light microscopy (PLM) and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) in bovine articular cartilage. MethodsFive samples of bovine articular cartilage from five different animals were studied using {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and PLM techniques. T 2 -weighted, diffusion-tensor (DT), and PLM images were acquired for each sample and average depth profiles of the PLM and DTI angles, {{as well as the}} banding patterns observed in T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, were compared. Statistical properties of the distributions of the DTI and PLM angles were examined. ResultsThe samples exhibited a <b>range</b> of <b>alignment</b> morphologies. In the samples with the “conventional” three-zone alignment pattern, a correlation between the PLM and DTI alignment zones and the banding in T 2 -weighted MR images was observed. The shapes of the depth profiles of the PLM and DTI alignment angles were qualitatively similar for each sample. Three samples showed good quantitative correlation between the DT and PLM alignment angles. The correlation between the diffusion and PLM alignment angles was best in the regions of low degree of disorder of fibre alignment. ConclusionsThis study provides the first quantitative comparison of DTI of cartilage with the more established PLM techniques. The correlation between alignment angles derived from PLM and DTI data was evident across a wide <b>range</b> of <b>alignment</b> morphologies.
