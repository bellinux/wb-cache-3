50|$|The tables {{used in the}} D'Hondt or Sainte-Laguë {{methods can}} then be viewed as calculating the highest quota {{possible}} to <b>round</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a given number of seats. For example, the quotient which wins the first seat in a D'Hondt calculation is the highest quota possible to have one party's vote, when rounded down, be greater than 1 quota and thus allocate 1 seat. The quotient for the second round is the highest divisor {{possible to have a}} total of 2 seats allocated, and so on.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 Qiao competed at the 1995 World Championships - {{where the}} team took second place behind 1994 World Champions Romania. The Chinese team {{actually}} scored {{the highest in}} the Team Optionals portion of the competition but their disappointing scores during the Compulsories round (where they were weak on vault and bars) prevented them from taking first place. During the team competition she did not compete on all four events and so did not qualify for the individual All-Around final. She did however qualify for the beam final (for the 2nd consecutive year) but a balance break {{at the beginning of the}} routine (a difficult <b>round</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> layout step-out mount onto the beam) resulted in an 8th-place finish.|$|E
5000|$|The next map was FaZe Clan vs Fnatic. Fnatic {{started off}} very strong, pulling a 7-3 lead {{going into the}} 11th round. However, after some adjustments, FaZe {{went on to win}} five in a row to bring the score to its {{advantage}} at 8-7. FaZe would go up 11-7 before Fnatic won two rounds of its own. FaZe won four rounds to make it 15-11, and putting the clan on the verge of victory. Fnatic's experience showed off and brought it to 15-14 and FaZe did not have enough money for Ricardo [...] "fox" [...] Pacheco to be on the AWP. However, FaZe did manage to pull the <b>round</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> win a close 16-14 game. Philip [...] "aizy" [...] Aistrup had 23 kills and Joakim [...] "jkaem" [...] Myrbostad had 22 while Fnatic's Freddy [...] "KRiMZ" [...] Johansson had 21 kills.|$|E
30|$|The <b>rounding</b> <b>off</b> of real numbers can {{be either}} {{deterministic}} or random. In deterministic, the highest real value for a virtual node is <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> 1.

30|$|Part of the {{complexity}} of Christopher’s orientation is that his work indicates that he has {{at least some of the}} quantitative reasoning skills needed to work out the answers to the first two problems by rounding (e.g., he is able to round his answer of 20.3 correctly to 20). The issue here is not that he does not know how to <b>round</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the nearest whole number. Instead, it would appear that the presence of a problem in mathematics is viewed as a trigger for a calculation, regardless of an instruction that calls for a solution through quantitative reasoning. The instruction is returned to after the exact answer has been calculated. This routine is followed in the second example as well, where, in spite of a calculation error, his answer still takes him to 2 as the nearest answer. Thus, while relevant reasoning practices are sporadically evident here relating to rounding and possibly scaling up and reversing downwards, these are not set holistically within either the quantitative reasoning (Schifter 2011) or the strategic working (Kilpatrick et al. 2001) that are described as part of the mathematical practices canon or mathematical modes of enquiry frame.|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{explores the}} {{transportation}} {{part of the}} installation concept WindFlip, where fully assembled floating wind turbines are transported lying with a 5 ° slope on the barge WindFlip. The transportation phase is assumed to last for 24 hours while the total installation time is uncertain. The main object {{is to find the}} limiting sea state for the transportation. Several issues need to be taken into account, both physical strains and regulations. The assumed relevant physical strains are situations related to the wind turbine. This includes water impact on the turbine blades or the nacelle or large accelerations (0. 3 G vertical acceleration on the nacelle is the maximum tolerable value). The limitations from regulations concern the duration of the operation and weather forecasts. For finding the limiting sea state for the transportation the MARINTEK software ShipX Vessel Responses was used. When using a 30 m long and 0. 5 m broad bilge keel and long-crested waves the limiting Hs for transit in 6 knots was calculated as 2. 99 m. This was with a probability of failure on one of thousand wind turbines. For zero velocity and wave heading from behind the limiting Hs was calculated to be 4. 26 m. This is suggested as a safe condition if there is a sudden change in weather during transportation. For further analyses the values were <b>round</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> respectively 2. 5 m and 4 m. This made the results easier to work with and it could be considered as a safety margin which the regulations recommended to apply. The next step was looking at measured wave data from the Gulf of Maine on the north-east coast of the USA. The seasonal variation was investigated and the five months from May to September came out as the calmest period of the year. Both the monthly mean values of Hs and operability due to the limiting sea states related to scatter diagrams showed this. In these five months more than 97 % of the wave data were within the operational limit and more than 99 % were within the safe condition. Also weather windows were investigated. The summer period is still the best time of the year and it generally looks like the installation operation has good possibilities to be carried through in this area especially during the five summer months. Nevertheless there should be possible to operate {{the rest of the year}} as well, but perhaps with a little more patience. </p...|$|E

30|$|Each of {{the four}} {{algorithms}} consists of three steps: node mapping, link mapping and definition of paths for transfer of the required images. For each step two procedures defines: how to round the real values <b>off</b> <b>to</b> binary ones and when such <b>rounding</b> <b>off</b> should take place. In node mapping, the first procedure defines which variable will be <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> 1 since only one Xn,m,ican be set to 1 for each virtual node m. The second procedure determines whether or not all the other variables values should be <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> 1.
