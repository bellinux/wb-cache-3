40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{condition}} monitoring and fault diagnosis of equipment is accomplished through {{the analysis and}} interpretation of signals acquired from sensors and transducers. However, any structure-borne vibration propagated through the neighboring structures will produce a background vibration in which the needed vibration signals for diagnosis are often submerged, in particular during the early stage of failure development. If the background noise level is too high or when the vibration signature level is too low, traditional techniques such as wavelet de-noising analysis could be ineffective in canceling the noise of such signals. In this article the combination of an adaptive signal enhancement and the wavelet transform for de-noising a vibration signal measured on a <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearing</b> is presented. Two algorithms were used as the adaptive weight-control mechanism. The final aim of the adaptive filter was the minimization of the mean-square value of the error signal which implies the maximization of the output signal-to-noise ratio of the system. The {{results showed that the}} combination of the adaptive vibration signal enhancement and the wavelet transform yielded the best signal-to-noise ratio.

30|$|In this paper, {{we first}} discuss the {{development}} of the field of tribology, and highlight some of the main problems encountered in this area, such as lack of systematicness, loose correlation, and inadequate focus on the microscopic perspective. Then, we provide basic formulas of frictional mechanics while considering the friction effect on classical mechanics formulae. In order to carry out the frictional mechanics analysis, we first classify the interface. According to the size analysis of surface films, the manufacturing roughness of the surface, the contact width, and the roller radius of the <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearing,</b> frictional mechanics has the features of interface mechanics, while interfaces are classified based on {{the presence or absence of}} a medium. Based on the classification, we further analyze the pressure and frictional stress of sliding and rolling friction problems without a medium, such as a slider, wedge key, and V belt. We also analyze problems with a medium, such as journal and rolling contact bearings. By comparing these results with those of classical mechanics without considering friction, we see that (1) friction causes deviations in the result for classical mechanics which does not consider friction, and (2) if the frictional stress and normal pressure affect each other, their interaction should be considered simultaneously. Finally, we summarize the friction problems, namely, sliding and rolling, with and without a medium, and deformed and non-deformed. From our analysis, we propose two conclusions. First, the frictional mechanics problem is a deviation of the classical mechanics problem, and secondly, frictional stress and normal pressure influence each other.|$|E
40|$|Silicon Nitride has {{traditionally}} been used as <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearing</b> material owing to its superior performance compared to bearing steels. Its successful application as a bearing element {{has led to the}} development of Silicon Nitride in other rolling contact applications in the automotive industry and the power industry. However, a major limitation of its wider application is its high material and machining cost, especially the cost associated with the finishing process. In the present study, a low cost sintered and reaction-bonded Silicon Nitride is used to study the surface machining effects on its rolling contact fatigue performance. Studies have been carried out to link the surface strengths of Silicon Nitride derived from half-rod and C-Sphere flexure strength specimens to the rolling contact lives of Silicon Nitride rod and ball specimens. The rolling contact fatigue tests were carried out on ball-on-rod and modified four-ball machines. Three types of surface with coarse, fine and RCF-conventional finishing conditions were examined. Flexure strength tests on half-rod and C-Sphere showed an increasing surface strength from specimens with coarse, fine to RCF-conventionally machined conditions. During rolling contact fatigue tests of as-machined specimens, no failures were observed on either ball-on-rod or four-ball tests after 100 million stress cycles. However, a trend of decreasing wear volumes was measured on the contact path of rods and balls with coarse, fine and RCF-conventional conditions. In four-ball tests, spall failures were observed on pre-cracked specimens. There was a trend of increasing rolling contact fatigue lifetime from pre-cracked specimens with coarse, fine to RCF-conventional machining conditions. The study of Silicon Nitride machining was also carried out using an eccentric lapping machine to investigate the effect of eccentricity on the finishing rate of hot isostatically-pressed and sintered and reaction-bonded Silicon Nitride.

A literature review summarizes current understanding in this field, {{leading to the}} key to the {{formation of}} these microstructural features being carbon redistribution as a consequence of cyclic <b>rolling</b> <b>contact.</b> In this context, a novel theory is postulated to describe the migration of carbon caused by gliding dislocations. The theory combines the Cottrell atmosphere theory with the Orowan equation and is capable of quantifying the dislocation-assisted carbon flux. Based on the proposed theory, models are suggested for different types of microstructural alterations formed in <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> fatigued <b>bearings</b> – dark etching regions (DERs), white etching bands (WEBs) and white etching areas (WEAs). Very good agreement is obtained between the predications made by the models and the experimental data from both this research and the literature. Moreover, the models consider the effects of contact pressure, temperature, rotational speed and number of cycles, and thus can be applied for universal RCF testing conditions. The reproduced microstructural features are also characterized using advanced characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT), with the observation validating the postulated formation mechanisms. It is demonstrated that DERs, WEBs and WEAs follow the same principle during formation – strain induced carbon redistribution.

40|$|Electrostatic Oil Line Sensor (OLS) is {{one type}} of the {{electrostatic}} sensors based on electrostatic charging phenomenon and {{has been used in}} wear debris monitoring in oil lubricated tribological systems. With the advantages of high sensitivity and resolution, OLS has been proved to be an effective sensing technique for sliding, <b>rolling</b> and <b>bearing</b> <b>contacts.</b> However the sensing technique has so far not been widely used in industrial systems due to the difficulties in identify the exact charge sources and charging mechanisms in a complex tribological system. This paper presents the results from a simulation of the sensing mechanisms that is successfully validated by experimental results. The initial OLS simulation results have led to a better sensor design and its application...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} performed both on the specimens and original test rig to estimate scuffing limits in angular <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearings.</b> From the scuffing approaches, it can be detached the idea that, any scuffing mechanism considered, there is an energetically unbalance in the <b>rolling</b> <b>contact.</b> Therefore we consider an energetically criterion the most adequate to estimate scuffing limits. Corroboration between our experimental and theoretical results allows a scuffing criterion to estimate this type of damage in 7206 angular <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearing.</b> The proposed scuffing criterion can be considered of practical use for ball bearings designers and producers in order to predict scuffing risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{coefficients}} of friction and relative degradation rates of three lubricants {{run in the}} boundary regime in vacuum are evaluated in a Spiral Orbit Tribometer. This tribometer subjected the lubricants to <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> conditions {{similar to those found}} in angular <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearings.</b> A multiply alkylated cyclopentane (MAC) hydrocarbon lubricant suffered degradation at a rate almost two orders of magnitude less than the degradation rate of two perfluoropolyalkylether (PFPE) lubricants...|$|R
