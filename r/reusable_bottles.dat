40|$|Polycarbonate plastic is a lightweight, {{high-performance}} plastic that {{possesses a}} unique balance of toughness, dimensional stability, optical clarity, high heat resistance and excellent electrical resistance. Because of these attributes, polycarbonate {{is used in}} a wide variety of common products including digital media (e. g. CDs, DVDs), electronic equipment, automobiles, construction glazing, sports safety equipment and medical devices. The durability, shatter-resistance and heat-resistance of polycarbonate also make it an ideal choice for tableware as well as <b>reusable</b> <b>bottles</b> and food storage containers that can be conveniently used in the refrigerator and microwave (APME). Bisphenol A (BPA) is a key building block of polycarbonate plastic. In recent years a number of researchers from government agencies, academia and industry worldwide have studied the potential for low levels of BPA to migrate from polycarbonate products into foods and beverages. These studies consistently show that the potential migration of BPA into food is extremely low, generally less than 5 parts per billion, under conditions typical for uses of polycarbonate products. Using these results, the estimated dietary intake of BPA from polycarbonate is less tha...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to explore {{the design of a}} {{reusable}} water bottle that can be inverted to expose the inside. Being able to directly touch the entire inside of the product could facilitate cleaning and consequently promote sustainable water bottle usage. Existing cleaning solutions and various water bottles were evaluated for benchmarking, and a water bottle usage survey revealed that most respondents clean their <b>reusable</b> <b>bottles</b> on a weekly to monthly basis, with 35. 5 % of respondents indicating that they had thrown out a bottle since it was clean. Observing volunteers in water bottle cleanliness perception test revealed that being able to physically contact and see the inside of the bottle while cleaning were most important. Two iterations of sketch models were created, demonstrating that a pouch-like design with a drawstring attached between the inside of the pouch and the water bottle top to aid invertibility was the most feasible solution. The final water bottle design, created as a CAD model, consists of three components: a top, a bottom, and an invertible pouch made of a soft plastic. The invertible pouch is held in place and made watertight between the bottom and top components that resemble a standard reusable water bottle design. by Matthew S. Metlitz. Thesis: S.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to see the amount of Escherichia coli in six different brands of 19 liter <b>reusable</b> <b>bottles</b> of water, {{and see if there}} is {{a significant difference between the}} amount of Escherichia coli they include or not. According to this, I came up with the research question: Is there any difference in terms of the amount of Escherichia coli in 19 liters reusable plastic bottles from 6 different brands, indicated by the membrane filter method? Six different brands of 19 liter reusable bottled water were chosen by considering their popularity and their prices. The ones with low popularity and price were chosen since they have a higher risk of contamination and named in alphabetic order as A, B, C, D, E and F. The amount of Escherichia coli in them was determined by the membrane filter method. The method can be briefly explained like this: The water is poured down the membrane filter system where the membrane filters don’t allow the passage of bacteria. Then, the filter papers are put on different petri plates and incubated. If there is right type of colorizations then, further tests are done to determine if the colonies are E. coli or not. At the end of the process, the numbers of colonies that are found out to be E. coli is counted and a result is obtained. In this experiment, ANOVA test is used and it proved that there is a significant difference between the amounts of E. coli in different brands of water since the p value is approximately zero...|$|E

5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, <b>reusable</b> <b>bottle</b> or other <b>reusable</b> containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|R
