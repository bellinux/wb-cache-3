In contrast, Finland imported crude oil from the Soviet Union as part of bilateral trade between these two countries and refined the oil for export to other Western European countries, while the Soviet Union did not intend to sell oil to these capitalist countries, but this was not <b>re-exportation</b> because the crude oil was refined before selling.Dubai has emerged as the major re-export center for the entire Middle East region.|$|E

50|$|The Government of Zanzibar legalized foreign {{exchange}} bureaux {{on the islands}} before mainland Tanzania moved to do so. The effect was to increase the availability of consumer commodities. The government has also established a free port area, which provides the following benefits: contribution to economic diversification by providing a window for free trade as well as stimulating the establishment of support services; administration of a regime that imports, exports, and warehouses general merchandise; adequate storage facilities and other infrastructure to cater for effective operation of trade; and creation of an efficient management system for effective <b>re-exportation</b> of goods.|$|E
50|$|Unlike a {{customs union}} (the third stage of {{economic}} integration), {{members of a}} free trade area {{do not have a}} common external tariff, which means they have different quotas and customs taxes, as well as other policies with respect to non-members.

Only goods that meet these minimum requirements are entitled to the special treatment envisioned by the free trade area provisions.|$|E

Perhaps the most important contribution of British blues was the surprising <b>re-exportation</b> of American blues back to America, where, {{in the wake of the}} success of bands like the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac, white audiences began to look again at black blues musicians like Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker, who suddenly began to appeal to middle class white Americans. The result was a re-evaluation of the blues in America which enabled white Americans much more easily to become blues musicians, opening the door to Southern rock and the development of Texas blues musicians like Stevie Ray Vaughan.|$|E
5000|$|Period of {{the transatlantic}} slave tradeIn 1646, Jesuit friar Gonçalo João succinctly stated the {{importance}} of the economic relationship between Brazil and Angola as [...] "Without Angola, there is no Brazil". Angola was a major source of slaves to Brazil, which was, out of the several European colonies in the Americas, the largest single importer of slaves during the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Two-thirds of those slaves in Brazil originated from the Angola-Congo region. Rio de Janeiro depended on the consistent influx of slaves from Angola to work on sugar cane plantations and for <b>re-exportation</b> to Buenos Aires in exchange for silver.Exports from Brazil to Angola in exchange for these slaves included manioc root meal and cachaça.During Dutch occupation of Angola in early 17th century, Brazil and Portugal acted as [...] "co-colonizers" [...] together in their efforts to reclaim the territory. Brazilian historian Luiz Felipe de Alencastro suggests that this critical historical period cemented Brazil's connection to Angola {{for the duration of the}} slave trade, and that the construction of Brazil occurred vis-à-vis the destruction of Angola's indigenous kingdoms.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is called}} the CARICOM rapid {{exchange}} system for dangerous non-food consumer goods, (CARREX) and was developed in response to concerns voiced by consumer bodies {{of the need to}} strengthen the Region's market surveillance for unsafe consumer goods. The concerns stemmed from the perceived increased permeability of the regional market to unsafe consumer products, which were facing growing difficulties in entering neighbouring territories where market surveillance systems were more effective. Such perceptions are supported by the fact that most industrialized countries do not have limitations in their law on the <b>re-exportation</b> of dangerous goods outside their frontiers once these have been identified at their borders. [...] Mindful of the resource limitations of Member governments in establishing and operating adequate market surveillance systems, it was recognised that the system could also aid in preventing the importation of dangerous goods by stopping such imports at the borders, once they have been detected elsewhere in the Community. The involvement of customs departments will therefore be critical in this regard and incorporates an added feature which is now being integrated in the EU's RAPEX from which the CARREX stems.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, the Škoda 105/120 {{range was}} sold {{under the name}} Škoda Estelle, a name created by Alan Blavins of Skoda GB's then {{advertising}} agency, Childs Greene, who were based {{a few blocks away}} from Skoda's office and showroom in Clerkenwell, London. The screen printed anodised aluminium front grille Estelle badges were designed by Alan Blavins and sourced by Jim Hubbard of Childs Greene for Skoda. The Estelle proved popular with 120,105 cars finding homes between May 1977 and March 1990. In 1987 alone (which was three years short {{of the end of the}} cars' production run), UK Škoda dealers managed to sell 17,000 rear-engined Škodas including the Rapid Coupé despite the cars negative image, individual handling and outdated technology and serious problems with the head gasket condition. Its main selling points were its spacious interior, dependability, ease of maintenance and low asking price. Reliability was often a strong point with these cars, some of which have reached over the 100000 mi point and are still running to the present day due to good maintenance. Skoda made great play in its advertising of its consistent class wins in the RAC rallies in the 1970s and 80s with the Estelle. In August 2006, an Auto Express survey revealed that just 612 Škoda Estelles sold in Britain were still registered with the DVLA, which officially made it the fifth most scrapped car in Britain sold in the last 30 years - although it can be argued that much of this reduction in numbers could be attributed to mass <b>re-exportation</b> of the vehicles back to Eastern Europe (as was also the case with contemporary Lada vehicles of the same era) where they were worth much more, as opposed to scrappage. The four cars with a higher rate for scrappings had all finished production at least four years before the Estelle. With the Škoda Estelle being the last mass-produced rear-engined small family car in Europe, not to mention the fact it's becoming increasingly rare in the UK, prices for good examples are rising.|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} end of the Biafra war, <b>re-exportation</b> has become an {{important}} economic activity for Benin’s economy. One of the reasons for the existence of this type of commerce resides in the disparity in economic policies between Benin and Nigeria. We model this sector and its interrelations with the remainder of the economy as well as on public finances. A CGE model was developed with data from Benin’s social accounting matrix for 1999. In the model, we distinguished between formal and informal households (households that work in the informal sector) and a distinction was incorporated into the model in regards of the <b>re-exportation</b> industry by dividing the latter into its 8 most important re-export sectors. We simulated a 10 % depreciation of the CFA F and a 20 % decrease in import tariffs. Our findings demonstrate a great sensitivity of government’s revenues to the activity of this informal sector. For one simulation, public savings dropped by almost 25 %, but in both cases, the government’s income was strongly affected. CGE model, informal trade, Benin, Nigeria, public finance...|$|E
30|$|The {{absence of}} high {{contents}} of kermesic and flavokermesic acids {{in most of}} the samples would point to the use of Armenian or Mexican cochineal. However, since Armenian cochineal (Porphyrophora hamelii) had nearly replaced kermes as the main dyestuff used to produce scarlet by the eighteenth century, [32] it is more likely Norwich dyers used Mexican/South American true cochineal [32, 33, 47]. Cochineal grown in the Spanish-dominated areas in Central and South America had to be imported through Spain before <b>re-exportation</b> to England. Although Norwich’s manufacturers had extensive networks of contacts in Spain, the city’s dyers almost certainly bought cochineal from London drysalters, or possibly from suppliers in Norwich.|$|E
40|$|In September 1936, both General Ioannis Metaxas and King George II {{declared}} it illegal for Greeks {{to intervene in}} the ongoing Spanish Civil War.

Nonetheless, members of the Greek Government permitted Prodomos Bodosakis Athanasiadis, a close friend of Metaxas, and the Greek Powder and Cartridge Company (GPCC) to ship and supply weapons to both sides in the Spanish conflict on a large scale. The objective of this thesis is to examine Greece’s weapons and ammunition sales to the Nationalists and the Republic during the Spanish Civil War as well as Greece’s internal and foreign policies that allowed for these dealings to occur. This thesis will contend that high-ranking members of the Greek Government permitted Bodosakis and the GPCC to sell munitions to both sides of the conflict as an economic expedient despite the ideology of the Metaxas dictatorship...|$|E
40|$|A. Lambert — Guinean Businessmen. Having {{emerged during}} Seku Ture's government, Guinean {{businessmen}} {{have been able}} to react to the liberalization carried out since 1984. By using criteria such as trade networks, traders' financial capacities and control over the Guinean market, an October 1990 study of rice importers has discerned three groups: "out-side" Guinean businessmen, foreign businessmen and "inside" Guinean traders who have never left the country. These operators, who have kept the liberalization policy from bearing expected results (in particular, opening the country up to competition), have shared out zones of influence among themselves. Foreign businessmen have been eliminated from distribution within the country; and "outside" Guinean businessmen are involved therein only insofar as they are partners with "inside" traders, who control not only distribution but also <b>re-exportation</b> toward neighboring lands.

Bryher, a British writer and literary patron, and the American poet Amy Lowell corresponded from 1917 until the latter’s untimely death in 1925. In my analysis of their still unpublished correspondence I concentrate on the inception and key moments of their exchange, from Bryher’s first letter to Lowell in 1917, to their meeting in New York in 1920, during Bryher’s first momentous visit to the United States. In the essay I offer yet another example of the interweaving of personal, literary and cultural stories by showing how the two writers’ epistolary relationship evolves into personal friendship and then into reciprocal critical and literary support. Moving from a personal to a cultural perspective, I argue that Bryher’s and Lowell’s letters also {{tell the story of the}} hybridization resulting from literary importation, assimilation and <b>re-exportation,</b> in a never-ending cultural circuit...|$|E

He studies the relationships between mass communication and cultural domination by re-importation or <b>re-exportation,</b> orientation to reference groups, and location in global social space. He also studies relationships among mass communication, knowledge of the ancient World African Community, and the understanding of imperatives among people of African Descent in the Caribbean region. This study used mass communication variables {{in an attempt to}} compare Africa and the United States as reference groups in the music culture of Trinidad. Among all subjects, the United States was a stronger reference group (a) as a surrogate for the world, (b) as a surrogate for the Caribbean, (c) in the motivation to secure information about the popularity of the music from the mass media, (d) in the introjection into oneself of the liking others display for the music, and (e) in the projection on to others of the liking one displays for the music. In general, Africa also was stronger as a reference group among People of Indian Descent than among People of African Descent. The results point to the importance of cultural domination and to the need {{for the study of the}} history, heritage, and relevance of the World African Community in this cosmopolitan island in the age of “globalization ” and “globalism. ” 7...|$|E

Though the Free Zone of Beirut {{was created}} {{almost half a}} century ago, it only began its real {{function}} a short while {{after the end of the}} Second World War when international trade resumed once again its normal movement. The Free Zone definitely helped and influenced the economy in giving many advantages to its different sectors. Transit to the neighbouring Arab countries, for instance, was much encouraged. Trade increased and the Free Zone became and international market, a warehousing and distribution center. Manufacturers took advantage of cheaper raw materials available at the Free Zone, set up installations to compete with foreign produced goods imported to the Arab world and to Africa. Businessmen have been much encouraged to increase their imports, due to the <b>re-exportation</b> facilities in case the Lebanese market failed to absorb the whole imported lot. Others, who did not have the required capital to import, were given the opportunity to choose any quantity, however small, from a wide line of products in the Free Zone. Transport, with the availability of return cargo, became cheaper amd more regular, this to the profit of the whole economy. At least, because of the intense traffic created by the Free Zone until the year 1975, more income is accuring to the port company as well as to the employment sector of the economy. In general, all of the above mentioned factors added up to a net increase in the national economy of the country before the year 1975, while from 1975 and on the same factors mentioned, become a burden on the net worth of the country's national economy and specially with respect to traffic, unemployment balance of trade, industry at the Free Zone. 1 bound copy: i, 62 leaves; ill.; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|E
