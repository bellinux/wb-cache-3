What about their skills?) and discuss its assimilation on the domestic labor market. Then we evaluate the demand for skilled immigration in the Belgian regions raised by domestic population changes. We demonstrate that <b>replacement</b> <b>immigration</b> is a sustainable policy in Flanders but not in Wallonia and Brussels, where it would jeopardize demographic stability. Using a projection methodology that takes into account the changes in the demand and supply of labor, we then show that an additional flow ranging from 500 to 9, 000 skilled immigrants would be necessary to stabilize the Flemish dependency ratio. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s 1, <b>replacement</b> <b>immigration</b> was {{advocated}} as {{an answer to}} the forecast population decline (in particular that of the working population). On top of this quantitative objective came, at the same time, the further ambition of qualitative control of inflows: selective immigration. One of the arguments put forward to support this change of direction in the migration policy was a bigger net contribution to public finance by skilled immigrants compared with that of unskilled immigrants 2. Thus, by limiting the population ageing process, immigration could help reduce the associated tax burden, particularly if migration policy is selective. Using a computable general equilibrium model, this letter assesses the contribution of migration policy to the reduction in social protection financing needs, {{in the context of the}} population ageing process. Stopping immigration from 2010 would lead to an increase in these financing needs of 1. 3 % by 2050. A more proactive migration policy (a doubling of the average net annual flow) would reduce the tax burden of ageing but at the expense of considerable demographic changes. The relative gain achieved by a selective migration policy is temporary and disappears over the long term. MIGRATION;AGEING;PENSION FUNDS...|$|E
40|$|Representations of {{population}} models {{in terms of}} countable systems of particles are constructed, in which each particle has a `type', typically recording both spatial position and genetic type, and a level. For finite intensity models, the levels are distributed on [0,λ], whereas in the infinite intensity limit λ→∞, at each time t, the joint distribution of types and levels is conditionally Poisson, with mean measure Ξ (t) ×ℓ where ℓ denotes Lebesgue measure and Ξ (t) is a measure-valued population process. The time-evolution of the levels captures the genealogies of the particles in the population. Key forces of ecology and genetics can be captured within this common framework. Models covered incorporate both individual and event based births and deaths, one-for-one <b>replacement,</b> <b>immigration,</b> independent `thinning' and independent or exchangeable spatial motion and mutation of individuals. Since birth and death probabilities can depend on type, they also include natural selection. The primary goal of the paper is to present particle-with-level or lookdown constructions {{for each of these}} elements of a population model. Then the elements can be combined to specify the desired model. In particular, a non-trivial extension of the spatial Λ-Fleming-Viot process is constructed...|$|E

40|$|Concern over unprecedentedly {{low levels}} of childbearing in Europe has become {{increasingly}} marked among both scientists and policy-makers. In conjunction with these concerns over fertility, {{there has also been}} considerable debate on the role migration can play in compensating for fertility below the replacement level. The issue of how to measure inter-generational replacement has been addressed by several scholars in recent years. In this paper we make use of a very simple method to assess how far migration alters the extent of replacement for a birth cohort as it ages. We term the measure used here the overall replacement ratio (ORR). It is calculated by taking the size of a female birth cohort divided by the average size of the cohorts of mothers in the year of birth. For example, we can compare the size of the 1975 cohort over time to the number of women in the main childbearing ages in 1975. Using annual estimates {{of the size of the}} 1975 cohort enables us to track the impact of migration on its implied level of <b>replacement.</b> Where <b>immigration</b> is significant, the ratio climbs over time, often reaching the replacement level by the age of 30 in many countries where fertility is well below the replacement level. The paper presents estimates of the ORR for a range of European countries representing different replacement regimes. In contrast with a frequently expressed notion of a limited impact of migration on population trends in Europe, we demonstrate that for many countries net migration has become a key factor in their population trends during the last decades...|$|R
40|$|The <b>replacement</b> of the <b>immigration</b> law, from Law No. 9 of 1992 to Law No. 6 of 2011 {{reflected}} {{the development of}} immigration legal policy. As a branch of administrative law that has dynamic character, the reform immigration laws should address the immigration legal needs in practice. This paper discusses the development of Indonesian immigration legal policy {{and to what extent}} these developments address the immigration legal needs. Based on the author analyses, it can be concluded, firstly, the development of immigration legal policy, in legal direction context, emphasized to face the impact of globalization both positive and negative effects, and other developments in the future. In legal substances aspect, the current immigration legal policy change various principles immigration laws, such as the principle of selective policies are balanced with the principle of respect for human rights, although in certain settings are not in line with human rights (as {{in the case of the}} period of temporary prohibition to leave Indonesia, that can be extended continuously). In legal form and scope context, Indonesian immigration legal policy today, is more concerned with the rules of immigration law in detail than ever before. Secondly, the development of immigration legal policy answered the immigration legal needs particularly, such as in the case of human smuggling, but forget the rest of the immigration legal needs, in terms of the handling of illegal immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees...|$|R
40|$|In the Mimbres {{region of}} southwestern New Mexico, {{there are two}} notable periods of {{transition}} (around 1150 A. D. and again around 1300 A. D.) during the Postclassic Period. These periods are marked by dramatic changes in material culture, settlement reorganization, and population decline. The first represents {{the transition from the}} Classic Mimbres period (1000 to 1150 A. D.) to the Black Mountain phase (1150 to 1300 A. D.). The second represents the transition from the Black Mountain to the Cliff phase (1300 to 1450 A. D.). The scale (size of the population reorganizations), chronology (timing of the reorganizations), and nature (social processes behind the reorganizations) of these changes are not fully understood. Three processes have been proposed to account for the changes: depopulation followed by population <b>replacement</b> (<b>immigration),</b> population decrease with remaining groups changing material culture and reorganizing economic and social networks, or some combination of these scenarios. The Black Mountain site (LA 49), near Deming, NM, in the Lower Mimbres Valley, is the type site for the Black Mountain phase. It represents one of the largest Black Mountain phase settlements and also contains a large Cliff phase room block. Through field excavations and laboratory analyses, this dissertation explores whether the change in material culture represents cultural continuity or cultural change at the Black Mountain site. Multiple artifact classes (radiocarbon and dendrochronology data as well as ceramic and obsidian sourcing data) suggest the transitions represent both a continuation of resident groups and immigration of new populations. This dissertation also provides a comparison of Black Mountain phase data from other sites and provides evidence that the transition from the Classic to Postclassic periods was not a uniform process throughout the region...|$|E
40|$|Quebec, as most Western societies, {{is facing}} the ageing of its population, {{producing}} many economic, political and social impacts. One solution often considered is to rely on immigration to reduce, delay or even counter certain consequences. For this purpose, replacement migration is sometimes seen as a solution: it aims to establish the number of immigrants needed to reach specific demographic targets, which are, in this study, to prevent total population decline, to prevent working-age population decline and to prevent the percentage of those 65 years and over from exceeding 25 % of the total population. The results show {{that it could be}} possible for Quebec to prevent the decline of its population if fertility does not decrease further and if immigration is well managed; that is replacement migration would not be excessively high. However, raising the immigration level too quickly could impede reaching this objective. The decline of the population aged between 20 and 64 years is inevitable: whatever the level of fertility, even if migration were much higher for the next two decades than has been planned for Quebec. Finally, immigration has no significant impact on the age structure of a population: it is quite unrealistic to expect this component to prevent the percentage of those 65 years and over in the total population from exceeding 25 %. The only way to reach this objective is a rapid increase of fertility to the replacement level. This means that immigration can in no way prevent the ageing of the population or {{have a significant impact on}} the process. <b>Replacement</b> migration, Quebec, <b>immigration,</b> demography, population, ageing, workforce, fertility, projections...|$|R
