The same anomalous fluctuation in the flood season <b>of</b> the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Yellow <b>River</b> and the Qinhe River is more obvious after the mid- 19 th century. The delay of flood season by about one pentad in the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Yellow <b>River,</b> Qinhe River, and Yongding River is in accordance with the relative low temperature of the Loess plateau in summer, while the early flood season <b>of</b> the middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Yellow <b>River</b> and Qinhe River corresponds with the relative high summer temperature in the Loess Plateau. The beginning time of the flood season in the research area is the time the rainy season begins.
