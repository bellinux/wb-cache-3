40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel design of 2 D tileable photodiode detector for medical CT imaging application. The novel design integrates the through-wafer interconnect (TWI) technology into the conventional photodiode structure to achieve 2 D tileable capability. With {{respect to the}} TWI technology, a new development of the upside down "T" shape TWI is reported {{for the first time}} in this thesis comparing to the existing straight TWI, and it shows better electrical properties and allows more robust processing capability. This thesis describes two structures of the photodiode integration with the TWI: via-outside-pixel (VOP) and the via-inside-pixel (VIP). The VIP structure shows advantages over the VOP structure with compact photodiode pixel arrangement. Moreover, it allows sophisticated guard <b>ring</b> <b>protections</b> to further improve the photodiode characteristics. This thesis reports experimental and theoretical studies on the effect of two different guard ring designs to the photodiode application. Upon the design and the fabrication of the novel photodiode chip, the properties of the photodiode are characterized in three aspects (electrical, optical and thermal properties) in this thesis. All the measurement and simulation data show that the demonstrated photodiode samples with the novel design can either meet or exceed the requirements (better image resolution, faster scanning speed and higher coverage rate) of the modern CT detector...|$|E

To implement the automatic <b>ring</b> <b>protection</b> in general wavelengthdivision multiplexing (WDM) optical networks, the lightpaths are partitioned into groups {{each of which}} can be carried in a simple cycle of the underlying network. As the electronic line terminals are the dominant cost factor in the deployment of WDM optical networks, we study how to generate these partitions with minimum electronic line terminals. This optimization problem is NP-hard. We develop two polynomial-time approximation algorithms, with performance guarantees between 1. 5 and 1. 6 and between 1. 5 and 1 5 +, respectively. The second algorithm can be adapted, with the same performance guarantees, to the problem in which lightpaths are not prespecified and only the endpoints of each connection are given.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{telecommunication}} operators have been deploying WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) technology to satisfy the exponential growth in global communication. While facilitating the advanced information society of today, this has also led to a higher dependency on the networks, and furthermore the high capacity utilisation of optical fibres means that a single link failure will influence many users and enterprises. For these reasons, protection of network connections {{has become a major}} competitive parameter for the operators. Currently, the most popular <b>protection</b> method is <b>ring</b> <b>protection,</b> due to its simplicity, requiring only basic management functionality and operating with local restoration control. While many optical rings have been deployed, little work has been published on exactly what the cost of ring networks are, compared to general mesh networks. In this article we perform a quantitative comparison between <b>ring</b> <b>protection</b> and mesh protection, using real world network data and realistic prices for network components. Extending classic LP flow models to take rings and node costs into account, and using a link-path based mesh network LP model, we are able to perform a total cost comparison of the two architectures, and of manual ring network design. The results suggest that the price of mesh network components must be reduced significantly to be competitive with ring based networks, and also that manual network design does not necessarily lead to the most cost-efficient designs. c ○ 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

This voltage is approximately linear with beam position. For this application, we have limited the video bandwidth of the log amps to 50 kHz in order to remove fill pattern dependence.

This paper presents the first analytical consideration of the availability of paths in a network protected by p-cycles. Results confirm the importance that cycle sizes play in terms of availability and suggests principles or strategies for achieving high availability of paths in a network protected by p-cycles. Based on these insights, two new formulations for joint service path provisioning and capacity planning are proposed. The first one offers a way to improve the availability of selected service paths by using a different routing strategy for them than for regular service paths. The second formulation enables a new class of service paths that are offered two protection options instead of just one. That class of service paths is expected to see its availability improved in a quantum step way relative to the availability of paths having only one protection option...|$|R

To recover from such failures, {{a number of}} methods such as SONET <b>rings,</b> <b>protection</b> cycles, and source rerouting have been investigated. Two important considerations in such approaches are the recovery time and the needed spare capacity to complete the recovery. Usually, these techniques attempt to achieve a recovery time less than 50 ms. In this paper we introduce an approach that provides link failure recovery in a hitless manner, or without any appreciable delay. This is achieved {{by means of a}} method called diversity coding. We present an algorithm for the design of an overlay network to achieve recovery from single link {{failures in}} arbitrary networks via diversity coding. This algorithm is designed to minimize spare capacity for recovery. We compare the recovery time and spare capacity performance of this algorithm against conventional techniques in terms of recovery time, spare capacity, and a joint metric called Quality of Recovery (QoR). QoR incorporates both the spare capacity percentages and worst case recovery times. Based on these results, we conclude that the proposed technique provides much shorter recovery times while achieving similar extra capacity, or better QoR performance overall...|$|R
