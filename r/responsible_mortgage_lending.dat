40|$|Purpose - This {{research}} {{attempts to}} evaluate how responsibly consumer mortgage lending in New Zealand is {{being carried out}} through an exploratory investigation of lending institutions’ and mortgage brokers’ lending processes and disclosures. The research assesses whether changes towards more socially responsible lending practices and related disclosures were made since the global financial crisis began in 2007 and aims to inform the question of “just how socially responsible Australasian financial institutions are?” Research methodology - The paper commences with a review of relevant literature on the global financial crisis, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and its role within the financial sector developing a theoretical framework in which to view <b>responsible</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> for consumers. Data for the study were collected {{by means of a}} questionnaire sent to a sample of 9 lending institutions and 300 mortgage brokers operating within New Zealand. Corporate disclosure analysis was subsequently undertaken. Documents reviewed included the institutions‟ CSR reports, independent assurance statements, annual reports, media releases and websites through the period 2006 – 2010. The key characteristics established in the theoretical framework, namely, ‘transparency’, ‘fairness’ and ‘adequacy’ were used to interpret the responses to the questionnaires and the corporate disclosure information to allow an assessment as to how responsibly consumer mortgage lending is being carried out in New Zealand. Findings - The findings indicate that consumer mortgage lending in New Zealand is, overall, being carried out in a socially responsible manner, with an emphasis being placed on prudent lending practice by lending institution respondents. This has been further strengthened by a number of changes that have been made {{as a result of the}} global financial crisis. However, the results have also illustrated concerns regarding three aspects of the <b>responsible</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> framework, namely, the prevailing upfront payment of commissions, the lack of adequate insurance protection requirements and the continuing availability of subprime lending through ‘second-tier’ lenders. Value - The paper adds to the limited literature of CSR reporting in the financial sector. The study is important from a public policy perspective on disclosure of lending institutions’ practices and contributes to a global dialogue on CSR in the financial sector. 29 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} assess whether consumer <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> is being carried out responsibly in New Zealand through an investigation of banking corporations’ and <b>mortgage</b> brokers’ <b>lending</b> processes and of their related disclosures to borrowers. The research assesses whether changes were made to these lending practices since the global financial crisis began, to ensure more responsible lending practices. Through this exploratory investigation the research aims to inform the question of “just how socially responsible Australasian banking corporations are?” This paper commences with a review of relevant literature on the global financial crisis, corporate social responsibility and its role within financial institutions developing a theoretical framework in which to view <b>responsible</b> consumer <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending.</b> Data for the study were collected {{by means of a}} questionnaire sent to a sample of 300 mortgage brokers and 9 banking corporations operating within New Zealand. Corporate disclosure analysis was subsequently undertaken. Documents reviewed included the corporations’ corporate social responsibility reports, independent assurance statements, annual reports, media releases and websites through the period 2006 – 2010. The key characteristics highlighted in the theoretical framework, namely, ‘transparency’, ‘equality’ and ‘adequacy’ were used to interpret the responses to the questionnaires and corporate disclosure information to allow an assessment as to whether consumer <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> is being carried out responsibly in New Zealand. The findings indicate that consumer <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> in New Zealand overall, is being carried out in a responsible manner, with an emphasis being placed on prudent lending practice by banking corporation respondents. This has been further strengthened by a number of changes that have been made {{as a result of the}} global credit crisis. The results have illustrated concerns regarding three keys areas of the responsible lending theoretical framework, namely, commission payment processes, adequate insurance protection requirements and the continuing availability of subprime lending through ‘second-tier’ lenders. This paper adds to the limited literature of sustainability reporting in the financial sector. The study is important from a public policy perspective on disclosure of banking corporations’ lending practices and contributes to a global dialogue on corporate social responsibility in the financial industry. 27 page(s...|$|R
40|$|To find a {{model for}} {{national}} legislation, many lawmakers {{need look no further}} than their own backyards. People who live in states with strong laws against predatory lending are more likely to get <b>responsible</b> <b>mortgages</b> at a lower cost. Our findings show that state laws enacted to prevent predatory <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> work as intended to reduce abusive loan terms without impeding credit. Strong state laws have been good for consumers while supporting a thriving subprime lending market. They provide credit-strapped families with plenty of access to responsible home loans at typical [...] or even lower [...] costs. At least 24 states have passed specific anti-predatory lending laws to supplement federal protections aimed at ending abusive <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> practices...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the effect of}} the share of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> by individual banks (together with some control variables) on two measures of financial stability - the bank Z-score and the nonperforming loan ratio - for a sample of 212 banks in 19 emerging Asian economies for 2007 - 2013 from the Bankscope database. We find some evidence that an increased share of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> is positive for financial stability, specifically by lowering the probability of default by financial institutions and reducing the nonperforming loan ratio, at least in noncrisis periods, for levels of mortgage shares up to 30 %- 40 %. For higher levels of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> shares, the impact on financial stability turns negative. We also find that the share of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> can be a useful measure of both financial development and financial inclusion. This finding most likely reflects the effect of a higher share of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> in diversifying the mix of banks' assets and, thereby, reducing overall risk. However, if the share of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> is too high, then the diversification effect diminishes. Therefore, the challenge is to balance the expected improvement in financial stability due to asset diversification against negative impacts that might result from easier lending standards or overly rapid increases in <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> that could trigger a bubble in the housing market. This highlights the need for prudent monetary policy and macroprudential policy measures to forestall the development of such bubbles...|$|R
40|$|Using {{detailed}} information on lobbying and <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> activities, we find that lenders lobbying more on issues related to <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> (i) had higher loan-to-income ratios, (ii) securitized more intensively, and (iii) had faster growing portfolios. Ex-post, delinquency rates are higher in areas where lobbyist'' lending grew faster and they experienced negative abnormal stock returns during key crisis events. The findings are robust to (i) falsification tests using lobbying on issues unrelated to <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending,</b> (ii) a difference-in-difference approach based on state-level laws, and (iii) instrumental variables strategies. These results show that lobbying lenders engage in riskier lending.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{examines}} patterns of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> in metropolitan Buffalo, New York. The analysis {{is based on}} 1999 - 2002 HMDA data and 2000 Census data for metropolitan Buffa-lo. <b>Mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> patterns in census tracts are compared using descriptive statistics, GIS mapping, and multiple regression. The results from this analysis indicate that disparities in <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> between census tracts are attributable to differences in: educational at-tainment, neighborhood socioeconomic distress, residential stability, {{and the age of}} neigh-borhood housing stock. It is noteworthy that after controlling for other variables, race and core city location did not significantly affect <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> patterns. The findings from this analysis indicate that disinvestment is no longer confined to minority communities in core cities. Instead, it is becoming a more general phenomenon in metropolitan areas. Policy recommendations are forwarded in light of the findings from this research...|$|R

40|$|Regulatory {{regimes are}} {{actively}} discussing macroprudential policy. Korea pursued a countercyclical macroprudential approach {{to prevent the}} overheating of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> and {{to minimize the risk}} of loan default. The Korean financial supervisory authority made adjustments in response to both the condition of the housing market and trends in mortgage loans. The lessons learned from the Korean experience are applicable to other situations. First, regulations regarding loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios and other restrictions on <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> can be employed as an important part of a countercyclical framework. Next, measures need to be applied in a timely manner and according to the specific conditions of each country. Finally, authorities should preemptively prepare macroprudential instruments before banks enter a period of rapid <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> to avoid reckless <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> operations and weaken any speculative motive in the housing market.
