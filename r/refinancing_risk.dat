50|$|The fifth {{attempt is}} {{the slope of}} the yield curve. In theory, and given the {{existence}} of term premiums, issuing short-term debt is cheaper than issuing long-term debt. However, <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk</b> is higher for short-term debt and frequent refinancing implies a larger risk of financing with higher interest rates. Therefore, governments face a trade-off between cheaper funding costs, which tilts the duration towards short-term maturities and <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk,</b> which tilts the duration towards longer-term maturities. Generally, an upward-sloping yield curve is associated with higher long-term borrowing to meet investor demand and, hence, lower original sin.|$|E

The focus is on the euro area. Empirical estimations of a debt management reaction function indicate that the share of short term debt (i) responds to the yield curve or the level of interest rates, in line with the objective of cost minimisation; and (ii) has been increasing especially since the onset of the economic crisis. The increase in short term debt brings about higher <b>refinancing</b> <b>risks</b> and strengthens the interaction of public debt management with financial stability and monetary policy. The sharp increase in cross border ownership of public debt since the adoption of the euro further amplifies potential spill-over effects. Policy recommendations focus on the need for transparency on the use of derivatives and prudent debt management that reflects broader macroeconomic considerations. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the recent}} crisis, lags in the {{transmission}} mechanism of economic shocks, together with monetary and fiscal policy, {{made it difficult}} to assess the evolving dynamics of creditworthiness. As such, developments in financial markets became a key guide for investors and policymakers in determining the degree of financial distress that borrowers faced, providing a real-time update of market participants' views. However, simple measures of borrowing costs such as secondary market yields typically ignore differences in debt maturities and hence <b>refinancing</b> <b>risks.</b> This paper describes a new indicator of financial distress - the break-even maturity - that combines these factors. Using financial market data for euro area countries, the break-even maturity is shown to provide an alternative perspective on the absolute and relative risks associated with different borrowers that is distinct from the standard metrics gleaned from bond yields or credit-default swaps. As such, while break-even maturities are ultimately theoretical constructs, they can offer a valuable alternative perspective on how the financing pressures facing distressed borrowers are evolving in real-time...|$|R
40|$|We take {{a closer}} look at the links between {{corporate}} capital structure and productivity, profitability and access to finance based on Danish industry-level and firm-level accounting data from the period 2000 - 2011. Our results indicate that the capital structure has no significant impact on the firms' profitability or productivity. However, the capital structure is important in relation to the range of financing options available to the firm and its funding and <b>refinancing</b> <b>risks.</b> Our analysis shows that small and medium-sized enterprises with high solvency ratios tend to have a higher acceptance rate when they apply for bank loans than corresponding firms with low solvency ratios. We also find that firms issuing exchange-traded stocks have higher solvency ratios than unquoted public firms. Finally we compare the corporate capital structure in Denmark with other EU countries based on aggregated financial accounts statistics. The overall funding pattern of Danish firms is quite similar to the one found in the other European countries. However, the Danish firms tend to a somewhat lesser extent to use market based funding such as quoted shares and corporate bonds which might reflect a large and well-functioning Danish market for mortgage bonds and the prevalence of industry foundations in Denmark...|$|R

40|$|The {{real estate}} {{literature}} has been {{puzzled by the}} story of why a tax-exempt vehicle like REITs uses more debt than equity. We used empirical evidence on REITs and real estate operating companies (REOCs) in Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong from 2006 to 2010 and verified that REITs did use more debt than REOCs, despite borrowing constraints imposed on REITs in Hong Kong and Singapore. REITs also used more short-term debt to finance their real estate investment activities, but their total debt level declined during the crisis periods in 2007 and 2008. We found that higher long-term debt reduced the price over net asset value ratio (P/NAV), while short-term debt increased P/NAV {{of the real estate}} firms during normal times. However, the leverage effects of both the long-term and short-term debts were reversed when the credit crunch occurred in 2007 and 2008. Our study provides {{a better understanding of how}} REITs in Asia strategically employ larger amounts of short-term debt funding during normal times due to the lower funding cost, and not for tax or signaling reasons. However, during a financial credit crunch, REITs that do not substitute short-term debt by long-term debt are exposed to huge <b>refinancing</b> <b>risks</b> and their stock prices are heavily discounted. The results are in line with a strategic pecking order of first using cheap short-term funding and reversing into equity funding when debt cost rises.

We find that, in a proportional-costs setting, the optimal strategies are always mixed in terms of <b>risk</b> management and <b>refinancing.</b> In contrast, when fixed issuance costs are too high relative to the firm’s profitability, optimal management does not involve refinancing.

We find evidence that the volume of housing transactions increase when the payment profile is increasing and households have little housing equity. In contrast, we show that loans that allow for a rapid accumulation of home equity can still have positive participation effects without increasing the volatility of the housing market.

40|$|Purpose – Credit default swap (CDS) spreads may not {{represent}} the accurate credit risk levels (asymmetric spread behavior) of assets with the initiation of corporate events, such as merger, spin-off or other similar events in which one entity succeeds to the obligations of another entity.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a conceptual framework for the relationship between the ISDA succession language and CDS spreads in order to clarify the factors behind the asymmetric spread behavior around several corporate activities. Design/methodology/approach – The authors develop a conceptual driver model to establish a link between company characteristics and succession issues.

40|$|The {{external}} {{environment has}} deteriorated sharply {{as a result}} of the spiraling financial turmoil, and has led to a weakening in commodity prices and fears of a worldwide recession. Latin America and the Caribbean's fastest expansion in 40 years may be threatened as the global credit crunch makes financing scarce and squeezes demand for the region's commodities. This time around the region is better positioned to weather the crisis than in the past, given improvements in macroeconomic and financial policies as well as a reduced net dependency on external capital inflows. However, Latin American markets are feeling the effects of the crisis through a slowdown in capital inflows, large declines in stock price indexes, significant currency adjustments and an increase in debt spreads. Volatility has soared, with the closely watched Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index moving to an all-time high of 70. 33 on October 17, indicating that fear (rather than greed) has been ruling the markets. After reaching record lows in May 2007, emerging markets bond spreads are now above pre-Asian crisis levels. The JPMorgan EMBI+ Latin American composite widened by 146 basis points in the third quarter, with spreads reaching 448 basis points at the end of September. Spreads have widened sharply in recent weeks as foreign investors cut back regional exposure for the safety of U. S. Treasuries. The ongoing lack of liquidity and subsequent liquidation of assets is leading to a collapse in asset prices and a sharp widening in spreads. Daily spreads in October have risen to levels not seen since December 2002, making it much more difficult for governments that need financing to get it. Risk premiums for Latin corporates and sovereigns have risen substantially, but have remained well below U. S. junk (high-yield) bonds. Latin corporates are facing a steep rise in foreign exchange borrowing costs (although less than firms in other emerging markets), which raises concerns that <b>refinancing</b> <b>risks</b> will climb. So far, emerging markets vulnerabilities have been more focused on corporates, as sovereigns have improved public debt dynamics and countries' financing needs are under control. Market performance has been driven by the rapid deterioration of emerging markets bank and corporate market, as well as ongoing losses in emerging markets equities. From January to September 2008, the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Latin American Index lost almost 28 %, while the Emerging Markets Index lost 37 % and the G- 7 Index lost 24 %. While in 2007 the Latin America component gained 47 %, almost nine times as much as the MSCI-G 7 index for developed markets, since mid-September 2008 stocks in Latin America have been doing worse than stocks in developed countries, as concerns about access to credit and the adverse impact of sharp falls in commodity prices and in local currencies contribute to increased risk aversion and to outflows of capital. Many governments in the region have used revenue from the commodity boom to pay down debt and build reserves. Now, facing a global financial crisis and the threat of recession in developed countries, the biggest question for Latin America is how long and deep this cyclical downturn will be, and how much it is going to reduce commodity prices. Prices for commodities such as soy, gold, copper and oil, which helped fund the region's boom, have fallen 28 % since their July 2 high, according to the RJ/CRB Commodity Price Index. According to Morgan Stanley (in a September 29 report), should prices return to their 10 -year average, Latin America's balanced budgets would quickly revert to a deficit of 4. 1 % of GDP. As risk aversion increases, investors are rapidly pulling out massive amounts of money, creating problems for local markets and banks. There is an ongoing shortage of dollars (as investors liquidate assets in Latin American markets), and as currencies depreciate, inflation concerns increase despite the global slowdown. In Brazil and Mexico, central banks deployed billions of dollars of reserves to stem steep currency declines, as companies in these countries, believing their local currencies would continue to strengthen against the U. S. dollar, took debts in dollars. Some companies also made bets using currency derivatives that have led to losses in the billions of dollars. Dramatic currency swings have caused heavy losses for many companies, from Mexico's cement giant Cemex SAB to the Brazilian conglomerate Grupo Votorantim. Mexico's third-largest retailer, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, declared bankruptcy recently after reporting huge losses related to exchange rate bets. As concerns about corporate exposure to dollar-denominated derivatives increases, yields on bonds issued by many of Brazil's and Mexico's leading companies have started to rise, sharply raising the cost of issuing new debt. Latin American external debt issuance came to a halt in the third quarter of 2008, totaling only US$ 690 million. The cost of obtaining loans for capital expenditures, M&A and debt refinancing is also rising substantially for Latin American corporates amid contagion from the U. S. financial crisis. According to bankers, a protracted trend of shortening tenors and widening spreads has intensified in the past few weeks, indicating that bank lending is quickly following the way of bonds and equity. Finally, money transfers from Latin American migrants are expected to decline for the first time this decade, {{as a result of}} economic downturns in the U. S. and Spain, inflation and a weaker dollar. The Mexican Central Bank announced that money transfers from Mexicans living in the U. S. dropped a record 12. 2 % in August. In 2008, migrants from the region will send some 1. 7 % less in remittances year-on-year when adjusted for inflation, according to the IADB, compounding the adverse effects of the deepening financial turmoil...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation comprises three independent essays on banking and corporate finance. The essays are preceded by {{an introduction to}} the thesis. The first essay explores whether <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk</b> is an important determinant of debt-maturity decisions. To this end, it investigates how firms with <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk</b> choose the maturity of new loans they obtain during the 2007 [...] 2009 financial crisis. The firms' <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk</b> is measured by the maturing portion of outstanding long-term debt. The result shows that firms with a high <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk</b> choose longer maturities. The second essay examines the association between a lead arranger's relationship with a firm and its retained share in the loan to that firms. While some literature indicates that lending relationships can help to alleviate ex post agency conflicts, others imply that relationship lead arrangers may use their information advantage to exploit syndicate participants. Using syndicated loans made to U. S. firms, this article shows that lead arrangers retain a smaller share in lending relationships with firms. The third essay (co-authored with Jens Forssbaeck) examines the relationship between collateral and credit rationing. In theory, the use of collateral in credit contracting should mitigate the information problems that are widely held to be the primary cause of credit rationing. However, direct empirical evidence on this link is scant. Using survey data that provides clean measures of quantity and loan size rationing, our results suggest that collateral reduces the likelihood of experiencing loan-size credit rationing...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose the}} {{creation}} of “Trichet Bonds” as a comprehensive solution to the current sovereign debt crisis in the EU area. “Trichet Bonds,” to be named after the ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet, will be similar to “Brady Bonds” that resolved the Latin American debt crisis in the late 1980 s and were named after the then Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Like the Brady Bonds, Trichet Bonds will be new long-duration bonds issued by countries in the EU area that will be collateralized by zero-coupon bonds of the same duration issued by the ECB. The zero-coupon bonds will be sold by the ECB to the countries issuing Trichet Bonds, which will be offered in exchange for outstanding sovereign debt of the countries. The exchange is offered at market value, so current debt holders will experience a “haircut” from par value, and thus the exchange does not involve a “bailout. ” However, present holders of sovereign debt will be exchanging low quality bonds with limited liquidity, for higher quality bonds with greater liquidity. Debt holders not accepting the exchange will be at risk of a forced restructuring {{at a later date}} at terms less favorable. The effect of the exchange offer, if a threshold of approximately 70 % approve it, is to replace old debt with a lesser amount of new debt with longer maturities. The creation of Trichet bonds will result in various advantages both in comparison to the present unstable situation and other proposed solutions. First, the long duration of Trichet bonds will eliminate the immediate crisis caused by short term expiration of significant amounts of debt which is looming over Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and possibly other EU countries. Second, the guarantee of the principal with the zero-coupon ECD bond collateral increases the quality of the Trichet Bonds compared to existing sovereign debt. Third, the market for the new Trichet Bonds will be liquid and likely to trade at appreciating prices as <b>refinancing</b> (roll-over) <b>risk</b> is reduced and time is allowed for economic reforms by the issuing countries (a condition of the ECB) to take effect. In addition, the exchange of existing sovereign debt for Trichet bonds will force many European banks holding the sovereign debt to take the write-offs required, thus making their own balance sheets more transparent. Many European banks are thought to have large holdings of sovereign debt from the “peripheral” countries that have not been marked-to-market, and thus represent sizeable potential losses for the banks when the sovereign debt is ultimately restructured, as we believe it must be over the next few years. Most of the sovereign bank debt likely to be exchanged, however, is held by larger German, French and Swiss banks with the capability (if not necessarily the desire) to take the write-offs required. The overhang of such future losses affects the entire European banking system {{at a time when it}} too is being restructured. The ECB, and the European central banks need to identify those banks that are impaired by excessive sovereign holdings and assist them in recapitalization – the sooner the better – but they should also push the larger, stronger banks to accept the exchange offers in the interest of bank transparency and restructuring as well as in resolving the sovereign debt problem. Clearly the two problems – sovereign debt and bank restructuring – are connected. The issuance of Trichet Bonds, will help to resolve both problems by recognizing market realities and offering an easier way out than through a forced, cram-down restructuring once the ailing sovereigns exhaust their ability to repay the existing debt. There are significant advantages to Trichet bonds over other discussed solutions to the sovereign debt problem. One such proposed solution is the issuance of “Euro Bonds” guaranteed by the Eurozone countries or the EU itself for the purpose of redeeming sovereign bonds by market purchases, or by lending the proceeds to the countries involved for them to acquire their debt. Apart from the considerable political obstacles to such a program, the undertaking actually makes it less likely that existing self-interested debt-holders will sell in the market. The implication of the program is that either through market interventions that push prices up, or by the assumption that the program will continue to enable the debt to be retired at par on maturity, debt-holders won’t sell unless the price is pushed high enough to constitute a bailout. The ECB’s current efforts to support the prices of distressed sovereign bonds is currently having this effect, which transfers some, if not all of the cost of resolving the problem to European taxpayers, where increasingly it is resented. The alternative approach, that has only been discussed by market participants, is for a Russian or Argentine solution in which the debt-holders are made a take-it-or-leave-it offer to exchange outstanding debt for new, generally illiquid bonds at an arbitrary price that discourages future investment by the market. Such an approach is understood by the sovereign debt market to constitute a de facto default. Such a default would likely have serious adverse consequences for the Euro and the EU, and may be less likely that a bailout of some kind. The great advantage of Trichet Bonds is that they avoid both bailouts and defaults.

40|$|We study optimal {{government}} debt maturity {{in a model}} where investors derive monetary services from holding riskless short-term securities.

We then extend the model to allow private financial intermediaries to compete with the government in the provision of money-like claims.

40|$|Credit {{ratings have}} become a widely {{accepted}} measure of firms’ creditworthiness in financial markets. Despite the significant growth of rating agencies, with a continuous reliance on credit ratings by regulators, investors and firms, prior academic literature generally tends to underestimate the relevance of credit ratings in firms’ financial decision-making. This thesis, therefore, provides a comprehensive analysis, which aims to {{examine the impact of}} external credit ratings on the financial structure decision-making of UK firms. The thesis has three empirical chapters. The first empirical chapter examines whether there are any systematic differences in firms’ levels of leverage across the rating levels which would suggest that the cost and benefits of credit ratings are material for such firms. The study finds that credit ratings are an important determinant of the capital structures of firms {{and that there is a}} strong non-linear inverted U-shaped relationship between credit ratings and capital structures. It is noted that rated firms have higher leverage than non-rated firms, but within the rated firms, leverage varies across the rating levels. High and low rated firms are found to have low leverage in their capital structures, and mid rated firms generally have higher leverage. Low gearing ratios may suggest that such firms have higher incentive to maintain their current ratings or to achieve upgrades, given the cost and benefits offered by credit ratings, than firms with high gearing ratios. The second empirical chapter investigates whether costs and benefits of credit ratings are material enough for potential and actual credit ratings changes to matter in the financial decision making of the firms. It does not appear from the empirical evidence that marginal changes in credit ratings possibly impose any serious costs on the rated UK firms. Whether credit ratings changes are potential or actual, they do not lead firms to follow any specific pattern with regards to their capital structure, which would suggest that firms are concerned about the marginal rating changes. Within the rating scale, however, some differences are noted among high and low rated firms. High (low) rated firms tend to issue (reduce) debt when they have a higher likelihood of upgrades. Similarly, high rated firms issue debt when they are actually upgraded or downgraded, while low rated firms are found only to reduce debt when they are upgraded indicating their efforts towards maintaining or achieving higher credit ratings. The third empirical chapter examines the influence of credit ratings on the debt maturity structure of UK firms by testing Diamond’s (1991) liquidity hypothesis. Consistent with the predictions, the results indicate that firms’ debt maturity structures are significantly influenced by their levels of <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk,</b> and that this <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk</b> induces a strong non-linear relationship between credit ratings and debt maturity structures. It appears that high rated firms possibly have low levels of <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk,</b> which allows them to select debt with short maturity. Low rated and non-rated firms are also found to have shorter debt maturities, despite being exposed to high levels of <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk.</b> It appears that these firms may have constrained access to long-term debt markets and, therefore, they have to rely mostly on short-term debt. Mid rated firms, however, have more long-term debt, which appears to be due to their better access to debt markets as well as their exposure to some degree of <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new composite index - the financial supply index (FSI), which measures {{the level of}} supply of foreign capital to 11 EU new member states (NMS). We aim {{to fill the gap}} in the literature, which has so far focused on creating indices that measure the financial conditions only, while the economic factors, also important determinants of capital flows, have been overlooked. FSI includes both the financial and economic determinants of capital flows and is estimated using Kalman filtering, principal components and variance-equal weights approach. Three financial supply cycles in NMS could be extracted based on the analysis of FSI dynamics. The results indicated that the main drivers of financial supply to NMS are externally determined, with economic sentiment and business climate in the Eurozone carrying the highest weight. In addition, we create a new indicator - the <b>Refinancing</b> <b>Risk</b> Ratio (RRR), which relates the supply and demand for foreign capital, to quantify the external refinancing conditions and risk faced by the government. We are able to distinguish between two main episodes of high <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk</b> faced recently by the EU NMS - one during the global financial crisis, and the other during the European sovereign debt crisis, but the episodes significantly differ in nature...|$|E

They show that, if the {{asymmetry of information}} is concentrated around long-term cash flows, firms finance with coupon-bearing long-term debt that partially restricts dividend payments. If the asymmetry of information is concentrated around near-term cash flows and there exists considerable <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk,</b> firms finance with coupon-bearing long-term debt that does not restrict dividend payments. Finally, if the asymmetry of information is uniformly distributed across dates, firms finance with short-term debt. Copyright 1995 by American Finance Association. ...|$|E

Special attention is devoted to analyzing the dynamics and structure of Moldova's foreign debt by currency and sector, in terms of the components parts of the foreign debt risk of Moldova - <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk,</b> currency risk and interest rate risk. It is analyzed the external state debt, publicly guaranteed, and non-guaranteed private external debt...|$|E
40|$|Consider a {{competitive}} bank whose illiquid asset portfolio {{is funded by}} short-term debt {{that has to be}} refinanced before the asset matures. We show that in this setting maximal transparency is not socially optimal, and that the existence of social externalities of bank failures further lowers the optimal level of transparency. Moreover, asset risk taking recedes as the level of transparency declines towards the socially optimal level. As for the sign of the transparency impact on <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk,</b> it is negative given the risk associated with the asset, but ambiguous if one accounts for its indirect effect via risk taking. financial stability; information disclosure; market discipline; Basel III; global games...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, both highly indebted {{countries}} and OECD countries have repurchased {{part of their}} outstanding debt, the former usually at substantial discounts on the face value. The main objectives of a debt repurchase are to reduce both the risks {{and the costs of}} debt service. The risk that is considered is <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk.</b> Then, buybacks could help reducing the costs of indebtedness for three reasons. They can help reducing the outstanding debt and they can be a way to increase the liquidity of the secondary market by switching from illiquid to liquid bonds. Finally, buybacks could be used to eliminate “unfair” risk premium since they can make a government enhance its commitment to an announced policy. ...|$|E
40|$|Firms obtain {{improved}} {{access to credit}} supply after their debt is referenced by credit default swaps (CDS). However, CDS-referenced firms also face tougher creditors and greater <b>refinancing</b> <b>risk.</b> In this context, we examine how firms manage their liquidity {{in response to the}} introduction of CDS trading on their debt. We find that firms hold significantly more cash after the inception of CDS trading. This finding is robust to the endogeneity of CDS trading, using instrumental variables and propensity score matching. The increase in cash holding by CDS firms is more pronounced for firms with lines of credit, suggesting that banks with CDS protection impose greater discipline on firms, causing them to take a more conservative risk management approach...|$|E
