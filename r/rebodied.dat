25|$|The {{last two}} front-engined Tigers {{known to have}} been <b>rebodied</b> were two {{completed}} by Vernon Priaulx, then coachbuilder for Guernseybus in 1991/2. After the success of open top RT-type AEC Regent III on tourist routes on Guernsey two former Jersey Motor Transport Tiger PS1s were purchased. Their Reading of Portsmouth bodies were too decayed to be restored so the first Tiger was <b>rebodied</b> as a single-deck open topper (Southport Corporation had used Ribble PS2s as such in the 1960s) and the second became a 35-seat coach with full-length sunshine roof. Both went to Mac Tours of Edinburgh after Guernseybus closed and passed to the Ensignbus preserved fleet, although the open topper is to operate a tourist service back on Jersey in 2012. On repatriation to Jersey it was registered J1942.|$|E
25|$|Hong Kong has {{the only}} fully {{double-decker}} tram fleet in the world. Most of the trams in operation were <b>rebodied</b> between 1987 and 1992. They {{are equipped with}} sliding windows.

25|$|It {{originally}} had a Packard body. It was <b>rebodied</b> by Paris coach builder Weymann as a two-door fixed head coupe. The Weymann body was replaced after {{the car was}} crashed by Ettore Bugatti who in 1930 or 1931 fell {{asleep at the wheel}} travelling home from Paris to Alsace necessitating a major rebuild.|$|E
25|$|Automóviles Lamborghini has {{produced}} two <b>rebodied</b> {{versions of the}} Diablo called the Eros and the Coatl.

The company has announced the production of a speedboat called the Lamborghini Glamour.|$|E
25|$|Statesman and Caprice are {{essentially}} long-wheelbase variants of the Commodore range and, as of 2006, were the largest rear-wheel drive sedans offered by GM. Internationally, Statesmans and Caprices have been rebadged as the Buick Royaum, Daewoo Statesman and Chevrolet Caprice. In addition, these cars have {{formed the basis}} of the Chinese-built Buick Park Avenue and the Bitter Vero, a <b>rebodied</b> version from Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{outdated}} {{layout of}} the half-cab single deck and its low seating capacity exercised the minds {{of a number of}} operators from the mid-1950s. Barton Transport converted PS1s to 27ft 6in long double-deckers and Tiger PS2s, including the former City coach to 30ft double deckers, the later ones carrying fully fronted Northern Counties double-deck bodies. Yorkshire Traction, in the BET group did systematic conversions of most of their fleet of Tigers from about 1955-63, using Charles H. Roe or Northern Counties bodies, Yorkshire Woollen District later following suit. Yorkshire Traction also oversaw the rebodying of five PS2s for Stratford Blue Motors, costed refurbishing the chassis at £500 and purchasing the bodies at £3,000 per bus at a time when a complete PD2 would cost over £5,000. Alexander took the running units from its 17 OPS2s in 1961 and fitted them into new Titan PD3 frames, then fitted units from scrapped PS1s into the former OPS2s. When fitted with new Alexander bodies the recycled double-deckers could only be distinguished from similar new deliveries in that they retained the traditional radiator and bonnet from the Tigers whilst the new buses had full-width bonnets. Ulster Transport Authority also <b>rebodied</b> many of its Tigers in the 1950s, using new Leyland Titan PD2 chassis frames and Metro-Cammell bodyframes completed at UTA's Belfast coachworks. CIÉ stripped a late batch of OPS3s of their units and purchased new Titan PD3 frames and St Helens Style glassfibre bonnets, and had the vehicles assembled in 1961-62 complete with Park Royal body frames by a company called Commercial Road Vehicles who were renting part of the former Great Northern Railway (Ireland) central works in Dundalk. These 'R900' Titans were CIÉ's last front-engine double-deckers, again the R series had started in 1934 with Dublin United Transport.|$|E

2500|$|ETCE {{carried out}} a program of heavy {{rebuilding}} of 18 Pullmans, much more extensive than the earlier rebuildings and effectively a full rebodying, for use exclusively on its new ETS system; these were renumbered into the series 101–118. [...] The Santiago system opened on 24 December 1991, using four ex-Zürich vehicles (renumbered 501–504) and the first few of the <b>rebodied</b> Pullmans. [...] Within two months, these had been joined in Santiago by eight brand-new Chinese [...] "Shenfeng" [...] trolleybuses (601–608) from Norinco, which ETCE/ETS purchased after evaluating a prototype Shenfeng vehicle in Valparaíso in early 1990. [...] China has had several trolleybus manufacturers, and these nine units for ETCE/ETS were notable in being the first Chinese-built trolleybuses ever exported outside of Asia.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Alfa Romeo {{announced}} that the 8C {{was not to be}} sold to private owners, but by autumn 1931 Alfa sold it as a rolling chassis in Lungo (long) or Corto (short) form with prices starting at over £1000. The chassis were fitted with bodies from a selection of [...] Italian coach-builders (Carrozzeria) such as Zagato, Carrozzeria Touring, Carrozzeria Castagna, Pininfarina and Brianza, even though Alfa Romeo did make bodies. Some chassis were clothed by coach-builders such as Graber, Worblaufen and Tuscher of Switzerland and Figoni of France. Alfa Romeo also had a practice of rebodying cars for clients, and some racing vehicles were sold <b>rebodied</b> as road vehicles. Some of the famous first owners include Baroness Maud Thyssen of the Thyssen family, the owner of the aircraft and now scooter company Piaggio Andrea Piaggio, Raymond Sommer, and Tazio Nuvolari.|$|E
