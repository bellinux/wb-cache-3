5000|$|... "HH" [...] is {{the home}} <b>repeater</b> number and has twenty {{possible}} values, 01 through 20. Talkgroups usually use their home <b>repeater</b> by default, unless the <b>repeater</b> is already in use by other Talkgroups. If the home <b>repeater</b> is in use, the controller will assign another free <b>repeater</b> at random. If no <b>repeater</b> is free (all are in use), then the radio will receive a busy signal.|$|R

5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, <b>repeaters</b> may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E
5|$|After {{experimentation}} on the Brighton experimental ensemble, Ofcom advertised {{for small}} scale DAB multiplexes to broadcast across the United Kingdom on ten localised multiplexes for a nine-month trial period, then extended {{for an extra}} two years. The trials will test the viability of using free and open source software (FOSS) with low cost equipment to broadcast from a single transmitter, a single frequency network or channel <b>repeaters</b> to allow smaller radio stations to broadcast more cost effectively than is currently possible on local multiplexes.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} raised {{criticism}} against several fundamental shortcomings in the network system. The most fundamental {{is the lack of}} indoor coverage. This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing <b>repeaters</b> at for instance medical clinics, Oslo Courthouse and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other shortcomings are that the location of base stations are publicly know, allowing for easy sabotage and increased investment costs because of the choice of the proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.|$|E

5|$|Youngstown {{is served}} by 10 {{television}} stations, three of which are <b>repeaters</b> of TV stations in other cities, and a fourth coming {{in the near future}} from Pittsburgh NBC affiliate WPXI in nearby New Castle, Pennsylvania, that would easily penetrate Youngstown pending FCC approval. This is unusual for a mid-sized city near large metro areas such as Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Nearby Akron, with a larger population than Youngstown and Warren combined, has no local television stations and relies on Cleveland for its local news. The community's 273,480 television households make the Youngstown market the nation's 106th largest, according to Nielsen Media Research.|$|E
5|$|Although Howe {{was in a}} {{favourable}} position, Villaret had {{not been}} idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was {{within a few hours}} of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took full advantage of his position on the weather gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe's formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the French, with frigates acting as <b>repeaters</b> for the admiral's commands. The French were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, Sinclair {{disclosed}} in an FCC filling {{that it was}} unable to find buyers for the three affected stations, requiring changes to its transaction. In Harrisburg, Sinclair chose to retain WHP-TV, and divest WHTM to Media General. However, in Charleston and Birmingham, the company proposed to shut down stations entirely (rather than selling them to other buyers that would also handle their operational responsibilities) so it could maintain legal duopolies; surrendering the licenses for WCIV and the full-powered <b>repeaters</b> of WBMA-LD (WJSU and WCFT), and moving their ABC programming to Sinclair's existing stations WMMP and WABM respectively – which would shift their existing MyNetworkTV programming to digital subchannels. After nearly a year of delays, Sinclair's deal to acquire Allbritton was approved by the FCC on July 24, 2014.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} <b>repeater</b> insertion for low power under a given timing budget. We propose a novel <b>repeater</b> insertion algorithm to compute the optimal <b>repeater</b> number and width in the discrete solution space, as defined by a given <b>repeater</b> library. Using our algorithm, we show that rounding the solution under the continuity assumption to the closest discrete solution candidate may result in suboptimal designs, or it may even fail to find an existing solution. Given a certain tolerance to the degradation of <b>repeater</b> power dissipation, we address two practical and highly important questions: (1) How coarse could the <b>repeater</b> size granularity be? (2) What range should the <b>repeater</b> size be in? Experimental results demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed scheme and provide valuable insights into <b>repeater</b> library design. Our approach achieves up to 23 % power reduction in comparison to rounding-based approaches. With a 4 % power degradation tolerance, <b>repeater</b> size granularity as coarse as 8 λ can be used, reducing the library size by more than 87 %. For interconnects with various wire lengths and timing targets, our investigation reveals that the range of optimal <b>repeater</b> sizes for low-power is limited, indicating that a low-cost small-size <b>repeater</b> library, if well designed, is adequate to provide high quality <b>repeater</b> insertion solutions...|$|R
50|$|Because the {{transmitter}} and receiver are on at the same time, isolation must exist to keep the <b>repeater's</b> own transmitter from degrading the <b>repeater</b> receiver. If the <b>repeater</b> {{transmitter and receiver}} are not isolated well, the <b>repeater's</b> own transmitter desensitizes the <b>repeater</b> receiver. The problem is similar to being at a rock concert {{and not being able}} to hear the weak signal of a conversation over the much stronger signal of the band.|$|R
5|$|Such mergers were theorized {{to produce}} kilonovae, and {{evidence}} for a kilonova associated with GRB 130603B was seen. The mean duration of these events of 0.2 seconds suggests (because of causality) a source of very small physical diameter in stellar terms; less than 0.2 light-seconds (about 60,000km or 37,000 miles—four times the Earth's diameter). This further suggests a very compact object as the source. The observation of minutes to hours of X-ray flashes after a short gamma-ray burst is consistent with small particles of a primary object like a neutron star initially swallowed by a black hole {{in less than two}} seconds, followed by some hours of lesser energy events, as remaining fragments of tidally disrupted neutron star material (no longer neutronium) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole, {{over a longer period of}} time. A small fraction of short gamma-ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from soft gamma <b>repeaters</b> in nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with <b>repeaters</b> for each of the aircraft instruments needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E
