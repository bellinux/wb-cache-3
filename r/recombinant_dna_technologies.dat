25|$|The {{human insulin}} protein is {{composed}} of 51 amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 5808 Da. It is a dimer of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by disulfide bonds. Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in carbohydrate metabolism effects) from human insulin because of these variations. Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the Biochemistry of Foods, Peter Eck {{explains}} <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies</b> in food. Pages 543-545 {{explain the}} use of glycerophospholipid cholesterol acyltransferase and the reaction products which are lysophospholipids. He states that “the enzyme preparation is used in egg yolk and whole eggs, in processed meats, in degumming of vegetable oils, in milk products such as cheese, and in bakery products containing eggs, such as cake products.” Then he lists each one and that in milk, the enzyme produces lysophospholipids from the phospholipids. He further explains that the enzyme preparation converts phospholipids to lysophospholipids {{in each of the}} above areas. Lysophosphatidylcholine is a lysophospholipid. This is significant and shows that there are unnaturally high amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine in enzyme-modified foods.|$|E
50|$|The term GM ("genetically modified") {{is often}} used as a synonym of {{transgenic}} to refer to plants modified using <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies.</b> Plants with transgenic/GM disease resistance against insect pests have been extremely successful as commercial products, especially in maize and cotton, and are planted annually on over 20 million hectares in over 20 countries worldwide (see also genetically modified crops). Transgenic plant disease resistance against microbial pathogens was first demonstrated in 1986. Expression of viral coat protein gene sequences conferred virus resistance via small RNAs. This {{proved to be a}} widely applicable mechanism for inhibiting viral replication. Combining coat protein genes from three different viruses, scientists developed squash hybrids with field-validated, multiviral resistance. Similar levels of resistance to this variety of viruses had not been achieved by conventional breeding.|$|E
5000|$|GMOs are {{commonly}} {{considered to be}} any organism whose DNA has been modified by human intervention. Agricultural practices, however, have long used selective breeding techniques for the same purpose as modern biotechnology. Researchers now define genetically engineered organisms (GEOs) as those that are produced {{from a range of}} <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies,</b> which introduce a transgene into the genome of a host cell. The most widely practiced method involves the use of bacteria, which are able to penetrate the cell membrane of the host. Other methods include a [...] "gene gun" [...] or [...] "biolistic particle delivery system". Recombinant DNA technology allows for the creation of synthetic genes with specific traits that have anthropogenic benefits. The term GEOs will be used here to describe organisms produced by the recombinant DNA technology commonly referred to by usage of the term GMOs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Like natural viruses, manmade protein cages {{for drug}} {{delivery}} {{are to be}} ideally formed by repetitive subunits with self-assembling properties, mimicking viral functions and molecular organization. Naturally formed nanostructures (such as viruses, flagella or simpler protein oligomers) can be engineered to acquire specific traits of interest in biomedicine, for instance through the addition of cell targeting agents for desired biodistribution and specific delivery of associated drugs. However, fully artificial constructs would be highly desirable regarding finest tuning and adaptation to precise therapeutic purposes. Although engineering of protein assembling {{is still in its}} infancy, arising principles and promising strategies of protein manipulation point out the rational construction of nanoscale protein cages as a feasible concept, reachable through conventional <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies</b> and microbial protein production. </p...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{represent}} a review {{on the recent}} literature dealing with the presence, expression, biological function and defence role of antimicrobial peptides in Teleosts.

They {{represent a}} primary line of defence (innate or aspecific) against the microbial aggressions originating from the aquatic environment. The results of preliminary investigations suggest that antimicrobial peptides could represent an alternative to antibiotics in the therapy of infectious diseases, therefore the current research is aimed to the synthesis of these molecules by <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies</b> and to the selection of fish stocks able to over-express them...|$|E
