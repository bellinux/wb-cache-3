50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>filing</b> long predated milling. A <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> by Jacques de Vaucanson, circa 1760, is well known. It {{is clear}} that milling {{machines}} as a distinct class of machine tool (separate from lathes running <b>rotary</b> <b>files)</b> first appeared between 1814 and 1818. The centers of earliest development of true milling machines were two federal armories of the U.S. (Springfield and Harpers Ferry) together with the various private armories and inside contractors that shared turnover of skilled workmen with them.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Using one <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> {{can result}} in a faster canal preparation. This can be done with several file systems and endodontic motors. In the present study, a newly single <b>file</b> {{technique}} (one <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> technique) with available <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> systems is introduced. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate centering ability and remaining dentin thickness of 2 rotary nickel-titanium systems (Mtwo versus RaCe) and instrumentation techniques (conventional versus one <b>rotary</b> <b>file)</b> by cone-beam computed tomography. Materials and Methods: A total of 76 mandibular molar teeth were selected and divided to 4 groups (n = 19 teeth with 57 canals). The teeth were mounted in resin and pre-instrumentation scans were prepared by Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). The canals instrumented with Mtwo and RaCe <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> either in conventional or one <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> technique (ORF). After cleaning and shaping of distal and mesial canals, post instrumentation scans were performed by CBCT in the same position as pre instrumentation scans. Centering ability and remaining dentin thickness were evaluated by Planmeca Romexis viewer. The data were analyzed with analysis of variance and post hoc t test (P 0. 05). However, in a few cross-sections, conventional technique and/or RaCe showed higher centering ability. One <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> technique with either RaCe or Mtwo was significantly faster than conventional technique (P = 0. 02). There was no significant difference among groups regarding file fracture. Mesiolingual canals showed more transportation compared with mesiobuccal and distal canals. Conclusions: Both of the instrumentation systems and techniques produced canal preparations with adequate centering ratio. One <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> technique prepared canal significantly faster than conventional technique...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{incidence}} of apical root cracks and dentinal detachments after canal preparation with hand and <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> at different instrumentation lengths. Methods Two hundred forty mandibular incisors were mounted in resin blocks with simulated periodontal ligaments, and the apex was exposed. The root canals were instrumented with <b>rotary</b> and hand <b>files,</b> namely K 3, ProTaper, and nickel-titanium Flex K files to the major apical foramen (AF), short AF, or beyond AF. Digital images of the apical surface of every tooth were taken during the apical enlargement at each file change. Development of dentinal defects was determined by comparing these images with the baseline image. Multinomial logistic regression test was performed to identify influencing factors. Results Apical crack developed in 1 of 80 teeth (1. 3 %) with hand files and 31 of 160 teeth (19. 4 %) with <b>rotary</b> <b>files.</b> Apical dentinal detachment developed in 2 of 80 teeth (2. 5 %) with hand files and 35 of 160 teeth (21. 9 %) with <b>rotary</b> <b>files.</b> Instrumentation with <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> terminated 2 mm short of AF and did not cause any cracks. Significantly less cracks and detachments occurred when instrumentation with <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> was terminated short of AF, as compared with that terminated at or beyond AF (P <. 05).

Sixty size 25 Profile® nickel titanium <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> were tested, thirty 0. 04 and thirty 0. 06 taper.

Materials and methods: In this descriptive study 200 general dentists were randomly selected in Esfahan. A questionnaire was prepared by two endodontists to collect demographic information and to assess knowledge, attitudes and skill in relation to the use of <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> among the subjects. Data was analyzed with SPSS 20 using Mann‒Whitney and Kruskal‒Wallis statistical tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Of 182 participants completing the questionnaires, 86 (47. 25 %) used rotary files; 5. 8 % provided correct replies in knowledge, with 1. 4 % in attitudes and 9. 9 % in skill areas.

40|$|Many new <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> {{systems have}} been introduced, however, limited {{research}} has been conducted related to the surface irregularities of these files and if these have any effects on the files themselves. Hence, the aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze surface irregularities of the ProTaper® Universal <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> (PTU) and the ProTaper Next? <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> (PTN) before and after instrumentation in curved canals. The main objective was to investigate the nature of these irregularities and how they might influence the use and fracture of <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> during root-canal treatments. The files were examined pre-operatively using a stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) to analyze surface imperfections and the presence of particles. Mesial roots of forty extracted mandibular molars were selected. Each instrument was used to prepare one of the mesial canals. The files were then rinsed with alcohol, and autoclaved and analyzed again. Of the 80 files used in this study, five files fractured, five files unwound and seven files were curved or bent and they all belonged to the PTU group. Irregularities and debris could be visualized with the SEM on both unused PTU and PTN files. Most of the debris was found associated with deeper milling grooves and defects on the surface of the metal. Surface analysis of the files that were used and sterilized were performed and the SEM images demonstrated organic debris, metal flash, and crack formation and initiation of fractures for both file types. All files showed machining grooves, metal flash, debris, and defects on cutting edges. These irregularities appear to be critical in the accumulation of debris and initiation of fatigue and crack propagation within the NiTi alloy.

40|$|Introduction: Nickel-titanium <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> were {{originally}} developed {{to allow for}} greater flexibility when instrumenting root canals. The increased flexibility of nickel-titanium instruments allowed operators to negotiate canal curvatures with greater ease. File design is continually changing. Manufacturers are trying to produce files that will work more efficiently and safely. Knowing the properties of files marketed is especially important in helping to choose an appropriate file system. Current ISO standards require force measurements at a static point along the file. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the flexibility of four different nickel-titanium files at three different points along the file. Materials and Methods: Flexibility of four different nickel-titanium <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> (EndoSequence, ProFile, Vortex, and Vortex Blue) was measured. Each file was clamped at 3 mm, 5 mm, or 7 mm (n = 10 /length/file) and a universal testing machine was used to bend the files to a maximum deflection of 4. 5 mm. All data were statistically analyzed by two-way analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey test (P = 0. 05) to determine any significant differences. Results: Statistically significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) differences were present. In general, ProFile was the stiffest, displaying the greatest force and bending moment values.
