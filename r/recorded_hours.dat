40|$|Depending {{on gender}} and activity, {{overcrowding}} and safety concerns may detract from urban green space use. Differences in use displacement intentions from a recreational trail {{in a forest}} in Vienna were investigated {{for male and female}} walkers as well as male and female dog-walkers (N�=� 425) using an image-based stated preference model. The trail scenarios were depicted as digitally calibrated images that systematically displayed combinations of levels of crowding with different mixes of user types and visitor behaviour. Visitors were asked whether the presented recreation scenario was so unacceptable that they would shift their use away from the presented trail. Hours and days of stated non-use of the recreation trail by various user groups are estimated by integrating the results of the behavioural model with annual visitation data. Use displacement intentions differed by gender and activity. High use levels were a greater concern for all respondents than very low use levels, particularly for female dog-walkers. However, only a small proportion of the <b>recorded</b> <b>hours</b> were heavily used. Safety concerns about very low use levels reduced the potential times of forest use for female walkers without a dog. dog, safety, gender, stated preference, urban park management,...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{consider}} individual professional assistance for pupils with learning difficulties in mathematics. In addition, I also present {{some forms of}} non-professional assistance: parents assistance, peer-tutoring, tutoring and computer aided assistance. The mainly focus is, however, on the approaches and strategies of mathematic teachers and other professionals in providing individual assistance in mathematics and {{on the effectiveness of}} selected forms of non-professional assistance. In the experimental part of the thesis I explore individual assistance for pupils with learning difficulties as is provided by two experts – a mathematics teacher and a special needs educator. I conducted a case study in which, using non-participatory observation and other methods, I studied two experts as they provided individual assistance to a pupil. In six <b>recorded</b> <b>hours</b> of individual assistance for a pupil with learning difficulties I studied various aspects of the assistance by analysing the transcription of the dialogues from individual lessons. The analysis revealed that the mathematic teacher and special needs educator used two consistent but different approaches. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses o both approaches to individual assistance is important in designing interventions aimed at improving pupils knowledge of mathematics...|$|E
40|$|The {{intent of}} the {{research}} is to present a critical methodological analysis of the clinical phenomenon referred to as bulimia. Specifically, the project is a theoretical analysis of bulimia from the Systems/Communications (S/C) perspective. It is termed a 2 ̆ 2 critical 2 ̆ 2 analysis because it constitutes an ongoing critical (self-reflective) commentary on a topic. In practical terms, the present methodological approach has two aspects. The first is the utilization of the S/C model or framework to provide a 2 ̆ 2 reasonable 2 ̆ 2 and coherent 2 ̆ 2 explanation 2 ̆ 2 {{of many of the}} clinical phenomena associated with bulimia. In practice this means selecting excerpts from a series of nine <b>recorded</b> <b>hours</b> of therapy with a bulimic client and 2 ̆ 2 understanding 2 ̆ 2 these transactions through the S/C perspective. The second aspect is to draw inferences concerning potential treatment practices from the S/C perspective. Dept. of Psychology.

40|$|Experimental {{prolonged}} febrile seizures (FS) lead to {{structural and}} molecular changes that promote hippocampal hyperexcitability and reduce seizure threshold to further convulsants. However, whether these seizures provoke later-onset epilepsy, {{as has been}} suspected in humans, has remained unclear. Pre-viously, intermittent EEGs with behavioural observations for motor seizures failed to demonstrate sponta-neous seizures in adult rats subjected to experimental prolonged FS during infancy. Because limbic seizures may be behaviourally subtle, here we determined the presence of spontaneous limbic seizures using chronic video monitoring with concurrent hippocampal and cortical EEGs, in adult rats (starting around 3 months of age) that had sustained experimental FS on postnatal day 10. These subjects were compared with groups that had undergone hyperthermia but in whom seizures had been prevented (hyperthermic controls), {{as well as with}} normothermic controls. Only events that fulfilled both EEG and behavioural criteria, i. e. electro-clinical events, were considered spontaneous seizures. EEGs (over 400 <b>recorded</b> <b>hours)</b> were normal in all nor-mothermic and hyperthermic control rats, and none of these animals developed spontaneous seizures. In contrast, prolonged early-life FS evoked spontaneous electro-clinical seizures in 6 out of 17 experimental rats (35. 2 %). These seizures consisted of sudden freezing (altered consciousness) and typical limbic automatisms that were coupled with polyspike/sharp-wave trains with increasing amplitude and slowing frequency on EEG...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{benzodiazepine}} 1 (BZ 1) receptor agonist SX- 3228 were studied in rats (N = 12) implanted for chronic sleep procedures. Administration of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 5 mg/kg SX- 3228, sc, to rats 1 h after {{the beginning of the}} light phase of the light-dark cycle induced a significant reduction of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) during the third <b>recording</b> <b>hour.</b> Moreover, slow wave sleep (SWS) was increased during the fourth <b>recording</b> <b>hour</b> after the two largest doses of the compound. Administration of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 5 mg/kg SX- 3228 one hour after the beginning of the dark period of the light-dark cycle caused a significant and maintained (6 -h recording period) reduction of waking (W), whereas SWS and light sleep (LS) were increased. REMS values tended to increase during the entire recording period; however, the increase was statistically significant only for the 1. 0 mg/kg dose during the first <b>recording</b> <b>hour.</b> In addition, a significant and dose-related increase of power density in the delta and the theta regions was found during nonREM sleep (LS and SWS) in the dark period. Our results indicate that SX- 3228 is a potent hypnotic when given to the rat during the dark period of the light-dark cycle. Moreover, the sleep induced by SX- 3228 during the dark phase closely resembles the physiological sleep of the rat...|$|R
