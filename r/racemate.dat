40|$|Many of {{the drugs}} {{currently}} used in medical practice are mixtures of enantiomers (<b>racemates).</b> Many a times, the two enantiomers differ in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Replacing existing <b>racemates</b> with single isomers has resulted in improved safety and/or efficacy profile of various <b>racemates.</b> In this review, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic implications of chirality are discussed in brief, followed by an overview of some important chiral switches that have yielded safer alternatives. These include levosalbutamol, S-ketamine, levobupivacaine, S-zopiclone, levocetirizine, S-amlodipine, S-atenolol, S-metoprolol, S-omeprazole, S-pantoprazole and R-ondansetron.

40|$|A {{strategy}} {{aimed at}} developing faster chiral screening approaches is proposed {{in this paper}} by mixing samples and simultaneously screening the resulting mixture of <b>racemates.</b> The data matrix of the mixture obtained by diode array detector or mass spectrometry is deconvoluted into resolved chromatograms and spectra through a multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares algorithm. The individual <b>racemates</b> are then identified through the resolved UV spectra, and enantiomeric excess ratios can be measured via the resolved chromatograms. Two representative experiments were carried out to verify the feasibility of the strategy. A mixture containing five pairs of racemic solutes was successfully screened on Chiralcel OD column in one-fifth of the conventional analysis time. Another mixture containing 10 <b>racemates</b> gained nine-tenths of the original screening time on three CSPs with a predictive accuracy above 90 %...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{resolution}} of <b>racemates</b> through diastereomeric salt formation is presented. An essential feature of this new method {{is the use of}} mixtures of resolving agents. The application of certain mixtures results in an efficient and fast crystallisation of enantiomerically enriched salts. It turns out that these salts still contain a mixture of the resolving agents. Via this new method, referred to as the Dutch Resolution (DR) technology, the success rate in identifying and performing adequate resolutions of <b>racemates</b> has been greatly improved. ...|$|R

25|$|Pharmacological {{studies on}} synephrine {{date back to}} the late 1920s, when it was {{observed}} that injected synephrine raised blood pressure, constricted peripheral blood vessels, dilated pupils, stimulated the uterus, and relaxed the intestines in experimental animals. Representative of this early work is the paper by Tainter and Seidenfeld, who were the first researchers to systematically compare the different effects of the two synephrine enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, {{as well as of the}} <b>racemate,</b> d,l-synephrine, in various animal assays.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{doses of}} escitalopram usually cause {{relatively}} minor untoward effects such as agitation and tachycardia. However, dyskinesia, hypertonia, and clonus may occur in some cases. Plasma escitalopram concentrations are {{usually in a}} range of 20–80 μg/L in therapeutic situations and may reach 80–200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, those who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods. Chiral techniques are available to distinguish escitalopram from its <b>racemate,</b> citalopram. Escitalopram seems to be less dangerous than citalopram in overdose and comparable to other SSRIs.|$|E

P 2010 {{was performed on}} chiral stationary phase of cellulose ramification (chiralpak OD and chiralpak OJ) by high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods, which included ibuprofen (C 1), ketoprofen (C 2), nitrendipine (C 3), nimodipine (C 4), felodipine (C 5), omeprazole (C 6), praziquantel (C 7), propranolol hydrochloride (C 8), atenolol (C 9), sulpiride (C 10), clenbuterol hydrochloride (C 11), verapamil hydrochloride (C 12), and chlorphenamine maleate (C 13). The mobile phase consisted of isopropanol and n-hexane. The detection wavelength was set at 254 nm and the flow rate was 0. 7 mL/min. The enantiomers {{separation of}} these thirteen <b>racemates</b> on chiralpak OD column and chiralpak OJ column was studied, while the effects of proportion of organic additives, alcohol displacer and temperature on the separation were studied. And the mechanism of some of <b>racemates</b> was discussed. The results indicated that thirteen chiral drugs could be separated on chiral stationary phase of cellulose ramification in normal phase chromatographic system. The chromatographic retention and resolution of enantiomers could be adjusted by factors including column temperature and the concentration of alcohol displacer and organic alkaline modifier in mobile phase. It was shown that the resolution was improved with reducing concentration of alcohol displacer. When concentration of organic alkaline modifier was 0. 2 % (v/v), the resolution and the peak shape were fairly good. Most <b>racemates</b> mentioned above had better resolution at column temperature of 25 °C.

5000|$|... 1-Phenylethylamine is a {{methylated}} benzylamine derivative {{which is}} chiral; enantiopure forms are obtained by resolving <b>racemates.</b> Its racemic form is sometimes known as (±)-&alpha;-methylbenzylamine. [...] Both benzylamine and 1-phenylethylamine form stable ammonium salts and imines {{due to their}} relatively high basicity.|$|R
25|$|Clinically, {{thalidomide}} {{has always}} {{been used as a}} <b>racemate.</b> Generally the S-isomer is associated with the infamous teratogenic effects of thalidomide and the R-isomer is devoid of the teratogenic properties but conveys the sedative effects, however this view is highly debated and {{it has been argued that}} the animal model that these different R- and S-effects were seen in was not sensitive to the thalidomide teratogenic effects. Later reports in rabbits, which is a sensitive species, unveiled teratogenic effects from both isomers. Moreover, thalidomide enantiomers have been shown to be interconversed in vivo due to the acidic chiral hydrogen in the asymmetric center (shown, for the EM-12 analog, in Figure 3), so the plan to administer a purified single enantiomer to avoid the teratogenic effects will most likely be in vain.|$|E
25|$|MDMA and {{metabolites}} {{are primarily}} excreted as conjugates, such as sulfates and glucuronides. MDMA is a chiral compound {{and has been}} almost exclusively administered as a <b>racemate.</b> However, the two enantiomers {{have been shown to}} exhibit different kinetics. The disposition of MDMA may also be stereoselective, with the S-enantiomer having a shorter elimination half-life and greater excretion than the R-enantiomer. Evidence suggests that the area under the blood plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) was two to four times higher for the (R)-enantiomer than the (S)-enantiomer after a 40mg oral dose in human volunteers. Likewise, the plasma half-life of (R)-MDMA was significantly longer than that of the (S)-enantiomer (5.8±2.2 hours vs 3.6±0.9 hours). However, because MDMA excretion and metabolism have nonlinear kinetics, the half-lives would be higher at more typical doses (100mg is sometimes considered a typical dose).|$|E
25|$|John Jacob Abel in Baltimore only {{partially}} purified adrenal extracts {{to what he}} called ″epinephrin″, and Otto von Fürth in Strasbourg to what he called “Suprarenin”. The Japanese chemist Jokichi Takamine, who had set up his own laboratory in New York, invented new isolation procedure and obtained it in pure crystal form in 1901 and arranged for Parke-Davis to market it as ”Adrenalin”, spelt without the terminal “e”. In 1903, natural adrenaline {{was found to be}} optically active and levorotary, in 1905 synthesis of the <b>racemate</b> was achieved by Friedrich Stolz at Hoechst AG in Höchst (Frankfurt am Main) and by Henry Drysdale Dakin at the University of Leeds, in 1906 the chemical structure was elucidated by Ernst Joseph Friedmann (1877–1956) in Strasbourg, and in 1908 the dextrorotary enantiomer was shown to be almost inactive by Arthur Robertson Cushney (1866–1926) at the University of Michigan, leading him to brilliantly conclude that ″the ‘receptive substance’ affected by adrenalin″ is able to discriminate between the optical isomers and, hence, itself optically active. Overall, 32 designations have been coined, of which “adrenaline”, preferred in the United Kingdom, and “epinephrine”, preferred in the United States, persist as generic names in the scientific literature.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Chiral separations of five β-adrenergic antagonists (propranolol, esmolol, atenolol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol) {{were studied}} by {{capillary}} electrophoresis using six cyclodextrins (CDs) as the chiral selectors. Carboxymethylated-β-cyclodextrin (CM-β-CD) exhibited a higher enantioselectivity power {{compared to the}} other tested CDs. The influences of the concentration of CM-β-CD, buffer pH, buffer concentration, temperature, and applied voltage were investigated. The good chiral separation of five β-adrenergic antagonists was achieved using 50 mM Tris buffer at pH 4. 0 containing 8 mM CM-β-CD with an applied voltage of 24 kV at 20 °C. In order to understand possible chiral recognition mechanisms of these <b>racemates</b> with CM-β-CD, host-guest binding procedures of CM-β-CD and these <b>racemates</b> were studied using the molecular docking software Autodock. The binding free energy was calculated using the Autodock semi-empirical binding free energy function. The results showed that the phenyl or naphthyl ring inserted in the hydrophobic cavity of CM-β-CD and the side chain was found to point out of the cyclodextrin rim.
