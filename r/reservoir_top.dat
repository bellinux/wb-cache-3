50|$|The Howden Reservoir is a Y-shaped <b>{{reservoir}},</b> <b>top</b> one of {{the three}} in the Upper Derwent Valley, England. The western half of the reservoir lies in Derbyshire, whereas the eastern half is in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The county border runs through the middle of the reservoir, following the original path of the River Derwent. The longest arm is around 1.25 miles (2 km) in length. The reservoir is bounded at the southern end by Howden Dam; below this, the River Derwent flows immediately into Derwent Reservoir and subsequently the Ladybower Reservoir. Other tributaries include the River Westend, Howden Clough and Linch Clough.|$|E
50|$|The lack of {{suitable}} geophysical data on {{the reservoir}} required serious precautions. The well was designed to have numerous backups to ensure that if the <b>reservoir</b> <b>top</b> was penetrated accidentally that the casing strings {{would be able to}} handle the overpressure. There was also the problem of the encountering other loss zones such as those experienced by the appraisal wells, which was overcome through a combination of strict control of the drilling and its location, along with careful analysis of the various geological variables. This ensured that the correct-sized wells were drilled through the loss zones and that the over-pressured shales were avoided by careful monitoring of the pore pressure. In total nine wells were drilled for production (seven central wells and two satellite wells).|$|E

It gave control over the basement structure, but since the first four wells proved reservoir sands varied from 141-410m in thickness over a relatively short distance, the survey gave little control over the trapping structure. Seismic maps on both horizons and subsurface information showed the reservoir structure and helped limit drilling in dry holes.|$|R

The topmost layer of the CO 2 plume can be most accurately characterized, its rate of growth quantified, and CO 2 flux at the <b>reservoir</b> <b>top</b> estimated.

40|$|Pressure drops {{associated}} with reservoir production generate excess {{stress and strain}} that cause travel-time shifts of reflected waves. Here, we invert time shifts of P-, S-, and PS-waves measured between baseline and monitor surveys for pressure reduction and reservoir length. The inversion results {{can be used to}} estimate compaction-induced stress and strain changes around the reservoir. We implement a hybrid inversion algorithm that incorporates elements of gradient, global/genetic, and nearest neighbour methods and permits exploration of the parameter space while simultaneously following local misfit gradients. Our synthetic examples indicate that optimal estimates of reservoir pressure from P-wave data can be obtained using the reflections from the <b>reservoir</b> <b>top.</b> For S-waves, time shifts {{from the top of the}} reservoir can be accurately inverted for pressure if the noise level is low. However, if noise contamination is significant, it is preferable to use S-wave data (or combined shifts of all three modes) from reflectors beneath the reservoir. Joint wave type inversions demonstrate improvements over any single pure mode. Reservoir length can be estimated using the time shifts of any mode from the <b>reservoir</b> <b>top</b> or deeper reflectors. We also evaluate the differences between the actual strain field and those corresponding to the best-case inversion results obtained using P- and S-wave data. Another series of tests addresses the inversion of the time shifts for the pressure drops in two-compartment reservoirs, as well as for the associated strain field. Numerical testing shows that a potentially serious source of error in the inversion is a distortion in the strain-sensitivity coefficients, which govern the magnitude of stiffness changes. This feasibility study suggests which wave types and reflector locations may provide the most accurate estimates of reservoir parameters from compaction-induced time shifts...|$|E

Conversely, cyclic flows of CO 2 -brine and CO 2 -gas increase the fracture aperture abruptly after each gas flow period, producing a progressive decrease of the caprock seal capacity. Aperture increase is controlled by decohesion of the clay framework within a micrometer-scale-thick layer induced by CO 2 -gas acidification.
