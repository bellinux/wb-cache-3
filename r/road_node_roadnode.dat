40|$|Abstract: Since {{the traffic}} {{congestion}} {{become more and}} more serious in modern society due to the sharp increasing of private cars, how to improve the transportation efficiency and utilize the current road network more effectively has become a crucial issue. In this paper, a new dynamic route guidance algorithm was proposed in order to provide travelers humanized “optimal route ” and to alleviate the loss caused by traffic jams. The study built a graph theory model for Beijing’s ring road transportation system, and proposed a evaluation function σ=Vf/[k×(t+m(ρ-ρ 0)) ] to describe the real time complex traffic flow, and realized the route searching by timed recomputation of classic Dijkstra algorithm. Meanwhile, due to the investigation of special features of ring roads, the study improved the priority of ring <b>road</b> <b>nodes</b> during the searching process. Comparing with Dijkstra algorithm, the time-complexity of this new algorithm decreases to 1 /(16 k 2) (k is the number of ring road in the road network), and extra mileage is less than 5 %, which is more effective applying in large scale ring-road networks. The algorithm was realized by C++ language and connected to Google Earth’s map database with easy operation interface.

Starting from USA defi nition of the SG considering the fi fth- and sixth- properties of the SG: It accommodates all generation and storage options and it enables new products, services and markets. We can determine EV role in the SG operation.

The most interesting for electric power there are Pure EVs and PHEVs that are consumers and also kind of electricity storage devices (very important in SG). These types may be charged “in home”, using special station with diff erent time of charging; there is also considered charging during the time waiting for change of lights on <b>road</b> <b>nodes</b> (junctions).

In order to further understand the spatial and temporal characteristics of urban residents, this paper research takes the taxi trajectory data of Beijing as a sample data and studies the spatio-temporal characteristics of the residents' activities on the weekdays. At first, according to the characteristics of the taxi trajectory data distributed along the road network, it takes the Voronoi generated by the <b>road</b> <b>nodes</b> as the research unit.

40|$|AbstractCurrent mobile {{systems for}} {{assisted}} navigation have limited effectiveness in satisfying user needs. The information content supporting location-based service discovery and path calculation is usually shallow. Semantic-based technologies can allow {{to overcome these}} limitations, by exploiting accurate and meaningful descriptions of locations, Points of Interest (POIs), road segments and environmental conditions. We present here a general framework leveraging an enriched cartography, which may be useful not only to enhance travel satisfaction and safety, but also to regulate vehicle efficiency, traffic and environmental impact. The availability of annotated map data is a crucial requirement to make practically viable such a proposal. Unfortunately, the majority of available systems is developed upon closed and proprietary solutions for both maps and software applications, so third parties cannot extend their functionality. To go beyond this restriction, the framework presented here is based on open standards and tools: in particular, it leverages Semantic Web technologies and crowd-sourced maps available from OpenStreetMap ([URL] enriching nodes and POIs with semantic annotations to enable innovative Location Based Services (LBSs) for traveling users. Particularly, the paper proposes a general method for storing semantic annotations into OpenStreetMap <b>road</b> <b>nodes</b> and POIs.

As taxies in Chinese cities continually drive along the streets seeking passengers, FCD can easily traverse the entire street network in a city on a daily basis. Taking advantage of this situation, this study extracted passenger pickup and drop-off locations from FCD sourced from 6445 taxis over a 2 -week period in Nanjing, China to discover human behavioral patterns and the dynamics behind them. In this study, <b>road</b> <b>nodes</b> are converted to the points, based on which Thiessen polygons are generated to divide the study area into small areas with the goal of exploring the spatial distribution of pickup and drop-off locations. Moran's I index is used to calculate the spatial autocorrelation of the spatial distribution of pickup and drop-off locations, and hot spot analysis is used to identify statistically significant spatial clusters of hot and cold spots. The spatial and temporal patterns of FCD in the study area are investigated, and the results show that: (1) the temporal patterns show a strong daily rhythm, (2) the spatial patterns show that the number of pickup and drop-off locations gradually diminish from the downtown areas to the outer suburbs, (3) the spatiotemporal patterns exhibit large differences over time, and (4) the driving forces explored by regression models indicate that population density and transportation density are consistent with the population distribution, but per capita disposable income is not consistent with the population distribution.

40|$|As a {{favorite}} {{urban public transport}} mode, the bike sharing system is a large-scale and complicated system, and there exists a key requirement that a user and a bike should be matched sufficiently in time. Such matched behavior makes analysis of the bike sharing systems more difficult and challenging. This paper considers a more general large-scale bike sharing system from two important views: (a) Bikes move in an irreducible path graph, which is related to geographical structure of the bike sharing system; and (b) Markovian arrival processes (MAPs) are applied to describe the non-Poisson and burst behavior of bike-user (abbreviated as user) arrivals, while the burstiness demonstrates that the user arrivals are time-inhomogeneous and space-heterogeneous in practice. For such a complicated bike sharing system, this paper establishes a multiclass closed queueing network by means of some virtual ideas, for example, bikes are abstracted as virtual customers; stations and roads are regarded as virtual nodes. Thus user arrivals are related to service times at station nodes; and users riding bikes on roads are viewed as service times at <b>road</b> <b>nodes.</b> Further, {{to deal with this}} multiclass closed queueing network, we provide a detailed observation practically on physical behavior of the bike sharing system in order to establish the routing matrix, which gives a nonlinear solution to compute the relative arrival rates in terms of the product-form solution to the steady-state probabilities of joint queue lengths at the virtual nodes. Based on this, we can compute the steady-state probability of problematic stations, and also deal with other interesting performance measures of the bike sharing system. We hope that the methodology and results of this paper can be applicable in the study of more general bike sharing systems through multiclass closed queueing networks.

40|$|Significant erosion {{occurred}} from recently constructed forest logging {{roads and}} skid trails {{in a small}} headwater catchment in Peninsular Malaysia. Soil loss was estimated by measuring dimensions of all significant rills and gullies along the road, {{as well as by}} measuring height of preserved soil pedestals in sidecast and fill material and on skid trails. Estimates of surface erosion from logging roads and skid trails were 272 ± 20 t ha-+ year-+ and 275 ± 20 t ha-+ year-+ respectively. However, owing to lack of connectivity of skid trails to the stream, much of the sediment mobilized on skid trails was stored either on adjacent hillslopes or the trails themselves, rather than being transported to the stream system, as was the case for the road. Steeper skid trails (> 20 % gradient) had slightly higher erosion rates (320 ± 24 t ha-+ year-+ than trails with gentler gradients (245 - 264 t ha-+ year-+). Some 60 % of the soil loss on logging roads comes from erosion of the running surface. Disturbed cut and fill material along the road supplied the remaining 40 % of the soil loss from roads. Roads and skid trails had no designed drainage systems; runoff discharged onto the hillslope at 25 major discharge nodes from the logging road (690 m total length) and at 34 nodes from skid trails (2300 m). Sediment pathways were either fully or moderately connected to headwater channels at 64 % of the logging <b>road</b> <b>nodes,</b> but at only 26 % of the nodes emanating from skid trails. A detailed sediment budget revealed that 78 % of the soil loss from the road system (including log landings) was delivered to the stream in the first 16 months after logging began. Most (90 %) of the deposition from skid trails occurred below just three discharge nodes. Runoff from and onto skid trails often exacerbated the sediment connectivity to channels. Clearly, sediment discharge from logging roads was more highly connected to the stream than discharge from skid trails. Once in the channel, much of this sediment was temporarily stored in the floodplain and behind woody debris. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R
