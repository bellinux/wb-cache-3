Health care services which reduce child mortality also <b>reduce</b> <b>fertility</b> when life expectancy reaches a level which anticipates the need for fewer children. Generally, this is a more costly way to <b>reduce</b> <b>fertility</b> than family planning.

25|$|The first menstrual {{bleeding}} {{is referred}} to as menarche, and typically occurs about two years after thelarche. The average age of menarche is 12.5 in the United States. Most American girls experience their first period at 11, 12 or 13, but some experience it earlier than their 11th birthday and others after their 14th birthday. In fact, anytime between 8 and 16 is normal. In Canada, the average age of menarche is 12.72, and in the United Kingdom it is 12.9. The time between menstrual periods (menses) is not always regular {{in the first two years}} after menarche. Ovulation is necessary for fertility, but may or may not accompany the earliest menses. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third year and 10% in the sixth year. Initiation of ovulation after menarche is not inevitable.

2500|$|As {{genes are}} capable of {{producing}} individual altruism, they {{are capable of}} producing conflict among genes inside the genome of one individual. This phenomenon is called intragenomic conflict and arises when one gene promotes its own replication in detriment to other genes in the genome. The classic example is segregation distorter genes that cheat during meiosis or gametogenesis and end up in {{more than half of the}} functional gametes. These genes persist even resulting in <b>reduced</b> <b>fertility.</b> Egbert Leigh compared the genome to [...] "a parliament of genes: each acts in its own self-interest, but if its acts hurt the others, they will combine together to suppress it" [...] to explain the relative low occurrence of intragenomic conflict.|$|E
