Anecdotal {{evidence suggests that the}} public is concerned with the level of remuneration given to executive officers. The authors examine the attitudes and views of individual shareholders on agency costs and disclosure issues pertaining to the <b>remuneration</b> of executive <b>officers</b> of Australian public companies. The results of the authors' empirical investigation suggest that shareholders are seeking more transparency in relation to the determining of executive <b>officer</b> <b>remuneration.</b> The results suggest support for the use of remuneration committees, comprehensive disclosure in Annual Reports and disclosure of achievements against performance targets in a broad and transparent disclosure regime. Despite the empirical investigation being undertaken prior to the Company Law Review Act 1998 (Cth), the results of the research suggest shareholders would support the disclosure regime that was put in place by the Company Law Review Act 1998...|$|R

40|$|Commentators {{frequently}} remark on {{the need}} to pay high levels of chief executive <b>officer</b> <b>remuneration</b> to attract, motivate and retain the best executives for Britain's leading companies. This paper presents the results of an empirical investigation into tenure, promotion and executive remuneration. The remuneration of the chief executive officers at some of Britain's largest businesses is examined. In the majority of cases the CEO had not been lured away from rivals but had risen through the internal labour market, often after a long-term employment relationship. Moreover, long job tenure and internal promotion were associated with higher levels of pay. It is concluded that understanding of this controversial issue will be improved if it is recognized that a part of current executive pay may be a reward for previous successful performance. ...|$|R
40|$|We examine chief {{executive}} <b>officer</b> <b>remuneration</b> disclosure in Australia from 1998 to 2004. Disclosure was first {{required by the}} "Company Law Review Act 1998 " ("CLRA 98 "). Despite "CLRA 98 "'s clear intentions, firms generally failed to comply until the requirements were formalized by "Director and Executive Disclosures by Disclosing Entities" ("AASB 1046 "), issued in 2004. For a sample of 124 firms, we find significant improvements in disclosure concurrent both with "CLRA 98 " and "AASB 1046 ". We also find firm size, corporate governance, auditor quality, cross-listing status and public scrutiny to be significant explanations of disclosure. Our results indicate that high quality disclosures will only come about through detailed, black letter requirements and that principle-based legislation involving interpretative discretion is unlikely to produce the desired level of disclosure.

40|$|One {{aspect of}} the study of {{executive}} remuneration that has received comparatively little attention is its ability to shed light on the governance of the corporation. The level of a Chief Executive <b>Officer’s</b> <b>remuneration</b> will embody information on both the market within which a business operates and the effectiveness of its independent directors as instruments of corporate governance. Differences in the salaries of top directors that cannot be accounted for by differences in business performance may provide useful evidence on the health of a company’s governance mechanisms. This paper contains the results of an empirical investigation into the role of external competition and internal controls in generating the executive salaries that we observe in the United Kingdom’s leading firms. It also considers whether compliance with the corporate structures prescribed by external committees is likely to curtail some of the excesses seen in the past.

40|$|Monetization {{policy which}} is also {{referred}} to as “monetization of fringe benefits ” is a new approach to the <b>remuneration</b> of public <b>officers</b> in Nigeria. Acts 2002 which provided the reference point for monetization of the salaries and allowances of all categories of Federal Public Servants stipulated that the fringe benefits which were formally paid in kinds be converted to cash by the salary and wage commission. The policy makers believed that the scheme will encourage private initiatives and facilitate creativity and motivation and most importantly, improve the service of quality delivery, promote patriotism and efficiency among civil servants. This paper investigated the economic implications of the Monetization policy using Nigeria data. The ordinary least square multiple regression analytical method was used for the data analysis. Some statistical tools were employed to explore the relationship between these variables. The analysis started with the test of stationarity and co-integration of Nigeria’s time series data. The empirical study found that the data were stationary and co integrated. The multiple regression results showed a significant but negative relationship between monetization and gross domestic product in Nigeria. These results were robust to a number of econometric specifications. Our findings and conclusion support the need for the government to be more disciplined in handling good polices. The Nigerian experience shows that although the positive benefits of monetization policy are disputable, positive results will be achieved if the conditions needed for monetization policy to work properly are set in place...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{statutory}} executive {{stock option}} (ESO) disclosures by Australian listed companies, and their nature, extent and association with governance characteristics. The study {{is motivated by}} the limited prior Australian studies that find evidence of low levels of compliance with ESO disclosures (Nelson and Percy, 2005), and by the changes in Australia's regulatory environment over the financial years 2001 to 2004. Arising from these motivations, three research questions are addressed: 1) {{what is the nature}} and extent of compliance with ESO disclosures in annual reports and does it change over time?, 2) how does corporate governance influence compliance with ESO disclosures?, and 3) what other factors influence compliance with ESO disclosures? Based on prior research and an application of agency theory, the research questions are addressed by systematically evaluating ESO disclosure compliance, and by modelling and testing the governance and other factors associated with companies' disclosure practices over the 2001 to 2004 study period. Within the agency framework, it is argued that effective governance mechanisms mitigate agency costs by decreasing information asymmetry through increased disclosure. Hence it is predicted that internal governance mechanisms, including the effectiveness of the board of directors, the effectiveness of the audit committee, the existence of a compensation committee, and management incentives are associated with the level of compliance with ESO disclosures. In addition, external governance mechanisms are predicted to influence compliance with ESO disclosures. Specifically, it is predicted that firms responded positively to the increased media and regulatory scrutiny on financial reporting practices as a result of major corporate collapses in Australia and the United States. Furthermore, it is predicted that regulatory intervention, in the form of new and comprehensive ESO disclosure requirements, as well as the authoritative guidance on valuing options and active enforcement efforts by ASIC, have contributed to increased levels of compliance. Using a combination of univariate and multivariate procedures, compliance and governance characteristics are tested over the financial years 2001 to 2004, to capture the changes in compliance over time and to examine the hypothesised relationships. The results of this thesis indicate that Australian companies do not fully comply with ESO disclosure requirements. Nevertheless, the results show that overall compliance has increased progressively from 2001 to 2004, suggesting that the increased scrutiny of companies' financial reporting practices following major corporate collapses has motivated companies to increase compliance. Notably, compliance has increased after the introduction of new and more comprehensive disclosure requirements for ESOs, as well as increased authoritative guidance and enforcement efforts by ASIC. However, despite the overall evidence of improvement in compliance levels, the results continue to reveal management's reluctance to disclose ESO information that may be considered sensitive (for example, price and value-related information). The multivariate results indicate that firms with a larger board of directors and a larger audit committee are more likely to encourage greater levels of compliance with ESO disclosures. However, a larger board of directors appears to take a holistic approach to monitoring company activities by encouraging higher overall compliance rather than focusing on specific, sensitive disclosures. Where a less independent Chairperson is present, the firm is more likely to disclose more sensitive information only, indicating a substitution effect whereby firms mitigate the agency problems associated with this lack of independence by increasing sensitive disclosures. Also, where the Chief Executive <b>Officer's</b> <b>remuneration</b> is relatively larger, companies are less forthcoming about ESO information. With respect to the influence of external corporate governance, the findings indicate that companies identified as poor performers by the Australian Shareholders' Association (a measure of external governance) exhibit lower levels of overall compliance, but not compliance with sensitive disclosures. This latter finding suggests that poorly performing firms provide similar levels of sensitive and important information as other firms, possibly to direct attention away from the low performance of the company. Consistent with prior disclosure research, other factors associated with compliance include leverage, where firms that are more highly leveraged disclose more sensitive information in an effort to become more transparent to creditors, thus reducing their monitoring costs. The use of a Big 4 auditor (a proxy for auditor quality) is associated with overall compliance, which indicates that external auditors primarily ensure that the financial report as a whole is compliant with the regulations, rather than identifying sensitive disclosures in detail, particularly where these disclosures may not have a material effect. Lastly, performance (as measured by profit or lossmaking status) is negatively associated with compliance. By investigating in detail {{the nature and extent of}} compliance with ESO disclosures over time and its relation to governance characteristics, the findings of this study demonstrate that while companies appear to lack full compliance with ESO disclosures, compliance has increased over time with active regulatory enforcement and assistance and comprehensive disclosure requirements. Of particular interest, is that the nature of compliance illustrates the very low levels of compliance with important, but sensitive, components of the required ESO disclosures. Importantly, the adoption of stronger governance structures appears to enhance compliance with ESO disclosures, including sensitive disclosures. Therefore, the findings of this study have important implications for corporate regulators, standard setters, financial statement preparers, shareholders and other users of financial reports with an interest in ESOs...|$|R
