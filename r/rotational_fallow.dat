40|$|The new {{techniques}} proposed for {{agriculture in the}} Amazon region include <b>rotational</b> <b>fallow</b> systems enriched with leguminous trees and the replacement of biomass burning by mulching. Decomposition and nutrient release from mulch were studied using fine-mesh litterbags with five different leguminous species and the natural fallow vegetation as control. Samples from each treatment were analyzed for total C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, lignin, cellulose content and soluble polyphenol at different sampling times {{over the course of}} one year. The decomposition rate constant varied with species and time. Weight loss from the decomposed litter bag material after 96 days was 30. 1 % for Acacia angustissima, 32. 7 % for Sclerolobium paniculatum, 33. 9 % for Iinga edulis and the Fallow vegetation, 45. 2 % for Acacia mangium and 63. 6 % for Clitoria racemosa. Immobilization of N and P was observed in all studied treatments. Nitrogen mineralization was negatively correlated with phenol, C-to-N ratio, lignin + phenol/N ratio, and phenol/phosphorus ratios and with N content in the litterbag material. After 362 days of field incubation, an average (of all treatments), 3. 3 % K, 32. 2 % Ca and 22. 4 % Mg remained in the mulch. Results confirm that low quality and high amount of organic C as mulch application are limiting for the quantity of energy available for microorganisms and increase the nutrient immobilization for biomass decomposition, which results in competition for nutrients with the crop plants...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of short rotation Desmodium distortum planted fallow on maize grain yield and soil properties, an experiment was conducted over four consecutive years (1995 - 1998) at two locations (Minkoameyos in the humid forest zone and Ntui in the forest-savannah transition zone) in Centre Cameroon. The experimental design for each year was made of four replications and three treatments: i) Natural Fallow used as control (NF), ii) Desmodium Fallow (DF) and iii) Soybean (Glycine max) Rotation (SR). Maize (Zea mays) was used as plant test and was planted {{each year in the}} first cropping season (March-June) followed by each treatment from July to February. The analysis of variance and mean separation (Tukey's HSD) were used to evaluate the effects of treatments on maize yield and soil chemical properties {{at the end of the}} experiment. No treatment could produce relatively more than the first year of the experiment where maize yields were based on 7 - 8 year-old natural fallow in both sites. However, in Minkoameyos, there was a significant difference (p= 0. 043) between the treatments in the fourth year. Desmodium plots out-yielded both natural fallow and soybean plots. In Ntui, there was a highly significant difference (p= 0. 000) among treatments in the third and fourth years. Desmodium plots also outyielded both natural fallow and soybean plots; while natural fallow plots out-yielded soybean plots. The general trend of productivity was ranked as: DF> NF> SR. Apart from the available P that has shown a highly significant difference (p= 0. 000) compared to the initial value and to other treatments, no other significant difference was noticed with other soil properties in both sites. However, the general trend is that most soil chemical properties tended to decrease excepted pH water and available phosphorus. The study has shown that, in forest-savannah–transition zone (Ntui), Desmodium distortum had highly significant effect on maize grain yield from the third year while in the forest zone (Minkoameyos), the effect of Desmodium was significant from the fourth year. This therefore, suggests that the Desmodium shrub has a potential for improving plant nutrient availability in these soils when used in short <b>rotational</b> <b>fallow</b> system...|$|E
40|$|Short-term <b>rotational</b> <b>fallows,</b> new {{set-asides}} {{and seed}} mixtures containing specific seed-bearing crops are best alternative to provide seed food for farmland birds (Hyvönen & Huusela-Veistola 2011). The age of set-aside and vegetation structure {{are more important}} than seed mixture or plant species richness in supporting insect food for birds, and therefore set asides of various ages are needed (Hyvönen & Huusela-Veistola 2011). Even a short-term fallow sown with a simple seed mixture can encourage populations of generalist predators (Huusela-Veistola & Hyvönen 2006), but longterm set-asides may be even better for natural enemies (Huusela-Veistola 2008). Because of the various species requirements numerous habitats are needed if biodiversity is to be increased or maintained. At the landscape level, the proportion and location of non-crop temporal habitats may be important factors for key ecosystem services. Therefore, temporal habitats, e. g. set-asides, of various ages and different vegetation structures {{should be included in the}} agricultural landscape to encourage optimum functional biodiversity. ...|$|R
40|$|Water law {{scholars}} have long supported water markets for addressing critical water needs, especially in arid regions like the western United States, and that support {{seems to be}} growing among policymakers as well. But translating academic theories about water markets to the field has proved challenging. To be sure, water can be transferred from one use to another use in all western states, but water markets in those states are not presently capable of providing prospective buyers with a reliable source of water when and where they need it. The reasons are myriad, but are primarily related to the high transaction costs and significant lead times needed to consummate transfers. Under the current system, no municipal water supplier in the western United States can guarantee its customers the water they demand if {{they are forced to}} rely on the availability of water on the open market. Remarkably, Australia has managed to adapt its water rights system {{in such a way that}} water markets have flourished. The water rights regime in the western United States is different in some significant ways from the Australian system, and thus it is unrealistic to think that the western states can duplicate Australia’s experience and success. But there are important lessons to learn from an Australian transfer system that has cut approval times for temporary transfers to less than five days and for permanent transfers less than twenty days. One way for western states to make progress towards developing functioning water markets is to cabin the scope of a marketing program so that it has a better chance of garnering the support of affected parties, and in particular the farmers who will be selling their water to cities for domestic and industrial uses. By focusing on “conserved water”—defined here as water that was previously but is no longer consumed by the water user—states will find it easier to adopt reforms that can provide farmers with incentives to make some portion of their water available for other uses. Farmers can keep farming even as they find ways to use less water to grow profitable crops. Agricultural scientists have made great progress towards identifying and refining techniques for maintaining stable crop production even while using less water. These techniques, which include deficit irrigation, crop switching, and <b>rotational</b> <b>fallowing,</b> have the potential to free up enough water to serve western communities for many years to come, even in the face of severe, sustained drought. But the law has yet to catch up with the science, and in most western states, transferring conserved water is not legally possible. Even where it is allowed, the process remains too cumbersome. This Article begins a discussion about overcoming the legal obstacles to marketing conserved water and suggests modest and practical reforms to current law that could finally open the western United States to robust water markets...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, population-environment {{research}} has focused on the hypothesis that house hold population has significant influence on agricultural land-use patterns and the health of the environment. This study is therefore aimed at providing land use planners in Nigeria with basic data and information that will be useful in identifying the prospects for and constraints to intensive cultivation systems in Obagaji area. The simple random sampling technique, using the table of random digits and availability sampling method were respectively employed to select settlements and farmers for investigations. Structured interview was utilized to generate data for the study. In order to capture the inputs to land in the study area, the level of agricultural land-use intensity was measured, using three surrogates, namely, proportion of farmland cultivated, frequency of cultivation and crop combination level. The study results showed that Obagaji area is a mixed cropping region where semi permanent cultivation with <b>rotational</b> bush <b>fallow</b> system dominates the existing cultivation systems. The characteristic features of agricultural practices in households with low number of family members in the area are: more extensive land-use systems, more of shifting elements than permanent cultivation, only very small proportion of land is under cultivation at any one time and very short cropping period on the field. The reverse is true for households with high number of family members. The direct variation in intensity of agricultural land use with regards to family size in the area is significant...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{agricultural}} technologies {{have had an impact}} in the humid forest zone remains questionable as adoption levels have been low. The technologies developed emphasized on maintaining soil fertility and crop yields in short fallow systems. This chapter defines the problems and opportunities of commercialization of cassava (Manihot esculenta) production in the forest margins of peri-urban Cameroon. Cassava is the chief subsistence staple and mainly produced extensively in traditional mixed food crop fields in a short fallow rotation. The fallow period is mostly around 2 - 4 years with natural regrowth typically dominated by Chromolaena odorata (Ngobo et aI., 2004). The urban demand for cassava products is currently higher than the supply which improves cassava income generation potential and justifies the development of more commercially orientated fields. Yet intensification levels are low and yields are generally far below the potential attainable. Observed production increments have been mainly based on increased cassava growing area. Data from farmer interviews and group discussions in three villages in peri-urban Yaounde indicate that technologies for sustainable intensification of cassava production should target both pre- and post-harvest activities. They should focus on reduced labour requirements and pest and disease management. The technology proposed therefore re-emphasizes on returns to labour as a parameter of success and includes the involvement of farmers in technology testing. A commercial cassava field with a <b>rotational</b> Pueraria <b>fallow</b> system is discussed as a basic design. To ensure appropriateness and subsequently a higher adoption potential and hence higher impact, the system has built-in flexibility for further on-farm adaptations.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} provide {{valuable}} {{information about the}} realities of the Queen pineapple (QP) farmers in Camarines Norte, highlighting their farming practices and worldview about sustainable development. Most of the respondents are owner-operator having a mean farm size of 1. 33 hectares devoted to queen pineapple farming and crop diversification with two to seven crops combined to augment income. Cropping pattern employed by most of the respondents is multiple cropping, specifically intercropping, <b>rotational</b> cropping, and <b>fallowing.</b> Soil nutrient and weed management of most respondents is conventional: inorganic fertilizers and chemical based, respectively. However, pest control management by most of the respondents is of the alternative method. Overall, QP farmer respondents were found to be practicing alternative farming methods. The problems cited by the respondents were mainly production, marketing and communication-related. The respondents showed that they have moved towards alternative farming. However, more attention should be given to soil nutrient and weed management practices. Strengthening communication-related activities, improved technology, and ensured availability of resources is necessary to have good avenue for change. These findings should make agencies concerned to promote alternative farming and sustainable agriculture. The significant attributes of the QP farmer respondents can be used as entry point for any development program to fully advocate alternative farming among the local people as a social movement...|$|R
40|$|In dryland cotton {{cropping}} systems, {{the main}} weeds {{and effectiveness of}} management practices were identified, and {{the economic impact of}} weeds was estimated using information collected in a postal and a field survey of Southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Forty-eight completed questionnaires were returned, and 32 paddocks were monitored in early and late summer for weed species and density. The main problem weeds were bladder ketmia (Hibiscus trionum), common sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus), barnyard grasses (Echinochloa spp.), liverseed grass (Urochloa panicoides) and black bindweed (Fallopia convolvulus), but the relative importance of these differed with crops, fallows and crop rotations. The weed flora was diverse with 54 genera identified in the field survey. Control of weed growth in <b>rotational</b> crops and <b>fallows</b> depended largely on herbicides, particularly glyphosate in fallow and atrazine in sorghum, although effective control was not consistently achieved. Weed control in dryland cotton involved numerous combinations of selective herbicides, several non-selective herbicides, inter-row cultivation and some manual chipping. Despite this, residual weeds were found at 38 - 59 % of initial densities in about 3 -quarters of the survey paddocks. The on-farm financial costs of weeds ranged from $ 148 to 224 /ha. year depending on the rotation, resulting in an estimated annual economic cost of $ 19. 6 million. The approach of managing weed populations across the whole cropping system needs wider adoption to reduce the weed pressure in dryland cotton and the economic impact of weeds in the long term. Strategies that optimise herbicide performance and minimise return of weed seed to the soil are needed. Data from the surveys provide direction for research to improve weed management in this cropping system. The economic framework provides a valuable measure of evaluating likely future returns from technologies or weed management improvements...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rotational</b> bush <b>fallowing,</b> the {{dominant}} agricultural land-use practice in Ghana {{is no longer}} sustainable as fallow periods have declined from over 10 to five or less years mainly due to increased population pressure on land, along with inter alia drought and rampant wild fires. Managed fallows have in recent times been useful in improving short fallow productivity {{in many parts of}} the tropics including Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, adoption of agricultural innovation by smallholders has often been poor. This is attributed to the inappropriateness of sound scientific breakthroughs to the complex socio-cultural and economic conditions that characterize rural livelihoods in the SSA. This study forms part of a bigger project that tested and developed managed fallow technologies in a participatory manner in three villages, Gogoikrom, Subriso III and Yabraso in the Atwima, Tano and Wenchi Districts of Ghana respectively. It involves a socio-economic analysis of livelihoods of farmers and their involvement in the development of the technologies to complement bio-physical aspects to ensure that technologies developed suit the socio-cultural, tenurial and economic circumstances of farmers and are adoptable by the farmers. PRA tools, mainly key informant, group and semi-structured interviews as well as structured questionnaire interviews of 242 households, were employed in collecting data to characterize the livelihoods of the people in the study villages. This guided the identification of suitable fallow improvement interventions and possible domains for their uptake. The data were analyzed descriptively and complemented with a regression analysis and analysis of variance to describe the infra and inter-village similarities and differences. Input-output data on crop, livestock and off farm enterprises were collected and analyzed to estimate farmers' financial resource capacity. Primary and secondary economic data on the technologies were gathered and analyzed through ex-ante cost benefit analysis to assess the profitability of the technologies. A chi-squared analysis was carried out to identify the determinants of adoption of the technologies. Community perceptions of the performance of the technologies and adoption potential were assessed and verified with a survey of 99 non-participating farmers. Farmer indicators were developed for evaluating the performance and the design of the experiments by participating farmers. Technology expansion and diffusion of knowledge gained by the experimenters were also assessed. The study area is characterized by two main classes of farmers, natives (indigenous landowners) and settlers (mainly tenants) whose livelihoods rely largely on the management of natural fallow rotations for the cultivation of a range of crops, i. e. maize, plantain, rice and cocoa for Gogoikrom; maize, plantain, cassava, groundnuts, tomato and pepper for Subriso; and maize, yam, groundnuts and pepper for Yabraso. However, fallow periods have declined and numerous associated problems of which poor soils, high weed pressure, poor yields and low farm incomes are paramount. Four interventions, namely: maize-legume relay suitable for all three districts; plantain-legume for Atwima and Tano; and cocoa-shade tree for Atwima and planted tree fallow for Wenchi were identified for on-farm experimentation after a series of ranking and discussion of interventions proposed at a stakeholder workshop to address the short fallow constraints. The interventions were experimented with farmers over two seasons. Farmers' assessment of the technologies over the two seasons revealed that the weed suppression and moisture conservation or retention potential of the maize-legume relay had been realized, V while they anticipated improved maize yields and a reduction in labour for land preparation in subsequent years. The major limitation to the use of this technology identified during a monitoring process was labour for weeding before and after relaying the legume to facilitate growth and spread. The labour constraint for relaying the legume can be addressed by targeting this activity to coincide with the first or second weeding as appropriate to the fanner. The weeding after the legume relay is a necessity where weed pressure is high as this may retard legume biomass productivity. The potential effects of the plantain-legume, cocoa-shade tree and planted tree fallow are likely to be realized in the long-term. However, farmers were hopeful that these technologies would address their respective targeted problems based on their judgments of the performance of the technologies at the time. The ex-ante economic assessment of the farmer experiments yielded higher gross margins, returns to labour, B/C ratios, NPV, LEV and IRR than the alternative options in the absence of the technologies but were sensitive to reductions in prices and yields. However, tenure, age and gender differences may be important in technology adoption. Although all the main community groupings participated in technology development it was observed that male tenants and landowners are potential adopters of the most preferred cocoa-shade tree technology in Gogoikrom-Atwima while in Subriso-Tano, middle-old aged, landowner men are potential adopters of the maize-legume relay and plantain-legume technologies. Native landowners including women are the potential adopters of the maize-legume and planted tree fallow technologies in Yabraso-Wenchi. The participatory technology development process was documented. It was observed that while the process was interactive, enlightening both farmers and scientists, farmers need to be encouraged to take greater control to enhance innovativeness and reduce research cost. Improving fallow productivity should be a national concern, as it has a wider implication on the livelihoods of rural people and that of the economy of the country. The majority of the producers that are directly involved in crop production may be tenants who are unlikely to improve soil productivity due to tenure restrictions. Government policies that encourage landowners to adopt fallow improvement technologies are required. Policies encouraging education, training or extension of improved fallow techniques are useful. Likewise, participatory policy research for improving traditional tenure systems to encourage sustainable land improvement need consideration. Policies that ensure stability in prices of agricultural commodities will improve farm income gained from improved fallow productivity and encourage the adoption of fallow techniques...|$|R
