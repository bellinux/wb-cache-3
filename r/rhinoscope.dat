40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to study the information value of video endoscopy method to estimate the state of nasal and pharyngonasal cavity in children with bronchial asthma. Materials and methods. There were examined 70 children with atopic bronchial asthma, mean age being 10. 5 ± 4. 2 years. In addition to general clinical, allergic, and functional examination, all the patients were performed video endoscopic examination of nasal and pharyngonasal cavity using endoscopic equipment — rigid <b>rhinoscopes</b> (Karl Storz, Germany), with vision angle 0 and 30 °, and diameter 2. 7 and 4. 0 mm. Results. The use of video endoscopy in all children with asthma enabled to reveal the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in the remission or exacerbation stage, other pathologies of nasal and pharyngonasal cavity, including nonspecific infectious rhinitis, acute bacterial rhinosinusitism, anomalies of intranasal structures, pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy being found in 89 % (62 / 70). Intraarticular structures anomalies were found in 63 % (44 / 70) children with asthma. Against the background of these anomalies, rhinitis was of persisting character, children {{with the state of}} moderate severity (32 children) and severe course of the disease (12 children) prevailing. 14 patients anomalies were combined with hyperplastic changes of nasal mucosa. Pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy was found in 54 % (38 / 70) of patients with asthma, frequently combined with the signs of venous stasis in the mucosa of inferior nasal conchas. 14 patients had combined hypertrophy of pharyngeal and palatine tonsils. On the whole, pathology of lymphoepithelial pharyngeal circle including chronic tonsillites and pharyngites was diagnosed in 69 % (48 / 70) of children. Conclusion. The results of video endoscopy application in children with bronchial asthma demonstrate high comorbidity of allergic rhinitis with other nasal and nasopharyngeal pathologies in childhood. A high information value of the technique enables to present the details of nasal obstruction causes in asthmatic patients offering the opportunities of individual therapy in this group of patients in order to receive maximum clinical effect and level down the negative effect of upper respiratory pathologies on bronchial asthma course...|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{conventional}} laryngoscopes, many other devices {{have been developed}} as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. These include a number of indirect fiberoptic viewing laryngoscopes such as the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or <b>rhinoscope</b> {{can be used for}} office-based diagnostics or for tracheal intubation. The patient can remain conscious during the procedure, so that the vocal folds can be observed during phonation. Surgical instruments passed through the scope can be used for performing procedures such as biopsies of suspicious masses. These instruments have become indispensable within the otolaryngology, pulmonology and anesthesia communities.|$|E
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the diagnosis and}} treatment of membrano-osseous choanal atresia in a Newfoundland puppy. Diagnosis was made via computed tomography and flexible rhinoscopy. An attempt was made at surgical correction by choanoplasty via a transpalatal approach. Endoscopic examination four weeks post-operatively showed that the surgical site had stenosed, with the left side more affected than the right. A balloon choanplasty was performed on the right side, but was unsuccessful on the left due to inability to break down the fibrous stenotic membrane. 	Clinical signs recurred, and four weeks subsequent to the first balloon choanoplasty, the procedure was repeated on the right side, achieving 90 % patency. The fibrous membrane on the left side was broken down with Steinmann pins passed nasally through a rigid <b>rhinoscope,</b> achieving 60 % patency. This paper {{discusses the}} clinical presentation of this patient, differential diagnoses for the presenting complaints, diagnostic workup of the case, and comparative medicine of the disorder...|$|E
40|$|Canine leishmaniosis (CanL), {{caused by}} L. infantum-chagasi, {{is perhaps the}} most common canine {{infectious}} disease in Greece as well as in other Mediterranean countries. Blood sucking Phlebotomus spp. sandflies are the vector responsible for the transmission of the parasite among dogs, humans and other mammalian species. In the endemic areas of the world, L. infantum-chagasi infection rate may approach 63 % within the local canine populations. Upregulation of the humoral immune response to parasitic antigens results in overproduction of IgG class specific antibodies and immunocomplexes that constitute the main pathogenetic background of the disease, since their deposition in many organs and body tissues explains the variability of clinical manifestations. Clinical picture of CanL may include peripheral lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, skin lesions, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis, chronic hepatitis, and most importantly glomerulonephritis which usually results in chronic renal failure and the demise of the animal. Epistaxis is an important clinical manifestation of CanL, the frequency of which may range from 5 % to 15 %. In a recent clinical study conducted in Greece, CanL was held responsible for 48 % of the canine cases admitted to our Teaching Hospital with epistaxis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate, as far as possible, the pathogenetic mechanism underlying CanL-associated epistaxis, not only because of the relatively small number of cases investigated before in a similar study but most importantly because of the potential influence concurrent factors, which are commonly seen in natural cases, may exert on the expression of nasal bleeding. To accomplish these goals, an attempt was made to measure as many hemostatic parameters as possible and to investigate more extensively nasal mucosa biopsies obtained from CanL cases, with or without epistaxis. Fifty-one CanL cases, confirmed with both serology (immunochromatographic technique, Snap Test IDEXX) and cytology / parasitology (Giemsa stained lymph node and / or bone marrow aspiration smears) were employed in the study. This study population was divided into group A (n= 24), in which, at least one episode of epistaxis had been witnessed before or was detected on physical examination and group B (n= 27) in which there was no historical or clinical evidence of nose bleeding for at least two months before the admission. In order to generate reference intervals for some common and uncommon hemostatic tests performed under our laboratory conditions (bleeding time [BT], prothrombin time [PT], partial thromboplastin time [PTT] and platelet aggregation studies), 25 clinically healthy and L. infantum-chagasi plus E. canis seronegative dogs were also employed. Furthermore, the hypothesis that concurrent infections such as monocytic ehrlichiosis, bartonellosis and nasal aspergillosis and some other internal conditions (chronic renal failures, hyperviscosity syndrome, arterial hypertension) would contribute to the expression of epistaxis in CanL was also investigated. The diagnostic evaluation of 51 CanL cases included physical examination, complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, hemostatic testing (BT, PT, PTT, thrombin time [TT], fibrinogen and vWf measurement, platelet aggregation studies by applying ADP and collagen activators), serum protein electrophoresis and serum relative viscosity measurement. Moreover, serology for E. canis (ELISA, Immunocomb, Biogal), Dirofilaria immitis (immunochromatographic technique, Snap Test IDEXX) and Aspergillus spp. (radial immunodiffusion - group A only) as well as bone marrow rRNA PCR for E. canis and Bartonella spp. were applied in all group A and B dogs. Arterial blood pressure (systolic) measurement (Doppler method) and indirect ophthalmoscopy were also performed along with the radiographic evaluation of nasal cavities, under general anesthesia and by applying a rigid <b>rhinoscope,</b> multiple biopsies were obtained from predetermined and lesional sites of nasal mucosa for histopathology. In animals which had been euthanized, the biopsies were taken upon necropsy. Statistical analysis of the results was focused on the comparison of abnormality frequency (Pearson’s x 2 test and Fischer’s exact test) and the mean or median values (Student’s t-test) of the aforementioned parameters between group A and group B dogs. Furthermore, the probability of linear correlations between several laboratory parameters (e. g. a) bleeding time versus creatinine concentration, γ-globulin concentration or serum relative viscosity; b) γ-globulin concentration versus serum relative viscosity or platelet aggregation) was investigated for each animal group and for the total number of animals. ...|$|E
