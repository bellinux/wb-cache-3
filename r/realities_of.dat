30|$|Images {{produce a}} <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> their own. This {{specific}} reality cannot be grasped by dualistically separating {{it from an}} alleged <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> ‘the factual’. We can clearly see this effect of creating an ‘own’ <b>reality</b> in works <b>of</b> art of abstract modernism displaying something which eludes objective, measurable and countable approaches. What is displayed by these images points to meaning (or emotion) rather than matter. This implicit meaning of the image is perceived as the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the image. From an epistemological perspective, the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the image and the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the factual are incongruent and disparate (Schütz 2016 a, 2016 b). The <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the image with its inherent logic and materiality can become tangible precisely in this incongruity. From an epistemological point <b>of</b> view, the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the image is not only perceived as reality, but also responded to immediately. The multitude of experiences which are constituted while looking at an image are immediate responses {{to the meaning of}} the image. The inherent, experiential <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the image is grounded in this pre-verbal and implicit meaning.|$|R

5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.

5|$|Recorded {{throughout}} 2003, Blink-182 marks {{a departure}} from the band's earlier work, infusing experimental elements into their usual pop punk sound. These elements were inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a more elaborate, mature side of the band. Songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> adulthood and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E
5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France.

An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
