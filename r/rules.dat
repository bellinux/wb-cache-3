5|$|Six {{years after}} the {{creation}} of the Sheffield <b>Rules</b> the Football Association <b>rules</b> were created. These were influenced by the Sheffield game but ongoing disputes meant that the Sheffield <b>rules</b> continued to be used. During this time many of the elements of the <b>rules</b> were incorporated into the association game. Regular games were played between Sheffield and London using both sets of <b>rules.</b> This led to an agreement on a single set of laws administered by the Football Association in 1877.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rules</b> {{of chess}} (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) are <b>rules</b> {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of chess. While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern <b>rules</b> first took form during the Middle Ages.

Today, the standard <b>rules</b> are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the <b>rules</b> for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E

5|$|By 1873, {{the college}} {{students}} playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The {{only way to}} score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify {{the first set of}} intercollegiate football <b>rules.</b> Before this meeting, each school had its own set of <b>rules</b> and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of <b>rules,</b> based more on the Football Association's <b>rules</b> than the <b>rules</b> of the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.|$|E

The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the D <b>rules</b> to date, and served {{as the basis for}} a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System. The 3rd Edition <b>rules</b> were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core <b>rules</b> to encourage further customization of characters. The new <b>rules</b> standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. In 2003, Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5 was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition <b>rules.</b> This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.|$|E

Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations of the <b>rules</b> soon emerged. Physical education instructor Senda Berenson developed modified <b>rules</b> for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to women's basketball. Around this time separate intercollegiate <b>rules</b> were developed for men and women. The various basketball <b>rules</b> converged into a universal set in the United States.|$|E
