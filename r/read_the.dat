40|$|Understanding minds is the {{cognitive}} basis of successful social interaction. In everyday life, human mental activity often {{happens at the}} moment of social interaction among two or multiple persons instead of only one person. Understanding the interactive mind of two- or multi-person is more complex and higher than understanding the single-person mind in the hierarchical structure of theory-of-mind. Understanding the interactive mind maybe differentiate from understanding the single mind. In order to examine the dissociative electrophysiological correlates of <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> single mind and <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> interactive mind, the 64 channels event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded while 16 normal adults were observing three kinds of Chinese idioms depicted physical scenes, one-person with mental activity and two- or multi-person with mental interaction. After the equivalent N 400, in the 500 - to 700 -ms epoch, the mean amplitudes of late positive component (LPC) over frontal for <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> single mind and <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> interactive mind were significantly more positive than for physical representation, while {{there was no difference between}} the former two. In the 700 -to 800 -ms epoch, the mean amplitudes of LPC over frontal-central for <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> interactive mind were more positive than for <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> single mind and physical representation, while there was no difference between the latter two. The present study provides electrophysiological signature of <b>the</b> dissociations between <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> single mind and <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> interactive mind...|$|R

5|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{performs}} a one-man show on Broadway {{so that he}} can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and <b>read</b> <b>the</b> phone book for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does <b>read</b> <b>the</b> phone book at his show, making Jenna very proud of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E
