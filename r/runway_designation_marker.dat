50|$|On December 17, 2009 the <b>runway</b> <b>designations</b> were changed, {{the former}} <b>runway</b> <b>designations</b> were: 9L-27R, 9R-27L and 13-31.|$|R
25|$|The <b>runway</b> <b>designation</b> {{was changed}} from 15/33 to 14/32 during the 2010s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Runway</b> <b>designations</b> {{change over}} time because the {{magnetic}} poles slowly drift on the Earth's surface and the magnetic bearing will change. Depending on the airport location and how much drift takes place, {{it may be necessary}} over time to change the <b>runway</b> <b>designation.</b> As <b>runways</b> are designated with headings rounded to the nearest 10 degrees, this will affect some runways more than others. For example, if the magnetic heading of a runway is 233 degrees, it would be designated Runway 23. If the magnetic heading changed downwards by 5 degrees to 228, the Runway would still be Runway 23. If on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226 (Runway 23), and the heading decreased by only 2 degrees to 224, the runway should become Runway 22. Because the drift itself is quite slow, <b>runway</b> <b>designation</b> changes are uncommon, and not welcomed, as they require an accompanying change in aeronautical charts and descriptive documents. When <b>runway</b> <b>designations</b> do change, especially at major airports, it is often changed at night as taxiway signs need to be changed and the huge numbers {{at each end of the}} runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators. In July 2009 for example, London Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom changed its <b>runway</b> <b>designations</b> from 05/23 to 04/22 during the night.|$|R

50|$|The {{airport is}} {{equipped}} with a 3000 meter long precision runway with two instrumental landing systems, as well as a helicopter landing pad. For medium-haul aircraft 16 parking positions are available. Linz Airport is actually a military airport but with a civil right of use. The civil part is located north of the landing strip. To the south lie the second largest barracks of Austria as well as a military airfield named “Fliegerhorst Vogler”. On 1 November 2010, both runway 09/27 and helicopter landing pad 07/25 were renamed to runway 08/26 and helicopter landing pad 07/25 due to permanent changes in the magnetic declination. Since the submitted variation of the compass rose results in such a magnetic value which lies closer to 08/26 than the existing identification code 09/27, the Austrian flight control Austro Control initiated the tracking of the new <b>runway</b> <b>designation.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{rotating}} beacon {{is at the}} north end of the airport. The Runway and Taxiways have medium intensity lighting systems (MILS). Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) are at each end of the runway, as well as lights showing the end of the threshold. A Precision Approach Path Indicator system is at each end. “Lighted airfield signs at IFP are at aircraft hold positions, taxiway intersections, and at the intersection of the connecting taxiways and runways”. [...] There are also mandatory hold signs. The medium intensity runway lighting can be turned on by a pilot clicking the radio transmission button in the cockpit. Airfield markings control the traffic efficiently on the ground. Runway 16/34 has centerline, threshold markings, aiming points, and <b>runway</b> <b>designation</b> markings. Taxiways have hold short markings before runway intersections and centerlines. The Airport’s aprons have centerlines to control traffic and designated tie down areas. A segmented circle is located close to the airport for visual reference on how a pilot should perform the traffic pattern for the Runway.|$|R
50|$|The aerodrome {{is owned}} by the local {{government}} and used for pioneer flight operations. The coordinates are 00 47 North, 114 34 East. The elevation is not officially published, only measured from the aircraft altimeter, which is about 650 ft above sea level. The <b>runway</b> <b>designation</b> is 02 and 20. The length of the runway is 750 meter with width of 23 meter. A stopway of 30 meter is provided for runway 02. The runway surface is asphalt and its strength can accommodate up to CASA 212 aircraft. It has an apron, taxiway, but a tower building is not available since the aerodrome is a non controlled aerodrome. The runway is not equipped with landing direction indicators and, due to local prevailing surface winds at most of the time, the preferred takeoff and landing direction is runway 02. A significant obstacle is the hilly forest in the northerly direction of the extension of runway 02. The first obstacle is about 200 feet high above runway elevation located about 533.3 meters from the end of runway 02, and the second obstacle is about 500 feet above runway elevation 1.262,9 meters from the end of runway 02. Runway slope inclination is 3% from direction of runway 02.|$|R

50|$|Before the Red Beard codename {{was issued}} in 1952, it was {{frequently}} {{referred to in}} official documents as the 'Javelin Bomb', because it was originally conceived as a weapon for the 'thin-wing Javelin bomber', a projected derivative of the (thick wing) Gloster Javelin all-weather fighter.

40|$|Segregation of {{homologous}} chromosomes during meiosis I depends on appropriately positioned crossovers/chiasmata. Crossover assurance ensures {{at least one}} crossover per homolog pair, while interference reduces double crossovers. Here, we have investigated the interplay between chromosome axis morphogenesis and non-random crossover placement. We demonstrate that chromosome axes are structurally modified at future crossover sites as indicated by correspondence between crossover <b>designation</b> <b>marker</b> Zip 3 and domains enriched for axis ensemble Hop 1 /Red 1. This association is first detected at the zygotene stage, persists until double Holliday junction resolution, and {{is controlled by the}} conserved AAA+ ATPase Pch 2. Pch 2 further mediates crossover interference, although it is dispensable for crossover formation at normal levels. Thus, interference appears to be superimposed on underlying mechanisms of crossover formation. When recombination-initiating DSBs are reduced, Pch 2 is also required for viable spore formation, consistent with further functions in chiasma formation. pch 2 Delta mutant defects in crossover interference and spore viability at reduced DSB levels are oppositely modulated by temperature, suggesting contributions of two separable pathways to crossover control. Roles of Pch 2 in controlling both chromosome axis morphogenesis and crossover placement suggest linkage between these processes. Pch 2 is proposed to reorganize chromosome axes into a tiling array of long-range crossover control modules, resulting in chiasma formation at minimum levels and with maximum spacing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Diffuse large B-cell {{lymphoma}} is a diffuse {{proliferation of}} large neoplastic B lymphoid cells {{with a nuclear}} size equal to or exceeding the normal macrophage nuclei. We report {{a case of a}} clear cell variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving a lymph node in the neck, which was clinically suspected of being metastatic carcinoma. Case presentation A 39 -year-old Caucasian ethnic Albanian man from Kosovo presented with a rapidly enlarging lymph node in his neck, but he also disclosed B symptoms and fatigue. A cytological aspirate of the lymph node revealed pleomorphic features. Our patient underwent a cervical lymph node biopsy (large excision). The mass was homogeneously fish-flesh, pale white tissue replacing almost the whole structure of the lymph node. The lymph node biopsy showed a partial alveolar growth pattern, which raised clinical suspicion that it was an epithelial neoplasm. With regard to morphological and phenotypic features, we discovered large nodules in diffuse areas, comprising large cells with slightly irregular nuclei and clear cytoplasm admixed with a few mononuclear cells. In these areas, there was high mitotic activity, and in some areas there were macrophages with tangible bodies. Staining for cytokeratins was negative. These areas had the following phenotypes: cluster <b>designation</b> <b>marker</b> 20 (CD 20) positive, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl) - 2 -positive, Bcl- 6 -, CD 5 -, CD 3 -, CD 21 + (in alveolar patterns), prostate-specific antigen-negative, human melanoma black marker 45 -negative, melanoma marker-negative, cytokeratin- 7 -negative and multiple myeloma marker 1 -positive in about 30 % of cells, and exhibited a high proliferation index marker (Ki- 67, 80 %). Conclusion According to the immunohistochemical findings, we concluded that this patient has a clear cell variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of activated cell type, post-germinal center cell origin. Our patient is undergoing R-CHOP chemotherapy treatment. </p...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} formal terrorism designations by governments {{through the lens}} of organization studies research on categorization processes. It is argued that <b>designations</b> hinge on <b>markers</b> from the organizational profile of a militant group. Using cross-sectional data on militant organizations and designations by the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, multivariate analyses find that listed organizations do not merely have a track record of violence against a government’s citizens, but also tend to target aviation and have an Islamic ideologi-cal basis. Mixed support for geopolitical factors is found, but imageries of hegemonic interest are not confirmed. Secondary analyses suggest that newer images of terror-ism may replace older ones in classification schemes but {{further research is needed to}} know whether this is because of policy adaptation or the effect of spectacular events like September 11 th...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{a new set}} of 61 polymorphic microsatellite markers for beans and the construction of a genetic map using the BAT 93 x Jalo EEP 558 (BJ) population for the purpose of developing a reference linkage map for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). The main objectives were to integrate new microsatellites on the existing framework map of the BJ population, and to develop the first linkage map for the BJ population based exclusively on microsatellites. Of the total of 264 microsatellites evaluated for polymorphism, 42. 8 % showed polymorphism between the genitors. An integrated map was created totaling 199 mapped markers in 13 linkage groups, with an observed length of 1358 cM and a mean distance between markers of 7. 23 cM. For the map constructed exclusively with microsatellites, 106 markers were placed in 12 groups with a total length of 606. 8 cM and average distance of 6. 8 cM. Linkage group <b>designation</b> and <b>marker</b> order for BM microsatellites generally agreed with previous mapping, while the new microsatellites were well distributed across the genome, corroborating the utility of the BJ population for a reference map. The extensive use of the microsatellites and the availability of a reference map can help in the development of other genetic maps for common bean through the transfer of information of marker order and linkage, which will allow comparative analysis and map integration, especially for future quantitative trait loci and association mapping studies.

40|$|One {{important}} {{mechanism of}} drug resistance in acute leukemia is the overexpression of the multi-drug resistance (MDR 1) gene that encodes a 170 -kDa membrane protein called P-glycoprotein. To estimate the incidence {{and role of}} MDR 1 gene expression in patients with acute leukemia, we investigated the expression of MDR 1 by using the RT-PCR method in blast cells from 40 cases of de novo acute leukemia. We found a high frequency of MDR 1 gene expression: 10 out of 20 with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 8 out of 17 with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), {{and none of the}} 3 with de novo acute mixed leukemia, were MDR 1 mRNA-positive. No correlation between cluster <b>designation</b> (CD) surface <b>markers</b> (CD 19, CD 7, CD 13, CD 33, CD 34, CD 14, HLA-DR) and MDR 1 gene expression in AML was found. The complete remission rate was correlated with MDR 1 gene expression. Among 40 evaluable patients examined, 17 % (3 of 18) with MDR 1 mRNA-positive reached complete remission versus 77 % (17 of 22) with MDR 1 mRNA-negative (p= 0. 044). These results suggest that MDR 1 gene expression {{can be used as a}} prognostic factor and may be helpful in determining chemotherapeutic protocol for patients with acute leukemia...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is an {{intracellular}} apicomplexan parasite infecting warm-blooded vertebrate hosts, {{with only}} early infection stage being contained with drugs. But diagnosis differencing {{early and late}} infection was not available. In the present investigation, 2 -dimensional immunobloting was used to explore early and late infections in chickens. The protein expression of T. gondii was determined by image analysis of the tachyzoites proteome separated by standard-one and conventional two-dimentional gel polyacrylamide electrophoresis (2 D- PAGE). Pooled gels were prepared from tachyzoites of T. gondii. A representative gel spanning a pH range of 3 - 10 of the tachyzoite proteome consisted of 1306 distinct polypeptide spots. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) combined with 2 -DE immunoblotting was used to resolve and compare immunoglobulins (Igs) M & G patterns against Toxoplasma gondii strain RH (mouse virulent strain). Total tachyzoite proteins of T. gondii were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting for their reactivity with the 7 and 56 days post-infection (dpi) SPF chicken antisera. Different antigenic determinant patterns were detected during analysis with M and G immunoglobulins. Of {{the total number of}} polypeptide spots analyzed (1306 differentially expressed protein spots), 6. 97 % were identified as having shared antigenic polypeptide spots on immunoblot profiles with IgG and IgM antibodies regardless the time after infection. Furthermore, some of the immunoreactive polypeptide spots seemed {{to be related to the}} stage of infection. Interestingly, we found natural antibodies to toxoplasmic antigens, in addition to the highly conserved antigenic determinants that reacted with non-specific secondary antibody; goat anti-chicken IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. In conclusion, unique reactive polypeptide spots are promising candidates for <b>designation</b> of molecular <b>markers</b> to discriminate early and late chicken infection...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{profiling}} {{has become}} a universal technique for identifying individuals for evidential use in courts of law. In more complex cases such as sexual assaults, identifying the origin of a stain or sample offers valuable information as to the events that occurred. Currently, many ‘in service’ body fluid identification (BFID) techniques are presumptive, require significant sample volumes and generate false positives. As such, {{the development of a}} highly specific and reliable BFID technique would be highly beneficial to forensic scientists in provide more informative and reliable evidence. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short, stable, non-coding RNA’s which modulate gene expression. Expression of some of these miRNA are body fluid specific, making them a potentially robust tool for BFID. The possibility for the integration of a robust, miRNA based BFID technology for forensic casework employing stem-loop reverse transcription and qPCR analysis was the theme of the research presented here. To be incorporated into the workflow of current forensic laboratories, the protocol must be able to be carried out alongside current techniques with limited addition of cost, equipment, analysts and time. A range of custom designed miRNA markers were analysed on vaginal material, menstrual blood, saliva, venous blood, semen, seminal fluid and skin. Screening indicated specificity of hsa mir- 124 to vaginal material, hsa-mir- 10 a, 135 a and 888 to semen, hsa-mir- 412 and 507 to menstrual blood, hsa-mir- 144 - 3, 144 - 5, 142 and 451 to blood and although highly expressed in saliva, hsa-mir- 205 was also observed in vaginal material. Universal expression was observed in hsa-mir- 93, 508, 1260 b and SNORD 47 providing a means of normalisation through the <b>designation</b> of these <b>markers</b> as endogenous controls. A combined panel of markers are presented which were capable of identifying all body fluids, excluding skin from single stains. The panel was successful at identifying certain mixtures such as semen within vaginal material but was unable to confirm saliva presence within vaginal material. Screening of hsa-mir 205 within vaginal material uncovered the observation that hsa-mir- 205 was impacted by the use of female contraception. Once a full BFID panel was generated the robustness of the markers was further analysed across the menstrual cycle. No significant difference (p> 0. 001) was seen in markers highly expressed in vaginal material during screening (hsa-mir- 124, 203 a, 205). Expression of non specific markers highlighted the importance of the optimisation of input miRNA. Differential extraction of genetic material was found to be detrimental to miRNA sample integrity. As such, total DNA extraction was employed for vaginal swabs obtained from volunteers following unprotected sexual intercourse, markers hsa mir- 10 a, 135 a and 888 were able to successfully detect semen presence for up to 96 hours. The data generated to date has highlighted a number of miRNA markers that provide a platform for BFID. The developed protocol is reliable and robust; requiring minimal optimisation and is capable of integration with current laboratory workflow with minimum implications to time and cost. The markers identified for BFID have been implemented within studies that are representative of real case scenarios, and have demonstrated their ability to be stable, specific and successful in the identification of certain body fluids. Overall, this research showcases a reliable and body fluid specific protocol capable of being performed alongside DNA profiling...|$|R
