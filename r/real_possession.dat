It rather chilled him, for they had been happy together as they were. He extracted from her at any rate an intimation that she should now have means less limited, that her aunt’s tiny fortune had come to her, {{so that there was}} henceforth only one to consume what had formerly been made to suffice for two. This was a joy to Stransom, because it had hitherto been equally impossible for him either to offer her presents or contentedly to stay his hand. It was too ugly to be at her side that way, abounding himself and yet not able to overflow—a demonstration that would have been signally a false note. Even her better situation too seemed only to draw out in a sense the loneliness of her future. It would merely help her to live more and more for their small ceremonial, and this {{at a time when he}} himself had begun wearily to feel that, having set it in motion, he might depart.

The place had the flush of life—it was expressive; its dark red walls were articulate with memories and relics. These were simple things—photographs and water-colours, scraps of writing framed and ghosts of flowers embalmed; but a moment sufficed to show him they had a common meaning. It was here she had lived and worked, and she had already told him she would make no change of scene. He read the reference in the objects about her—the general one to places and times; but after a minute he distinguished among them a small portrait of a gentleman. At a distance and without their glasses his eyes were only so caught by it as to feel a vague curiosity. Presently this impulse carried him nearer, and in another moment he was staring at the picture in stupefaction and with the sense that some sound had broken from him. He was further conscious that he showed his companion a white face when he turned round on her gasping: “Acton Hague!” ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had meant}} to give a simple {{illustration}} of the church-habit, so to speak, but I have given it at such a length as leaves scant space to touch on the innumerable topics brushed by the pen that begins to take Roman notes. It is by the aimless flânerie which leaves you free to follow capriciously every hint of entertainment that {{you get to know}} Rome. The greater part of the life about you goes on in the streets; and for an observer fresh from a country in which town scenery is at the least monotonous incident and character and picture seem to abound. I become conscious with compunction, let me hasten to add, that I have launched myself thus on the subject of Roman churches and Roman walks {{without so much as a}} preliminary allusion to St. Peter's. One is apt to proceed thither on rainy days with intentions of exercise--to put the case only at that--and to carry these out body and mind. Taken as a walk not less than as a church, St. Peter's of course reigns alone. Even for the profane [...] "constitutional" [...] it serves where the Boulevards, where Piccadilly and Broadway, fall short, and if it didn't offer to our use the grandest area in the world it would still offer the most diverting. Few great works of art last longer to the curiosity, to the perpetually transcended attention. You think you have taken the whole thing in, but it expands, it rises sublime again, and leaves your measure itself poor. You never let the ponderous leather curtain bang down behind you--your weak lift of a scant edge of whose padded vastness resembles the liberty taken in folding back the parchment corner of some mighty folio page-- without feeling all former visits to have been but missed attempts at apprehension and the actual to achieve your first <b>real</b> <b>possession.</b> The conventional question is ever as to whether one hasn't been [...] "disappointed in the size," [...] but a few honest folk here and there, I hope, will never cease to say no. The place struck me from the first as the hugest thing conceivable--a real exaltation of one's idea of space; so that one's entrance, even from the great empty square which either glares beneath the deep blue sky or makes of the cool far-cast shadow of the immense front something that resembles a big slate-coloured country on a map, seems not so much a going in somewhere as a going out. The mere man of pleasure in quest of new sensations might well not know where to better his encounter there of the sublime shock that brings him, within the threshold, to an immediate gasping pause. There are days when the vast nave looks mysteriously vaster than on others and the gorgeous baldachino a longer journey beyond the far-spreading tessellated plain of the pavement, and when the light has yet a quality which lets things loom their largest, while the scattered figures--I mean the human, for there are plenty of others--mark happily the scale of items and parts. Then you have only to stroll and stroll and gaze and gaze; to watch the glorious altar-canopy lift its bronze architecture, its colossal embroidered contortions, like a temple within a temple, and feel yourself, at the bottom of the abysmal shaft of the dome, dwindle to a crawling dot.|$|E

6000|$|He {{could live}} over again {{at almost any}} quiet moment the long process of his {{introduction}} to his present interests--an introduction that had depended all on himself, like the [...] "cheek" [...] {{of the young man}} who approaches a boss without credentials or picks up an acquaintance, makes even a real friend, by speaking to a passer in the street. HIS real friend, in all the business, was to have been his own mind, with which nobody had put him in relation. He had knocked at the door of that essentially private house, and his call, in truth, had not been immediately answered; so that when, after waiting and coming back, he had at last got in, it was, twirling his hat, as an embarrassed stranger, or, trying his keys, as a thief at night. He had gained confidence only with time, but when he had taken <b>real</b> <b>possession</b> of the place it had been never again to come away. All of which success represented, it must be allowed, his one principle of pride. Pride in the mere original spring, pride in his money, would have been pride in something that had come, in comparison, so easily. The right ground for elation was difficulty mastered, and his difficulty--thanks to his modesty--had been to believe in his facility. THIS was the problem he had worked out to its solution--the solution that was now doing more than all else to make his feet settle and his days flush; and when he wished to feel [...] "good," [...] as they said at American City, he had but to retrace his immense development. That was what the whole thing came back to--that the development had not been somebody's else passing falsely, accepted too ignobly, for his. To think how servile he might have been was absolutely to respect himself, was in fact, as much as he liked, to admire himself, as free. The very finest spring that ever responded to his touch was always there to press--the memory of his freedom as dawning upon him, like a sunrise all pink and silver, during a winter divided between Florence, Rome and Naples some three years after his wife's death. It was the hushed daybreak of the Roman revelation in particular that he could usually best recover, with the way that there, above all, where the princes and Popes had been before him, his divination of his faculty most went to his head. He was a plain American citizen, staying at an hotel where, sometimes, for days together, there were twenty others like him; but no Pope, no prince of them all had read a richer meaning, he believed, into the character of the Patron of Art. He was ashamed of them really, if he wasn't afraid, and he had on the whole never so climbed to the tip-top as in judging, over a perusal of Hermann Grimm, where Julius II and Leo X were [...] "placed" [...] by their treatment of Michael Angelo. Far below the plain American citizen--in the case at least in which this personage happened not to be too plain to be Adam Verver. Going to our friend's head, moreover, some of the results of such comparisons may doubtless be described as having stayed there. His freedom to see--of which the comparisons were part--what could it do but steadily grow and grow? ...|$|E

By implementing scoring system it is hoped that the principles will be realized in the government goods/services procurement. The set of problems in this research is the minimum use of Scoring System (Scrutinizing List and Passing Grade) in the Goods/Services bid. This leads to the many findings of less-than-minimum-score projects in Temanggung Regency by the Auditing Team. The object being researched is the goods and services auction of budget ceiling below five billion rupiahs. The objectives of the research are: 1) to analyze the difference between elimination system and scoring system in a bid evaluation, 2) to determine the factor most dominantly affecting passing grade and scrutinizing list within the process of choosing the winner for the contracting work, using AHP method, 3) to validate the analysis result {{with the help of the}} stakeholders of the goods/services procurement in Temanggung Regency. The methods used are qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative method is used to relatively measure the factors affecting passing grade and the scrutinizing list from the primary data. On the other hand, the quantitative method is used to analyze the secondary data and the bid documents. The combination of the two methods is used to validate the research result. The result shows that the elimination and scoring systems are different in terms of time, cost evaluation, evaluation result, detail of qualifications, accuracy in choosing the service provider, result of contract work, participants selection, process of determining the winner of the contract work, number of case found by auditors, basic guidelines in conducting the project, opinions of the service providers, opinions of the budget user, opinions of the project leader, and opinions of the contract work committee about the two systems, and evaluation limitations. Factors obtaining the lowest average of likert scale (2) are detail of qualification, accuracy in choosing the service provider, number of case found by auditors, opinions of the service providers, opinions of the budget users, opinions of the project leader, and opinions of the contract work committee about the two systems, and evaluation limitations. One factor has the highest average of likert scale (4), that is evaluation cost. Secondly, the research result shows that the most dominant factor affecting passing grade is the financial one (55, 1 %). The data validation tells that the scoring system stresses the importance on the company‟s financial strength, experience, the number of minimum expert personnel employed and the number of minimum work tools owned by the goods/service providers. This research concludes that 1) the characteristic difference between elimination system and scoring system is that scoring system proves to give better impact towards the bidding process and the contract working, 2) the dominant factors affecting passing grade and scrutinizing list are finance (55, 1 %), technical (18, 4 %), administrative (6, 7 %), interest statement (6, 7 %), pact of integrity (6, 5 %), and qualification (6, 7 %). Data validation shows that there are still abuses on the contract work. The research suggestions are 1) the application of scoring system requires further validation on what is written on the document and what are found in <b>real</b> <b>possession</b> of the company attending the contract bid, 2) the company‟s experience in conducting contract work, not merely administrative matters, should also be considered as an important factor in determining the winner of the contract work, 3) the theses succeeding this one should focus on the application of bid evaluation method using Built Operator Transfer System (BOT).

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} Kant’s {{philosophy of}} matrimonial law. It {{focuses on the}} idea of this law as “possession of a person as a thing and its use as a person”: Kant conceives marriage as an interpersonal relation in an external form of <b>real</b> <b>possession,</b> in the aspect of the objective and subjective goal of such relation, but primarily in the aspect of its legal and ethical possibility. Given the naturalistic interpretation of the constitutive act for this kind of law, the legal deduction of marriage comes in a desperate contradiction with Kant’s ethics of personal dignity, because it seems to lead to a mutual instrumentalization of persons; as a matter of fact, Kant's deduction of marriage rules out the possibility of mutual personal obligations of family members. The naturalistic premise of Kant's family law, provenient from the ancient Roman property law, is as follows: marriage is mutual possession of the other's person as a thing and the use of it as a person for mutual pleasure; it seems to predetermine a necessary connection between legal use and legal posession of a person, the latter presupposing primary acquisition. This premise causes in Kantian family law an antinomy of private law and personalist ethics, which can hardly be eliminated by the own theoretical means of Kant's legal philiosophy. According to the essentials of Kant's ethics, the dignity of the other person, which is (allegedly) acquisited in matrimony, allows no possible equivalent, and its loss cannot be compensated at all events by the fact of mere mutuality of the instrumentalizing relation. The doubtfulness of this naturalistic premise of Kant's family theory means in terms of legal philosophy the doubtfulness of the premise which states the title-establishing status of primary acquisition in the field of personal law. References to the ethical idea of the absolute unity of personality, as well as the accent on “pleasure” as the necessary subjective goal of marital union, which leads the moralist an the philosopher of law upon a false trail, cannot provide a real solution of the problem. The naturalistic premise, in consequence of which the meaning of love is conceived in terms of pleasure, perpetuates the Roman contractualism in matrimonial law by understanding marriage as an external relation of persons, and prepares the soil for the seeds of a nihilistic philosophy of marriage and family. Kant's opinions about the reasons of inacceptability of false and, as a matter of fact, contractually based forms of matrimonial unions, proceed in undermining still more the basics of his positive philosophy of family, and supply additional arguments for a reform of Kantian philosophy of matrimonial law. In the expositions of Kant’s philosophy of marriage, when purified from this naturalistic premise, there can be traced some more integral notion of family union, seen as a moral unity of persons as such, in regard to which the marriage as external union of physical persons is a mere consequence and legal form. The personal union in matrimonial communication creates a relation in which there are two physical persons, but only one moral personality of the family and one legal person; not only a personal {{and at the same time}} property-related union, but a personaltranspersonal union. The specific person as an absolute monadical unity is here absolved by the personality of the family, as the absolute unity of active [...] . between persons, which has no other goal besides of and out of this union itself. When seen that way, it doesn't seem necessary any more to identify the “real-right form” of legal matrimonial union with the essence of the personal union itself, and therefore a merely contractual vision of family law can be overcome. The personalist philosophy of family retains the fruitful contents of Kant's matrimonial law theory: the notion that the matrimonial union is necessary “due to the law of humanity”, and not due to mere natural necessity; the notion of matrimonial acquisition as one accomplished neither factually, nor contractually, but “according to a law”, as a consequence of an obligation to enter a family unity. And yet, just as in Kant’s theory of law there is no ethically enriched concept of this genuine kind of union, in the individual ethics of Kant’s later years there is no ethical notion of family as a personality. Its elaboration became a task for German classical idealism...|$|E

In a tract of 1697 Jollie ascribed his cure to the prayers of the nonconformists. Zachary Taylor (died 1703), vicar of Ormskirk, son of an ejected minister of the same name, wrote two tracts (1697–9) to expose the ‘popery’ and ‘knavery’ of this business. John Carrington (died 1701), presbyterian minister at Lancaster, who had taken part in the exorcism, came forward in its defence; Frankland and Heywood were significantly silent.|$|R

There are modes of the love of our country which are definitely selfish, as a cat's of the hearthrug, yet entirely balanced and calm in judicial faculty; passions which determine conduct, but have no influence on opinion. For instance, I have bought for my own exclusive gratification, the cottage in which I am writing, near the lake-beach on which I used to play when I was seven years old. Were I a public-spirited scientific person, or a benevolently pious one, I should doubtless, instead, be surveying the geographical relations of the Mountains of the Moon, or translating the Athanasian Creed into Tartar-Chinese. But I hate the very name of the public, and labor under no oppressive anxiety either for the advancement of science, or the salvation of mankind. I therefore prefer amusing myself with the lake-pebbles, of which I know nothing but that they are pretty; and conversing with people whom I can understand without pains, and who, so far from needing to be converted, seem to me on the whole better than myself. This is moral egoism, but it is not intellectual error. I never form, much less express, any opinion as to the relative beauties of Yewdale crag and the Mountains of the Moon; nor do I please myself by contemplating, in any exaggerated light, the spiritual advantages which I possess in my familiarity with the Thirty-nine Articles. I know the height of my neighboring mountains to a foot; and the extent of my <b>real</b> <b>possessions,</b> theological and material, to an article. Patriotic egoism attaches me to the one; personal egoism satisfies me in the other; and the calm selfishness with which Nature has blessed all her unphilosophical creatures, blinds me to the attractions--as to the faults--of things with which I have no concern, and saves me at once from the folly of contempt, and the discomfort of envy. I might have written, as accurately, [...] "The discomfort of contempt"; for indeed the forms of petulant rivalry and self-assertion which Mr. Spencer assumes to be developments of egoism, are merely its diseases; (taking the word [...] "disease" [...] in its most literal meaning). A man of sense is more an egoist in modesty than a blockhead is in boasting; and it is neither pride nor self-respect, but only ignorance and ill-breeding, that either disguise the facts of life, or violate its courtesies.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the state}} of Louisiana, a mixed legal {{jurisdiction}} with strong civil law roots, prescription can be either acquisitive or liberative, both of which involve the creation or extinguishing of rights over time. Acquisitive prescription in Louisiana {{is analogous to the}} common law idea of adverse possession. As defined in La. C.C. Art. 3446, [...] "acquisitive prescription is a mode of acquiring ownership or other <b>real</b> rights by <b>possession</b> for a period of time." [...] Unlike the common law adverse position, Louisiana's acquisitive prescription is not a procedural bar to recovering property but {{the creation of a new}} ownership right in the property. Time periods for acquisitive prescription depend on whether the property is movable or immovable and whether the property is possessed in good faith (possessor believes they have title to the property) or in bad faith.|$|R

The land registration is carried out by the Territorial Cadastre and Land Registry, taking to the parcel as the unit of registration. They are managed by the respective provincial rules. In the Territorial Cadastre the parcels are registered with reference to the state of right contained in the public document or possession exercised.

40|$|Land {{problems}} in South Korea consist chiefly {{of the growth}} of land values and the bias of the land ownership. These suppress a healthy life of the people. To improve land problems, the Public Concept of Land Ownership System was introduced in the Land Taxation Reform of 1990. Public Concept of Land Ownership valued the public in terms of land, and restricted its use. The Comprehensive land tax was introduced at the same time. Afterwards, the price of land stably changed. However, due to the influence of the South Korean Currency crisis in 1977, the price of land fell, and the Public Concept of Land Ownership was withdrawn in order to give priority to economic rebuilding. Afterwards, the price of land rose again and bias of the land ownership came to be feared. As a result, Land Possession Taxation Reform introduced the <b>Possession</b> of <b>Real</b> Property, and regulation that raised the tax of both excessive land ownership and that for speculative purpose was established. This article examines the <b>Real</b> Estate <b>Possession</b> Tax of South Korea, and considers what role land problems played. The detailed content of the <b>Possession</b> of <b>Real</b> Property introduced in especially 2005 is examined and analyzed. Chapter 1 takes up land {{problems in}} South Korea. The growth of land values, bias of land ownership, and bias of house ownership are chiefly discussed. Chapter 2 examines the substantial content and features of the Public Concept of Land Ownership system, the property tax, and the <b>Possession</b> of <b>Real</b> Property in land possession taxation. Chapter 3 considers various problems of the <b>Possession</b> of <b>Real</b> Property in terms of the method of calculation according to household, dual taxation, and the fairness of the tax burden. In conclusion, it is reasoned that the function of the <b>Possession</b> of <b>Real</b> Property as land possession taxation is strengthened, and is useful for the stability of the price of land and the improvement of the bias of land ownership. However, lessening the burden of large taxation is deemed necessary to improve the daily life of even the average household...|$|R
40|$|What is Bluebird AR? Bluebird AR was the ABC's {{alternate}} reality drama set {{around the}} leak of Bluebird, a clandestine geoengineering initiative created by eco-billionaire Harrison Wyld. Proposing a fictional scenario {{set against a}} backdrop of real world possibilities, Bluebird AR took some of the conventions of the well-established alternate reality game (ARG) genre and pulled them into the relatively new area of online drama, to create a hybrid entertainment form best described as 'participatory drama'. With Bluebird AR's interactive narrative centred on the experimental science of geoengineering, the deliberate manipulation of the Earth's atmosphere to counteract global warming, the events and characters in the Bluebird story were entirely fictional but fused with reality online. Inhabiting a mixture of third party social media spaces and websites created by the ABC, the story incorporated real online articles, scientific journals, media and debate around geoengineering. In an Australian first, ABC Innovation launched Bluebird AR on 27 April 2010, with a 6 week live phase. Audience members were invited to play collectively to help 'unlock the drama' and push forward the emerging narrative, or passively watch the story unfold in real-time across the internet. Bluebird AR subverted ARG conventions with the high quality of its production and assets, and raised the stakes for online drama with its level of audience participation. " © 2014 ABC "Introduction One of the most exciting creative challenges of producing Bluebird AR was formulating the broad array of visual styles and treatments required for the project's diverse range of content. Many assets also needed to translate well not only online but across other media, including television and print. With the project's producers keen to create a visually rich narrative with high production values from the outset, inspiration for the production design for various aspects of the Bluebird story began in the earliest pitching phase in September 2008. Particular visual treatments and styles for Bluebird's characters, their web spaces and <b>real</b> world <b>possessions</b> were formulated concurrently with the creation of their profiles. Ideas around how various clues and gameplay spaces might look and feel were also explored at this early stage. Bluebird AR's small but tight creative team produced 7 website designs and brands, motion graphics for title sequences and logo animations, rotoscope animation, 3 D compositing and animation, 3 D wireframes and schematics, countless Photoshop composites, and a vast array of character assets for the DC (including Kyle's Bluebird Labs security pass and resignation letter, Kruger's American and Russia passports and birth certificate, Harrison's divorce papers, and more) …" © 2014 AB...|$|R
40|$|When {{a course}} has ended, the grades have been distributed, {{and the course}} {{evaluation}} is finished, one could still ask oneself if the course really gave something for the individual student. The final grade {{is a result of}} the assessment of the students’ skills in relation to stated learning outcomes according to the syllabus. But what if the students enter the course with different skills’ levels? If a specific student already possesses a certain amount of competence within an area, can he or she still learn something in a basic level course? In this paper we investigate the outcomes of a project management course in terms of syllabus fulfilment with regard to the students’ perception of increased learning. The course comprise theoretical as well as practical training in writing, study design and project management. The student group is heterogeneous and consists of national programme students as well as international exchange students representing a wide range of subjects, nations and previous study experiences. Therefore, even if the course formally is a first-year course, the <b>real</b> skills’ <b>possession</b> of the participating students varies a lot. This makes this course challenging to teach, and raises several questions: Do all students develop their individual skills during the course, disregarded of the skills level which they entered the course with? Are we focusing on the right set of skills, or are some skills more important to develop than other skills? How should we improve the design of the course to enable each individual student to develop their skills? The paper focuses on the first and second question, because understanding the problem is the first step in any improvement activities. This understanding could thereafter be used for improving the course syllabus in terms of contents, learning outcomes and activities. After a general discussion regarding personal and interpersonal skills’ development in higher education, findings from the course entitled Technical projects and report writing are presented. The course design and student characteristics are described and thereafter the work with assessment of skills’ development is described. We asked the students to state their skills level within x predefined areas connected to the course contents. In the end of the course, the students were asked to once again state their skills’ level. Results from the skills’ evaluation are presented and discussed, and conclusions regarding the possibilities to further improve the course design are drawn. The positive and negative aspects of homogenous student groups in project courses are also discussed. [URL]...|$|R
60|$|The Earl of Bude {{had meant}} to lay his heart, coronet, and other <b>possessions,</b> <b>real</b> and personal, before the tiny feet of the fair American at Goodwood. But when he learned from Merton the involvements of this heiress and paragon, that her hand {{depended}} on {{the choice of the}} people, that the choice of the people was to settle on the adventurer who brought to New York the rarest of nature's varieties, the earl honourably held his peace. Yet he and the object of his love were constantly meeting, on the yachts and in the country houses of their friends, the aristocracy, and, finally, at shooting lodges in the Highlands. Their position, as the Latin Delectus says concerning the passion of love in general, was 'a strange thing, and full of anxious fears.' Bude could not declare himself, and Miss McCabe, not knowing that he knew her situation, was constantly wondering why he did not speak. Between fear of letting her secret show itself in a glance or a blush and hope of listening to the words which she desired to hear, even though she could not answer them as her heart prompted, she was unhappy. Bude could not resist the temptation to be with her--indeed he argued to himself that, as her suitor and an adventurer about to risk himself in her cause, he had a right to be near her. Meanwhile Merton was the confidant of both of the perplexed lovers; at least Miss McCabe (who, of course, told him nothing about Bude) kept him apprised as to the conduct of her trustees.|$|R
2500|$|Property law governs {{ownership}} and <b>possession.</b> <b>Real</b> property, sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership {{of land and}} things attached to it. Personal property, refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as stocks and shares. A right in rem is {{a right to a}} specific piece of property, contrasting to a right in personam which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns mortgages, rental agreements, licences, covenants, easements and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, company law, trusts and commercial law. An example of a basic case of most property law is Armory v Delamirie [...] A chimney sweep's boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three halfpence and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. Lord Chief Justice Pratt ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of possession in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something could belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.|$|R
