40|$|M. A. Waste {{management}} {{has always been}} a delegated responsibility, undertaken on behalf of the public by authorities, industry and specialist waste management contractors. In South Africa, there are neither regulations nor measures to deal with the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> or to control the disposal thereof. Municipalities for example, have no plans in place to deal with <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> generated and some landfills refuse to dispose <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyres.</b> As a result, <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> have been disposed haphazardly, at times stockpiled and burnt and thereby present an environmental problem. This research investigates discarded tyres as an aspect of solid waste, as well as options that may be taken for their disposal. The research points to the current waste tyre disposal problems. These disposal problems are a result of the chemical composition of tyres, their size and shape. It was found that although there has been a proliferation of environmental legislation, no regulation ensures that discarded tyres are systematically collected for appropriate disposal. Given the undesirable consequences of inappropriate waste tyre disposal, three recommendations are made: An integrated national waste management policy, in which a workable public participation is formalised, will determine the future <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyre</b> management including the management of discarded tyres. This requires an attractive incentive to collect and appropriately dispose <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyres.</b> Allowance has to be made for entrepreneurs to determine the most efficient and less expensive way <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyre</b> disposal to achieve environmentally desirable outcomes. Non-subsidised markets are therefore recommended. There are possibilities <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> that are discarded as raw materials in other industries. Technologies that take advantage of the fuel value and steel in <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> should be explored and encouraged. Discarded tyres can also be used for some constructions or in the manufacture of some new products. ¨ South Africa may have to consider legislation for the collection, transfer and reprocessing <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyres.</b> The rate <b>of</b> waste tyre generation is also an outcome of tyre design. The possibility of producing tyres that are environmentally friendly should be explored. Discussions are taking place within the tyre manufacturing industries in South Africa to formulate and implement sustainable plans that will address the problems of waste tyre disposal...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{pyrolysis}} process <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyre</b> {{as a method of}} producing an alternative energy source is presented in this paper. The study reports the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyre</b> materials and methods of recycling, types and principles of pyrolysis, the pyrolysis products and their composition, effects of process parameters, and kinetic models applied to pyrolysis. From publications, the proximate analysis of tyre rubber shows that it is composed of about 28. 6 [*]wt. % fixed carbon, 62 [*]wt. % volatile material, 8. 5 [*]wt. % ash, and 0. 9 [*]wt. % moisture. Elemental analysis reveals that tyre rubber has an estimated value of 82 [*]wt. % of C, 8 [*]wt. % of H, 0. 4 [*]wt. % of N, 1. 3 [*]wt. % of S, 2. 4 [*]wt. % of O, and 5. 9 [*]wt. % of ash. Thermogravimetry analysis confirms that the pyrolysis <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyre</b> at atmospheric pressure commences at 250 °C and completes at 550 °C. The three primary products obtained from <b>used</b> <b>tyre</b> pyrolysis are solid residue (around 36 [*]wt. %), liquid fraction or biocrude (around 55 [*]wt. %), and gas fraction (around 9 [*]wt. %). Although there is variation in the value of kinetic parameters obtained by different authors from the kinetic modeling <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyre,</b> the process is generally accepted as a first order reaction based on Arrhenius theory...|$|R

40|$|This {{technical}} report is a state-of-the-art literature review regarding tyre shreds as a construction material for published material in English, Swedish and Norwegian languages. The main focus {{is to present}} the technical and environmental properties of tyre shreds focusing on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the material as unbound aggregates in foundation and geotechnical engineering applications. The technical properties of tyre shreds are relatively well investigated. In general, methods for determining technical properties for soils {{have been used in}} the studies. Compared to conventional soil materials like sand and gravel, tyre shreds are considered to be a lightweight material, bulk density 500 - 900 kg/m 3 depending on compaction and overlaying pressure. The low thermal conductivity, 0. 15 - 0. 30 W/m,K, makes the material interesting for thermal insulation. The permeability is high,about 0. 01 m/s, at overlaying pressures up to at least 200 kPa. Tyre shreds is a relatively weak material, Young’s modulus is approximately 1 MPa depending on overlaying pressure. Poisson’s ratio is typically 0. 3. The stress-strain relationship is non- linear and the material becomes stiffer as the stress increases. The shear strength is high at large strains, effective cohesion intercept 0 - 82 kPa and effective friction angle 15 – 36 º at 20 % strain, and low at smaller strains, effective cohesion intercept 0 - 12 kPa and effective friction angle 19 - 38 º at 10 % strain. The durability of tyre shreds seems not to be a problem in applications where the material is not exposed to UV-radiation or heat. The environmental implications <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds in ground engineering applications have here been studied by dividing the results into three different categories; chemical content, leachability and environmental response. Tyre shreds contain compounds that have a pollution potential, e. g. PAH, phenols and zinc. The leachability of most compounds is low under normal conditions in civil engineering applications, i. e. for pH 5 - 8 and water as a leaching agent. Ecotoxicological studies show that tyre leachate causes response in these tests. Compared to the European Unions classification for chemicals these responses are below hazardous limits. However, some other species studied are sensitive to tyre leachate. Field experiences <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds shows, up to know, no measurable negative effects in surrounding environment. Tyre shreds have beneficial properties, e. g. low density, high hydraulic conductivity, low thermal conductivity and high shear strength at large strains. There are properties of tyre shreds which differs from soil materials like sand and gravel that must be especially considered in design, e. g. the elastic properties. There are several successful examples <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds in civil engineering applications, e. g. in road embankments, as thermal insulation layer, in lightweight embankments and as draining layers in landfills. There are also examples of not successful projects resulting in useful experiences in design work and limitations of the material. The environmental effects <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds needs to be considered. Before use a site-specific evaluation is recommended where both the construction and surrounding environment are considered. Based on today’s knowledge the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds should be limited to above the ground-water table and, if high percolation is expected, to non-sensitive recipients where the potential accumulation of pollutants may not be a problem.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{all over the world}} there are more than 550 million road vehicles in everyday use. Annually, 1. 3 billion <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> are dismantled from these vehicles due to safety reasons. A small number of these tyres end up reused as second-hand tyres or, after being retreated, as new ones. The rest are end of life tyres which are recycled or used as tire derived fuels under controlled combustion conditions. Modern vehicle tyres are a high-technological product containing, on the average, 85 % hydrocarbon, 10 - 15 % steel, as well as some other chemical materials. Tyres belong to high caloric materials, with calorific value of a passenger car tyre of approx. 30. 2 MJ/kg being more than of hard coal and comparable to calorific value of petrol-coke. Having this in mind many countries <b>use</b> end <b>of</b> life <b>tyres</b> as safe alternative fuel in cement works or power plants. Undeveloped countries dump end of life tyres on legal and illegal scrap stockpiles. End of life tyres, if deposed correctly, don’t endanger the environment because they are chemically inert. However, since they can easily be burnt there is a real possibility of tyre dump fires, which in effect can lead to harmful products emission that extremely pollute the environment. End of life tyres represent a very important secondary material, which when recycled is transformed into a number <b>of</b> raw materials <b>used</b> in rubber industry, for road construction, sports facilities, residential and business buildings, artificial fish habitats in shallow seas, sea walls, steel production, etc. By the industrial procedures of controlled degradation, which have been uneconomical up till now, gaseous and liquid fuel can be obtained by natural rubber, steel and soot recycling.

As an insulator, the CRC was comparable with plain concrete with only marginal differences observed. Effects of freezing and heating were shown to have no significant influence on the insulation properties. The insulation performance for all concretes was found to improve at high frequencies.

Since controlled density foamed aggregate is designed to co-exist with peat, a more durable road with less maintenance is expected. The self leveling foamed concrete of density about 1200 kg/m 3 is to be placed on the foamed aggregate with tyres and geosynthetics as a special provision for lateral restraint. It is hoped that more intensified research into the exploitation <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> for sustainable construction on problematic soil will lead to improved quality of life and conservation of the environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide another way of {{reducing}} the stock <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> and polyvinyl chloride waste, a new material is developed and studied. Formulation includes a matrix constituted by a compound of recycled polyvinyl chloride with plasticized polyvinyl chloride and a reinforcement of ground tyre rubber. Acoustic and mechanical properties of different compositions of polyvinyl chloride/ground tyre rubber were tested {{in order to determine}} their suitability for applications fulfilling industry requirements. Sound absorption has been analyzed, showing interesting results at frequencies higher than 2500 ¿Hz. The obtained values are found to be depending on the thickness of the sample, the content of the ground tyre rubber and the existence of gaps, pores and voids either between layers or in the interphase between the matrix and reinforcement. From the study of the mechanical properties, we may observe that the ground tyre rubber act as filler, improving stiffness of polyvinyl chloride/ground tyre rubber composites with an increase of Young Modulus. The tensile strength, elongation at break and toughness decrease slowly. The decrease of these mechanical properties is observed to be lower than in the case of composites made by using high-density polyethylene as a matrix.

40|$|Truck tyres {{can cause}} {{significant}} environmental pressure through the life cycle. The main {{aim of this}} paper is investigate to what extent international policy measures on foreign trade, international recycling and harmonisation of legislation can contribute in effectively reducing environmental pressure caused in the truck tyre life cycle. A two-region simulation model, representing Western and Eastern Europe, is developed that integrates the complete life cycle, incorporates environmental impacts in its economic analysis, is technically dynamic by accounting for learning-by-doing effects, and allows for variations in trade of new and old truck tyres. In this study the economic, environmental and social effectiveness of harmonisation and trade measures in the European life cycle for truck tyre is tested. Several conclusions can be drawn from the model simulations. First, the environmental effects caused by the trade <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> from Western to Eastern Europe are of limited impact on the overall environmental damage caused by truck tyres. The consumption stage is by far the main contributor to environmental damage. Within the marginal analysis of trade, harmonisation of disposal fees illustrated to generate very limited positive results. The private and external costs in the soli...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} factor in pedestrian injuries from vehicle collisions is the impact velocity. In cases where the impact configuration can be ascertained, the most common method now used to determine vehicle speed involves the pedestrian projection distance. The more traditional method <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>tyre</b> brake marks is losing applicability as ABS braking systems become more common. The two most common impact configurations are wrap projection and forward projection, these being determined by the vehicle/pedestrian geometry and the initial conditions of the impact. In this paper, two models are presented for pedestrian forward and wrap projection impacts. These models are predicated on separating the total projection distance into the individual projection distances occurring during three principal phases of the collision. The models are novel as they use a rigid single-segment body representation of the pedestrian, include explicit modelling of the impact phase, and also allow for uncertainty in the input parameters. Published data are used to provide distributions for the input variables such as pedestrian and vehicle masses, etc. The model predictions of impact speed from overall projection distance are validated by comparison with real-world accident data...|$|R
40|$|The {{pollutants}} {{found in}} emissions from cement plants {{depend on the}} processes used and {{the operation of the}} clinker kilns. Another crucial aspect concerns the characteristics of raw materials and fuels. The intensive <b>use</b> <b>of</b> fuels in rotary kilns of cement plants and the increasing fuel diversification, including fuels derived from coal and oil, from a multitude of industrial waste and from biomass, charcoal and agricultural waste (sugarcane bagasse, rice husk), is increasing the possibilities of combinations or mixtures of different fuels, known as blends. Thus, there are socio-environmental impacts associated with the burning of alternative fuels in clinker kilns. In view of the growing trend of entrepreneurs who want to target the waste produced in their unit and of the owners of the cement plants who want to reduce their production costs by burning a waste with lower cost than conventional fuels, it is necessary to warn that a minimum level of environmental care should be followed regarding these decisions. It is necessary to monitor the points of emission from cement kilns and in the wider area influenced by the plant, in order to improve environmental quality. Laboratory studies of burning vulcanised rubber contaminated with arsenic simulate the burning <b>of</b> <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> in cement clinker kilns producing SO 2 and As 2 O 3...|$|R
