40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) is {{a persistent}} problem in cattle herds in Great Britain and Ireland. Farm management and cattle husbandry practices {{can influence the}} risk of transmission of bTB and hence the likelihood of bTB breakdown (>= I reactor to the tuberculin skin test). Biological differences are expected in the transmission dynamics, and hence risk factors for bTB breakdown, on farms where infection persists in the herd compared to farms where infection is more sporadic or short-lived. Comparative case-control studies were performed to test farm management practices as potential risk factors for transient (under breakdown restrictions for 6 months) bTB breakdown over 5 years (1995 - 1999) on 179 and 171 UK cattle farms, respectively. Farms were characterised for badger sett density and farm habitat composition by ground survey, farmers were questioned retrospectively on management practices, and cases and controls were identified from national tuberculin test records. Controlling for <b>routine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing</b> interval, log-transformed herd size, regional location, badger sett density and farm habitat complexity, multivariable logistic regression identified increased odds of both transient and persistent breakdown on farms that bought-in cows (odds ratio (OR) >= 4. 9; 95...|$|E
40|$|In New Zealand, {{under the}} {{national}} bTB eradication strategy, bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has had a sustained decrease in prevalence since its peak in 1994 at 1700 infected herds. With the success of control measures, recurrence of infection in cattle and deer herds that have previously tested to a clear status {{is a problem that}} has recently become more apparent. Uncontrolled movement of cattle and deer from these herds pose a risk to the bTB eradication strategy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify herd-level risk factors for bTB recurrence. Data were collected from 356 New Zealand cattle and deer herds that met the following criteria: (1) a culture positive case of bTB had been identified on or after 1 June 2006 (the index bTB episode), (2) the herd status had been cleared by testing that was completed by 1 November 2010, and (3) the clear status was not achieved by destocking. The outcome of interest for this study was defined as detection of a subsequent bTB episode before the end date of the study, 5 May 2011, by <b>routine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing</b> or by slaughter surveillance. Herds were censored if no further bTB episode occurred by 5 May 2011. A Cox proportional hazards model was developed to quantify the magnitude of a series of herd-level risk factors on the daily hazard of bTB recurrence. Disease control area was included in the model as a fixed effect to account for confounding. There was a positive relationship between the daily hazard of recurrence and: (a) the number of bTB episodes in a herd prior to the first episode (HR [hazard ratio] 3. 2 for two prior episodes, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 8. 5; HR 86. 7 for five prior episodes, 95 % CI 13. 8 - 580), (b) the presence of more than one bTB positive animal at the index bTB episode (HR 2. 3 : 95 % CI 1. 2 - 4. 3) and (c) the presence of one or more cleared test-positives at the final clearance test at the index episode. The proportional hazards assumption was violated for the latter variable so a time dependent covariate was introduced into the model to account for the variable effect of the presence of cleared test-positives at the final clearance test over time. The monthly hazard of recurrence during the first two years after clearance was significantly increased in herds with one or more test-positive animals at the final test (HR 2. 8 : 95 % CI 1. 2 - 6. 4), but this association was no longer significant more than two years after clearance (HR 1. 5 : 95 % CI 0. 6 - 3. 6). We conclude that the presence of unresolved infection in a herd is a contributor to further bTB episodes {{in the first two years}} after clearance. TBfree New Zealand is reviewing policies to increase the sensitivity of detecting residual infection before clearance and to intensify post clearance testing and movement tracking in herds with risk factors...|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of continued spillover of Mycobacterium bovis into cattle from wildlife reservoirs and increased globalization of cattle trade with associated transmission risks, new approaches such as vaccination and novel testing algorithms are seriously being considered by regulatory agencies for the control of bovine tuberculosis. Serologic tests offer opportunities for identification of M. bovis-infected animals not afforded by current diagnostic techniques. The present study describes assay development and field assessment of a new commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects antibody to M. bovis antigens MPB 83 and MPB 70 in infected cattle. Pertinent findings include the following: specific antibody responses were detected at ∼ 90 to 100 days after experimental M. bovis challenge, minimal cross-reactive responses were elicited by infection/sensitization with nontuberculous Mycobacterium spp., and the apparent sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA with naturally infected cattle were 63 % and 98 %, respectively, with sensitivity improving as disease severity increased.

40|$|I was {{so pleased}} {{to learn that}} the inaugural issue of the {{neonatology}} specialty section of Frontiers in Neonatology would high-light Mary Ellen “Mel ” Avery’s contribu-tions to decades of neonatal research. Mel was my mentor and friend for more than 30 years, and it is a great honor for me to write about some of her substantial accom-plishments. Among her many contribu-tions, three are especially notable because they have saved the lives and improved the health of countless newborns: identifica-tion of surfactant deficiency as the cause of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), treat-ment of RDS with artificial surfactant, and prevention of RDS with antenatal steroids. In a paper she wrote about how it really happened,Mel dated her interest in respira-tory physiology to the start of her pediatric internship at Johns Hopkins in 1952 (1). Only 1 month after she began her training, a <b>routine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> that was pos-itive and a small upper lobe infiltrate on a chest radiograph consistent with tuber-culosis prompted a course of antibiotics and a prescription for 6 months of bed rest. During this period, questions about her own treatment spurred her quest for more knowledge of respiratory physiology. Returning to her pediatric residency at Johns Hopkins, Mel cared for many pre-mature infants with a lung condition then called hyaline membrane disease (HMD), and now known as RDS. Nearly half of the affected infants died, usually in the first 3 or 4 days, with pathology character-ized by atelectasis and hyaline membranes (2).

40|$|Introduction: The <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> is {{the most}} common method used for the {{detection}} and control of bovine tuberculosis (TB). Specificity and sensitivity of this <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> is low, so it is better to perform another test in parallel for investigation of the disease. The ELISA test is user friendly, so it can be an appropriate test for performing in parallel with the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> for an accurate detection. The aim of this study is the development of an ELISA test (kit) based on proteins smaller than 10 kDa (specially ESAT- 6) for the detection of TB in cattle. Materials and Methods: Proteins lower than 10 kDa M. W. were isolated from sonicated bacteria and were precipitated with ammonium sulfate. Protein assay was done after dialysis. Then a checkerboard was done for the determination of the best concentration of antigens and antibodies. There were 114 serum samples that were isolated; 100 cows that three continual <b>tuberculin</b> <b>tests</b> were negative and 14 serum samples were positive (in the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test).</b> Culture and PCR were done from lymph nodes (or tissues) of tuberculin positive cows. Stability was investigated on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 in 37 °C. Results: The best concentration of antigens and antibodies were acquired 200 ng and 1 / 100 respectively. All of the 100 samples that were negative in the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>tests</b> were negative in this ELISA kit as well, but out of 14 samples that were positive in the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test,</b> just 8 samples were positive in the ELISA kit. Meanwhile, the results of culture and PCR were compatible with the ELISA kit's results. There was a variation of less than 10 % between days 0 and 7 at 37 °C that shows at least 1 year stability of this kit in refrigerator temperatures (4 – 8 °C). Conclusion: Performing the ELISA test based on ESAT- 6 antigen shows that this test can be a suitable way for screening beside the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> for accurate detection. It is noticed that the specificity of the ELISA test was determined more than the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test,</b> especially since the culture and PCR are gold standards.

40|$|Background. Repeat <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>tests</b> may {{be false}} {{positive}} due to boosting of waned immunity to past mycobacterial exposure. We evaluated whether an ELISPOT test could identify tuberculosis (TB) contacts with boosting of immunity to nontuberculous mycobacterial exposure. Methodology/Principal Findings. We conducted <b>tuberculin</b> and ELISPOT <b>tests</b> in 1665 TB contacts: 799 were <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> negative and were offered a repeat test after three months.

We compared converters with non-converters, assessed {{the probability of}} each of four combinations of ELISPOT results over the two time points and estimated boosting with adjustment for ELISPOT sensitivity and specificity. 704 (72 %) contacts had a repeat tuberculin test; 176 (25 %) had test conversion, which increased with exposure to a case (p = 0. 002), increasing age (p = 0. 0006) and BCG scar (p = 0. 06). 114 <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> converters had ELISPOT results: 16 (14 %) were recruitment positive/follow-up positive, 9 (8 %) positive/negative, 34 (30 %) negative/positive, and 55 (48 %) were negative/negative.

40|$|Aim: Study {{degree of}} {{sensitivity}} and specificity of IFN-γ as QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay in diagnosis of tuberculosis instead of <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test.</b> Subjects and methods: Forty patients were {{included in this study}} subdivided into two groups. First included 20 patients with sputum positive for tuberculosis, while the second included 20 patients suspected to catch TB infection, guided by: clinical and radiological examinations with smear negative for TB. Control group included 10 clinical and radiological healthy controls previously vaccinated by BCG with positive <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test.</b> All subjects were submitted for full clinical history physical examination routine laboratory tests, plain chest X-ray, sputum study for acid fast Bacilli by Ziehl–Neelsen stain, <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> using Mantoux technique, sputum culture on Lowenstein-Jensen Medium and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-Gold IT) assay. Results: QFT-Gold IT test sensitivity =  100 % specificity =  100 % predictive value positive =  100 % which means that 100 % of the disease positive patients gave positive QFT-Gold IT test and predictive value negative =  100 % which means that 100 % of the disease negative patients gave negative QFT-Gold IT <b>test.</b> Agreement between <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> and QFT-Gold IT test was good agreement where the ‘κ’ was 0. 65 (CI =  0. 39 – 0. 91). Study revealed positive correlation between QuantiFERON level and severity of infection in sputum, which was statistically significant, where ‘r’ was 0. 92 and P-value was < 0. 05. Conclusion: QFT-Gold IT, has excellent sensitivity and specificity unaffected by BCG vaccination. <b>Tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> specificity is high in non-BCG-vaccinated populations but low and variable in BCG vaccinated populations...|$|R
40|$|Background: The <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used test for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) infection. The basis of <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing</b> is the induction of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the intradermal injection of <b>tuberculin.</b> Unfortunately, this <b>test</b> is incapable of distinguishing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection from Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination or infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria.

Materials and Methods: For skin test, different groups of guinea pigs were sensitized with M. tuberculosis, M. avium and M. bovis BCG. Guinea pigs were injected intradermally with 0. 1 ml of 0. 4, 2 and 10 µg/ml of tuberculin. Skin reactions (diameters of erythema, in millimeters) were independently measured 24 h after injection and results were calculated. Results: The results showed that the specificity index of human <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> for guinea pigs sensitized with M. bovis BCG in compare of guinea pigs sensitized with M. tuberculosis was equal and for guinea pigs sensitized with M. avium was not equal.

40|$|In {{assessing}} the biological activity of BCG vaccine by <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing</b> of vaccinated guinea-pigs, {{it is necessary}} {{to take into account the}} rates of development and waning of allergy, and also the boosting effect on waning allergy caused by the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> itself. Using Danish liquid vaccine (in approximately standard dose), the authors have carried out two series of tests, involving more than six hundred guinea-pigs, to evaluate the significance of these factors. Post-vaccination tuberculin sensitivity was found to reach a maximum within 1 - 2 months. Three months after vaccination the BCG-induced allergy began to wane, and after 12 months it had dropped almost to the level observed in non-vaccinated guinea-pigs. The <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> had a strong boosting effect, however, and even 12 months after vaccination the waning sensitivity could be considerably increased by a single injection of 10 TU of tuberculin. An analysis of the results showed that the waning of the level of allergy takes place gradually over several months. This is not an effect of aging, however, as the response to vaccination was found to be independent of the age of the animals. The indications of this study are that <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing</b> of guinea-pigs used for the laboratory control of BCG vaccine is best performed about 6 weeks after vaccination...|$|R
