In general, {{this method is}} used by bacteria {{that do not have}} the ability to perform the branch-chain fatty acid system using alpha-keto primers. Typical short-chain primers include isovalerate, isobutyrate, and 2-methyl butyrate. In general, the acids needed for these primers are taken up from the environment; this is often seen in <b>ruminal</b> bacteria.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Ruminal</b> tympany, {{also known}} as bloat, is a common problem in grazing systems for ruminants, {{although}} not for pigs or poultry, that if left untreated can lead to animal death. [...] This problem occurs when foam producing compounds in plants are digested by cows, causing foam to form in the rumen of the animal and ultimately prohibiting animals from expelling gas. The risk of bloat can be mitigated by seeding non-bloating legumes with the grasses. [...] Animals are especially susceptible to bloat if they are moved to new pasture sources when they are particularly hungry. [...] It is therefore important {{to ensure that the}} herd is eating enough {{at the end of a}} rotation when forage will be more scarce, limiting the potential for animals to gorge themselves when turned onto new paddocks.|$|E

60|$|Ancient Rome, like modern Sienna, abounded most {{probably}} {{with images of}} the foster-mother of her founder; but there were two she-wolves of whom history makes particular mention. One of these, of brass in ancient work, was seen by Dionysius[632] at the temple of Romulus, under the Palatine, and is universally believed to be that mentioned by the Latin historian, as having been made from the money collected by a fine on usurers, and as standing under the <b>Ruminal</b> fig-tree.[633] The other was that which Cicero[634] has celebrated both in prose and verse, and which the historian Dion also records as having suffered the same accident as is alluded to by the orator.[635] The question agitated by the antiquaries is, whether the wolf now in the Conservator's Palace is that of Livy and Dionysius, or that of Cicero, {{or whether it is}} neither one nor the other. The earlier writers differ as much as the moderns: Lucius Faunus[636] says, that it is the one alluded to by both, which is impossible, and also by Virgil, which may be. Fulvius Ursinus[637] calls it the wolf of Dionysius, and Marlianus[638] talks of it as the one mentioned by Cicero. To him Rycquius tremblingly assents.[639] Nardini is inclined to suppose it {{may be one of the}} many wolves preserved in ancient Rome; but of the two rather bends to the Ciceronian statue.[640] Montfaucon[641] mentions it as a point without doubt. Of the latter writers the decisive Winckelmann[642] proclaims it as having been found at the church of Saint Theodore, where, or near where, was the temple of Romulus, and consequently makes it the wolf of Dionysius. His authority is Lucius Faunus, who, however, only says that it was placed, not found, at the Ficus Ruminalis, by the Comitium, by which he does not seem to allude to the church of Saint Theodore. Rycquius was the first to make the mistake, and Winckelmann followed Rycquius.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ruminal</b> tympany, {{also known}} as bloat, is a disease of {{ruminant}} animals, characterized by an excessive volume of gas in the rumen. <b>Ruminal</b> tympany may be primary, known as frothy bloat, or secondary, known as free-gas bloat.|$|E

Dr. Beauchemin is also internationally recognized for her work in the area of improving the utilization of forages by ruminants through the use of feed enzyme technology and other feed additives.

50|$|In frothy bloat (primary <b>ruminal</b> tympany), the gas {{produced}} by fermentation is trapped within the fermenting {{material in the}} rumen, causing a build up of foam which cannot be released by burping.

Some legumes, such as sainfoin, birdsfoot trefoil and cicer milkvetch are not associated with cause bloat in cattle. In feedlot cattle, a diet containing a high proportion of cereal grain can lead to primary <b>ruminal</b> tympany. The main signs in cattle are distension of {{the left side of the}} abdomen, dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and severe distress.

50|$|After being swallowed, food travels {{down the}} {{oesophagus}} and is {{deposited in the}} dorsal part of the reticulum. Contractions of the reticulorumen propel and mix the recently ingested feed into the <b>ruminal</b> mat. The mat is a thick mass of digesta, consisting of partially degraded, long, fibrous material. Most material in the mat has been recently ingested, and as such, has considerable fermentable substrate remaining. Microbial fermentation proceeds rapidly in the mat, releasing many gases. Some of these gases are trapped in the mat, causing the mat to be buoyant. As fermentation proceeds, fermentable substrate is exhausted, gas production decreases, and particles lose buoyancy due to loss of entrapped gas. Digesta in the mat hence goes through a phase of increasing buoyancy followed by decreasing buoyancy. Simultaneously, the size of digesta particles-relatively large when ingested-is reduced by microbial fermentation and, later, rumination. Incomplete digestion of plant material here {{will result in the}} formation of a type of bezoar called Phythobezoars. At a certain point, particles are dense and small enough that they may “fall” through the rumen mat into the ventral sac below, or they may be swept out of the rumen mat into the reticulum by liquid gushing through the mat during <b>ruminal</b> contractions. Once in the ventral sac, digesta continues to ferment at decreased rates, further losing buoyancy and decreasing in particle size. It is soon swept into the ventral reticulum by <b>ruminal</b> contractions.|$|E

5000|$|Because of {{the high}} solute {{concentration}} of the rumen fluid under such conditions, considerable water is translocated from the blood to the rumen along the osmotic potential gradient, resulting in dehydration which cannot be relieved by drinking, and which can ultimately lead to hypovolemic shock.

Undissociated lactic acid can cross the rumen wall to the blood, where it dissociates, lowering blood pH. Both L and D isomers of lactic acid are produced in the rumen; these isomers are metabolized by different metabolic pathways, and activity of the principal enzyme involved in metabolism of the D isomer declines greatly with lower pH, tending to result in an increased ratio of D:L isomers as acidosis progresses.|$|E
