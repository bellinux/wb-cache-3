Further evolution was slow, and for about 3 billion years in the Precambrian eon, (much {{of the history of}} life on Earth), all organisms were microorganisms. Bacteria, algae and fungi have been identified in amber that is 220 million years old, which shows that the morphology of microorganisms has changed little since the Triassic period.

5|$|The {{architecture}} of Conwy has close to links to {{that found in}} the kingdom of Savoy in the same period. These include window styles, the type of crenellation used on the towers and positioning of putlog holes, and are usually ascribed to the influence of the Savoy architect Master James. The links between Conwy and Savoy are not straightforward, however, as in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built after James had left the region. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider <b>role</b> <b>played</b> <b>by</b> Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the Conwy project.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} demands {{placed on}} the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots {{and other forms of}} resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The <b>role</b> <b>played</b> <b>by</b> Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E

Due to bad weather conditions, NATO aircraft were unable to locate their targets, but on 9 October, in the final combat engagement of Deny Flight, NATO aircraft returned and destroyed a Serb command and control bunker.|$|E
5|$|A {{point of}} {{contention}} among scholars is the <b>role</b> <b>played</b> <b>by</b> Armenian clerics in that process. According {{to a number of}} scholars and medieval Armenian sources, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has been criticized by scholars, both Georgian and Western, who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other scholars quote Koryun's claims without taking a stance on its validity. Many agree, however, that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must {{have played a role in}} the creation of the Georgian script.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} forms of their respective languages, the four linguistic regions of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms. The <b>role</b> <b>played</b> <b>by</b> dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in the German-speaking regions, Swiss German dialects have become ever more prevalent since {{the second half of}} the 20th century, especially in the media, such as radio and television, and are used as an everyday language, while the Swiss variety of Standard German is almost always used instead of dialect for written communication (c.f. diglossic usage of a language). Conversely, in the French-speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.|$|E
5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features – such as the gatehouses – are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider <b>role</b> <b>played</b> <b>by</b> Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not {{elsewhere}} in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the <b>role</b> <b>played</b> <b>by</b> the Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, da Vinci and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the Augustinians order in Florence.|$|E
