5|$|Illinois's 1st congressional {{district}} is a minority-majority district. At {{the time of}} the election, 65percent of its constituents were African American. In redistricting after the 1990 United States Census, the district was extended into the suburbs {{for the first time in}} 90 years, but a majority of the districts' residents (70%) lived in Chicago. A strongly Democratic district, only twice since 1966 has a <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> United States Congress received over 20% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Willson {{was chosen}} by acclamation as the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> governor. Willson's {{opponent}} had been chosen at a nominating convention two years earlier. Governor Beckham had convinced the Democrats to hold their primary early so he could secure the party's nomination for the 1908 senatorial election {{while he was still}} serving as governor. Further, he wanted to influence the selection of his would-be successor. Using his clout as governor, he assured the selection of Samuel Wilbur Hager as the party's gubernatorial nominee.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Morrow {{was chosen}} as the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the Senate seat of Thomas Paynter. Paynter had decided not to seek re-election, and the Democrats {{nominated}} Ollie M. James of Crittenden County. The General Assembly was heavily Democratic and united behind James. On a joint ballot, James defeated Morrow by a vote of 105–28. Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment the next year, this was the last time the Kentucky legislature would elect a senator.|$|E

5|$|In prison, Sideshow Bob calls local right-wing {{talk show}} host Birch Barlow and {{complains}} about being unfairly imprisoned. Barlow and Springfield's residents pressure Mayor Quimby into releasing Sideshow Bob. Sideshow Bob is soon unveiled as the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the Springfield mayoral election. Determined to keep Sideshow Bob from becoming mayor, Bart and Lisa decide to campaign for Mayor Quimby. Unfortunately, due to Sideshow Bob's charisma and Mayor Quimby's drowsy, overmedicated appearance at a televised debate, Sideshow Bob wins the election by a massive margin.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 1953, Nunn {{declared}} as a <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> county {{judge and}} was ultimately the only Republican to declare. In the Democratic primary, {{one of the}} challengers charged that the incumbent had used his office for personal gain. In {{the wake of the}} investigation, a group of disgruntled Democrats formed an organization to elect Nunn, who defeated his Democratic challenger by a vote of 5,171 to 4,378, becoming the first Republican elected county judge {{in the history of the}} heavily Democratic county.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office in 1956, when he sought to be a <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> Baltimore County Council. He was turned down by local party leaders, but nevertheless campaigned vigorously for the Republican ticket. The election resulted in an unexpected Republican majority on the council, and in recognition for his party work, Agnew was appointed for a one-year term to the county Zoning Board of Appeals, at a salary of $3,600 per year. This quasi-judicial post provided an important supplement to his legal practice, and Agnew welcomed the prestige connected with the appointment. In April 1958 he was reappointed to the Board for a full three-year term, and became its chairman.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from his}} World War I-era service in Mexico and Europe, his {{overseas}} postings {{had been in}} Asia and the Pacific. During World War II, {{he had become a}} national hero and had been awarded the Medal of Honor for the unsuccessful defense of the Philippines in the Battle of Bataan. He had commanded the Allied armies in the New Guinea Campaign and Philippines Campaign, fulfilling his famous promise to return to the Philippines. In 1944 and 1948, he had been considered a possible <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> president. After the war, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP), he had overseen the Occupation of Japan and played an important part in the post-war political and social transformation of that country.|$|E
5|$|By 1877, {{differences}} with the Republican party leadership on the money question led him to consider other options. After initially supporting the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> governor that year, Weaver joined the Greenback Party in August. In 1878, Weaver accepted the Greenback nomination for Iowa's 6th congressional district. Although Weaver's political career up to then had been as a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district considered that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Ezekiel S. Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Despite objections from some hard-money Democrats, the Greenback-Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Wetherby resumed his private law practice. In 1956, Senator Alben Barkley {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a}} heart attack. The timing of his death meant that the state would elect two senators in 1956—Clements' term was expiring and now Barkley's seat was vacant. President Eisenhower convinced former senator and ambassador John Sherman Cooper to be the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the seat, hoping Cooper's immense popularity in the state would help his own re-election bid. Barkley's death occurred so late in the year that there was not time for a Democratic primary to choose the party's candidate for the open seat. The Democratic state committee chose Wetherby, who was only six months removed from his term as governor.|$|E

Two years later, in 1860, Harrison successfully ran as the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> reporter of the Indiana Supreme Court. Harrison was an active supporter of the Republican Party's platform and served as Republican State Committee's secretary. After Wallace, his law partner, was elected as county clerk in 1860, Harrison established a new firm with William Fishback that was named Fishback and Harrison. The new partners worked together until Harrison entered the Union Army {{after the start of}} the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Mikan was the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the United States Congress in Minnesota's 3rd congressional district. He {{challenged}} incumbent Representative Roy Wier in {{a closely}} fought race that featured a high voter turnout. Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning {{to the legal}} profession, Mikan was frustrated, after hoping for an influx of work. For six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him {{to cash in on}} his life insurance.|$|E
5|$|Only one <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> Mayor, Squirrel Hill {{resident}} Joshua Wander, filed {{a petition}} {{prior to the}} March 12 filing deadline to run as a Republican. In addition, Wander had stated an intention to run as a write-in candidate for the Democratic nomination. Wander had previously run as a write-in candidate for the Republican Mayoral nomination in the 2009 election, but was defeated by incumbent Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, also a write-in candidate in the Republican primary. The Republican primary took place alongside the Democratic primary on May 21, 2013. Wander, having run unopposed, won the nomination.|$|E

5|$|In 1866, Melvin was {{nominated}} as the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> Attorney General of West Virginia, {{and he won}} his election to the position with 23,509 votes, receiving {{the highest number of}} votes cast for an attorney in West Virginia's brief three-year history. On January 1, 1867, Melvin began his one-year tenure as attorney general; he was renominated on June 4, 1868 at the West Virginia Republican Convention and reelected to the position in fall 1868. He served in the office until his resignation on July 1, 1869. Melvin resigned his post as attorney general to accept an appointment to a circuit judgeship of the First Judicial District of West Virginia which comprised Brooke, Hancock, Marshall, and Ohio counties. He had been appointed to the judgeship by West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Elbert H. Caldwell.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Waller ran as a <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> US Congress. He {{lost the}} {{election}} by 8376 votes to Democratic lawyer Francis Dolan Collins. He did, however, win Columbia County in the election. He {{was also the}} proprietor of a furnace on Roaring Creek and built the Bloomsburg Sanitarium {{at the corner of}} Sixth Street and Market Street in Bloomsburg in 1870. Waller was vice president of the State Agricultural Society. He also extended Market Street in Bloomsburg and built many houses along it. Along with John Ramsay, he built First Street in Bloomsburg and sold the lots on it to Welsh immigrants some time before 1847. He also laid out other residential streets in Bloomsburg. He supported moving the county seat of Columbia County from Danville to Bloomsburg, although he was unable to convince Danville's businessmen to move their industries to Bloomsburg. In 1866, he was made one of three trustees of Bloomsburg's Board of Trade.|$|E
5|$|In public, Hand {{discussed}} {{issues of}} democracy, free speech, and toleration only in general terms. This discretion, plus {{a series of}} impressive speaking engagements, won him the respect of legal scholars and journalists, and by 1930 he {{was viewed as a}} serious candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court. His friend Felix Frankfurter, then a Harvard Law School professor, was among those lobbying hard for Hand's appointment. President Herbert Hoover chose to bypass him, possibly for political reasons, and appointed Charles Evans Hughes, who had previously served on the Court for six years before resigning to become the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> President in 1916, as Chief Justice. With Hughes and another New Yorker, Harlan Fiske Stone, on the Court, the promotion of a third New Yorker was then seen as impossible.|$|E

5|$|The Checkers {{speech or}} Fund speech was an address made on September 23, 1952, by the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> vice {{president}} of the United States, California Senator Richard Nixon. Nixon had been accused of improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses. With his place on the Republican ticket in doubt, he flew to Los Angeles and delivered a half-hour television address in which he defended himself, attacked his opponents, and urged the audience to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) to tell it whether he should remain on the ticket. During the speech, he stated that regardless of what anyone said, he intended to keep one gift: a black-and-white dog who had been named Checkers by the Nixon children, thus giving the address its popular name.|$|E
5|$|Under Knight Ridder, The Inquirer {{continued}} to be editorially independent. However, conservative commentators have labeled The Inquirer left leaning, and the paper has not endorsed a <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> President of the United States since Gerald Ford in 1976. Throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, groups supportive of Israel such as the Zionist Organization of America often accused The Inquirer of being anti-Israel. At the same time, Edward S. Herman, a University of Pennsylvania media analyst, has written many articles accusing The Inquirer of having given in to conservative pressure and including a conservative slant in the paper's reporting and editorial page. In 2006, The Inquirer {{became one of the}} only major United States newspapers to print one of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons. Afterwards, protesting the printing of the cartoon, Muslims picketed outside The Inquirer Building.|$|E
5|$|Without a peace treaty, MacArthur {{decided not}} to resign {{while at the same}} time writing letters to Wood saying he would be more than happy to accept the Republican {{nomination}} if it were offered to him. In late 1947 and early 1948, MacArthur received several Republican grandees in Tokyo. On 9 March 1948 MacArthur issued a press statement declaring his interest in being the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> president, saying he would be honored if the Republican Party were to nominate him, but would not resign from the Army to campaign for the presidency. The press statement had been forced by Wood, who told MacArthur that it was impossible to campaign for a man who was not officially running for president, and that MacArthur could either declare his candidacy or see Wood cease campaigning for him. MacArthur's supporters made a major effort to win the Wisconsin Republican primary held on 6 April 1948. MacArthur's refusal to campaign badly hurt his chances and it was won to everybody's surprise by Harold Stassen. The defeat in Wisconsin followed by defeat in Nebraska effectively ended MacArthur's chances of winning the Republican nomination, but MacArthur refused to withdraw his name until the 1948 Republican National Convention which was won by Governor Thomas Dewey of New York.|$|E
