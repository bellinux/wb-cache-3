50|$|The Mountwood and her {{identical}} sister Woodchurch {{originally had}} bright orange funnels {{with a black}} base and black soot buffer. On the main deck, there was a forward, heated shelter and also a main saloon, aft of this was the toilets and machine space. Below was a saloon bar. On the top deck was a large open promenade and a forward shelter beneath the bridge, although this shelter was open beneath the bridge so it was often breezy and cold. They had a main central wheelhouse and two side cabs, and power came from two medium speed Crossley 8-cylinder diesel engines. Upon the bridge deck, in the wheelhouse, one would find the large brass helm, the hydraulic steering telemotor. a binnacle, and two conjoined Chadburn Synchrostep engine order telegraphs. These were linked {{to the other two}} identical telegraphs in the docking cabs so they moved in tandem. There was also whistle controls and lighting controls. In the docking cabs or navigation boxes was another binnacle, a whistle control, telegraphs and also various indicators for engine/speed etc. Originally all ferries had a simple ship to shore communicating radio, but did not have radar or sonar. The wheelhouses of the two ferries differed slightly due to different positioning of <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> <b>indicators</b> and engine RPM gauges in the bridge wings. The telegraphs were designed to give the captain direct control of the engines (although they could still be used in the traditional signal / response manner) and as such were marked with commands such as brakeand start. They also had more speed settings ahead and astern. The original engines could reach full speed within 3 seconds once run had been passed.|$|R

Early photographs of Leasowe and Egremont show them carrying what look like binnacle shrouds (the brass lids that sit atop of a binnacle) on the roof of their wheelhouses and wing cabs. It is not understood what these were. Some people have said that they were in fact ventilation devices. Upon the bridge there were numerous modern devices. Chadburn synchrostep telegraphs and <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> <b>indicators,</b> hydraulic steering telemotor and an automatic whistle control could be found in both the wheelhouse and the navigation boxes. There was also an internal communication system, a ship to shore radio and PA system and three binnacles on the bridge. Similar types of navigation equipment and deck fittings used on these vessels are extant on the Edmund Gardner Pilot Boat at Merseyside Maritime Museum. The Leasowe and Egremont were popular ferries with their crews as they had much improved crew accommodation compared to the earlier steamers, where much of the lower deck space was taken up with boilers and machinery. When the ferries entered service they all had Wallasey white and black funnel liveries. There was, however, a major design fault with Leasowe and Egremont. In order to reach the bows of the ship when casting off etc., crew members were required to either push through the hordes of commuters and climb down a ladder from the forward promenade deck or walk along the rubbing strake and climb over. In flat calm conditions this was not a problem, but in a force 8 gale with the vessel bobbing around wildly, it could be considerably dangerous. The simple reason for such problems was because there was no door leading from the main saloon to the bow area of the ships! ...|$|R

The trial results are stated below. 1) Comparing to the operation of two engines, the ratio of steady turning diameter (D/L), the speed reduction rate (RATE), and the time for turning (TIME) were large when the position of engine and the turning direction was the same.

On the 30th, she sighted a convoy; but, since the enemy ships were well escorted, the submarine abandoned the chase. On 1 February, Tarpon fired a spread of four torpedoes at a freighter. One hit. She then fired two more; both hit. Her victim was apparently sinking when the submarine left the scene of the attack, but postwar analysis of Japanese records did not confirm the kill. On 11 February, while investigating a surface contact. Tarpon was illuminated by the enemy's searchlight. She dived and went deep but was severely jolted by four depth charges that knocked out her bow planes, <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> <b>indicator,</b> and port annunciator. On the night of 23 February - 24 February, Tarpon ran aground while attempting to navigate Boling Strait, west of Flores Island. Jettisoning ammunition, fresh water, fuel, and torpedoes failed to lighten the ship enough to float her off. A native boat then took an officer ashore on the island of Adunara, later returning with the only white man on the island, a Dutch missionary, Pastor H. von Den Rulst. He informed Wallace the next high tide would occur between 16:00 and 18:00. His warning that Japanese planes had been over the island during each of the past four days caused the crew a bit of uneasiness until flood tide. Then, with three engines backing, she slid off the bottom, returning to Fremantle on 5 March.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a ship subject to kinematic, dynamic, and moment equations and steered via the rudder under the assumptions that the <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> and <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> time rate {{are subject to}} upper and lower bounds. We formulate and solve four Mayer problems of optimal control, the optimization criterion being the minimum time. Also, we formulate and solve four Chebyshev problems of optimal control, the optimization criterion being the maximization {{with respect to the}} control history of the minimum value with respect to time of the distance between two identical ships, one maneuvering and one moving in a predetermined way. Problems P 1 and P 2 deal with course change maneuvers. In Problem P 1, a ship initially in quasi-steady state must reach the final point with a given yaw angle and zero yaw angle time rate. Problem P 2 differs from Problem P 1 in that quasi-steady state is required at the final point. Problems P 3 and P 4 deal with sidestep maneuvers. In Problem P 3, a ship initially in quasi-steady state must reach the final point with a given lateral distance, zero yaw angle, and zero yaw angle time rate. Problem P 4 differs from Problem P 3 in that quasi-steady state is required at the final point. Problems P 5 and P 6 deal with collision avoidance maneuvers without cooperation, while Problems P 7 and P 8 deal with collision avoidance maneuvers with cooperation. In Problems P 5 and P 7, the maneuvering ship must reach the final point with a given lateral distance, zero yaw angle, and zero yaw angle time rate. Problems P 6 and P 8 differ from Problems P 5 and P 7 in that quasi-steady state is required at the final point. The above Mayer problems and Chebyshev problems, transformed into Lagrange problems via suitable transformations, are solved via the sequential gradient-restoration algorithm in conjunction with a new singularity avoiding transformation which accounts for the bounds on <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> and <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> time rate.

Therefore, performance of the Indonesian ro-ro ferries in operation become important in technical and economical point of view. This paper discusses effect of wind and wave to the ship speed, drift and <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> in order to maintain the ship direction. The wind velocities of 5 m/s, 10 m/s, 15 m/s, 20 m/s and 25 m/s with variation of direction from 0 degree (head wind) to 180 degrees (following wind) are used to investigated its effect on ship speed, drift <b>angle</b> and <b>rudder</b> <b>angle.</b> The wave is assumed to be fully developed due to wind. Therefore the wave parameters are determined using wind and wave correlation as defined in Beaufort scale.

40|$|Experimental {{tests and}} {{numerical}} calculations of replenishment at sea operations for two Fridtjof Nansenclass frigates have been performed. A Fridtjof Nansen-class frigate has been model {{with the use}} of empirical formulas for the hull, propeller and rudder properties. The hull is based on hull description from a VERES model. Turning circle and zigzag maneuvers have been performed with a maneuvering simulation program from the work of Skejic (2008). The results of these numerical maneuvering tests with the model does not correspond entirely with the results from model tests and full scale test of the ship class. The reason for this might be due to the hull description the model is based on, which lacks the appendices and has been manipulated to fit the program. But the differences in results are in an order of magnitude such that it is possible use the model for the further calculations. Full scale tests were performed with two Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates. Measurements of position, <b>rudder</b> <b>angles,</b> course, heading and other parameters was done with on board equipment from both ships. The most distinctive result is the oscillations of the <b>rudder</b> <b>angles</b> of the approaching ship. This effect is most evident {{in the wake of the}} other ship, but carries on during the replenishment as well. The effect was seen on both ships when being in the wake of the other. The effect of these oscillations might lead to a reduction in the rudder lift. Which means there is little effect of the rudder oscillations. When using these <b>rudder</b> <b>angles</b> in a simulation of the maneuvering, we get a course close to the one being measured. Due to these oscillations it is hard to get some comparable rudder data from the replenishment maneuver. The positioning measurements for the RAS maneuver from GPS is not accurate, and other methods for measuring the transverse distance should be used in addition to the GPS. Numerical calculations have been performed with the simulation program from the work of Skejic (2008). Two Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates have been modeled in the program and various runs have been performed. First in calm water conditions to see the effect without the disturbance of waves. For replenishment maneuvers at transverse distances according to the given procedures, that is between 30 and 50 meters, only small <b>rudder</b> <b>angles</b> are needed to account for the sway force and yaw moment due the presence of the other ship. Both the <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> and the drift angle are less than 1 o. With other external loads, like waves, wind current, working on the ships during the maneuver, the interaction forces would be difficult to distinguish from the others. We see that the approaching speed is of significance, especially when the delivering ship is relatively small compared with the receiving ship. A larger ship will get little effect of presence of a smaller approaching vessel. From the sensitivity analysis we see a strong dependency on the thrust deduction factor, in addition to the location of the COG. When including waves in the calculations, we see that the waves makes an equally large contribution on the ships as the presence of an other, at transverse distance of 45 meters and 55 meters.   </p...|$|R

40|$|This is the {{continuation}} of our research on development of a fully nonlinear, dynamically consistent, numerical ship motion model (DiSSEL). In this study we will report our results in predicting ship motions in unsteady maneuvering in calm water. During the unsteady maneuvering, both the <b>rudder</b> <b>angle,</b> and ship forward speed vary with time. Therefore, not only surge, sway, and yaw motions occur, but roll, pitch and heave motions will also occur even in calm water as heel, trim, and sinkage, respectively. When the <b>rudder</b> <b>angles</b> and ship forward speed vary rapidly with time, the six degrees-of-freedom ship motions and their interactions become strong. To accurately predict the six degrees-of-freedom ship motions in unsteady maneuvering, a universal method for arbitrary ship hull requires physics-based fully-nonlinear models for ship motion and for rudder forces and moments. The numerical simulations will be benchmarked by experimental data of the Pre-Contract DDG 51 design and an Experimental Hull Form. The benchmarking shows a good agreement between numerical simulations by the enhancement DiSSEL and experimental data. No empirical parameterization is used, except for {{the influence of the}} propeller slipstream on the rudder, which is included using a flow acceleration factor...|$|R

The relief helmsman will then take the helm and repeat all the information to ensure that he/she knows what to steer while on watch. An example of this would be: ...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The Report {{discusses}} briefly {{the philosophy}} of parametric methods of load measurement in which load is not measured directly, but is deduced from a statistical correlation with an appropriate combination of aircraft motion variables and control surface angles. It describes a full-scale flight experiment on a Lightning Mk T 5 aimed at developing a parametric method for the measurement of fin fatigue loads under operational conditions. An empirical relationship is established between the fin root bending moment, as determined from a multi-strain gauge installation, and a combination of parameters. The parameters from which the combination is selected include translational and rotational accelerations, rates of rotation, <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> and angle of sideslip. The study covers the measurement of fin loads under {{a wide range of}} loadin...|$|R
