40|$|Near {{eutectoid}} fully pearlitic {{wire rod}} (5. 5 mm diameter) was taken through six stages of wire drawing (drawing strains of 0 to 2. 47). The as-drawn (AD) wires were further laboratory annealed (LA) to re-austenitize and reform the pearlite. AD and LA grades, for <b>respective</b> <b>wire</b> diameters, had similar pearlite microstructure: interlamellar spacing (lambda) and pearlite alignment with the wire axis. However, LA grade had lower hardness (for both phases) and slightly lower fiber texture and residual stresses in ferrite. Surprisingly, essentially identical tensile yield strengths in AD and LA wires, measured at equivalent spacing, were found. The work hardened AD had, as expected, higher torsional yield strengths and lower tensile and torsional ductilities than LA. In both wires, stronger pearlite alignment gave significantly increased torsional ductility...|$|E
40|$|In {{integrated}} circuits, {{components are}} frequently interconnected by {{horizontal and vertical}} <b>wires</b> in <b>respective</b> <b>wiring</b> planes whether on chip, card, or board. The wire changes direction through “vias” that connect the orthogonal wiring planes. Because of technology constraints, the arrangement of vias must conform with certain neighborhood restrictions. We present results on the guaranteed minimum number and maximum possible number of vias in a given wiring cell for various technology constraints. These numbers provide an early means of control on global wiring routes to further {{the success of the}} exact embedding process that follows global wiring...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} feature of the cortex is its ability to wire itself. Understanding how the visual cortex wires up through development and how visual experience refines connections into adulthood is a key question for Neuroscience. While computational models of the visual cortex are becoming increasingly detailed, the question of how such architecture could self-organize through visual experience is often overlooked. Here we focus on the class of hierarchical feedforward models of the ventral stream of the visual cortex, which extend the classical simple-to-complex cells model by Hubel and Wiesel (1962) to extra-striate areas, and have been shown to account for a host of experimental data. Such models assume two functional classes of simple and complex cells with specific predictions about their <b>respective</b> <b>wiring</b> and resulting functionalities. In these networks, the issue of learning, especially for complex cells, is perhaps the least well understood. In fact, in most of these models, the connectivity between simple and complex cells is not learned butrather hard-wired. Several algorithms have been proposed for learning invariances at the complex cell level based on a trace rule to exploit the temporal continuity of sequences of natural images, but very few can learn from natural cluttered image sequences. Here we propose a new variant of the trace rule that only reinforces the synapses between the most active cells, and therefore can handle cluttered environments. The algorithm has so far been developed and tested at the level of V 1 -like simple and complex cells: we verified that Gabor-like simple cell selectivity could emerge from competitive Hebbian learning. In addition, we show how the modified trace rule allows the subsequent complex cells to learn to selectively pool over simple cells with the same preferred orientation but slightly different positions thus increasing their tolerance to the precise position of the stimulus within their receptive fields...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{calculation}} of momentum resolution for muons incident on the large end-cap chambers. The impact on the resolution of two chamber designs was evaluated: Those constructed with straight drift tubes are compared to the ATLAS baseline design in which chambers are bent such that tube axes conform to the catenary of their <b>respective</b> anode <b>wires.</b> The analysis was performed using the GARFIELD program to calculate drift tube time-to-space functions. ATLAS muon system code packages LHCTOR and MUONBOX were used to generate tracks, hits and momentum reconstruction. We find that, for straight tube chambers compared to bent ones, the overall degradation in momentum resolution, averaged over all of {{the largest of the}} so called large end-cap chambers (EML 4 - 5 and EOL 3 in the pseudo-rapidity range 1. 02 < η < 1. 49), is very small for muon transverse momentum P_t = 500 Gev and negligible for P_t < 100 Gev. When the intermediate large end-cap chambers (EEL 1 and EEL 2) are considered no momentum degradation at P_t= 500 Gev is observed...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{information}} processing is expressed using quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates which {{are arranged in}} the terms of quantum circuits. Here, each qubit is associated to a quantum circuit wire which is used to conduct the desired operations. Most of the existing quantum circuits allocate a single quantum circuit wire for each qubit and, hence, introduce a significant overhead. In fact, qubits are usually not needed during the entire computation but only between their initialization and measurement. Before and after that, corresponding wires may be used by other qubits. In this work, we propose a solution which exploits this fact in order to optimize the design of quantum circuits with respect to the required wires. To this end, we introduce a representation of the lifetimes of all qubits which is used to analyze the <b>respective</b> need for <b>wires.</b> Based on this analysis, a method is proposed which "recycles" the available wires and, by this, reduces the size of the resulting circuit. Experimental evaluations based on established reversible and fault-tolerant quantum circuits confirm that the proposed solution reduces the amount of wires by more than 90 % compared to unoptimized quantum circuits.
