At 13:30, Ba's M113 formation finally closed in on the downed helicopters {{on the west side of}} Ap Bac. The M113s approached the landing zone in single file instead of in formation, and they were immediately fired upon by Viet Cong inside the hamlet who were able to concentrate their fire on one target at a time. The South Vietnamese M113 gun crews were exposed from the waist up, so they were easy targets for snipers; by the end of the day, 14 South Vietnamese M113 crewmen had been killed due to their exposure. The two leading M113s were able to pull up beside the downed helicopters, but one driver was killed while driving with his head outside of the hatch, and Ba was knocked unconscious inside his carrier.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>fields</b> {{constitute}} {{a significant proportion}} of the existing wetlands in the Mediterranean basin and are important areas for the conservation of different vertebrate species, especially birds. However, little is known on how fish and crayfish use <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> in Mediterranean areas. In this work we analyze fish communities and crayfish populations occupying <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and their associated irrigation network (inflow and outflow channels) in the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). We set fyke nets in 104 sites and captured almost 23, 000 fish belonging to 19 species, 9 of which were found to occupy <b>rice</b> <b>fields,</b> as well as over 3000 red swamp crayfish (. Procambarus clarkii). Stone moroko (Pseudorasbora parva), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), dojo loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) and Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were the most common fish found in <b>rice</b> <b>fields.</b> More than 95 % of the fish individuals captured belonged to non-native species. Dojo loach, a recently introduced species well adapted to rice cultivation cycles in its native range, used <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> as reproduction ground. Outflow channels seemed to be a more important source of fish colonizing <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> than inflow channels. Colonization was the main limitation for the establishment of fish populations in <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and fish tended to be more abundant in <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> than in channels for any given frequency of occurrence. The importance of fish as trophic resource for natural predators and the possible interactions between fish occupying <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and <b>rice</b> yield, largely unexplored in the Mediterranean areas, could be managed by modulating connectivity between <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and irrigation channels. <b>Rice</b> <b>fields,</b> however, are not important areas for the conservation of native fish biodiversity, being largely occupied by non-native fishes. Moreover, the influence of low-conductivity water diverted for rice cultivation on natural wetlands favors the establishment and expansion of different non-native fish species. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

One unique feature of paddy <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> is that they have a layer of surface water to cover soils, and consequently it acts as a major source of methane emissions and {{plays an important role in}} global atmospheric methane budget. Flooding (irrigation) of paddy <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> consumes large amounts of water. Intermittent drainage of paddy <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> is widely practiced by farmers as a way for enhancing plant growth and increasing rice crop yield. Changes in spatial distribution of paddy <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and temporal management of water (flooding/drainage) in paddy <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> are likely to have significant impacts on food production and trace gases emissions. Here we present an effort to develop novel approaches for identifying and mapping paddy <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> in Asia.

40|$|The Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon {{was once}} thought to be extinct in the wild until seven birds were {{discovered}} in a remote mountain village in China in 1981. Studies suggested that winter-flooded <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> play an essential role in nest site selection by the Crested Ibis and hence in their survival. Considerable efforts were therefore made to conserve the winter-flooded <b>rice</b> <b>fields,</b> but these have caused conflicts between the agricultural and conservation communities. The population and geographical range of the wild Crested Ibis has expanded greatly since 1981, but there is no spatial information on the winter-flooded <b>rice</b> <b>fields,</b> nor on the current association of nest sites and winter-flooded <b>rice</b> <b>fields.</b> We mapped winter-flooded <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> across the entire current range of Crested Ibis using innovative remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) techniques. The spatial relationships between the nest site clusters and winter-flooded <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> were quantified using Ward’s hierarchical clustering method and Ripley’s K-function. We show that both have significantly clumped distribution patterns and that they are positively associated. However, the dependence of Crested Ibis on the winter-flooded <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> varied significantly among the nest site clusters and has decreased over the years, indicating the absence of winter-flooded <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> is not constraining their recovery and population expansion. We therefore recommend that efforts should be made to protect the existing winter-flooded <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and to restore the functionality of natural and semi-natural wetlands, to encourage both in-situ conservation and the re-introduction of the Crested Ibis.

25|$|Harvests of P. clarkii {{account for}} a large {{majority}} of the crayfish produced in the United States and elsewhere. Crayfish farming began in Louisiana in the 18th century, taking place in rice fields in a concurrent or alternate culture system. The concurrent culture of rice and crayfish makes good use of land, resources, equipment, and infrastructure already being used for rice production. However, crawfish production has decreased in recent years due to an increase of imports from China, which is now the world's leading producer of crawfish and is also using a rice-based system. A number of species of crustaceans were introduced to China to create markets for aquaculture and because they are better adapted to growing in a <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> than native fish species. Rice-fish farming originated in China and is once again growing as the yields from Green Revolution practices used to grow rice are no longer increasing, and resources such as land and water are becoming more limited.|$|E
