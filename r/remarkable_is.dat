As with oxides, protactinium forms mixed halides with alkali metals. Among those, most <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> Na3PaF8 where protactinium ion is symmetrically surrounded by 8 F− ions which form a nearly perfect cube.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann {{opened up a}} new era in human history. It seems to me that what makes the science behind this discovery so <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> that it was achieved by purely chemical means.|$|E

25|$|Also <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} suit now {{frequently}} appears in Rock, Heavy Metal and Gothic happenings, {{even though such}} groups were once known for a rather rebellious tradition of clothing. Artists and bands such as Nick Cave, Marilyn Manson, Blutengel and Akercocke are known {{for the use of}} formal clothing in music videos and stage performances. The suit also appears when fans dress for styles such as Lolita, Victorian and Corporate Gothic.|$|E
25|$|His {{greatest}} {{performance as}} a player, however, came in January 2000 when England played Zimbabwe in the fifth match of a triangular tournament held in South Africa. Ealham took five wickets for only 15 runs. At the time {{this was the best}} bowling performance by an Englishman in a one-day international match ever. Even more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> that all five wickets were LBWs. This is still a record in one-day international cricket.|$|E
25|$|<b>Remarkable</b> <b>is</b> {{the absence}} of {{peripheral}} burials {{for the members of}} the royal family. Indeed, no mastaba or pyramid of a queen dating to Sahure's time has been discovered as of 2012 in the immediate vicinity of Sahure's pyramid. This is in rupture with a tradition dating back at least to pharaoh Sneferu and that would be followed by Sahure's successors. Consequently, Sahure's consort queen Meretnebty, is only attested through carved reliefs found in the high temple. The reason for this absence is unknown.|$|E

60|$|So {{emphatic}} and <b>remarkable</b> <b>was</b> the captain's {{manner in}} putting this question, that the mate cast {{a look of}} surprise beneath him ere he answered it. A look with the glass succeeded, when the reply was given.|$|R
25|$|No signs, tracks or {{anything}} tangible or visible {{of the alleged}} animals was seen or shown whatsoever. Tracks, droppings, and other signs of forest elephants and gorillas were commonly seen, as well as crocodiles in the lake. Despite {{the fact that the}} African guides were extremely capable and experienced hunters, guides and experts of the African rainforest, they were not able to show any track or sign of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé and none of the several interviewed guides even claimed ever to have seen one personally, nor its tracks. <b>Remarkable</b> <b>is</b> the fact that the guides that were interviewed by the Dutch expedition and that also accompanied Regusters, stated that they never saw a Mokèlé-mbèmbé during that expedition, although Regusters himself claims to have seen one.|$|E
25|$|Eddie Keher of the Rower-Inistioge holds {{numerous}} championship scoring records. In 50 championship appearances between 1959 and 1977 {{he scored}} 35 goals and 334 points. Not only that but Keher also set and broke {{a number of}} individual records. In the 1963 All-Ireland final he scored 14 points, a verifiable record for a final up to that point. In 1971 Keher broke his own record when he captured 2 goals and 11 points in the All-Ireland final against Tipperary. What is more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> {{the fact that he}} ended up on the losing side on that occasion. This record was broken by Nicky English in 1989 when he scored 2 goals and 12 points in a 70-minute All-Ireland final. Keher's tally of 6 goals and 45 points in the 1972 championship is also a record.|$|E
25|$|<b>Remarkable</b> <b>is,</b> for example, the {{increase}} in non-occupational activities with obligation character, which include mainly house and garden work, maintenance and support of family members or volunteer activities. All this {{can contribute to the}} perception of a chronic lack of time. This time pressure is, amongst others, influenced by their own age, the age and number of children in the household, marital status, the profession and level of employment as well as the income level. The psychological strain, which in turn affects the health, increases due to the strong pressure of time, but also by the complexity of work, growing responsibilities, concern for long-term existential protection and more. The mentioned stresses and strains could lead in the long term to irreversible, physical signs of wear as well as to negative effects on the human cardiovascular and immune systems.|$|E
50|$|One of {{his most}} <b>remarkable</b> works <b>was</b> the {{reconsideration}} of the Babylonian musical scales and giving the first complete description of all of its notes, the work which was accepted widely and confirmed by newer researchers, for example M. L. West and O. R. Gurney.Also very <b>remarkable</b> <b>was</b> giving a new interpretation of the Hurrian Hymn 6 (see Hurrian songs) {{which is the most}} ancient musical notation known, giving the first complete interpretation.|$|R

25|$|One month later, on November 21, 1991, Caidic {{sets the}} PBA all-time {{records of the}} most points in a single game by a {{homegrown}} Filipino player (79 points), the most points in a single half (53 points), the most points in a single quarter (37 points), the most three-point field goals made and attempts in a game (17/27 triples), the most three-point field goals made in a quarter (8 triples) and the most consecutive three-point field goals made in a single game (8 triples), to lead Presto Tivoli against Ginebra San Miguel. His performance remains {{as one of the}} greatest individual performances in the PBA history. What makes it more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> that while he was playing in the court, his wife Millote was giving birth to their first daughter. He came off the bench late in the first quarter and left the game in the middle of the fourth, in a game where he could have possibly scored 100 points or more.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, R. G. Harrison, a {{professor}} of anatomy, used a portable x-ray machine {{to get a better}} look at the internal structures of the mummy to better determine age and cause of death of Tutankhamun. One of the most abnormal findings was the sternum (breastbone) and most parts of the frontal ribs were missing. Removing these bones was not part of the normal mummification process, which led Harrison to believe they might have been removed because they were badly damaged before his death. Harrison quickly discovered that Carter was not as careful as many of his personal notes had claimed. The mummy was not re-wrapped after 1926, which led to more deterioration due to the extremely hot external elements over the forty-two years. Also many of the limbs had been amputated in the body in order to remove some of the jewellery. Both hands were cut off, both legs were removed from the pelvis, and the head was severed from the body in order to get the mask off. Even more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> the king's right ear and penis were missing, but photographs from Carter show they were both present during his examination. Harrison believed the slight curve in the spine and small bone fragments might have been the result of the embalming process. The lesion on the left jaw showed signs of healing occurred before his death and one of his legs had been broken, but it could not be determined if it happened naturally or as a result of the embalming or Carter's examination. The fact that skull fragments were discovered led many to assume the king was murdered by a blow to the head, but the x-ray could not support or discredit this theory.|$|E

50|$|Demis Nikolaidis {{played in}} the Final as footballer of Apollon, {{a few days before}} his {{transfer}} in AEK Athens. Also <b>remarkable</b> <b>was</b> that Giannis Pathiakakis, coach of Apollon then, would coach AEK Athens 4 years later and would win the Cup.|$|R
500|$|Michael Kazin, Bryan's biographer, {{notes the}} many handicaps he faced in his 1896 campaign: [...] "A severe {{economic}} downturn that occurred with Democrats in power, a party deserted by its men of wealth and national prominence, the vehement opposition of most prominent publishers and academics and ministers, and hostility from the nation's largest employers". [...] According to Kazin, [...] "what is <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> not that Bryan lost but that he came {{as close as he}} did to winning." [...] Williams believes that Bryan did better than any other Democrat would have, and comments, [...] "The nominee of a divided and discredited party, he had come remarkably close to winning." [...] Bryan's own explanation was brief: [...] "I have borne the sins of Grover Cleveland." ...|$|E
500|$|The Narragansett Pacer was not {{exclusively}} a pacing horse, as strong evidence indicates it exhibited an ambling gait, {{which is a}} four-beat, intermediate-speed gait, while the pace is a two-beat, intermediate-speed gait. The amble is more comfortable to ride than the pace, and Narragansett Pacers were known for their qualities as both riding and driving horses. They averaged around [...] tall, and were generally chestnut in color. James Fenimore Cooper described them as: [...] "They have handsome foreheads, the head clean, the neck long, the arms and legs thin and tapered."; however, another source stated, [...] "The hindquarters are narrow and the hocks a little crooked...", but also said, [...] "They are very spirited and carry both the head and tail high. But what is more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> that they amble with more speed than most horses trot, {{so that it is}} difficult to put some of them upon a gallop." [...] Other viewers of the breed rarely called them stylish or good-looking, although they considered them dependable, easy to work with and sure-footed.|$|E
500|$|There's a Riot Goin' On was {{included}} on several music publications' [...] "End of the Year" [...] lists and critics' polls, including The Village Voices Pazz & Jop albums list at number seven. The album achieved commercial success with two hit singles and debuting at number-one on the Billboard Pop Albums and Soul Albums chart. It later {{came to be}} viewed by critics {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential albums. Christgau wrote in 2007 that the [...] "temptations and contradictions" [...] of commercial stardom consumed Sly Stone and resulted in [...] "the prophetic 1971" [...] album, [...] "its taped-over murk presaging Exile on Main St., its drum-machine beats throwing knuckleballs at [...] and , it was darker than the Velvet Underground and Nico and funkier than shit, yet somehow it produced two smash hits, including the stark, deep 'Family Affair'." [...] AllMusic described the album as [...] "funk at its deepest and most impenetrable," [...] stating that [...] "what makes Riot so <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> that it's hard not to get drawn in with him, as you're seduced by the narcotic grooves, seductive vocals slurs, leering electric pianos, and crawling guitars." [...] Zeth Lundy of PopMatters deemed it [...] "a challenging listen, at times rambling, incoherent, dissonant, and just plain uncomfortable" [...] with [...] "some episodic moments of pop greatness to be found". Lundy went on to discuss its radical departure from the band's past music: ...|$|E

500|$|Margarita with a Straw premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, and {{was also}} {{screened}} at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, 19th Busan International Film Festival, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The film garnered positive reviews, and Koechlin widespread attention and universal acclaim for her portrayal of a disabled person. While Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter made a detailed note of her [...] "bravura performance in both physical and emotional terms", NDTV film critic Saibal Chatterjee straightforwardly deemed her [...] "absolutely brilliant". Firstposts Deepanjana Pal ascribed her screen appeal to her lack of acting pretense, and wrote [...] " [...] {{has done a good}} job of miming the physicality but what is truly <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> the lack of artifice in her expressions". John Beifuss compared her performance to Eddie Redmayne's act as Stephen Hawking in the biographical drama, The Theory of Everything, in his review for The Commercial Appeal. He gave Koechlin the highest praise writing that her performance would have attracted Academy Award notice in a major film studio production. The view was echoed by Variety critic Guy Lodge, who was particularly impressed by her range. Koechlin won several accolades for the film, including the Best Actress Award at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Jury Award at the 63rd National Film Awards. Additionally, she had garnered nominations for Best Actress at the Seattle International Film Festival and the Asian Film Awards.|$|E

50|$|Morphology in Blastocladiomycota varies greatly. For example, {{members of}} Coelomycetaceae are simple, unwalled, and plasmodial in nature.
