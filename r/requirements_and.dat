5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> poor project management by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include requirements beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without regard for costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' final price and delivery schedule. The Navy's failure to maintain control of the design <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> make cost-performance trade-offs {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E

Some F-35 technology, such as more durable stealth coatings, have been applied to the F-22.
