50|$|Hardware {{palettes}} {{based on}} component video colors such as YPbPr {{or the like}} were generally replaced in the mid 1980s by the more flexible RGB color model, in which a given color {{can be obtained by}} mixing different amounts of the three primary colors red, green, and blue. Although the total number of different colors depends on the number of levels per primary, and on a given hardware implementation (a 9-bit RGB provides 512 combinations, a 12-bit RGB provides 4,096, and so on), in this model Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC) can generate the colors — simplifying the hardware design — while the software can treat the number per levels used abstractly and manage the RGB colors in a device-independent fashion. With colors stored in <b>RGB</b> <b>format</b> within the palettes of indexed image files, any image can be displayed (through appropriate transformations) on any such system, regardless of the color depth used in the hardware implementation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When {{a person}} watches {{different}} marrow-cell images {{he or she}} can identify every type of cells easily. In this process, human’s visual system has ability to adapt the different shades of the color marrow cells images. We propose a segmentation method for marrow-cell images based on fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM). Firstly, the count of cluster is calculated out using the shades of the R-matrix of a <b>RGB</b> <b>formatted</b> marrow cells image. Secondly, the fuzzy c-means clustering method is done on the R-matrix. Finally, the pixel of G-matrix and B-matrix are divided into some clusters by “one to one correspondence ” of the position of pixels that belong to R-matrix, G-matrix or B-matrix. This paper’s contribution could be summarized into three points: 1) a frame work of the fuzzy c-means clustering for marrow-cell images segmentation is proposed. 2) Using FCM and the R-matrix component of a <b>RGB</b> <b>formatted</b> marrow-cell images to generate the count of clustering. 3) This method could adaption different shades of different marrow-cell images...|$|R

5000|$|Today, display {{hardware}} and image file formats {{that deal with}} indexed color images almost exclusively manage colors in <b>RGB</b> <b>format,</b> the de facto standard encoding being the so-called truecolor or 24-bit RGB, with 16,777,216 different possible colors. However, indexed color images are not genuinely constrained to a 24-bit RGB color encoding; image palettes can hold any type of color encoding. For example, the PDF file format does support indexed color in other colorspaces, notably CMYK, and Adobe Distiller by default will convert images to indexed color whenever {{the total number of}} colors in an image is equal to or less than 256. When using RGB, the TIFF and PNG file formats can optionally store the RGB triplets with a precision of 16-bit (65,536 levels per component) yielding a total of 48 bits per pixel. A proposed extension to the TIFF Standard allows non-RGB color palettes, but this was never implemented in software due to technical reasons. The color map table of the BMP file format indexed color mode stores its entries in BGR order rather than RGB, and has (in the current version) an additional unused byte for padding to conform to 32-bit word alignment during processing, but it is essentially still a 24-bit RGB color encoding. (An earlier version of the BMP format used three bytes per 24-bit color map table entry, and many files in that format are still in circulation, so many modern programs that read BMP files support both variations.) ...|$|E

As such the systems need {{a way for the}} {{information}} they process to show up on the screen, and for the audio to be played through a sound system. Originally this was done through an antenna switch box. Later this was changed to a coaxial cable setup called a RF connector. It transmitted both the audio and video through one cable. Modern day systems are quite different though. All of the newer systems use industry standards now. One of those standards is RCA composite cables of single video and left and right audio. The video connector is usually colored yellow while the left and right audios are colored white and red respectively. Now that the newer systems are focusing on HD content and displaying in HD newer types of cable connections are needed. The basic are component cables with the <b>RGB</b> <b>format.</b> RGB stands for the three colors, red, green, and blue. This is the simplest form of HD cables. It uses three cables for video and the two for audio still. The newest form of HD transmittance cables are the High-Definition Multimedia Interface or HDMI cables. The HDMI cables transmit both the video and audio signals over a single cable. More importantly the information transmitted is a digital signal. Other cables utilize analog signals so that modern systems must convert to analog and then back to digital for use. Information is often lost in these conversions so that HDMI keeps the signal as digital so that less information is lost, keeping the signal truer to its source. These cables and signals are too new to be fully utilized, and are really only necessary for 1080p signal.|$|E

The paper briefly introduces the concept of data security i. e. a manually generated shift key based cryptographic technique which (de) ciphers the fragmented plain text. Here both encryption and decryption methodologies are proposed. The paperwork outlines a cryptographic algorithm based on a user defined shift key modus operandi engendering ciphers at bay. First, it creates an IDT (Induced Dynamic Table) to refer the position of the plain text characters. Then the next cipher is fabricated by setting the ART (Axis Rotation Table) according to the shift key. Subsequently, the further cipher is induced by a FFC (Four Face Cube). Later, the new partial cipher text characters are put into a definite sequence to get the standard color palette in <b>RGB</b> <b>format.</b> Hence, our final cipher with the shift key characters at the additional first and last color respectively in <b>RGB</b> <b>format</b> is generated. During decryption methodology, the color is selected and is opened in the standard color palette.
