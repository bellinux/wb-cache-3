40|$|Compared to muon {{acceleration}} in re-circulating linear accelerators, considered earlier, muon acceleration in FFAG rings {{holds the}} promise of having one arc instead of several, and {{a smaller number of}} RF cavities; i. e., using more than a few turns for acceleration from about 6 to about 20 GeV/c. We consider non-scaling FFAG machines (but with limited tune variation) that are essentially strong-focusing rings with a dispersion small enough to keep muons over the full momentum range inside the same magnet aperture. We compare several scenarios: (i) Rings with straight sections, long enough- a few metres- to house super-conducting RF cavities at about 200 MHz (and with enough space for decay of the magnetic fields in neighboring components to a level of about 10 mGauss; (ii) Rings with shorter straight sections, just long enough about a metre to house normal-conducting RF cavities also operating at about 200 MHz; (iii) <b>Racetrack-shaped</b> rings with compact arcs without RF cavities, joined to long straight sections with super-conducting RF cavities by adiabatic transition sections that match between them over the wide momentum range needed; (iv) Rings with a number of super periods (about 10) so that there are only a number of sc RF sections.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of the endogenous forces generated by fibroblast-mediated contraction, using four individual collagen gel models that differed with respect to the ability of the cells to contract the gel. Human neonatal dermal fibroblasts were seeded in type I collagen and the gels were cast in a <b>racetrack-shaped</b> mould containing a removable central island. Two of the models were mechanically stressed (20 mm and 10 mm), as complete contraction was prevented by the presence of a central island. The central island was removed in the third model (released) and the final model was cast in a Petri dish and detached, allowing full multi-axial contraction (SR). Cell viability was maintained in the 10 mm, released and SR models over a 6 day culture period but localized regions of cell death were evident in the 20 mm model. Cell and collagen alignment was developed in the 20 mm and 10 mm models and to a lesser extent in the released model, but was absent in the SR model. Cell proliferation and collagen synthesis was lower in the 20 mm model compared to the other systems and there was evidence of enhanced matrix metalloproteinase production. The mechanical properties of the 20 mm model system were inferior to the 10 mm and released systems.

40|$|Part 17 : Electrical Machines - IIInternational audienceA disk-shaped, double stator, {{induction}} motor with High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) field coils is proposed in this paper. Copper, typically used in windings of classic machines, limits current density allowed in field coils due to Joule effect losses. Also iron, {{which is used}} in magnetic circuits, limits the magnetic flux density obtained in the air gap due to saturation. The application of HTS field coils and iron removal effect in fractional power disk shaped or axial flux motors is analyzed by comparison of two different stator topologies. Twelve HTS field coils made of Bi- 2223 (Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10) first generation tape, wrapped around a <b>racetrack-shaped</b> nylon core, are assembled. A simple topology was chosen, consisting of six filed coils per semi-stator arranged in the same plane with 60 º displacement.

Simulations, experimental and theoretical results are consistent, showing high space harmonic distortion for the chosen topologies.

40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to confine light in a silica microfiber (MF) cavity using a lattice-constant-varying nanohole array. The MF cavity integrated with an optimally designed nanohole array produces Q-factors ~ 7 × 105 in the near infrared region while its mode volume remains ~ (λe) 3. Our MF cavity of enhanced performance will find potential applications in fiber lasers, nonlinear fiber optics, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), and cavity optomechanics. OCIS codes: (060. 2310) Fiber optics; (140. 3948) Microcavity devices; (140. 3945) Microcavities Research activities in microfibers (MFs) have continued to grow in recent years [1, 2]. Taking advantages of the unique, versatile properties of MFs, different approaches [3 - 6] have been theoretically proposed or experimentally demonstrated. A Fabry-Perot cavity or a slot resonator shows good light confinement yet suffers from low Q-factors (~ 101 - 102) [3]. On the other hand, knot and coil resonators [4 - 6] provide high Q-factors (~ 104 - 105), but their mode volumes are relatively large. Although smaller optical cavities have been implemented in high-Q MF resonators by incorporating phase-shifted Bragg gratings, the resulting Q-factors were low (~ 60) [7]. Here, we propose an MF optical cavity capable of achieving both very high-Q and small mode-volume. Results show that the Q-factor reaches 105 - 106 while the mode volume is kept close to a cube of the eigenwavelength (λe) 3. This approach {{could prove to be}} very useful for studies involving cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and cavity optomechanics as well as micro-/nano-scale material applications that would require strong light-matter-interactions.

40|$|Three major {{facilities}} {{have been proposed}} for the precision study of neutrino oscillation parameters, the Neutrino Factory, the Betabeam and the Superbeam. Of these, the Neutrino Factory offers high precision measurement of oscillation parameters [1]. The Neutrino Factory generates neutrinos by firing protons onto a target {{in order to produce}} pions. The pions decay to muons which are captured before being accelerated to 25 GeV and stored in racetrackshaped rings where they decay to neutrinos. In this note the pion decay channel, longitudinal drift, adiabatic buncher, phase rotation and ionisation cooling system that make up the Neutrino Factory muon front end are reviewed. THE NEUTRINO FACTORY The baseline design of the International Design Study (IDS) is shown in Figure 1. Proton bunches with RMS time spread in the range 1 - 3 ns from a 4 MW proton driver are fired at kinetic energies of 5 - 15 GeV onto a target where pions are produced. The intensity of the beam may be sufficient to destroy non-moving solid targets; moving solid or liquid targets are under investigation. Pions are captured in a 20 T solenoid which is tapered along the accelerator axis. Pions decay to muons with a large energy spread. The beam is transported through a long solenoid for an energy-time correlation to develop, the muons are bunched and then the energy spread reduced using phase rotation. The beam is subsequently cooled using ionisation cooling {{to increase the number of}} muons that are accepted by the accelerating system. The beam is then accelerated as fast as possible, to minimise decay losses, in a series of 3 linacs. In order to use equipment efficiently, the latter two linacs each have recirculators that return the beam for multiple passes through the same cavities. Next, a high acceptance Fixed Field Alternating Gradient machine (FFAG) is used to take the muons up to 25 GeV. Finally the muons are stored in a large aperture <b>racetrack-shaped</b> ring where the muons decay to neutrinos for study in the detector system.

40|$|We {{demonstrated}} that photonic micro-ring resonators {{can be used}} in micro-machined ultrasound microphones. This might cause a breakthrough in array transducers for ultrasonography; first because optical multiplexing allows array interrogation via one optical fiber and second because the silicon-on-insulator technology allows cost-effective fabrication. To understand this microphone, all of its components were studied: fundamental theory of the photonic resonators, experimental characteristics of the resonators, and the effect of a static deformation of the resonator. The most familiar use of ultrasound is observing unborn children but ultrasonography is widely used in medical and industrial applications. Today's clear ultrasonic images are made by digital focusing which requires an array of transducers that records the sound at a number of positions spaced less than a wavelength. Typical sound frequencies are 1 - 40 MHz with corresponding wavelengths of 0. 04 - 1. 5 mm in water. Conventional ultrasound transducers employ piezo-electric material to convert sound pressure to an electronic signal. An array requires individual fabrication, placement and wiring of these transducers. Last decades, micro-machined ultrasound transducers (MUTs) have received large interest. Array MUTs are fabricated and wired directly as a single silicon "chip". This micro-machining technology leverages the cost-effective wafer-scale CMOS technology that was developed by the semiconductor industry. A MUT consists of a flexible membrane that is sensitive to ultrasonic pressure waves, like a drumhead. The membrane deformation is most commonly measured by recording the electrical capacitance between the membrane and a fixed bottom plate. Unfortunately, these MUTs do not meet the sensitivity of piezo-electric transducers. Moreover, electrical transducers normally require a coaxial wire for each array element. The size of this wire bundle is, for example, problematic in medical intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS), where atherosclerosis is diagnosed from a high-resolution ultrasonograph of the artery wall that is obtained by catheter which is brought inside the blood vessel. We propose a new type of ultrasound microphone that consists of a silicon photonic micro-ring resonator integrated in the membrane of a MUT. Incident ultrasonic pressure waves deform the membrane and thus deform the resonator, thereby shifting its optical resonance frequencies. This shift is accurately recorded by an external interrogation system. Next to the resonators, it is possible to integrate tiny optical multiplexers on the same chip so that many resonators can be simultaneously interrogated via a single optical fiber. Moreover, the all-optical sensor {{can be used in}} MRI scanners. We proved the operation principle of this new ultrasound microphone. The designed, fabricated and characterized microphone consists of a photonic <b>racetrack-shaped</b> resonator (footprint 50 ?m by 10 ?m, height 0. 220 ?m) that is integrated in an acoustically resonant silicon-dioxide membrane (diameter 0. 124 mm, height 2. 5 ?m). Fabrication of the microphone demonstrated successful integration of silicon photonic circuits in silicon micro-mechanical systems. First the photonic circuit was fabricated in a semi-industrial CMOS line. Second the membrane was fabricated by etching a hole from the back-side of the wafer using a Bosch etch process. The photonic micro-ring resonator was interrogated using a laser and a photo-receiver, providing a minimal detectable wavelength shift of 36 fm. We measured an ultrasonic minimal detection level (noise equivalent pressure) below 1 Pa which is on the same order of magnitude as the state-of-the-art of PZT piezo-electric based transducers. The microphone showed an acoustical resonance around 0. 75 MHz with a - 6 dB bandwidth of 20 %. We only studied the most simple configuration of this microphone {{and there is a lot}} of room for improvement. The relation between a deformation of the micro-ring resonator and the shift in the resonance wavelengths was studied in a well-defined static mechanical setup. Depending on the width of the waveguide and the orientation of the silicon crystal, the linear wavelength shift per applied strain varies between 0. 5 and 0. 75 pm/microstrain for infrared light around 1550 nm wavelength. The influence of the increasing ring circumference is about three times larger than the influence of the change in the propagation speed of the light through the waveguide (effective index), and the two effects oppose each other. The strong dispersion in silicon sub-wavelength waveguides (400 nm by 220 nm) accounts for a decrease in sensitivity of about a factor two. The optical characteristics of the micro-ring resonators and their components were extensively studied. Different methods to characterize directional couplers (direct and in ring-resonators) gave similar results. An interesting observation was that directional couplers introduce a large coupling-induced phase delay when nearly all light couples from one waveguide to the other. Most properties of silicon ring resonators and their components can be computed using approximate analytical theories. Many theories on integrated optics were originally derived for low-index-contrast waveguides like optical fibers (?n < 0. 1). We reviewed and revised those theories for application to silicon-on-insulator waveguides which have a very high index contrast (?n ~ 2). This work is formulated such that it can be used in a university course with only basic theory of electrodynamics as prerequisite. Analytical theories provide insight and allow fast computation of the behavior of photonic devices and circuits. In conclusion, we studied silicon photonic micro-ring resonators and their application in mechanical sensing. Application of these sensors in micro-machined ultrasound transducers opens new opportunities for ultrasonic array technology. Department of Imaging PhysicsApplied Science...|$|E
