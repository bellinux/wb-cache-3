40|$|Because of the {{difficult}} plot of the corner near {{the church of the}} Brothers of Charity and the neighborhood almost functionalist hotel Austerlitz I considered as a basis of my idea to emphasize the corner by the main entrance. There is a mass of the building divided into 3 parts - the first floor respects the street line, the second floor is a overhanging and representative (most acts for passing people), the next four floors are receding again. The living function of these floors is emphasized by overhanging balconies. The dominant part is just the corner - two glass blocks above themselves point at high areas that are located {{in this part of the}} building (a wall climbing over 3 floors, a gallery with vegetation over 2 floors). In the first floor there is located a <b>restaurant</b> <b>and</b> <b>canteen</b> facilities, in the second floor except the other canteen appears also sport function – a hall for aerobics, table tennis hall and the mentioned area of the gym with climbing wall.

50|$|In {{the chaos}} {{created by the}} {{communist}} government during the wholesale nationalisation of industry and commerce Werner found a job in an enterprise newly created for building roads and railways. One of his tasks was to produce detailed descriptions of work done by technical staff, which placed him {{in the category of}} technical (rather than administrative) clerks and this became the designation of his occupation entered in his identity card. When a year later he had to begin his two-year military service, he was given only the most basic training and became, as a ‘technician’, the assistant of the regimental caretaker-cum-quartermaster (1952-54). (After the purge of ‘bourgeois’ officers, the newly commissioned substitutes of working-class origin needed, owing to their lack of competence, the unofficial but tolerated help of educated soldiers who for political reasons were not deemed fit for officer’s training. After his military service Werner did not get his previous job back, but was transferred, in a similar capacity, to the headquarters of the nationalised enterprise overseeing <b>restaurants</b> <b>and</b> <b>canteens.</b> A year later (1955) he lost even this job to a communist party member and after a short training period worked as a restaurant manager (1956-60).|$|E

40|$|In Brazil, and {{mainly in}} the State of Bahia, crude {{vegetable}} oils are widely used {{in the preparation of}} food.

There is also some use of castor oil, which is widely cultivated in the Sertão Region (within the State of Bahia), and widely applied in industry. This massive use in food preparation leads to a huge amount of waste oil of different types, which needs either to be properly disposed of, or recovered. At the Laboratorio Energia e Gas-LEN (Energy & Gas lab.) of the Universidade Federal da Bahia, a cycle of experiments were carried out to evaluate the recovery of waste oils for biodiesel production. The experiences were carried out on a laboratory scale and, in a semi-industrial pilot plant using waste oils of different qualities.

40|$|Environmental {{tobacco smoke}} (ETS) is {{recognized}} as a health hazard by environmental and public health authorities worldwide 1. Therefore, several countries have implemented legislation that prohibits smoking {{in the majority of}} public spaces. In Portugal, since 2008, legislation banned smoking in most restaurants and bars, but some except ions remained, namely in spaces where devices for ventilation and air extraction were installed. Nevertheless, whether those preventive measures are efficiently protecting the health of the workers that are continuously exposed to ETS at their workplaces is still an open question. To address this issue, a recent work by our group showed that ETS pollution was higher in Lisbon restaurants and bars where smoking is allowed, comparatively to smoke-free <b>restaurants</b> <b>and</b> <b>canteens</b> and also that workers were indeed internally exposed to ETS at their workplaces 2, 3. Major concerns with the workers ’ health originate from the carcinogenic effects of ETS (IARC Group 1 carcinogen 1). The use of biomarkers of early genetic damage for biomonitoring these workers can unravel genotoxic lesions that may be implicated in cancer development.

40|$|Abstract Background Norwalk-like viruses are {{the most}} common cause of {{gastroenteritis}} outbreaks and sporadic cases of vomiting and diarrhoea. In healthy individuals infection is often mild and short-lived but in debilitated patients infection can be severe. It is essential that the virus laboratory can offer a sensitive and specific test, delivered in a timely manner. Methods We have developed a nested reverse transcriptase PCR based on published primers against the RNA polymerase gene and after comparison with electronmicroscopy used the assay to investigate 31 outbreaks of gastroenteritis. These were in diverse situations including nursing homes, small district hospitals, large general hospitals, a ferry ship, hotels, <b>restaurants</b> <b>and</b> staff <b>canteens.</b> Results A positive diagnosis was made in 30 / 31 outbreaks investigated giving an overall outbreak positive detection rate of 97 %. At an individual patient level there was a positive diagnostic rate of 11. 5 % in a large hospital environment to 100 % in smaller outbreak situations. The average patient positive rate was 34 %. In addition we investigated 532 control faecal specimens from adults. Of these 530 were negative and 2 were repeatedly positive. Conclusions It is essential that insensitive electronmicroscopy is replaced with the more sensitive reverse transcription PCR assays. These tests should be made available "on call" at weekends and public holidays. It is also important that outbreaks of NLV infection are monitored using sensitive RT-PCR assays so that the laboratory information can be used in ascertaining the spread and duration of the outbreak</p...|$|R

40|$|Separate {{collection}} of biowaste represents in Portugal only 2 % of total collected biowaste. Even though higher quality compost {{can be obtained}} through the separate {{collection of}} biowaste, this is generally regarded as more expensive and discarded as an option. In this work we assessed the viability of implementing the separate collection of biowaste targeting <b>restaurants</b> <b>and</b> <b>canteens</b> in city centers, using Aveiro as a case study. The current situation (no separate collection for biowaste) was compared with an alternative scenario in which biowaste was separately collected and valorized. The costs, constrains and the producers' attitude towards such a collection scheme are presented and discussed. On average 0. 46 kg of biowaste were produced per meal served. The acceptance of separate biowaste collection was high (67 %) among producers, {{and it could be}} increased further through informative campaigns and economic incentives such as pay-as-you-throw tariffs. Door-to-door collection of biowaste could reduce the cost per ton as much as 37 %, when compared to collection as unsorted waste. The major constrains for the implementation of separate collection of biowaste were the selection of alternative legal destinations to the MBT unit (which has the exclusivity to treat collected waste) and the lack of dedicated infrastructures at multimunicipal waste management facilities to handle separately collected biowaste...|$|E
40|$|Norovirus (NoV) {{gastroenteritis}} outbreaks appear {{frequently in}} food service operations (FSOs), {{such as in}} <b>restaurants</b> <b>and</b> <b>canteens.</b> In this study the presence of NoV and adenovirus (AdV) genomes was investigated on the surfaces of premises, especially in kitchens, of 30 FSOs where foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks were suspected. The objective was to establish a possible association between the presence of virus genomes on surfaces and a visual hygienic status of the FSOs. NoV genome was found in 11 and AdV genome in 8 out of 30 FSOs. In total, 291 swabs were taken, of which 8. 9 % contained NoV and 5. 8 % AdV genome. The presence of NoV genomes on the surfaces was not found to associate with lower hygiene level of the premises when based on visual inspection; most (7 / 9) of the FSOs with NoV contamination on surfaces and a completed evaluation form had a good hygiene level (the best category). Restaurants had a significantly lower proportion of NoV-positive swabs compared to other FSOs (canteens, cafeteria, schools etc.) taken together (p = 0. 00014). The presence of a designated break room for the workers {{was found to be}} significantly more common in AdV-negative kitchens (p = 0. 046). Our findings suggest that swabbing is necessary for revealing viral contamination of surfaces and emphasis of hygiene inspections should be on the food handling procedures, and the education of food workers on virus transmission...|$|E

40|$|This article {{constitutes}} a state-of-the-art {{review of the}} literature on the effects of expectations on the sensory perception of food and drink by humans. In the ‘Introduction’, we summarize the theoretical models of expectations that have been put forward. In the ‘Empirical research utilizing direct methods’ section, we describe the influence that expectations created by a variety of product extrinsic cues have on sensory perception, hedonic appraisal, and intake/consumption. We critically evaluate the evidence that has emerged from both laboratory studies and real-world research conducted in the setting of the <b>restaurant,</b> <b>canteen,</b> <b>and</b> bar. This literature review is focused primarily on those studies that have demonstrated an effect on tasting. Crucially, this review goes beyond previous work in the area by highlighting the relevant cognitive neuroscience literature (see the section ‘Applied research through the lens of cognitive neuroscience methods’) and the postulated psychological mechanisms of expectation in terms of recent accounts of predictive coding and Bayesian decision theory (see the ‘Predictive coding and expectations’ section) ...|$|R

50|$|The Housing Act 1949 was a British Act of Parliament {{which enabled}} local {{authorities}} to acquire homes for improvement or conversion with 75% Exchequer grants. It also bestowed upon local authorities {{a wide range}} of useful powers, such as to provide <b>restaurants</b> or <b>canteens</b> <b>and</b> laundry facilities for tenants of municipal flats and housing estates, and to sell furniture to them. The legislation also removed the restriction imposed upon local authorities by previous pieces of housing legislation which limited them to providing housing for working-class people only. The aim of this change was to allow local authorities to develop mixed estates of houses of more varied types and sizes, thereby attracting all income groups. In addition, housing improvement grants for private landlords and owner occupiers were introduced under the Act. According to Norman Ginsburg, this piece of legislation was the first example of a “welfarist” policy in respect of owner occupiers, as local authorities were to direct these grants towards bringing properties up to a sixteen-point standard.|$|R
40|$|This {{concept paper}} {{summarizes}} key “hotspots” for waste generation along {{the food supply}} chain and identifies a range of existing solutions/measures that can help producers, retailers and consumers {{reduce the amount of}} food that is wasted. The majority of food waste of 71 – 92 kg/head/year in Western Europe was found to originate from private households (61 %), followed by <b>restaurants</b> <b>and</b> <b>canteens</b> (17 %) and then supermarkets (5 %); 59 %– 65 % (of this food waste (71 – 92 kg) can be avoided and 54 % thereof are fruit and vegetables. Since ethylene accelerates fruit ripening and its accumulation can lead to fruit decay and waste and new portable instruments now enable continuous in-situ determination of ethylene along the food chain, there is a possible key to reducing food waste of perishable, fresh produce. Hence, suggested countermeasures at the field level are use of ethylene inhibitors (AVG as “Retain” or MCP as “Harvista”), the former prevents pre-mature fruit drop in pome fruit, incentives for processing fruit of industrial grade and whole crop purchase (“WCP”). Along the supply chain, applications of ethylene inhibitors (e. g., 1 -MCP as “SmartFresh”) absorber strips (e. g., “It’s Fresh”, Sensitech), bags (e. g., “Peakfresh”) as well as simply cooling and venting, and shading to avoid sun exposure. Countermeasures also include superstores no longer promoting multi-packs, e. g., “two strawberry punnets for the price of one”, abandon the “Display until” or “Sell by” date, conservative consumer shopping behavior, and sale of class II produce (“Wunderlinge” in Billa or “Kleine Äpfel” in REWE, “Ünique” in Coop), collection (rather than wasting) of perishable food by volunteers (“Die Tafel”), or “Food Sharing” of private household left-over perishable on social media, or any combination of the above to aid reducing fresh produce waste...|$|E
40|$|By {{the end of}} this century, global food {{production}} must increase by 70 per cent to feed the world’s growing population. Currently, we waste one-third of all food produced for human consumption. This is major problem, affecting not only the environment, but also labour in the food value chain, waste management services, commodity prices, and global food security. If no action is taken, the current problem of food waste can soon develop into a global tragedy. High income levels and lack of knowledge among people living in Western Europe has created an affluent society, where access to food is regarded as inexhaustible. To address this issue, we chose to target food waste in food service industry. A sample of 45 Western European food service business were analysed to identify emerging food waste-reducing business practices and the benefits that follow adoption of such practices. The sample consisted of <b>restaurants,</b> hotels <b>and</b> <b>canteens</b> that do an exceptionally good effort in reducing food waste as well as other food waste experts. After conducting several in-depth interviews and thorough online research, we created The Food Waste Fighter’s Toolbox –a guide and inspiration for the food service industry to learn about and select business practices that suit their individual business. Presented in a business model perspective, these practices are easy to adopt, as leaders can focus their attention to specific parts of the business. To further simplify implementation, each practice is labelled according to requirements needed, and to the effectiveness of the practices. In addition, we present reported monetary and non-monetary benefits. We offer practical recommendations on how operators can reduce food waste that can possibly lead to increased profit, improved reputation and quality, as well as reduced environmental externalities. Hereby, our thesis contributes to the nearly non-existing literature of measures to fight food waste in the foodservice industry, and contribute in fighting a global problem that the Western world has yet to see the consequences of...|$|R
