5|$|At 13.5degrees of elevation, the 30.5cm gun {{could hit}} targets out to 16,200m (17,717yards) with armor-piercing shells. After the turrets were {{improved}} to allow elevation to 16degrees, the <b>range</b> correspondingly increased to 20,400m (22,310yd). At a <b>range</b> of 12,800m (14,000yd), the L3 armor-piercing shells {{fired by the}} gun were expected to penetrate 254mm (10in) of armor plate. At 15,000m (16,000yd) {{the effectiveness of the}} shell decreased; it was able to pierce 229mm (9in)-thick plate. The <b>range</b> of the World War II guns was significantly greater than the guns used in World War I. With the 405kg shell at 45degrees, the guns had a maximum <b>range</b> of 32,000m (35,000yd).
