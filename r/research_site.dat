5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military <b>research</b> <b>site</b> in Syria that had not been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E

40|$|Recently, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) {{technology}} has been developed rapidly. UAV allows engineers to use remote sensing at lower cost than satellite images or aerial photos. The expansion of business for UAV is expected. However, UAV can take photos in local areas, not the global area. Then the authors covered areas without pictures by UAV using aerial photograph from aircrafts. The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify possibilities for remote sensing with three types of photography (aerial photographs, panoramic photographs, and UAV photographs) and to monitor vegetation covers. The data were processed through five main steps: (1) to obtain aerial photographs in <b>research</b> <b>sites</b> from Geographical Survey Institute, (2) to take pictures with digital camera in 360 degrees in <b>research</b> <b>sites,</b> (3) to flow UAV with two filters, IR 72 and IR 90 in <b>research</b> <b>sites,</b> (4) to construct a 3 D model in <b>research</b> <b>sites</b> with PhotoScan, and (5) to analyze vegetation covers with GIS...|$|R

The museum also operates the Val Verde County <b>research</b> <b>site</b> and the Lubbock Lake Landmark, an archaeological site and natural history preserve in the city of Lubbock. The site has evidence of 12,000years of use by ancient cultures on the Llano Estacado (Southern High Plains), and allows visitors to watch active archaeological digs. Visiting scientists and tourists may also participate in the discovery process. Lubbock Lake Landmark is a National Historic Landmark, which lists it on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a designated State Archaeological Landmark. Texas Tech is also the location of the Southwest Collection of historical archives and the sponsoring institution of the West Texas Historical Association.|$|E
