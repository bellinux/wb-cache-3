5|$|Historian Michael Crawford {{attributes}} {{the disappearance of}} much of Tiberius Gracchus' support to the <b>reduced</b> <b>level</b> of citizen participation due to dispersal far from Rome, and sees his tribunate as marking {{a step in the}} Hellenization of Roman aristocracy. Crawford asserts that Gaius Gracchus' extortion law shifted {{the balance of power in}} Rome and that the Gracchi made available a new political armoury which the oligarchy subsequently sought to exploit.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD 1) is an ER {{resident}} enzyme {{introducing a}} double-bond in saturated fatty acids. Global knockout of SCD 1 in mouse increases fatty acid oxidation and insulin sensitivity {{which makes the}} animal resistant to diet-induced obesity. Inhibition of SCD 1 has therefore been proposed as a potential therapy of the metabolic syndrome. Much of the work has focused on insulin target tissue and very {{little is known about}} how <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> of SCD 1 would affect the insulin-producing β-cell, however. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to investigate how <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> of SCD 1 affect the β-cell. Results Insulin-secreting MIN 6 cells with <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> of SCD 1 were established by siRNA mediated knockdown. When fatty acid oxidation was measured, no difference between cells with <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> of SCD 1 and mock-transfected cells were found. Also, <b>reducing</b> <b>levels</b> of SCD 1 did not affect insulin secretion in response to glucose. To investigate how SCD 1 knockdown affected cellular mechanisms, differentially regulated proteins were identified by a proteomic approach. Cells with <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> of SCD 1 had higher levels of ER chaperones and components of the proteasome. The higher amounts did not protect the β-cell from palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis. Instead, rise in levels of p-eIF 2 α and CHOP after palmitate exposure was 2 -fold higher in cells with <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> of SCD 1 compared to mock-transfected cells. Accordingly, apoptosis rose to higher levels after exposure to palmitate in cells with <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> of SCD 1 compared to mock-transfected cells. Conclusions In conclusion, <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> of SCD 1 augment palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis in the β-cell, which is an important caveat when considering targeting this enzyme as a treatment of the metabolic syndrome. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{training}} of B-29 aircrews and {{the testing of}} prototype atom bombs was the last major contribution of Wendover Field during World War II. After war's end, some crew training continued, but at a <b>reduced</b> <b>level.</b> For a while, B-29s which had returned from the Marianas were flown to Wendover for storage. In the summer of 1946, the Ogden Air Technical Service Command at Hill Army Air Field north of Salt Lake City assumed jurisdiction over all operations at Wendover Field except engineering and technical projects.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the plague it was at a much <b>reduced</b> <b>level</b> and many stalls were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E

5|$|Quiriguá {{apparently}} {{retained its}} independence from Copán and continued to flourish {{until the beginning of}} the 9th century. Relations between the two cities had improved somewhat by 810, when king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat of Copán visited Quiriguá in order to carry out a k'atun-ending ritual. However, 810 was also the year when the last hieroglyphic texts were raised at Quiriguá, although a <b>reduced</b> <b>level</b> of construction continued in the city centre. After this, Quiriguá falls into silence, engulfed by the greater phenomenon of the Classic Maya collapse– it had lost its reason for existence when trade no longer flowed along the Motagua; within a few years Quiriguá was all but deserted and sites throughout the Motagua Valley suffered severe decline or abandonment.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} phase occurs next, with resorption of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream. This usually lasts {{two to three}} days. The improvement is often striking, and can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate. Another rash may occur with either a maculopapular or a vasculitic appearance, which is followed by peeling of the skin. During this stage, a fluid overload state may occur; if it affects the brain, it may cause a <b>reduced</b> <b>level</b> of consciousness or seizures. A feeling of fatigue may last for weeks in adults.|$|E
5|$|This {{marked the}} end of Smith's front-line {{political}} career—Gerald Smith (no relation) replaced him as leader of the CAZ—but he remained active in opposition at a <b>reduced</b> <b>level.</b> In July 1992 he chaired a meeting where the CAZ, Muzorewa's UANC, Sithole's ZANU–Ndonga party and Edgar Tekere's Zimbabwe Unity Movement formed a coalition to challenge Mugabe and ZANU–PF in the next parliamentary election. The result was the short-lived United Front, which Smith agreed to chair, saying he had no more political ambitions and could therefore be regarded as a neutral figurehead. The United Front quickly failed, largely {{due to the lack of}} common ground between the constituent parties, and never contested an election. Another brief collaboration between Smith, Muzorewa and Sithole in March 2000 also led to nothing.|$|E

In general, pigs fed <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> of trace minerals excreted less Cu and Zn. The same can be said for pigs fed organic trace minerals. Organic trace minerals can be supplemented in place of inorganic forms to reduce fecal mineral concentrations. Both organic and inorganic trace minerals can be fed at <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> to decrease fecal trace mineral concentrations without adversely affecting growth, feed efficiency, and carcass characteristics. However, under increased levels of stress, mineral deficiency symptoms may occur more frequently in pigs fed <b>reduced</b> <b>levels</b> of trace minerals...|$|R
5|$|As a whole, {{interest}} in the war memorials diminished considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, reflected in a <b>reduced</b> <b>level</b> of ceremonies and a simplification of the commemorative events around memorials. In the post-war years, for example, the separate official and veterans ceremonies at the Verdun memorials blended into one; in 1956, German and French ceremonies were also united into a single event. Attendance at events like Anzac Day diminished. Many memorials slowly deteriorated: {{in some cases the}} original inter-war funding had never included maintenance, in other cases the materials used to construct the memorials were not durable. In some towns and cities, the memorials were moved to less prominent locations as part of urban renewal projects, or hidden by new buildings. World War I memorials were commonplace in many countries and were paid little attention.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{remained}} largely inactive in Philadelphia {{for the next}} three years. On 22 January 1917, she became a receiving ship for naval recruits. Alabama was transferred to the southern Chesapeake to begin training recruits in the middle of March. Shortly thereafter, on 6 April, the United States declared war on Germany. Two days later, Alabama became the flagship of the 1st Division, Atlantic Fleet, {{and for the rest of}} the war she continued her training mission of the east coast of the United States. During this period, she made one cruise to the Gulf of Mexico from late June to early July 1918. On 11 November, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe; Alabama continued training naval recruits, though at a <b>reduced</b> <b>level</b> of intensity. She took part in fleet maneuvers in February and March 1919 in the West Indies before returning to Philadelphia in April for repairs. A summer training cruise for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy followed; Alabama departed Philadelphia on 28 May bound for Annapolis, where she arrived the next day. After taking on a contingent of 184 midshipmen, she steamed out of Annapolis on 9 June. The cruise went to the West Indies and passed through the Panama Canal and back. By mid-July, the ship was cruising off the coast of New England. She returned south in August for maneuvers, and at the end of the month she returned the midshipmen to Annapolis before docking in Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{one-on-one}} {{channels of communication}} grows more rapidly {{than the number of}} workers, thus increasing the time and costs of communication. At some point one-on-one communications between all workers becomes impractical; therefore only certain groups of employees will communicate with one another (e.g. within departments or within geographical locations).
