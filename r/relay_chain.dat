40|$|Abstract—An {{important}} use of unmanned aerial vehicles is {{surveillance of}} distant targets, where sensor information must quickly be transmitted {{back to a}} base station. In many cases, high uninterrupted bandwidth requires line-of-sight between sender and transmitter to minimize quality degradation. Communication range is typically limited, especially when smaller UAVs are used. Both problems can be solved to creating <b>relay</b> <b>chains</b> for surveillance of a single target, and relay trees for simultaneous surveillance of multiple targets. In this paper we show how such chains and trees can be calculated. For <b>relay</b> <b>chains</b> we create a set of chains offering different trade-offs {{between the number of}} UAVs in the chain and the chain’s cost. We also show new results on how relay trees can be quickly calculated and then incrementally improved if necessary. Encouraging empirical results for improvement of relay trees are presented.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{a forward}} {{decoding}} procedure is {{developed for the}} compress-and-forward (CF) relaying scheme. This procedure uses a layered framework {{and is based on}} exploiting a feature of the N-to- 1 mapping inherent in the underlying Wyner-Ziv binning. It is shown that exploiting this mapping enables the relaxation of the constraint on the rate of the relay codewords representing the bin indices. For the cooperative multimessage network, the proposed procedure achieves the same rate region as the short-message noisy network coding (SNNC) scheme. However, this procedure is more advantageous for other networks including the two networks presented herein. The first network is a <b>relay</b> <b>chain</b> one with two destinations, whereas the second network is a partially cooperative multimessage one with three destinations. In both networks, side information is available to a subset of the decoding nodes, but not {{to the rest of the}} nodes, and in both cases, the network benefits from the relaxation of the rate of the CF bin indices. This relaxation results in rate regions larger than those achieved by conventional CF and SNNC.

40|$|When {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{are used}} to survey distant targets, {{it is important to}} transmit sensor information back to a base station. As this communication often requires high uninterrupted bandwidth, the surveying UAV often needs a free line-of-sight to the base station, which can be problematic in urban or mountainous areas. Communication ranges may also be limited, especially for smaller UAVs. Though both problems can be solved through the use of relay chains consisting of one or more intermediate relay UAVs, this leads to a new problem: Where should relays be placed for optimum performance? We present two new algorithms capable of generating such relay chains, one being a dual ascent algorithm and the other a modification of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. As the priorities between the number of hops in the <b>relay</b> <b>chain</b> and the cost of the chain may vary, we calculate chains of different lengths and costs and let the ground operator choose between them.

40|$|Surveillance is an {{important}} application for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The sensed information often has high priority {{and it must be}} made available to human operators as quickly as possible.

In this case, other UAVs can form a <b>relay</b> <b>chain</b> between the surveillance UAV and the base station. Determining suitable positions for such UAVs is a complex optimization problem in and of itself, and is made even more difficult by communication and surveillance constraints. To solve different variations of finding positions for UAVs for surveillance of one target, two new algorithms have been developed. One of the algorithms is developed especially for finding a set of relay chains offering different trade-offs between the number of UAVs {{and the quality of the}} chain. The other algorithm is tailored towards finding the highest quality chain possible, given a limited number of available UAVs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the Relay Chain: a new {{algorithm}} central to a novel strategy for exploring underwater envi-ronments using {{a swarm of}} autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The <b>Relay</b> <b>Chain</b> provides a mobile, scalable and dynamic communication link between the water’s surface and a shoal of AUVs exploring the sea bed. The chain tracks the shoal as it explores, recruiting and returning AUVs from and to the shoal to modulate {{the length of the}} chain as re-quired. The chain can instruct the shoal to reverse course when it travels too far from the starting point and there are no further AUVs to recruit. Given the challenging underwa-ter environment, chain breakages are however inevitable, and as such we consider a number of recovery strategies to ad-dress chain breakages and minimise the time for which mes-sages destined to the surface from the shoal are delayed. A simple ‘turn and search ’ strategy is contrasted with strategies that depend on absolute positioning systems of varying accu-racy. Implementing underwater absolute positioning systems is challenging, and our results highlight how accurate such a system must be to outperform more naive strategies, and hence be considered a worthwhile investment. We find the accuracy must be within 20 cm, being 40 % of AUV sensor range...|$|E

40|$|We use quantum {{chemical}} calculations {{to elucidate}} a viable homogeneous mechanism for pyridine-catalyzed reduction of CO 2 to methanol. In the first {{component of the}} catalytic cycle, pyridine (Py) undergoes a H+ transfer (PT) to form pyridinium (PyH+) followed by an e- transfer (ET) to produce pyridinium radical (PyH 0). Examples of systems to effect this ET to populate the LUMO of PyH+(E 0 calc ~ - 1. 3 V vs. SCE) to form the solution phase PyH 0 via highly reducing electrons include the photo-electrochemical p-GaP system (ECBM ~ - 1. 5 V vs. SCE at pH= 5) and the photochemical [Ru(phen) 3] 2 +/ascorbate system. We predict that PyH 0 undergoes further PT-ET steps to form the key closed-shell, dearomatized 1, 2 -dihydropyridine (PyH 2) species. Our proposed sequential PT-ET-PT-ET mechanism transforming Py into PyH 2 {{is consistent with the}} mechanism described in the formation of related dihydropyridines. Because it is driven by its proclivity to regain aromaticity, PyH 2 is a potent recyclable organo-hydride donor that mimics the role of NADPH in the formation of C-H bonds in the photosynthetic CO 2 reduction process. In particular, in the second component of the catalytic cycle, we predict that the PyH 2 /Py redox couple is kinetically and thermodynamically competent in catalytically effecting hydride and proton transfers (the latter often mediated by a proton <b>relay</b> <b>chain)</b> to CO 2 and its two succeeding intermediates, namely formic acid and formaldehyde, to ultimately form CH 3 OH.

40|$|In this thesis, {{studies on}} the enzyme isocitrate {{dehydrogenase}} (IDH) from the hyperthermophiles Aeropyrum pernix (ApIDH), Thermotoga maritima (TmIDH), Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AfIDH) and Pyrococcus furiosus (PfIDH) are presented. The aim of the described work was {{to contribute to the}} understanding of protein thermostability and to study the catalytic mechanism. Hyperthermophilic organisms thrive at temperatures ranging from WC to about 120 degress C. The three-dimensional structures of their enzymes are usually very similar to their counterparts in mesophilic organisms which optimally grow at 20 - 50 degrees C. Their similarity suggests that they are evolutionary related. However, the hyperthermostable enzymes must have specific properties which are distinct from those of the mesophilic homologues in order to avoid thermal denaturation. These properties are most likely determined by optimization of the weak forces by which proteins are stabilized. IDH is an enzyme in the citric-acid cycle and is widely distributed in the three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. It catalyzes the metal-dependent dehydrogenation and decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate and C 02 using NAD+ or NADP+ as cofactor. It was found that ApIDH was most thermostable, with an apparent melting temperature of 109. 9 degrees C, whereas that of TmIDH, AfIDH and PfIDH was 98. 3 degrees C, 98. 5 degrees C and 103. 7 degrees C, respectively. The crystal structures of the apo-forms of ApIDH, TmIDH and AfIDH were determined. The structures indicated that the enzymes are homodimers and homologous to their mesophilic counterparts. In addition, the crystal structure of a ternary complex of ApIDH with NADP+, Ca 2 + and isocitrate was determined. It was suggested that large domain movements and a proton <b>relay</b> <b>chain</b> might be essential for the catalytic reaction of IDH. The structures were compared to their mesophilic homologues and combined with mutational studies in order to reveal determinants for their increased thermostability. The major findings were that ApIDH is stabilized by a disulfide bond at the N-terminus, a seven-membered ionic network and most likely by a higher total number of ion pairs; TmIDH is stabilized by long-range electrostatic interactions at the N- and C-termini, aromatic clustering, a higher total number of ion pairs and more inter-subunit ion pairs; AfIDH is stabilized through aromatic interactions at the Nterminus, inter-domain ionic networks and inter-domain aromatic clustering. In solution, ApIDH was found to be monomeric at pH 3. 0 and dimeric at pH 7. 5. Equilibrium unfolding characteristics and kinetic stability of ApIDH were investigated by spectroscopic methods. Although the ApIDH monomer contains three domains, the unfolding transition was reversible and could be approximated by a two-state process. The mutant R 211 M, which disrupts the seven-membered ionic network, was compared to the recombinant wildtype form. The apparent thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the mutant was significantly reduced and it was concluded that ionic networks contribute to the kinetic barriers that prevent unfolding of proteins from hyperthermophiles...|$|E

40|$|A growing {{interest}} for making high resolution observations {{in the upper}} troposphere and lower stratosphere has motivated {{the development of the}} multi-beam satellite-borne instrument Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange And climate Monitor Radiometer (STEAMR). The measurements made by STEAMR will be used to monitor trace-gases and link the occurence of these to the Earth's climate by accurate modeling of the atmosphere. To interpret the measured data require a firm understanding of the coupling between the radiation emitted from the atmosphere to the signal being received by the instrument's optical system. Thus, precise knowledge of the instrument's optical performance while in orbit is crucial. This thesis is dedicated to the study of optical analysis and measurements of the highly advanced optical system of the STEAMR instrument. A mechanical tolerance analysis of the complete optical system consisting of two polarisation separated focal plane arrays, a four reflector anastigmatic <b>relay</b> optics <b>chain</b> and an off-axis Ritchey-Chretien telescope was performed. Using Monte-Carlo simulations in combination with ray-tracing and physical optics/physical theory of diffraction, it could be concluded that the overall reflector alignment accuracy from manufacturing should be better than 100 µm. Surface distortion analyses of the 1. 6 m × 0. 8 m primary reflector highlighted the need for an optical system with high stability in orbit (< 30 µm).

40|$|The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) added {{public key}} {{cryptography}} to the DNS, but problems remain in selecting signature lifetimes. A zone’s master server distributes signatures to secondary servers. The signatures lifetimes should be long so that a secondary server can still operate if the master fails. However, DNSSEC lacks revocation. Signed data can be replayed until the signature expires and thus zones should select a short signature lifetime. Operators must choose between reduced robustness or long replay vulnerability windows. This paper introduces a revised DNSSEC signature that allows secondary servers to operate even if the master has failed while simultaneously limiting replay windows to twice the TTL. Each secondary server constructs a hash <b>chain</b> and <b>relays</b> the hash <b>chain</b> anchor to the master server.

We exchanged relay domain regions (encoded by alternative versions of exon 9) between an embryonic (EMB) isoform and the indirect flight muscle isoform (IFI) of myosin. Previously, we observed no effect of exchanging the EMB relay domain region into the flight muscle isoform (IFI- 9 b) on in vitro actin motility velocity or solution ATPase measurements compared to IFI. However, in indirect flight muscle fibers, IFI- 9 b exhibited decreased maximum power generation (Pmax) and optimal frequency of power generation (fmax) to 70 % and 83 % of IFI fiber values. The decrease in muscle performance reduced the flight ability and wing-beat frequency of IFI- 9 b Drosophila compared to IFI Drosophila. Previously, we found that exchanging the flight muscle specific relay domain into the EMB isoform (EMB- 9 a) prevented actin movement in the in vitro motility assay compared to EMB, which does support actin movement. However, in indirect flight muscle fibers EMB- 9 a was a highly effective motor, increasing Pmax and fmax 2. 5 -fold and 1. 4 -fold, respectively, compared to fibers expressing EMB. We propose that the oscillatory load EMB- 9 a experiences in the muscle fiber reduces a high activation energy barrier between two strongly bound states of the cross-bridge cycle, thereby promoting cross-bridge cycling.

40|$|Object {{positioning}} is {{an important}} research which has been applied in many application areas for decades. Usually, a number of spatially separated observers capture a set of range or angle based measurements, and then estimate the object location based on the measurements. The problem is not trivial {{because of the high}} non-linearity between the measurements and the object position. The performance of a localization system mainly depends on two factors. One is the measurement type and the other is the estimator which explores the non-linear measurement equations to estimate the object position. This research investigates the positioning techniques from these two aspects. First, we analyze the localization performance of the common positioning approaches, such as time of arrivals (TOA), time differences of arrival (TDOA) and angle of arrivals (AOA). We theoretically derive the biases of their Maximum Likelihood (ML) object location estimates resulted from the Gaussian measurement noise and observer position errors. The derived formulas show that the two types of errors contribute inter-related bias components unless they are independent and identically distributed (IID). The bias behaviors of the three positioning approaches are contrasted and the geometric conditions under which the location bias becomes zero are elaborated. The effectiveness of the developed results for bias compensation in improving the performance of object tracking is illustrated. The study is then extended to elliptic positioning, which is recently received attentions because of its asynchronous operation capability. We characterize its performance with respect to TDOA based on the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) and the bias of the ML object location estimate under Gaussian measurement noise as well as transmitter and observer position errors. When the observer positions are controllable, we derive its optimum observer placement to improve the localization accuracy. Its performance study is demonstrated by simulation. Second, we propose efficient solutions for three challenging positioning problems. The basic idea is to use parameter transformation and multi-stage processing to convert the original non-linear estimation problem into multiple sequential linear estimation problems. One example is the joint localization and synchronization problem in a wireless sensor network (WSN) when Gaussian beacon position and clock uncertainties are present. Two computationally efficient closed-form algorithms are developed to explore the time stamp information from message exchanges within the WSN. One is for the case without message exchanges among the sensor nodes and the other is with the exchanges. The proposed algorithms are proved by theoretical analysis and simulations to reach the CRLB accuracy for the sensor node positions and the clock parameters over the mild error region. The second problem addressed is the multi-static sonar localization when the uncertainties in the signal propagation speed and the transmitter and receiver positions are present. The proposed efficient algorithms for this problem obtains the hybrid CRLB over the mild error region as shown by the analysis and simulation. The last problem is for object localization in the relay network. Comparing to traditional problems, additional ambiguity exists because the measurements are collected along time without the knowledge of their corresponding <b>relays.</b> A Markov <b>Chain</b> Monte Carlo method, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, is applied to solve the measurement association problem to avoid the high computation burden in the traditional brute-force method. The ML object location estimate is iteratively obtained by the alternating minimization principle. The proposed method has shown good performance under the mild noise level in the simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{lithium lens}} in the {{antiproton}} source target vault {{is protected by}} an interlock system, which is located in relay racks R 5 and R 6 near {{the southwest corner of}} the Target Hall (building APO). The interlock system consists of crates of commercial signal conditioner and alarm modules built by Acromag, Inc and interlock Master Modules built by Fermilab: Twenty analog signals from the lens/transformer, power supply, and cooling water system are buffered with signal conditioners (amplifiers), which are located in creates R 5 C and R 5 E. The signals and conditioner assignments are listed in Table 1. Interconnection details are shown in Figure 1. Thermocouple signals come into the conditioners directly from the vault or water system via 12 -pair multiconductor thermocouple extension cables. All other signals pass through a master connection panel on the east end of rack R 6. Water flow signals are AC voltages which must be converted by electronics in crate D 2 B to DC voltages before entering their signal conditioners. Each conditioner drives two parallel outputs. One output goes to a Multiplexed Analog to Digital Converter (MADC 25), which is located in R 5 D. This voltage output is read by the accelerator control network (ACNET) and can be displayed at any control console on parameter page P 46. The other voltage output is connected to an alarm module. Thirteen analog signals are processed by alarm modules, which are located in crates R 6 B and R 6 C. Alarm connection details are shown in Figure 2. Each alarm module contains two DPDT relays, one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit. The relays are latching, so that once an input has passed outside a limit, that limit relay remains in the tripped condition until an operator issues a reset pulse. The reset may be generated locally with a pushbutton on the appropriate interlock master module or remotely from controls parameter page P 46 via ACNET. Alarm settings are summarized in engineering units in Table 1, and actual comparitor voltage settings are listed in Figure 2. Each alarm crate contains 10 module slots and is wired as shown in Figure 3, except for the water conductivity slot, which is wired to a separate interlock chain output. Normally open contacts are used for interlock chains, while normally closed contacts provide status bits. The interlock chain outputs are connected to Interlock Master Modules located in D 5 C. Status bits are read into ACNET through a multiplexer in R 4 A, and can be displayed on parameter page S 40. Any alarm slot may be bypassed by inserting a 'dummy' printed circuit card in place of a module. Each interlock master module sums 5 inputs and provides 3 reed relay contact closure outputs. A circuit schematic is shown in Figure 4. Input 1 requires + 5 volts, and directly energizes an interlock <b>chain</b> <b>relay.</b> Input 2 and 3 require TTL logic levels, and inputs 4 and 5 require and external contact closure. Internal switches select which inputs are active Interlock master interconnections are shown in Figure 5. The lens uses two masters, one for water conductivity and the other for all interlocked conditions. The Conductivity Master controls the lens water purging system and also energizes one input of the General Master. The General Master provides the external interlock for the pulsed power supply. If lithium comes into contact with the cooling water, the conductivity master will trip. Output 2 of the Master shuts off the water circulating pump and initiates purging hardware, which isolates the lens from the water supply and allows inert gas to force remaining water from the lens into a reservoir located in the vault. Output 1 of the Master, which is connected to input 4 of the lens General Master, causes the General Master to trip and disable the pulsed power supply. All other lens alarm conditions (except conductivity) enter input 1 and 2 of the Lens General Master. An alarm condition from these inputs will disable the pulsed power supply, but the water system will remain on. Each interlock master has a manual Emergency Stop pushbutton (red) on its front panel. The pushbutton has alternating action, one push enabling the interlock master, the next push opening the interlock chain. all interlock masters are connected to an audible trip alarm module located in R 5 E- 6...|$|R
