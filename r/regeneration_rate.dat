40|$|Ammonium uptake and <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> were {{measured}} in time course experiments with 15 N as a tracer. Both ammonium uptake and <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> measured over 12 to 18 h remained essentially constant. However, as {{the length of}} the incubations increased the amount of usable data decreased dramatically due to substrate depletion and recycling of 15 N. Mass balance calculations indicated that 22 to 51 % of the ammonium removed from the dissolved pool was not recovered in the particulate fraction. This appeared to be a more serious problem at 0 and 8 m (47 %) than at 25 m (22 %). As a result, ammonium uptake rates were probably underestimated. At 0, 12, and 20 m uptake rates either balanced or exceeded <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates,</b> while at 8 and 25 m net regeneration occurred. The fastest rates {{were measured}} during upwelling-induced phytoplankton blooms, intermediate rates characterized post-bloom conditions and the lowest rates coincided with an active upwelling event.

Mussel farming also caused considerable nutrient regeneration within the water column with the mussel ropes contributing ~ 25 % of total inorganic N and P production and at times dominating the sediments (e. g. 95 % of SRP production in summer and 45 % of DIN production in winter).

Chlorophyll concentrations up to 30 g L 1 were {{highest in the}} low- and mid-salinity regions (salinities 8. 5 – 28. 2) and comparable to records of other years but extended over smaller areas than during periods of normal river flow. Bacterial biomass (5. 1 – 28. 3 g C L 1) was {{at the low end}} of the range observed in normal flow years, decreased with distance from the river mouth and did not peak with chlorophyll. Heterotrophic nanoflagellate abundance (1. 4 – 4. 0 g C L 1) did not reflect phytoplankton and bacterial spatial distribution but peaked at 9. 2 g C L 1 at salinity 8. 5. Microbial NH 4 <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated by 15 NH 4 + isotope dilution experiments for the whole microbial community, under light and dark conditions, and for the < 2 m bacterium-dominated size fraction. Microbial NH 4 + <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> (0. 018 – 0. 124 mol N L 1 h 1) were low relative to previous reports and peaked at salinity 28. Total NH 4 + <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> were higher than those in the < 2 m size fraction at only four stations, suggesting that bacterial mineralization was a significant component of NH 4 + recycling in some parts of the river plume.

40|$|Suspension-feeding mussels exert {{top-down}} grazing {{control on}} primary producers, and provide bottom-up feedback of regenerated nutrients. Besides direct excretion, an important pathway of nutrient regeneration {{is through the}} decomposition of feces and pseudofeces, of which mussels can produce large quantities. Information on mussel feces and pseudofeces quality and nutrient <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> is scarce. Feces and pseudofeces, produced in varying proportions, are commonly treated as one pool. We determined nutrient <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> of feces and pseudofeces decomposition in incubations using natural seawater and juvenile Mytilus edulis from spat collectors. Apart from one 1993 trial, our results {{are the first to}} present nutrient regeneration dynamics of feces and pseudofeces separately. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphate regeneration continued at stable rates for approximately 3 wk, after which 13. 1 and 12. 4 % of the available N and 8. 7 and 7. 9 % of the available P was regenerated from feces and pseudofeces, respectively. <b>Rates</b> of silicate <b>regeneration</b> declined continuously, which we attribute to its accumulation in the experimental setup. Coinciding environmental levels of DIN and silicate at growth-limiting levels indicate the potential ecological relevance of biodeposit decomposition. Overall DIN <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> were similar between feces and pseudofeces, but depletion of ammonia was initially more rapid for pseudofeces due to stronger nitrification.

Growth {{of these}} injured nubbins was examined in parallel, and compared to controls. Biochemical compositions of the holobiont and the zooxanthellae density were determined {{at the onset}} of the experiment, and the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) of zooxanthellae was monitored during the experiment. Acropora muricata rapidly regenerated small lesions, but <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> significantly differed between sites.

We reviewed nine patients of united network of organ sharing (UNOS) status 2 or 3 who had undergone ATALDLT with a left lobe graft. For the comparison of liver regeneration, 20 hepatectomized patients for biliary malignancy were selected as non-transplant control group.

5000|$|The {{gameplay}} of Undying {{in general}} follows the precepts of the first-person shooter genre. The game simulates the main character's (Patrick Galloway's) {{point of view}} for the player, who uses a variety of weapons to defeat enemies within the game while making his or her way {{through a series of}} levels. As with most FPSs, Galloway has a certain amount of health, represented by a cross symbol and corresponding number at the bottom center-left of the screen. Each time the player is hurt by an enemy the health number is continually reduced until it reaches zero, at which point Galloway dies - an event which is usually marked by a unique to each enemy type third-person cut scene which shows his gruesome final moments. To prevent this, health can be replenished when low using health packs. Patrick's maximum health can also be increased when using the alternate mode of a certain weapon, however it drains quickly back to the standard amount of health. Another aspect of the gameplay of Undying - and one which makes it somewhat similar in terms of ambience to traditional role-playing video games - is that along with its set of offensive weapons, the player is able to use a wide range of magical spells. Spells consume a certain amount of Galloway's magical energy, or [...] "Mana", which is represented by a flask icon and corresponding number on the bottom center-right of the screen. This energy slowly regenerates itself over time. Magical tatto pickups called [...] "Arcane Whorls" [...] permanently increase mana <b>regeneration</b> <b>rate,</b> while amulets called [...] "Mana Wells" [...] increase maximum mana by 10 up to 200.

The effect of Sorafenib on liver regeneration in healthy rats was investigated. MethodsSixty Wistar rats received either Sorafenib (group S; 15 mg/kg) or placebo for 14 days prior to resection and until sacrifice. After a 70 % partial hepatectomy, the rats were euthanized on post-operative days (POD) 2, 4 or 8. Hepatocyte proliferation was estimated by immunohistochemistry for Ki- 67 antigen using stereological methods on sections prepared by systematic uniform random sampling. ResultsSeven animals (12 %) died after surgery. Death rates were similar in treated rats and controls. At hepatectomy, the body weight was significantly lower in group S rats. The liver weight and <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> were lower in group S rats on PODs 2, 4 and 8. Hepatocyte proliferation was significantly lower in group S animals on PODs 2 and 4.

40|$|Endozoochory plays a {{prominent}} role for the dispersal of seed plants. However, for most other plant taxa {{it is not known}} whether this mode of dispersal occurs at all. Among those other taxa, lichens as symbiotic associations of algae and fungi are peculiar as their successful dispersal requires movement of propagules that leaves the symbiosis functional. However, the potential for endozoochorous dispersal of lichen fragments has been completely overlooked. We fed sterile thalli of two foliose lichen species (Lobaria pulmonaria and Physcia adscendens) differing in habitat and air-quality requirements to nine snail species common in temperate Europe. We demonstrated morphologically that L. pulmonaria regenerated from 29. 0 % of all 379 fecal pellets, whereas P. adscendens regenerated from 40. 9 % of all 433 fecal pellets, showing that lichen fragments survived gut passage of all snail species. Moreover, molecular analysis of regenerated lichens confirmed the species identity for a subset of samples. <b>Regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> were higher for the generalist lichen species P. adscendens than for the specialist lichen species L. pulmonaria. Furthermore, lichen <b>regeneration</b> <b>rates</b> varied among snail species with higher rates after gut passage of heavier snail species. We suggest that gastropods generally grazing on lichen communities are important, but so far completely overlooked, as vectors for lichen dispersal. This opens new ecological perspectives and questions the traditional view of an entirely antagonistic relationship between gastropods and lichens...|$|R
