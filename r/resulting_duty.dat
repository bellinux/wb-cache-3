40|$|International audienceIn {{low-power}} wireless networking, {{new applications}} such as cooperative robots or industrial closed-loop control demand for network-wide consensus at low-latency and high reliability. Distributed consensus protocols is a mature eld of research in a wired context, but has received little attention in low-power wireless settings. In this paper, we present A 2 : Agreement in the Air, a system that brings distributed consensus to low-power multi-hop networks. A 2 introduces Synchrotron, a synchronous transmissions kernel that builds a robust mesh by exploiting the capture eeect, frequency hopping with parallel channels, and link-layer security. A 2 builds {{on top of this}} reliable base layer and enables the two-and three-phase commit protocols, as well as network services such as group membership, hopping sequence distribution and re-keying. We evaluate A 2 on four public testbeds with diierent deployment densities and sizes. A 2 requires only 475 ms to complete a two-phase commit over 180 nodes. The <b>resulting</b> <b>duty</b> cycle is 0. 5 % for 1 -minute intervals. We show that A 2 achieves zero losses end-to-end over long experiments, representing millions of data points. When adding controlled failures, we show that two-phase commit ensures transaction consistency in A 2 while three-phase commit provides liveness at the expense of inconsistency under speciic failure scenarios...|$|E
30|$|In IEEE 802.15. 4 {{standard}} [3], it is {{stated that}} SO and BO are {{selected based on}} the following equation 0 ≤ SO ≤ BO ≤ 14. For energy-efficient operation, {{it is essential to}} maintain SO less than BO. If SO is less than BO by a minimal value of 1, the <b>resulting</b> <b>duty</b> cycle from Equation (2) is found to be 50 %. The highest possible duty cycle with energy saving is 50 % and that corresponds to the case when active period is equal to inactive period. Such a long inactive period can be utilized to schedule another instance of super-frame structure working independently to the already running super-frame. Such scheduling is achieved through a priori synchronization amongst the sensor networks such that the two super-frames operate in the two frequency channels independently, one in native channel and the other in shared channel. Every node, no matter to which native channel it belongs, switches to the shared channel and expects an orphaned message [19] from a disconnected node to arrive. A node disconnected from its native channel can now use the common channel to associate to such a node in order to establish a connection to its parent network. This connectivity is intermittent and persists only within the superframe duration. The disconnected node gets to access its respective gateway through such borrowed connectivity. This is a simple and low-cost approach to implement shared channel connectivity between nodes of co-existing sensor networks.|$|E

40|$|Is {{the civic}} duty to report crime and {{corruption}} a genuine moral duty? After clarifying {{the nature of}} the duty, I consider a couple of negative answers to the question, and turn to an attractive and commonly held view, according to which this civic duty is a genuine moral duty. On this view, crime and corruption threaten political stability, and citizens have a moral duty to report crime and corruption to the government in order to help the government’s law enforcement efforts. The <b>resulting</b> <b>duty</b> is triply general in that it applies to everyone, everywhere, and covers all criminal and corrupt activity. In this paper, I challenge the general scope of this argument. I argue that that the civic duty to report crime and corruption to the authorities is much narrower than the government claims and people might think, for it only arises when the state (i) condemns genuine wrongdoing and serious ethical offenses as “crime” and “corruption,” and (ii) constitutes a dependable “disclosure recipient,” showing the will and power to hold wrongdoers accountable. I further defend a robust duty to directly report to the public—one that is weightier and wider than people usually assume. When condition (ii) fails to obtain, I submit, citizens are released of the duty to report crime and corruption to the authorities, but are bound to report to the public, even when the denunciation targets the government and is risky or illegal...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTechnology {{development}} in EDM is very time consuming {{especially for the}} application of new materials {{or in the case of}} unfavorable machining conditions. Due to the large number of influencing factors and their interdependencies it is not possible to predict the machining conditions only by interpretation of the used generator parameters. Therefore it is difficult to link the machining results directly to the parameter setting. As a consequence a large number of test series are typically performed in a trial and error approach to find the ideal set of parameters for each machining task. But in this case the resulting technology is limited to the machining of the same material, geometry and the used machine tool. For an intelligent model based technology development the direct influence of the generator parameters on the actual process conditions need to be identified. In this paper the actual physical values for current and voltage as well as pulse on- and off-time of each discharge is determined by monitoring the electrical process signals. By tracking these values over time the quality of the whole process is evaluated by determination of the actual discharge frequency, the percentage of misdischarges and the <b>resulting</b> <b>duty</b> cycle. These parameters are then linked to the output variables cutting rate and surface roughness. Using this approach the specific influence of the machined material as well as other special machining conditions on the EDM process can be identified. With this fundamental knowledge the needed test series for future developments can be reduced and the transferability of the resulting technology will be improved significantly...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Massively-parallel {{sequencing}} (MPS) technologies create {{challenges for}} informed consent of research participants given the enormous {{scale of the}} data and {{the wide range of}} potential results. Discussion We propose that the consent process in these studies be based on whether they use MPS to test a hypothesis or to generate hypotheses. To demonstrate the differences in these approaches to informed consent, we describe the consent processes for two MPS studies. The purpose of our hypothesis-testing study is to elucidate the etiology of rare phenotypes using MPS. The purpose of our hypothesis-generating study is to test the feasibility of using MPS to generate clinical hypotheses, and to approach the return of results as an experimental manipulation. Issues to consider in both designs include: volume and nature of the potential results, primary versus secondary results, return of individual <b>results,</b> <b>duty</b> to warn, length of interaction, target population, and privacy and confidentiality. Summary The categorization of MPS studies as hypothesis-testing versus hypothesis-generating can help to clarify the issue of so-called incidental or secondary results for the consent process, and aid the communication of the research goals to study participants. </p...|$|R
