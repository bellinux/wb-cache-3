5|$|According to the {{dominant}} scholarly view during the late 19th {{and much of the}} 20th century, Roman <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> originally animistic, directed towards spirits associated with specific objects or activities which were only later perceived as gods with independent personal existence. Terminus, with his lack of mythology and his close association with a physical object, seemed a clear example of a deity who had developed little from such a stage.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} symbol {{among the}} Nri <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> the omu, a tender palm frond, used to sacralize and restrain. It {{was used as}} protection for traveling delegations or safeguarding certain objects; a person or object carrying an omu twig was considered protected. The influence of these symbols and institutions extended well beyond Nri, and this unique Igbo socio-political system proved capable of controlling areas wider than villages or towns.|$|E

ABSTRACT: <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> a set of beliefs of an individual or a set of people. Language of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> as sacred as any <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> itself. Language of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> distinctive as well as prior to everyday language. In spite of many distinctive features language of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> also having some similar features to the other registers. Language of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> dynamic and complex regarding its function, style and interrelation with other texts. In this article language of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> stylistically analyzed. Stylistic features like grammatical level, graphological effects, phonological level and semantics discussed {{on the basis of}} stylistic analysis...|$|R

5|$|As at the 2001 UK census, 65% of Stretford {{residents}} reported {{themselves as}} being Christian, 12% as Muslim, and 2% as Sikh. No other <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> represented at higher than 1% of the population, with 12% reporting themselves as having no religion.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} rest of England, the city had an above-average {{proportion}} of foreign-born residents, at around 12%. Ninety-five percent of residents were recorded as white; the largest minority group was recorded as Asian, at 1.8% of the population. <b>Religion</b> <b>was</b> recorded as 68.2% Christian, 1.1% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, 0.8% Hindu, 0.2% Jewish, and 0.1% Sikh. The rest either had no religion, an alternative religion, or did not state their religion.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occupancy}} of {{the palace}} by Dom Pedro and Maria I, the chapel was central to the daily routine of their court. It was {{no coincidence that the}} chapel was the first part {{of the palace}} to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. <b>Religion</b> <b>was</b> one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in <b>religion</b> <b>was,</b> however, no less fevered than that of her husband—the couple attended mass several times a day. Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies. Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity. Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in Rio de Janeiro in 1816.|$|E
50|$|Iranian <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> ancient <b>religions</b> whose roots predate the Islamization of Greater Iran. Nowadays these <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> practiced only by minorities.|$|R

2500|$|Indian religions, {{sometimes}} also termed as Dharmic faiths or <b>religions,</b> <b>are</b> the <b>religions</b> {{that originated}} in the Indian subcontinent; namely Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. [...] These <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> also all classified as Eastern religions. Although Indian <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> connected through the history of India, they constitute {{a wide range of}} religious communities, and are not confined to the Indian subcontinent.|$|R
5|$|Gingrich {{has three}} younger half-sisters, Candace and Susan Gingrich, and Roberta Brown. Gingrich {{was raised in}} Hummelstown (near Harrisburg) and on {{military}} bases where his father was stationed. The family's <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> Lutheran. He also has a half-sister and half-brother, Randy McPherson, from his father's side. In 1960 during his junior year in high school, {{the family moved to}} Georgia at Fort Benning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} wards {{that make up}} the Whitby {{district}} of North Yorkshire, out of a population of 13,596 there are 10,286 who stated that their <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> Christian in the 2001 UK census. There were 19Muslims, 17Buddhists, 12Jews, 3Sikhs and 499people had no religious affiliations.|$|E
5|$|Polarization {{of voting}} {{patterns}} based on <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> {{evident in the}} eastern provinces. Christianity-based Prosperous Peace Party (PDS) received 14.8 percent of votes in Christian-dominant North Sulawesi and 13 seats overall in the People's Representative Council. Likewise, Muslims {{were more likely to}} vote for the PKS in regions where religious conflict has been historically prevalent.|$|E

5000|$|Traditional Mohawk <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> {{predominantly}} Animist. [...] "Much of the <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} a primordial conflict between good and evil." [...] Many Mohawk continue to follow the Longhouse Religion.|$|R
5000|$|Dark Green <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> one way {{in which}} people, both secular and religious, connect with nature on a spiritual level. Bron Taylor defines Dark Green Religion as [...] "religion that {{considers}} nature to be sacred, imbued by intrinsic value, and worthy of reverent care" [...] in his book Dark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. Nature <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> an overarching term of which Dark Green <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> a part of. A key part of Dark Green <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "depth of its consideration of nature." [...] Dark Green Religion differs from Green Religion. Green Religion claims that it is a religious obligation for humans to be environmental stewards, while Dark Green <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> a movement that simply holds nature as valuable and sacred.Spiritual types of Dark Green Religion include Naturalistic and Supernaturalistic forms of Animism and of Gaianism. The diverse views within Dark Green <b>Religion</b> <b>are</b> not without the idea that the earth is sacred and worthy of care. The perceptions of Dark Green <b>Religion</b> <b>are</b> global and flexible. Taylor's use of the word 'Dark' gestures toward these negative possibilities. According to Taylor, Dark Green Religion has the possibility to [...] "inspire the emergence of a global, civic, earth religion." [...] Dark Green, Green and Nature <b>Religions</b> <b>are</b> arguably all a part of ecospirituality. The term ecospirituality is versatile and overarching.|$|R
5|$|<b>Religion</b> <b>was</b> an {{important}} part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of Manchu Shamanist ceremony. At the same time, the native Chinese Taoist religion continued to have {{an important}} role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties. There were two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court.|$|E
5|$|The {{final step}} in the {{formation}} of Egyptian <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> the unification of Egypt, in which rulers from Upper Egypt made themselves pharaohs of the entire country. These sacred kings and their subordinates assumed the exclusive right to interact with the gods, and kingship became the unifying focus of the religion.|$|E
5|$|The first clear testaments to Christian {{communities}} in Switzerland date after 313, when the <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> officially tolerated with the Edict of Milan. It is however certain that, as in Gaul, the Christian faith {{had already had}} adherents for some time prior to 313.|$|E
50|$|Religion for Atheists: A non-believer's {{guide to}} the uses of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> a book by Alain de Botton {{published}} in 2012. It argues that while supernatural claims made by <b>religion</b> <b>are</b> false, some aspects of <b>religion</b> <b>are</b> still useful and can be applied in secular life and society. <b>Religion</b> for Atheists <b>was</b> published in the UK in hardback edition by Hamish Hamilton, and in the US by Pantheon. <b>Religion</b> for Atheists <b>was</b> a New York Times non-fiction bestseller, and has been widely reviewed, with mixed results.|$|R
25|$|The {{cultural}} {{anthropology of}} <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> principally {{concerned with the}} cultural aspects of religion. Of primary concern to the cultural anthropologist of <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> rituals, beliefs, religious art, and practices of piety.|$|R
50|$|The modern Indonesian {{state is}} founded on the {{principles}} of pancasila, which requires the belief in 'one and only God', the practice of either Protestantism, Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism, one of which must be entered on an individual's KTP. Traditional <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> not officially recognised, and accordingly traditional <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> increasingly marginalised, although aspects of the traditional Batak <b>religion</b> <b>are</b> still practised alongside Christianity.|$|R
5|$|The {{place of}} birth of the town's {{residents}} was 96.8% United Kingdom (including 95.13% from England), 0.6% Republic of Ireland, 0.5% from other European Union countries, and 2.1% from elsewhere in the world. <b>Religion</b> <b>was</b> recorded as 84% Christian, 1.7% Muslim, 0.2% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, 0.1% Jewish and <0.1% Sikh. Some 6.8% were recorded as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion, and 5.6% did not state their religion.|$|E
5|$|Although Jewish, Levi's {{family did}} not {{practise}} their religion, {{and were not}} part of the Jewish community, but when she was enrolled at the Victoria School (now the Bettina School) in Frankfurt, her <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> listed as Jewish. Religious instruction was compulsory, so she had to attend classes with a local rabbi. She soon rebelled against this, and told her parents that she did not wish to attend the classes. She came to reject formal religion.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 UK census, the Ditton electoral ward had a {{population}} of 4,786. The ethnic breakdown was 96% white, 1.2% mixed race, 1.7% Asian, 0.6% black and 0.3% other. The place of birth of residents was 94.8% United Kingdom, 0.4% Republic of Ireland, 1% other 2001 EU member countries, 0.5% later EU accession countries and 3.2% elsewhere. <b>Religion</b> <b>was</b> recorded as 67.5% Christian, 0.3% Buddhist, 0.3% Hindu, 0.1% Sikh and 0.6% Muslim. 24.2% were recorded as having no religion, 0.3% had an alternative religion and 6.7% did not state their religion.|$|E
50|$|This factor {{assesses the}} individual’s {{evaluation}} {{of the extent to}} which <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> central to their identity as Pacific, and the extent to which they believe <b>religion</b> to <b>be</b> entwined with Pacific culture. <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> an important aspect of Pacific identity, having a huge influence on many Pacific communities by providing social connections and support, and fulfilling cultural and religious needs. This factor focuses on Christianity-based <b>religions</b> which <b>are</b> the most common in Pacific societies. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels that Christianity-based <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> a central aspect of self-identity, and is strongly linked to their Pacific culture.|$|R
50|$|Each {{community}} {{is different from}} another from its particularities, culture, language and <b>religion.</b> It <b>is</b> the reason why so many distinct <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> spoken throughout the island. The four most developed <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> Hinduism, Islam, Catholicism and Buddhism. They are mostly practiced respectively by Hindus, Muslims, the General Population and Sino-Mauritians.|$|R
50|$|Bretonnia's {{official}} <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> {{the worship}} of The Lady. However, this <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> only exclusive to the aristocracy, as peasants are considered unworthy to worship Her and any caught doing so are brutally punished.|$|R
5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|Constantine ignored {{those parts}} of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of {{preserving}} a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold solidus became the empire's primary currency instead. Diocletian's persecution of Christians was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Constantine would claim {{to have the same}} close relationship with the Christian God as Diocletian claimed to have with Jupiter. Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s. The combination of state autocracy and state <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Diệm deposed head {{of state}} Bảo Đại in a {{fraudulent}} referendum in 1955 and proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam). The VNA thus became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Born into a nominally Buddhist family, Đính had converted to Catholicism {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. The change of <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> widely perceived to be a factor in his rapid promotion above more capable officers. A devout member of the Catholic minority, Diệm dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary and heavily disenfranchised and disadvantaged the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5000|$|Elite <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> often {{contrasted with}} folk religion, or the {{religious}} symbols {{and beliefs of}} the masses. Elite <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> then the [...] "official religion" [...] as championed by the leaders of a religion.|$|R
50|$|One way {{to define}} a major <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> {{by the number of}} current adherents. The {{population}} numbers by <b>religion</b> <b>are</b> computed by a combination of census reports and population surveys (in countries where <b>religion</b> data <b>is</b> not collected in census, for example the United States or France), but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> especially difficult to count.|$|R
5000|$|At {{this time}} in China all <b>religions</b> <b>were</b> tolerated but there <b>were</b> three {{principal}} <b>religions.</b> Confucianism which <b>is</b> also known as [...] "The Doctrine of the Lettered". Confucius {{is regarded as the}} patriarch and reformer of the religion which gives its followers a positive outlook on life. The second <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> known as Taoism or the Primitive religion. Taught by a contemporary of Confucius Lao-tze this <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> similar to Confucianism. The priests and priestesses are sworn to celibacy and practice things such as magic, astrology, and necromancy. The last <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> Buddhism. This <b>religion</b> follows the teachings of the Buddha and ends ones suffering though his understanding of the four noble truths.|$|R
