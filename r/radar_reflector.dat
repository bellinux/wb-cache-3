5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to create the illusion of a large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed <b>radar</b> <b>reflector</b> balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E

25|$|Palast {{has also}} taken {{issue with the}} {{official}} story behind the grounding of the Exxon Valdez, claiming the sobriety of the Valdezs captain {{was not an issue}} in the accident. According to Palast, the main cause of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 was not human error, but an Exxon decision not to use the ship's radar in order to save money. The Raytheon Raycas radar system would not have detected Bligh Reef itself - as radar, unlike sonar, is incapable of detecting submerged objects. The radar system would have detected the <b>radar</b> <b>reflector,</b> placed on the next rock inland from Bligh Reef for the purpose of keeping vessels on course via radar.|$|E

40|$|The water-ice-rich north polar layered {{deposits}} (NPLD) of Mars play a {{key role}} in the Martian climate through an active exchange of water vapor with the atmosphere. Conditions are not currently amenable for flow of the NPLD; however, gross morphological evidence for past flow suggests the possibility of a warmer climate in the past. Here we present the first comparison of internal stratigraphy predicted by a flow model with that observed by an orbital radar sounder. We have analyzed radar data from Gemina Lingula, the southernmost tongue of the NPLD, acquired by the Shallow Radar on board NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The data shows extensive internal reflections and several <b>radar</b> <b>reflectors</b> were mapped to create gridded surfaces of this part of the NPLD. All the mapped <b>radar</b> <b>reflectors</b> were smooth with no sudden dips towards the surface or the bedrock. The internal <b>radar</b> <b>reflectors</b> were then compared with modeled isochrones in two different areas of Gemina Lingula under the assumption of flow occurring. Results indicate that flow of ice is unlikely to have occurred between the main dome and Gemina Lingula. Furthermore, we found no evidence for the existence of a prior ablation zone in Gemina Lingula as predicted in another study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} calculating the {{radar cross section}} (RCS) of two maritime <b>radar</b> <b>reflectors</b> using the method of moments. The Echomaster 152, although smaller in size, produces a higher maximum RCS than the Echomax 230 that includes three layers of corner reflectors. The Echomaster 152 also has deeper nulls in the RCS pattern, which means it is less detectable at those angles...|$|R

Some are only intended to be visible in daylight (daymarks), others have some combination of lights, reflectors, bells, horns, whistles and <b>radar</b> <b>reflectors</b> to make them usable at night and in conditions of reduced visibility.|$|R

50|$|Sea kayaking {{is another}} of McKerrow's passions; he has done a double {{crossing}} of Cook Strait, and a 10-hour solo crossing from Raumati to Cape Jackson, New Zealand. In 1988 he joined world-famous sea kayaker Paul Caffyn {{in an attempt to}} do the first kayak crossing of the Tasman Sea from Australia to New Zealand. They were arrested by the Maritime Police for not having a large <b>radar</b> <b>reflector.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{operational}} {{version of}} the GAM-72 carried internal <b>radar</b> <b>reflectors</b> facing forward and to {{each side of the}} aircraft. Up to 100 lb (45 kg) of payload could be accommodated internally by the GAM-72. This internal space could be used to house a radar repeater or a chaff dispenser. An infrared burner in the tail could produce intense heat to simulate the heat signature of a bomber. The GAM-72 was not armed.|$|R
5000|$|Experiment 216 ( [...] 216) is {{the newest}} target ship in the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).

50|$|A <b>radar</b> <b>reflector</b> can be {{made from}} a Luneburg lens by {{metallizing}} parts of its surface. Radiation from a distant radar transmitter is focussed onto the underside of the metallization {{on the opposite side of}} the lens; here it is reflected, and focussed back onto the radar station. A difficulty with this scheme is that metallized regions block the entry or exit of radiation on that part of the lens, but the non-metallized regions result in a blind-spot on the opposite side.|$|E

Nevertheless, the court stated MV Lady Elena did not notice Bieszczadys stern light about 10 minutes before the accident, although it should have done it.

A modified version of the Shelduck, the RP-71 Falconer (MQM-57), added an autopilot and camera mounts for battlefield reconnaissance duties.|$|R
