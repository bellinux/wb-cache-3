40|$|This memo {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the Formal (90 %) Design Review process and meetings held to evaluate the design of the Flexible <b>Receiver</b> <b>Adapters,</b> support platforms, and associated equipment. The equipment is part of the Flexible Receiver System used to remove, transport, and store long length contaminated equipment and components from both the double and single-shell underground storage tanks at the 200 area tank farms...|$|R
50|$|The radio {{spectrum}} scope (also radio panoramic <b>receiver,</b> panoramic <b>adapter,</b> pan <b>receiver,</b> pan <b>adapter,</b> panadapter, panoramic radio spectroscope, panoramoscope, panalyzor and band scope) {{was invented by}} Marcel Wallace and measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within one or more radio bands - e.g. shortwave bands. A spectrum scope is normally a lot cheaper than a spectrum analyzer, because the aim is not high quality frequency resolution - nor high quality signal strength measurements.|$|R
50|$|Upper {{receivers}} will {{be available}} in several calibers and barrel lengths, as short as 10.7 in for the 5.56mm model. The lower receiver will also accept older mil-spec M16 or M16 upper <b>receivers</b> with an <b>adapter.</b> <b>Receivers</b> {{will be available}} that accept 5.56×45mm NATO NATO rounds, 6.8×43mm Remington SPC rounds, 7.62×39mm rounds, and 7.62×51mm NATO rounds. Each upper receiver has its own rail system, which allows scopes, or other optics to be pre-sighted for each configuration, and swapped quickly to perform different tasks.|$|R
50|$|Pennine Radio Limited is a UK {{manufacturer}} of electronic equipment, transformers and inductors, ride on electric golf carts, sheet metalwork and computer equipment.Founded in 1958 the company started off producing radio <b>receivers</b> and <b>adapters</b> {{to enable the}} new band III ITV television broadcasts. However they soon expanded into industrial electronics. In the early days they produced many innovative designs for the woollen industry which surrounded Huddersfield.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of these}} variances in {{resolution}} and frame rate from the NTSC standards for television broadcasting, field-sequential color broadcasts {{could not be}} seen on existing black and white <b>receivers</b> without an <b>adapter</b> (to see them in monochrome), or adapter-converter (to see them in color).|$|R
50|$|TimeTrax has {{developed}} software that can record the audio broadcast on XM satellite radio. The software saves songs as individual MP3 files after identifying {{the name and}} the artist. TimeTrax is both a software and hardware solution: the TimeTrax software can interface with any PC-compatible satellite <b>receiver,</b> and the <b>adapter</b> box is necessary to allow certain receivers to interface with a PC.|$|R
2500|$|The MAR, or the Micro Galil, is a reduced-size {{version of}} the Galil SAR (706mm stock {{extended}} / 465mm folded), weighing 2.98kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel (210mm), receiver, piston, gas tube and foregrip. The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds/min) as other 5.56mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round M16 magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located {{on both sides of}} the receiver) has four settings: [...] "S"—weapon is safe, [...] "A"—automatic fire, [...] "B"—3-round burst, [...] "R"—semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0–300m and beyond 300 m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a <b>receiver</b> cover <b>adapter),</b> low-light sights with tritium illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a bolt catch, plastic magazines weighing 0.164kg or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.|$|R
40|$|This release {{has several}} improvements, {{addition}} of new features and bug fixes: 	Improvements in receiver design: Internal block communication has been redesigned {{to accommodate the}} addition of new signals, and now upstream and downstream communication within blocks is implemented through the GNU Radio block’s asynchronous message passing system, leading to a more scalable, more robust and cleaner design. 	Improvements in receiver design: Correlators have been rewritten {{to take full advantage}} of VOLK and VOLK_GNSSSDR, and they are of general use for any tracking block. Their API now admit an arbitrary number of correlators, spaced in an arbitrary manner, in 16 ic and 32 fc versions. 	Improvements in <b>receiver</b> design: Block <b>adapters</b> are now all managed by smart pointers, ensuring better memory management. 	Improvements in processing speed: The VOLK_GNSSSDR library has been rewritten, following current VOLK standards and adding a number of new kernels. This approach addresses both efficiency and portability. Now the library provides the key kernels for GNSS signal processing in 16 ic and 32 fc versions, including SSE 2, SSE 3, SSE 4. 1, AVX, AV 2 and NEON implementations. Please execute volk_gnsssdr_profile’'' andvolk_profile’'’ to use the fastest implementation for your host machine. 	New source block: Two_Bit_Packed_File_Signal_Source. This block takes 2 bit samples that have been packed into bytes or shorts as input and generates a byte for each sample. 	Fixes in SUPL assistance (supl. nokia. com removed). 	Improvements in acquisition: Added a non CFAR PCPS acquisition algorithm based on the estimation of the post correlation noise floor. If enabled as an option in the acquisition configuration, it allows setting more stable thresholds in the presence of non-gaussian front-end noise (which is the usual behavior of front-ends.) 	Fixes in acquisition: Fixed mismatch between the config files and the acquisition code in the specification of the IF. Fixed a bug in the length of the FFT of local codes. 	Improvements in tracking sensitivity: Added configuration option to customize the extension of the GPS L 1 CA correlation length after bit synchronization (options are: [1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20] ms). Only available in the GPS_L 1 _CA_DLL_PLL_C_Aid_Tracking implementation. 	New tracking block introduced: GPS_L 1 _CA_DLL_PLL_C_Aid_Tracking is a GPS L 1 C/A carrier PLL and code DLL with optional carrier-aid feedback. It is available in both 32 bits gr_complex input samples and in 16 bits short int complex samples. The gr_complex version has also the capability to extend the coherent correlation period from 1 ms to 20 ms using telemetry symbol synchronization. 	Increased resolution in CN 0 estimator internal variables. 	Fixed a bug in computation of GPS L 1 C/A carrier phase observable. 	Fixed a bug in the internal state machine that was blocking the receiver after a few hours of usage. Now the receiver can work continually (tested for more than one week, no known limit). 	New tracking block introduced: GPS_L 1 _CA_DLL_PLL_Tracking_GPU is a GPS L 1 C/A carrier PLL and code DLL that uses the CUDA-compatible GPU to compute carrier wipe off and correlation operations, alleviating the CPU load. 	Obsolete/buggy blocks removed: GPS_L 1 _CA_DLL_FLL_PLL_Tracking, GPS_L 1 _CA_DLL_PLL_Optim_Tracking. 	Added a RTCM printer and TCP server in PVT blocks (still experimental). The receiver is now able to stream data in real time, serving RTCM 3. 2 messages to multiple clients. For instance, it can act as a Ntrip Source feeding a Ntrip Server, or to be used as data input in RTKLIB, obtaining Precise Point Positioning fixes in real-time. The TCP port, Station ID, and rate of MT 1019 /MT 1045 and MSM can be configured. GPS_L 1 _CA_PVT serves MT 1019 (GPS Ephemeris) and MSM 7 (MT 1077, full GPS pseudoranges, phase ranges, phase range rates and CNR - high resolution) messages, while GALILEO_E 1 _PVT serves MT 1045 (Galileo ephemeris) and MSM 7 (MT 1097, full Galileo pseudoranges, phase ranges, phase range rates and CNR - high resolution). 	Added a GeoJSON printer. Basic (least-squares) position fixes can be now also stored in this format, in addition to KML. 	Obsolete block removed: output filter. 	QA code migrated to the new asynchronous message passing system. 	Improvements in documentation: update of README. md file, addition of documentation for the VOLK_GNSSSDR library, updated links to new ICDs. 	Improvements in documentation: Satellite identification updated to current constellation status. 	Updated and cleaner console output. Now Galileo satellites have the ‘E’ identifier in their PRN number. 	Several improvements in CMake scripts allow to build GNSS-SDR in Linux Debian (Jessie, Stretch and Sid), Ubuntu (from 12. 04 to 16. 04), including amd 64, i 386, armhf and arm 64 architectures, and possibly in other GNU/Linux distributions, as well as in Mac OS X 10. 9 to 10. 11. It also works well with CMake 3. 5 (some problems solved with VOLK_GNSSSDR as a sub-project). 	The software can link either against OpenSSL or against GnuTLS with openssl extensions, whatever it is available. This allows buildings in distributions such as Fedora or ArchLinux, while being compatible with binary distribution through Debian packages. 	Fixed a number of defects detected by Coverity Scan. 	Some fixes required by Debian licensing and packaging system. 	Added a CGRAN ([URL] manifest 	Lots of code cleaning and fixes of typos and small bugs...|$|R
