One of the hacks for compatibility used here was that the new structure was exactly {{the same size as}} the old one, with most data members in the same place, but with additional handles and pointers to color structures in place of the BitMap fields. The upper two bits of the rowBytes field were pressed into use as flags to distinguish a GrafPort from a CGrafPort (they were always zero on old-style GrafPorts because a BitMap could never feasibly be so wide as to ever set these bits). The use of these two high bits would come back to haunt QuickDraw later, as it forced a maximum <b>row</b> <b>width</b> of just 4,096 on 32-bit PixMaps, which became problematic for high-resolution graphics work. Later development (Carbon) eliminated this limitation but was not fully backward compatible. A Palette Manager was also added in Color QuickDraw which managed the arbitration of colors on indexed video devices. Most graphics primitives operations remained either unchanged (but would operate in color), or else new color versions of the black and white APIs were added.|$|E

40|$|A {{competitive}} crop {{stand is}} a basis requirement for indirect weed control, potentially reducing {{the need for}} direct control measures. Efficient light interception by crop canopies can suppress weed growth by shading. As part of the EU-project ″Strategies of weed control in Organic Farming″ (WECOF) weed suppression by crop shading ability were evaluated in winter wheat. Three wheat cultivars with different leaf inclination and height (Greif, Astron, Pegassos) were grown at three row widths (12 cm, 17 cm and 24 cm) and two drilling directions (East-West, North-South) using a three-factorial design. Two field trials in 2000 / 01 and 2001 / 02, respectively, were conducted in Hennef, North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. No direct weed control measures were undertaken. Weed growth was influenced by both, cultivars´ morphology and <b>row</b> <b>width,</b> but remained unaffected by drilling direction. A tall and planophile cultivar (Pegassos) as well as narrow <b>row</b> <b>width</b> increased light interception of wheat stands, thus reducing weed ground cover and weed biomass. Leaf inclination and plant height became more important at wider row widths. The tallest planophile cultivar was able to suppress weeds at 24 cm <b>row</b> <b>width</b> as effectively as at 12 cm <b>row</b> <b>width.</b> Competitiveness of the shorter erectophile cultivar Greif decreased significantly with increasing <b>row</b> <b>width.</b> Furthermore cultivars´ ability for early covering enhanced competitiveness. The effectiveness of crop shading ability depends on weed species´ susceptibility to shading. Early-season growing and high statured weed species cannot be suppressed by crop shading effectively. Despite these limitations crop shading ability is regarded as {{an important element of}} weed control strategies in organic farming...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric) (Agronomy)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{adoption}} of the no-till planting method brought about changes {{to the way the}} wheat crop is established in the Mediterranean climate of the Western Cape. <b>Row</b> <b>widths</b> have to increase from the normal narrow rows (170 - 180 mm) to at least 250 mm to allow for sufficient stubble handling. Furthermore, planters are designed to place seed accurately in the soil at uniform depth, which may increase seedling survival rates. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of the use of wide <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> on yield, the components of yield and grain quality parameters and to revisit planting density recommendations to be used with the notill planting method. On-farm, producer managed trials which included cultivars, <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> and planting density treatments were planted at Riversdale, Swellendam and Caledon in the Southern Cape region and at Moorreesburg and Hopefield in the Swartland during the 2004 to 2006 production seasons. All trials were factorial RCB designs with split-split plot arrangements. Grain yield, grain protein, hectolitre mass (HLM) and the yield components, seedlings m- 2, seedling survival (%), number of heads m- 2, number of heads plant- 1, number of kernels head- 1 and thousand kernel mass (TKM) were determined at all sites in 2005 and 2006. Seedling survival rates of 80 % were easily achieved in all trials with the exception of Caledon and Swellendam in 2005. The no-till planting method may be efficient to improve on survival rates of 50 - 70 % found with the conventional planting methods. The yield component response that raised the most concern was the clear trend of the reduction in the number of heads m- 2 as <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> increased, which was significant in eight out of the nine experiments. The number of heads plant- 1 decreased significantly as planting density increased in all experiments. Cultivars differed in the grain quality parameters grain protein (%) and HLM but were influenced minimally by the other treatments. Reductions in grain yield occurred in three out of eight trials in the Southern Cape and in three out of six trials in the Swartland, with reductions of between 6. 8 % and 33 % in some seasons. The risk of yield loss due to wide <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> could not be excluded by this study and therefore the <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> used by producers should remain as narrow as practically possible. Grain yield response to increasing planting density differed between the two regions. No significant yield benefits were found in any of these trials if planting densities were increased above 175 target plants m- 2. Planting densities may be reduced to between 70 and 87. 5 kg seed ha- 1 to achieve this target if the crop is planted in time and seedling survival rates of at least 80 % can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Low {{rainfall}} {{during the}} wheat growing season in Mediterranean climates leads to variation in growth period {{and this may}} constrain yield. Low seedling survival is among the factors that can limit yield in the Western Cape. Seedling survival rates of 50 - 70 % are expected with conventional tillage, necessitating high sowing rates. Conservation tillage practices which can help to improve seedling survival have been readily adopted in the Winter Rainfall production region of South Africa, but require wider <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> than previously used in conventional tillage and seeding systems to facilitate stubble handling. Replicated, factorial experiments with split-split plot arrangements were established in commercial wheat fields during the 2005 and 2006 seasons at five localities. Treatments included three cultivars, split into <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> (250 - 350 mm) which were split into different planting densities. Seedling counts (3 - 4 weeks after planting) {{were used to determine}} seedling emergence and survival rates. Results indicated that seedling establishment was significantly reduced by increasing <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> (RW), higher planting densities (PD) and in PD × RW interactions in some trials, but that seedling survival of more than 80 % were obtained when planting conditions were favourable. The lowest seedling survival of 63 % occurred when dry conditions prevailed after planting at one locality in 2005. Anecdotally the no-till planting method as used in this region, can improve on the 50 - 70 % seedling survival of previously used conventional planting methods. Articl...|$|R

Quorum systems have been used for many applications in the area of distributed systems, including mutual exclusion, data replication and dissemination of information. Crumbling walls are a general class of quorum systems. The elements (processors) of a wall are logically arranged in rows of varying widths. A quorum in a wall is the union of one full row and a representative from every row below the full row. This class considerably generalizes a number of known quorum system constructions. In this paper we study the availability of crumbling wall quorum systems. We show that if the <b>row</b> <b>width</b> is bounded, or if the number of rows is bounded, then the wall's failure probability Fp does not vanish as the number of elements tends to infinity (i. e., Fp is not Condorcet).

Approximately 2, 000 acres of onions are grown in western Colorado, while the remaining 10, 000 acres are grown in eastern Colorado. Dry storage onions make up 47 % of all vegetable crops grown in Colorado. While, green bunching onions are grown on only about one hundred acres and are generally grown on ground that has been fumigated to kill weeds, diseases, and insects. They are harvested for the shoot tissue and not the bulbs and sold in bunches of 25 to 30 onions, hence the name "green bunching onions. " Cropping System Seed are planted from the first of March to mid April. They should be planted 0. 5 - 1 " deep and 3 - 4 " apart. Uniform seed placement is important.

50|$|Row spacing is {{the second}} factor that determines canopy closure and yield components. Row spacing can either refer to the space between plants in the same row or the {{distance}} between two rows. Row spacing determines the degree of plant to plant competition. Rows planted closer together in a population will decrease the space between plants. Closer <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> increase plant to plant competition for nutrients and water but also increase sunlight use efficiency. According to former Iowa State University Soybean Extension Specialist Palle Pedersen, current recommendations are to plant rows that are less than 30” apart. This increases light interception and decreases weed competition.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of corn acres in Iowa are planted in “conventional” 30 -inch row widths, with some farmers choosing {{to stay with}} the 38 -inch row system. Questions often arise on the magnitude of yield penalty, whether there really is a yield penalty, or if there is actually a benefit to wider row corn in specific situations with today’s elite hybrids. Recommendations are difficult because current data do not exist. There also is growing interest in narrower row corn (20 -inch) and any economical or environmental benefits associated with this practice. These two questions have created a need for more research involving modern hybrids and management practices. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify any <b>row</b> <b>width</b> benefits and (2) determine the optimum planting population for each <b>row</b> <b>width.</b> In addition to this site in 2000, this research was conducted at two other university research farms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Information {{is needed}} on optimum {{conservation}} tillage soybean production management when the soybean is planted fol lowing a wheat grain crop. Our {{objective was to}} determine the effect of surface tillage, deep tillage. and <b>row</b> <b>width</b> on double-cropped soybean growth and yield. Surfacetillage treatmentswere disked or not disked. <b>Row</b> <b>width</b> treatments were 7. 5 in or 30 in. Deep tillage treatments consisted of fall paratilling before seeding wheat or not paratilling. In the spring, half of the 30 -in plots were in-row subsoiled and half of the 7. 5 -in plots were paratilled, and these were compared to no spring deep tillage. Soybeans were planted in early June in 1994 and 1995. Surfacetillage and spring deep tillage impacted plant height at some measurement times through each season, but <b>row</b> <b>width</b> and fall deep tillage did not. Averaged over all treatment combinations,soybeansgrown in 7. 5 -in rows yielded 30. 1 buiac (1994) and 21. 2 bu/ac (1995) more than soybeans grown in 30 -in rows. Surfacetillage and deep tillage had no effect on yield when the 30 -in-row width was used. When the 7. 5 -in-row width was used, both fall and spring deep tillage in-creased yield. Disking before planting the 7. 5 -in-row-widthsoy-beans resulted in yield reductions of 14. 2 bu/ac in 1994 and 9. 8 buiac in 1995, compared to the no surface tillage treatment. Con servation tillage, combined with narrow-row culture and deep till-age. should improve double-crop soybean production in the Coastal Plain...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} row spacing and plant density on yield and yield components of sweet corn, variety KSC 403, an experiment was conducted in Research Farm of Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2007, as randomized complete block design with a split-plot layout and three replications. The main plots were allocated to two row spacing (60 and 75 cm) and the sub-plots accommodated four levels of plant density (50000, 70000, 90000 and 110000 plants per ha). There was significant increase in leaf area index, shoot dry weight, 100 -grain fresh weight and grain fresh yield, as <b>row</b> <b>width</b> was decreased from 75 to 60 cm but the plant height was decreased. There was no significant effect of row spacing on number of rows per ear, number of grains per row and number of grains per ear. Plant height, leaf area index, shoot dry weight per m 2 and number of ears per m 2 were increased {{with an increase in}} plant density. The number of rows per ear, number of grains per row, number of grains per ear, 100 -grain fresh weight and grain fresh yield were significantly higher under plant densities of 90000 and 110000 as compared to 50000 and 70000 plants per ha. There was significant interaction between row spacing and plant density for leaf area index, shoot dry weight, number of grains per ear, 100 -grain fresh weight and grain fresh yield. Under all plant densities, the grain fresh yield was higher in 60 -cm <b>row</b> <b>width</b> compared to 70 -cm <b>row</b> <b>width.</b> However, the difference between these two row spacing was not significant in plant densities of 50000 and 110000 plants per ha. The highest grain fresh yield (33940 kg/ha) was achieved under row spacing 60 cm and 70000 plants per ha and the least grain fresh yield (20750 kg/ha) was obtained in under 75 cm <b>row</b> <b>width</b> and 110000 plants per ha. Considering the obtained results of this experiment, to have maximum grain fresh yield of sweet corn under Isfahan climate, the row spacing of 60 cm and plant density of 70000 plants per ha is recommended...|$|E

40|$|In Iowa, corn {{historically}} has been grown in <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> of 30 inches or wider. During the last decade, many Iowa producers developed {{a renewed interest}} in the productiveness of corn in narrower rows. Much of this renewed interest was a result of the observed yield benefits of planting soybeans in rows narrower then 30 inches. In addition, the advancements made in farm machinery today have established effective means by which farmers can plant and harvest these narrow rows. As a result, research is needed to evaluate the effect of row spacing and related planting decisions on the yield of modern, high-yielding corn hybrids. The designed {{purpose of this study was}} to test the responses of different hybrids (based on relative maturity) to narrow row spacings. This study was conducted over three years, 1997 - 1999.

40|$|The {{critical}} leaf potassium (K) concentration {{for maximum}} yield of conservation-till soybeans {{was estimated to}} be 2. 4 % in nine Ontario trials from 1998 to 2000. This is substantially higher than the critical levels used in Ontario and many states. Critical leaf K levels for the maximum concentrations of oil and isoflavones in soybean seed were estimated to be similar to those for maximum yield. Soils with stratified soil test K appeared to require higher critical levels of leaf K. wheat at two locations and corn at the third. Treatments included both rates and place-ment (broadcast vs. banded) of K fertilizer at all sites, and fall disk tillage to a depth of 4 in. as a variable at two of the sites. All remaining treatments were grown with no tillage. The investigations involved a total of four varieties; soybean <b>row</b> <b>widths</b> were consistently at 15 or 7. 5 in. Further treat...|$|R
