40|$|The Wireless Network Design Problem (WND) {{consists}} in choosing values of <b>radio-electrical</b> parameters of transmitters of a wireless network, to maximize network coverage. We present a pure 0 - 1 Linear Programming formulation for the WND that may contain an exponential number of constraints. Violated inequalities of this formulation {{are hard to}} separate both theoretically and in practice. However, a relevant subset of such inequalities can be separated more efficiently in practice {{and can be used}} to strengthen classical MILP formulations for the WND. Preliminary computational experience confirms the effectiveness of our new technique both in terms of quality of solutions found and provided bounds. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{concentrates}} on 'worker flirting' {{as one of}} the forms of interactional ritual in the culture of an organization. It is thus only an illustration of the interactional dimension of the culture of an organization. The paper deals with interactional ritual in an industrial organization and is based on an empirical study carried out in a <b>radio-electrical</b> plant, "Z," which employs 1, 500 workers. The author carried out a period of three-months covert participant observation and recorded 139 free-interviews. These were supplemented by three months of covert participant observation by the author's collaborator, himself a worker at the plant. The study also included 21 one-week periods of covert participant observation in other plants. The research and analytical procedures utilized in this study have been taken mainly from the work by Glaser and Strauss, The Discovery of Grounded Theory (1967; see also Glaser 1978; Turner 1981; and Martin and Turner 1986).

40|$|The DORIS system (Doppler Orbitography and Radio {{positioning}} Integrated by Satellite) {{was designed}} and developed by CNES, the National Geographic Institute, IGN (Institut G 6 ographique National), and the Space Geodesy Research Group, GRGS (Groupe de Recherches de Geodesie Spatiale - CNES/CNRS/Universite Paul Sabatier) to meet new needs for the precise determination of satellite positions on their orbits and for precise positioning of terrestrial beacons. This system has been carried since 1990 on the French SPOT 2 satellite, since 1992 on the French/American satellite TOPEX/POSEIDON, and since 1998 on the French SPOT 4 satellite. It {{will be part of}} the JASON (CNES/NASA) and ENVISAT (ESA) altimetric missions and also the SPOT follow-on Earth observation missions. DORIS is a <b>radio-electrical</b> system which takes Doppler measurements between a satellite in low orbit and a permanent global network for the purpose, on the one hand, of determining the satellite's position in orbit, and on the other hand, of locating ground beacons with a high degree of precision...|$|E
40|$|Transmitters and {{receivers}} are {{the basic}} elements of wireless networks and are characterized by a number of <b>radio-electrical</b> parameters. The generic planning problem consists in establishing suitable values for these parameters so as to optimize some network performance indicator. The version here addressed, namely the Power Assignment Problem (pap), is the problem of assigning transmission powers to the transmitters of a wirelessnetwork so as to maximize the satisfied demand. This problem has relevant practical applications both in radio-broadcasting and in mobile telephony. Typical solution approaches make use of mixed integer linear programs with huge coefficients in the constraint matrix yielding numerical inaccuracy and poor bounds and cannot be exploited to solve large instances of practical interest. In order to overcome these inconveniences, we developed a two-phase heuristic to solve large instances of pap, namely a constructive heuristic followed by an improving local search. Both phases are based on successive shortest path computations on suitable directed graphs. Computational tests on a number of instances arising {{in the design of the}} Italian Digital Video Broadcasting are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{property}} {{investigation of}} strong electromagnetic waves, propagation in quantum superlattices, is {{the aim of}} the paper as well as the clearing up of new physical laws, conditioned, in main, by the finitude of the permitted zone width and the periodicity of an energy spectrum of charge carriers. As a result the possibility of the electromagnetic brizer propagation in quantum superlattices has been forecasted. The brizer-electrical effect has been investigated. The <b>radio-electrical</b> effect at the light propagation along a superlattice axis has been investigated for the first time. The dependence of the free charge carrier increase current on parameters of non-linear waves has been determined. The time of the non-linear wave run in quantum superlattices has been found. The high frequency effect of Frantz-Keldysh in quantum superlattices has been represented. Recommendations {{for the use of the}} Frantz-Keldysh effect in quantum superlattices has been given. The paper results may find their field of application in the extension of the element base for devices of solid-state electronicsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
