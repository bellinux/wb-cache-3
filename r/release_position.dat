40|$|A multi-anabranch {{river with}} three braid bars {{is a typical}} river pattern in nature, but no studies have been {{conducted}} to describe mixing characteristics of pollutants in the river. In this study, a physical model of a typical multi-anabranch river with three braid bars was established to explore the pollutant mixing characteristics in different branches. The multi-anabranch reach was separated into seven branches, B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4, B 5, B 6, and B 7, by three braid bars. Five tracer <b>release</b> <b>positions</b> located 2. 9 m upstream from the inlet section of the multi-anabranch reach were adopted, and the distances from the five positions to the left bank of the upstream main channel were 1 / 6 B, 1 / 3 B, 1 / 2 B, 2 / 3 B, and 5 / 6 B(B is the width of the upstream main channel), respectively. The longitudinal velocities and pollutant concentrations in the seven branches were measured. The planar flow field and mixing characteristics of pollutants from the bottom to the surface in the multi-anabranch river were obtained and analyzed. The results show that the pollutant <b>release</b> <b>positions</b> are the main influencing factors in the pollutant transport process, and the diversion points and pollutant <b>release</b> <b>positions</b> jointly influence the percentage ratios of the pollutant fluxes in branches B 1, B 2, and B 3 to the pollutant flux in the upstream main channel...|$|R

40|$|The {{machine of}} this {{invention}} {{provides for the}} forming of large round bales, weighing from a half a ton to a ton, from a windrowed ?brous material such as hay or the like, transporting the bales to a storage <b>position,</b> and <b>releasing</b> the bales at the storage position. A pair of transversely spaced swing arms are supported on a portable frame unit for up and down pivotal movement between bale <b>releasing</b> <b>positions</b> projected rearwardly of the frame unit to for wardly projected bale forming positions, and for pivotal movement toward and {{away from each other}} in either the bale forming or bale <b>releasing</b> <b>positions</b> therefor. A rotata ble material wrapping and bale supporting spindle is car ried at the free end of each arm so that when the arms are in their bale forming positions, the spindles project in wardly toward each other from the opposite ends of a bale forming compartment that extends transversely of the frame unit. With the swing arms in their bale forming positions and on a forward advance of the frame unit along a windrow, the windrowed material is picked up and directed into the bale forming compartment where it is engaged by the spindles for wrapping thereon. As the ma terial is wrapped it is yieldably con?ned about the spindles to give satisfactory compactness or density to the com pleted bale. When the bale is completed and while in the bale forming compartment it may be transported to a stor age position.

50|$|The knuckleball is also {{employed}} by the Indian cricket fast bowler Zaheer Khan as his slower delivery. The physics of the operation are largely the same. However, the seam on a cricket ball is equatorial, and thus the extent of erratic movement is reduced due to the symmetry (at least in the conventional <b>release</b> <b>position</b> where the planes of the ball's trajectory and the seam are nearly co-planar). In addition, the lack of backspin does shorten {{the length of the}} delivery, and also tends to make the ball skid off the pitch—faster than it would come off a normal delivery.|$|E

While riding the train, you will likely hear the hiss of air being released from the brake cylinders as the train goes into the long horseshoe curve, where the grade is flat enough to maintain speed and recharge the brake pipe at the same time. As the engine nears the end of the curve, another set is generally made progressively and will be maintained until the Thunderhead Gap bridge, where the process is repeated and the final application is made for the descent into the lower loop. Once on the lower loop, the train drifts past the engine house and pulls the light grade back into the station.|$|E

The nose weapons were later augmented by four fixed guns, two each side, in the forward fuselage that were fired by the pilot.
