5000|$|The {{village is}} located on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Bridge 92, to the south of the village, also known as Millfield Bridge, is a Grade II listed {{building}} and is described by English Heritage as: [...] "Accommodation bridge over Leeds-Liverpool Canal. 1811-16, Supervising Engineer probably Joseph Priestley. Squared sandstone. Elliptical portal with rusticated voussoirs and keystone, band, parapet with <b>ridge</b> <b>coping,</b> pilastered ends to curved keepers".|$|E
50|$|Though {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to a gargoyle, a hunky punk is an architectural feature that is purely decorative, {{with no other}} functional purpose (often {{referred to as a}} grotesque). Strictly a gargoyle is not a hunky punk because it serves to drain water off the roof through its mouth. An example might be found at the corner of a church tower, along the <b>coping</b> <b>ridge</b> below any castellations. Often there are carvings on each corner, yet the roof may only drain in one direction and so there might be three hunky punks and one true gargoyle.|$|R
50|$|The House is a Grade II listed {{building}} made of rock-faced limestone with ashlar dressings and steeply pitched Welsh slate roofs, with decorative <b>ridge</b> tiles. Ashlar <b>coped</b> gables with moulded kneelers and finials. North front entrance has central projecting gabled wing, with single storey, lean to, porch to the left. The doorway has a pointed arched moulded ashlar surround, with marble shafts, and hood mould. Above is a moulded ashlar parapet pierced with quatrofoils. To the right a 2-light chamfered window, with tracery, above a single plain sash, {{in a flat}} headed chamfered surround, with a pointed inner arch. Above again a 3-light, chamfered mullion window, with a taller central light with cusped heads. At the north-west corner a circular or 'candle wick' tower, of 3 storeys, the lower 2 storeys have 3 single light chamfered lancets, with quatrefoil tracery. The building stands in 4 acre of mature grounds with over 40 preserved trees.|$|R
50|$|The loy was {{traditionally}} {{used for}} cultivating the potato. In the 19th century, these were grown in a potato ridge, sometimes {{known as a}} lazy bed. Sods were turned from either side to form the ridge. This was sometimes called copin the sods, and the sods forming {{the sides of the}} <b>ridge</b> were called <b>cope</b> sods. A sod of earth about 2 feet (60 cm) wide {{on each side of the}} intended ridge was lifted by the loy and turned over so that the grassy sides were together. Manure was spread on the ridge part first. Narrow ridges were most often made with sets of around twelve sods. Loy ploughing took place on very small farms or on very hilly ground, where horses could not work or where farmers could not afford them and were used up until the 1960s in poorer land. This suited the moist climate of Ireland as the trenches formed by turning in the sods provided drainage. It also allowed the growing of potatoes in bogs as well as on mountain slopes where no other cultivation could take place.|$|R
6000|$|The {{ruins of}} Shaghab are built upon a more {{complicated}} site than those of Shuwák. The position is charming. The Wady Shaghab, flowing to the south, here spreads out in a broad bulge or basin open to the west. Down-stream we see a [...] "gate" [...] formed by the meeting of two rocky tongue-tips, both showing large works. Beyond these narrows the valley bends to the south-west and feeds the Wady Aznab, which falls into the sea south of the Dámah. The mass of the ruined city lies upon the left bank, where a high and artificial-looking remblai of earth masks an eastern influent, the Wady el-Aslah (Athlah), or [...] "of the Kali-plant." [...] It drains the mountain of the same name, and the Jebel Zigláb (Zijláb), the cones of pale granite visible from Shuwák; and upon its broad mouth the old settlement stood à cheval. A little north of west rises profiled the great Shárr, no longer a <b>ridge</b> with a <b>coping</b> of four horns, but a tall and portly block, from whose summit spring heads and peaks of airy blue-pink. Slightly east of north the twins Naghar and Nughayr, combining to form the [...] "Mountain of the Maker" [...] (Jebel el-Sáni'), tower {{in the shape of}} a huge pyramid. Lastly, a regular ascent, the Majrá el-Wághir, fronts the city, sloping up to the west-north-west, and discloses a view of the Jibál el-Tihámah: this broad incline was, some three centuries ago, the route of the Hajj-caravan.|$|R
