50|$|Most servos are rotary {{actuators}} although other types are available.

50|$|A {{servomotor}} is a <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> or {{linear actuator}} {{that allows for}} precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module designed specifically for use with servomotors.|$|E
40|$|A fuzzy robust {{nonlinear}} controller for hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators</b> {{in flight}} motion simulators is proposed. Compared with other three-order models of hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators,</b> the proposed controller based on first-order nonlinear model is more easily applied in practice, whose control law is relatively simple. It {{not only does}} not need high-order derivative of desired command, but also {{does not require the}} feedback signals of velocity, acceleration and jerk of hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators.</b> Another advantage {{is that it does not}} rely on any information of friction, inertia force and external disturbing force/torque, which are always difficult to resolve in flight motion simulators. Due to the special composite vane seals of rectangular cross-section and goalpost shape used in hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators,</b> the leakage model is more complicated than that of traditional linear hydraulic cylinders. Adaptive multi-input single-output (MISO) fuzzy compensators are introduced to estimate nonlinear uncertain functions about leakage and bulk modulus. Meanwhile, the decomposition of the uncertainties is used to reduce the total number of fuzzy rules. Different from other adaptive fuzzy compensators, a discontinuous projection mapping is employed to guarantee the estimation process to be bounded. Furthermore, with a sufficient number of fuzzy rules, the controller theoretically can guarantee asymptotic tracking performance in the presence of the above uncertainties, which is very important for high-accuracy tracking control of flight motion simulators. Comparative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which can guarantee transient performance and better final accurate tracking in the presence of uncertain nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties...|$|R

In the early 2000s the 8-speed Nexus hub gear was introduced, having two stepped planetary series mounted downstream of each other. The hub was operated with a twist shifter. By November 2006, The Nexus range came in several ranges (Inter 3, Inter 7 and Inter 8) providing 3, 7 and 8 speed models respectively.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{concerns}} {{the design and}} optimization of a <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> of which the rotor {{is attached to a}} linear actuator inside a two degree-of-freedom zφ-module, which is part of a pick-and-place robot. The <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> provides ± 180 ° rotation, while the linear actuator offers a z-motion of ± 5 mm. In the paper, the optimal combinations of magnet poles and coils are determined for this slotless actuator with concentrated windings. Based on this analysis, the <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> is optimized using a multi-physical framework, which contains a coupled electromagnetic, mechanical and thermal model.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{necessity to}} miniaturize smooth torque <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators</b> has placed severe {{constraints on the}} current slotless permanent-magnet technology. These constraints are mainly the consequence of the relatively large effective magnetic airgap which limits the achievable magnetic loading and, therefore, the torque density of slotless permanent-magnet <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators.</b> Further, the miniaturization has to be achieved at ever-decreasing costs and, therefore, it would be advantageous to implement solid back irons. However this, even at reduced magnetic loading, still results in considerable eddy-current losses. Therefore, a careful selection of the various actuator dimensions and most appropriate soft magnetic laminated or solid material {{is a prerequisite for}} applications that require smooth speed and torque characteristic. This paper will identify the influence of various parameters of the slotless permanent-magnet actuator on the eddy-current loss in the back iron using both 2 -D and 3 -D finite-element analysis...|$|R

Thus, we have been focused on microrobots that can locomote using step patterns. We are studying insect-type microrobot systems. The locomotion of the microrobot is generated by rotational movements of the shape memory alloy-type <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator.</b> In addition, we have constructed artificial neural networks by using analog integrated circuit (IC) technology. The artificial neural networks can output the driving waveform without using software programs. The shape memory alloy-type <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> and the artificial neural networks are constructed with silicon wafers; they can be integrated by using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technology. As a result, the MEMS microrobot system can locomote using step patterns. The insect-type MEMS microrobot system is 0. 079 g in weight and less than 5. 0 mm in size, and its locomotion speed is 2 mm/min. The locomotion speed is slow because the heat of the shape memory alloy conducts to the mechanical parts of the MEMS microrobot.

To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. The independent analysis results for the Orbiter Rudder/Speedbrake Actuation Mechanism is documented. The function of the Rudder/Speedbrake (RSB) is to provide directional control {{and to provide a}} means of energy control during entry. The system consists of two panels on a vertical hinge mounted on the aft part of the vertical stabilizer. These two panels move together to form a rudder but split apart to make a speedbrake.
