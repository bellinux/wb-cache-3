Porsche, not necessarily a <b>rival</b> <b>car</b> manufacturer, has claimed Nissan overstated the GT-R's performance in September 2008. Porsche, unusually, claims to have conducted a test of a factory stock, European market GT-R and achieved a slower time (of 7:54), apparently implying that the car isn't as fast around this public road as Nissan claims and/or that their driver isn't as talented as Nissans. Nissan disputed the former and implied the later claim in October 2008.|$|E

[...] Released in November 1974, and running on Taito Discrete Logic hardware, the game featured sprites with collision detection. The game's most important innovation was its introduction of scrolling graphics, where the sprites moved along a vertical scrolling overhead track, with the course width becoming wider or narrower as the player's car moves up the road, while the player races against other <b>rival</b> <b>cars,</b> more of which appear as the score increases. The faster the player's car drives, the more the score increases.|$|R

50|$|Ford {{was also}} {{motivated}} {{by a desire to}} squeeze out his minority shareholders, especially the Dodge brothers, whom he suspected (correctly) of using their Ford dividends to build a <b>rival</b> <b>car</b> company. By cutting off their dividends, Ford hoped to starve the Dodges of capital to fuel their growth. In that context, the Dodge decision is viewed as a mixed result for both sides of the dispute. Ford was denied the ability to arbitrarily undermine the profitability of the firm, and thereby eliminate future dividends. Under the upheld business judgment rule, however, Ford was given considerable leeway via control of his board about what investments he could make. That left him with considerable influence over dividends, but not complete control as he wished.|$|E
