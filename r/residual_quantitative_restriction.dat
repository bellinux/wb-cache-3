40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} Canadian pension funds relative to those from the UK and US, {{in the light of}} the ongoing <b>quantitative</b> asset <b>restrictions</b> that still apply in Canada, compared with the purer prudent person approach in the UK and US. We find that although Canadian funds often obtain better combinations of return and risk, returns are often less than could be obtained given financial market conditions, as shown by dummy portfolios split evenly between bonds and equities, or diversified into real estate, as well as mean-variance optimal portfolios. In contrast, UK and US funds typically outperform such benchmarks. Combined with criticisms of specific Canadian regulations in the light of finance theory and empirical evidence, the paper makes a case for removal of <b>residual</b> <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> in Canada, and their replacement by sole prudent person regulations...|$|R

In the context of a Ricardo–Viner dynamic trade model, it is shown that when a binding <b>quantitative</b> <b>restriction</b> regulates extraction of a natural resource, free trade is optimal. This is true even if the <b>quantitative</b> <b>restriction</b> is not optimal.

40|$|The subject {{developed}} in my thesis {{relates to the}} "Exclusions from prohibition of quantitative restrictions". The origin of these exclusions {{can be found in}} the internal market law and more precisely in the free movement of goods. The free movement of goods is one of the four fundamental freedoms on which is based the internal market of the European Union. The free movement of goods is ensured by removing fiscal and non-fiscal barriers that hinder trade between Member States and which are prohibited between Member States. The fiscal barriers involve the prohibition between Member States of customs duties, all charges having equivalent effect and other fiscal barriers such as internal taxations. The non fiscal barriers involve direct <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> which are quotas and bans, as well as measures having equivalent effect to <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> (MEE). These non fiscal barriers are prohibited but they can be justified in some cases. Direct <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> almost disappeared while measures having equivalent effect to <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> may exist in various forms and variations. Measures having equivalent effect on imports are prohibited by the article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Moreover, measures having equivalent effect on exports are prohibited by [...] ...|$|R

In the 1960 s the deleterious effects of protectionist policies on resource allocation were recognized and the emphasis was changed in favour of import liberalization, i. e. the replacement of <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> by tariffs and the eventual reduction of the tariffs. In recognition of the discontinuity of import policy the paper is divided into two parts reflecting the two phases. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{popularity}} of mobile and networked applications {{has resulted in}} an increased demand for execution “sandboxes”—environments that impose irrevocable restrictions on resource usage. Existing approaches rely on kernel modification for enforcing <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> (e. g., limiting CPU utilization of an application to 25 %). However, the general applicability of such approaches is constrained by the difficulty of modifying shrink-wrapped operating systems such as Windows NT. This paper presents a user-level sandboxing approach for enforcing <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> on resource usage of applications. Our approach actively monitors an application’s interactions with the underlying system, proactively controlling them to enforce the desired behavior. Our approach leverages a core set of user-level mechanisms that are available in most modern operating systems: fine-grained timers, monitoring infrastructure, debugger processes, priority-based scheduling, and pagebased memory protection. We describe implementation of a sandbox on Windows NT that imposes <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> on CPU, memory, and network usage. Our results show that application usage of system resources can be restricted to within 3 % of desired limits with minimal run-time overhead. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{approach}} the normative analysis of paternalistic laws.

We develop a normative framework from the literature and apply it to the restrictions. It shows that the <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> apparently rest on a misunderstanding of structural change and can therefore hardly be justified, whereas the price allegation protects from information asymmetries which would lead to unfair results. Hence it can be shown that a normative analysis of paternalistic interventions can produce meaningful results. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|A computable general {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} used to examine effects of removing U. S. tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. The model differs from traditional disaggregated trade models in its attention to intertemporal decision-making, adjustment dynamics, and international capital mobility. Unilateral elimination of tariffs would reduce the welfare of U. S. households by 0. 4 percent. Elimination of <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions,</b> in contrast, would increase U. S. welfare by 1. 1 percent. The international cross-ownership of capital associated with internationally mobile capital significantly influences the distribution of capital gains and losses from trade liberalization. Disregarding cross-ownership leads to understatement of the domestic welfare losses from tariff removal and overstatement of the domestic welfare gains from eliminating <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|The nineties {{represent}} {{a paradigm shift}} in India’s economic policy making. The period witnessed significant changes in trade and industrial policies opening more avenues for private initiatives in the economy signaling {{a departure from the}} state-directed planned industrialization. The policy changes involved a concerted effort to integrate India {{with the rest of the}} world, by liberalizing trade, which could be classified into two broad groups: (a) those which were intended to reduce domestic distortions and (b) those intended to ease trade with the rest of the world. The rationale for import liberalisation by way of reduction in tariff rates and a movement away from the <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> was to bring cost reduction via lowering the prices of intermediate inputs and to enhance competitiveness of the final products. Controls via <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> which accounted for 90 per cent of items in the pre 1991 era, decreased dramatically to 51 per cent even as early as in 1994 – 95 (Joshi and Little, 1996). Along with this movement away from <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> there were also substantial reductions in the tariff rate, from 77 per cent in 1989 – 90 to 29 per cent in 2005 – 06 (Kathuria et al., 2011).|$|R
