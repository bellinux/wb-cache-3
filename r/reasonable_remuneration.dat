If A lets B have the use of his horses on the terms that he gives them fair and reasonable treatment, I have no doubt that it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, surely the State in stipulating for fair and <b>reasonable</b> <b>remuneration</b> for the employees means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is twofold; firstly, to use data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) to estimate the technical efficiencies of Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) -listed companies (per industry) to convert the multiple components of CEO remuneration into multiple company determinants, namely size and performance indicators, and secondly, to develop an efficiency frontier to serve as a benchmark to suggest acceptable CEO remuneration levels. An empirical study was executed on a sample of 221 JSE-listed companies. Cross-sectional data of CEO remuneration and company determinants were obtained from the McGregor BFA database for the 2010 financial year. The study found that CEOs from 80 of the 221 companies included in the sample emerged as the benchmark CEOs and formed the efficiency frontier against which inefficient CEOs were compared. The practical value is that remuneration committees can use this model, which is based on best practices, to simplify the structuring of <b>reasonable</b> CEO <b>remuneration</b> packages.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how {{an appropriate}} theoretical framework for Intellectual Property may be constructed. Such a framework {{would be the}} lens through which contested IP issues may be resolved and upon which national IP policy and legislation might be based. The paper begins by highlighting the inherent tensions in IP, which are caused by the various stakeholder interests that this body of law seeks to balance, and by the cross-cutting nature of IP. It contends {{that in order to}} more equitably balance the contesting rights of the creators and users, IP rights should be formulated and enforced so as to meet societal goals or serve public interest, be responsive to the economic environment, and take cognisance of the human rights claims of both creators and users. National socio-economic goals should inform such a framework in a way that ensures that IP is used as a means to achieve these goals and is not perceived as an end. This will require nuances in policy and legislation that meet the country's needs. In particular, as a developing country South Africa would do well to exploit available flexibilities in the various international IP agreements by which it is bound. Due regard also ought to be had to the users' need for affordable access to IP-protected goods in order that they may exercise the right to work and access to knowledge, as provided for by ss 22 and 16 of the Constitution respectively. Similarly, creators ought to be given due recognition, together with <b>reasonable</b> reward and <b>remuneration</b> for their efforts. This will be achieved through the creation of an IP system that provides protection that is compatible with the nature of the good being protected {{and the manner in which}} the creative process unfolds. Such protection should rely on registration systems are efficient, simplified and affordable. The accompanying enforcement system should be equally accessible, although the costs of enforcement would depend on the forum used to secure redress. Finally, the resulting IP regulatory framework should be both certain and clear. ...|$|R

50|$|Higgins's {{judgment}} read as follows:One {{finds that}} the Legislation has not indicated {{what is meant by}} 'fair and reasonable,' what is the model or criterion by which fairness and reasonableness are to be determined. It is to be regretted that the Legislature has not given a definition of the words. It is the function of the Legislature, not of the Judiciary, to deal with social and economic problems; it is for the Judiciary to apply, and, when necessary, interpret the enactments of the Legislature. But here this whole controversial problem, with its grave social and economic bearings, has been committed to a judge, who is not, at least directly, responsible, and who ought not to be responsible to public opinion. even if the delegation of duties should be successful in this case, it by no means follows that it will be so hereafter. I do not protest against the difficulty of the problem, but against the confusion of functions and against the failure to define, the shunting of legislative responsibility. It would be almost as reasonable to tell a Court to do what is 'right' with regard to real estate, and yet lay down no laws or principles for its guidance. In the course of the long discussion of this case, I have been convinced that the President of this Court is put in a false position. The strength of the Judiciary in the public confidence is largely owing {{to the fact that the}} judge has not to devise great principles of action as between great classes, or to lay down what is fair and reasonable between contending interests in the community; but has to carry out mandates of the Legislature evolved out of the conflict of public opinion after debate in Parliament. I venture to think that it will not be found wise to bring the judicial department within the range of political fire....The provision for 'fair and reasonable' remuneration is obviously designed for the benefit of the employees in the industry; and it must be meant to secure to them something which they cannot get by the ordinary system of individual bargaining with employers....The standard of 'fair and reasonable' must therefore be something else, and I cannot think of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of an average employee, regarded as a human being in a civilised community. If, instead of individual bargaining, one can conceive of a collective agreement - an agreement between all the employers in a given trade on the one side, and all the employees on the other - it seems to me that the framers of the agreement would have to take as the first and dominant factor the cost of living as a civilised being.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{movement}} towards community-based {{health care for the}} treatment and management of alcohol and drug problems across Australia.

Thus, GPs 2 ̆ 7 views on this issue are vital {{if there is to be}} any form of viable home detoxification programme for alcohol and/or other drugs. A qualitative study was undertaken to determine General Practitioners 2 ̆ 7 views in regard to alcohol and drug home detoxification. A qualitative data collection method, focus groups, was used. Focus group participants were obtained from a maximum variation sampling technique. Twelve focus groups were conducted in rural and metropolitan Queensland Australia, over a four-month period. Fifty-two participants (43 general practitioners and 9 other health professionals, 20 females and 32 males). Mean age was 40. 5 years (age range 19 – 70). Views about home detoxification were dependent on level of experience with substance abuse treatment. Overwhelmingly, GPs argued that for home detoxification to become viable, there would need to be a more responsive infrastructure, clear policy guidelines, training and more <b>reasonable</b> <b>remuneration</b> than currently exists. GPs require improved training in addiction and drug and alcohol problems. Revised remuneration schemes will facilitate better GP management of complex chronic problems such as addiction. Even though GPs 2 ̆ 7 held quite negative views about alcohol and drug dependent patients there was a high level of willingness to become involved in their treatment and support.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{movement}} in the nominal and real remuneration of two selected positions in the South African public sector over the period 1984 to 2008. Over this period a divergent trend is discernible in the nominal and real remuneration of these two positions. The choice of positions {{in the public sector}} was determined by the availability of historic and current remuneration information and {{by the fact that the}} designations and responsibilities of these positions seemingly remained homogeneous over the period of comparison. South Africa has suffered considerable “job title” inflation over this period, thereby rendering numerous positions unsuitable for comparative purposes. In comparing the remuneration of these two positions in real terms; on a gross and after tax basis; and in terms of increases in prices of selected goods, this paper tests a hypothesis that cost-of-living adjustments in remuneration kept abreast of inflation and of general price increases over the period 1984 to 2008. The comparison confirms the hypothesis in one instance, but refutes it in another instance. This comparison confirms that periodic remuneration adjustments are necessary under conditions of sustained inflation to take account of cost-of-living increases. Without such adjustments incumbents would increasingly experience declines in their standards of living and would be tempted to leave the public sector for better paying positions in the private sector. Oneoff structural adjustments are required to re-align relative remuneration of positions once adjustments have not kept abreast of inflation. In as much as the remuneration of one of the groups used for comparative purposes declined in real terms (i. e. did not keep pace with inflation), it is obvious that the remuneration adjustments of this group did not take any cognisance of possible improvements in productivity. Any compensation for productivity improvements during a period of sustained inflation (albeit more moderate towards the second half of the period of comparison) as was the case in South Africa between 1984 and 2008, would have been reflected in a real improvement in remuneration over this period. Compensation for productivity improvements are outside the scope of this paper. The comparison of the prices of selected goods purchased by a typical household shows considerable changes in relative prices. During a period of sustained inflation, as South Africa suffered from 1984 to 2008 (albeit more moderate from the middle of the 1990 s), price movements reflecting relative price changes are often confused with general price inflation. This impedes the ability of consumers to adjust their spending patterns to reflect changes in relative prices. Over time this inability could contribute to a misallocation of resources in an economy. The methodology developed in this paper can be used for similar comparisons of nominal and real remuneration outside the public sector. The only conditions for such comparisons are the availability of current and historic remuneration information, positions that remained relatively homogeneous in terms of job title and responsibility over the period of comparison, and inflation figures reflected in some or another price index. Likewise, the only conditions for price comparisons are historic and current price data and a relevant price index. The final conclusion is that some restructuring of remuneration in the public sector could be required to ensure the retention of suitably qualified staff. The methodology applied in this paper can be used to calculate the magnitude of structural adjustments required in the public sector to eradicate real declines in remuneration. This methodology can also be used by negotiators to calculate fair and <b>reasonable</b> <b>remuneration</b> adjustments. The fields of application of this methodology developed from the perspective of the economic science are therefore in general management, the management of human resources and organised labour. Hierdie artikel vergelyk die vergoeding van twee poste in die Suid-Afrikaanse openbare sektor in 1984 en in 2008. Drie wyses van vergelyking, naamlik ’n bruto grondslag; na die berekening van belasting; en in vergelyking met prysveranderings van ’n geselekteerde mandjie verbruikersgoedere, word gebruik om ’n hipotese te toets dat lewenskoste-aanpassings in die Suid-Afrikaanse openbare sektor tussen 1984 en 2008 met inflasie en prysstygings oor hierdie tydperk tred gehou het. Die vergelyking bevestig die hipotese vir een pos, maar verwerp dit in die ander geval. As vergoeding nie periodiek vir inflasie aangepas word nie, is eenmalige strukturele vergoedingsaanpassings die enigste wyse waardeur relatiewe vergoedingsvlakke tot hul vorige vlakke herstel kan word. Die metodologie wat in hierdie artikel verduidelik word, kan gebruik word om billike vergoedingsaanpassings te bereken en om vas te stel of strukturele aanpassings nodig is.
