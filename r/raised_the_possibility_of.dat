5|$|Field's {{failure to}} secure {{independence}} concurrently {{with the end}} of the Federation caused his Cabinet's support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction with him on the grounds that the British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a European and American science team at the 1.2m Leonhard Euler Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which further <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> {{the existence of a}} planet in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE spectrograph on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing binary star system.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna with its peculiar orbit in 2004 {{led to the}} conclusion that something beyond the known eight planets had perturbed Sedna away from the Kuiper belt. That object could have been an unknown planet on a distant orbit, a random star that passed near the Solar System, or a member of the Sun's birth cluster. The announcement in March 2014 of the {{discovery of}} a second sednoid, , which shared some orbital characteristics with Sedna and other extreme trans-Neptunian objects, further <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> an unseen super-Earth in a large orbit.|$|E

5|$|In 1969 RAF Duxford, a Royal Air Force fighter {{airfield}} in Cambridgeshire {{was declared}} surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence. Needing further space, the museum duly requested {{permission to use}} part of the site as temporary storage. The entire site was later transferred to the museum in February 1976 and Duxford, now referred to as Imperial War Museum Duxford became the museum's first branch. Also during the 1970s the government <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> the museum taking over the historic Cabinet War Rooms in Whitehall. The museum was reluctant due to its new commitments related to Duxford and HMS Belfast, but agreed in 1982.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, Smyth <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> {{producing}} an unclassified {{report for the}} general public on the achievements of the Manhattan Project. The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, supported the idea. He arranged a meeting with James B. Conant, the President of Harvard University and one of the senior administrators of the Manhattan Project, who had similar thoughts. Conant took up the matter with the Manhattan Project's director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.. In April, Smyth received a formal letter from Groves asking him to write such a report. Both the report and the choice of Smyth as its author were approved by the Manhattan Project’s governing body, the Military Policy Committee, in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|Simonsohn also <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> reverse {{causality}} in {{the case}} of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.But Simonsohn suspected that, likeWalt Disney working for Disney, many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.|$|E

5|$|The Commonwealth's {{struggles with}} the Cossacks were being paid {{attention}} to at Moscow's Kremlin, which from the late 1620s began regarding Cossacks as a potent source of fundamental instability in the Polish–Lithuanian rival and neighbor. Russian efforts to destabilize the Polish Kingdom using Cossacks in the 1630s were not yet successful, even though the Cossack elders themselves often <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> a union with the Tsardom to pressure Poland's ruling elites. The borderlands with Russia had become a place of refuge for Cossacks persecuted after their failed uprisings; regiments of Russian-registered Cossacks, following the Commonwealth example, were eventually established there.|$|E
5|$|During the {{suspension}} of competitive football in the First World War, Hyde Road was used to stable 300horses. Later in the wartime period the club became the sole leaseholder of the ground, no longer dependent upon support from Chesters brewery. At this point the annual rent was £500. In 1920, the ground became the first football venue outside London to be visited by a reigning monarch; King George V attended the ground to watch a match between Manchester City and Liverpool. In November a fire caused by a cigarette end destroyed the Main Stand, and Manchester City began to seek a new home. Initial discussions <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> sharing Old Trafford with neighbours Manchester United, but United's proposed rent was prohibitive, so repair work was undertaken and Manchester City continued to play at Hyde Road.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the US Secretary of Defense, Charles E. Wilson, <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> a joint {{ballistic}} missile programme with the Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys. This {{resulted in an}} agreement on collaboration being signed on 12 August 1954, and a British Medium Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) development project codenamed Blue Streak. The United States pursued Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) development in parallel. Indeed, it had two IRBM projects: the US Army's Jupiter and the USAF's Thor. When Sandys, now the Minister of Defence, visited the United States in January 1957, he found the Americans anxious to deploy IRBMs in Britain. Macmillan and Eisenhower agreed to do so during their summit in Bermuda in March 1957, and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, {{although it was not}} until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E

5|$|There {{remained}} {{the prospect of}} American assistance. In secret talks in Washington, D.C., in June 1939, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William D. Leahy <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> an American fleet being sent to Singapore. In April 1940, the American naval attaché in London, Captain Alan Kirk, approached the Vice Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Phillips, to ask if, {{in the event of}} the United States Fleet being sent to the Far East, the docking facilities at Singapore could be made available, as those at Subic Bay were inadequate. He received full assurances that they would be. Hopes for American assistance were dashed at the staff conference in Washington, D.C., in February 1941. The U.S. Navy was primarily focused on the Atlantic. The American chiefs envisaged relieving British warships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean so a British fleet could be sent to the Far East.|$|E
5|$|Bradley <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> using {{nuclear weapons}} in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, {{but there was no}} support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo {{suggesting}} that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of {{nuclear weapons in}} Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, Coast Guard {{intelligence}} officials <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> significant security {{risks associated with}} the management of some U.S. port operations by a Dubai company, stating in a report that broad intelligence gaps prevented them from assessing the risks.|$|E

25|$|To {{encourage}} participation, {{the court}} offered to remove districts from the NAACP's lawsuit (resulting in four districts offering to participate), then <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> consolidating the area's districts into a metropolitan district if more districts did not volunteer (resulting {{in nearly all}} suburban districts agreeing to participate).|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, several people were {{instrumental}} {{in the establishment of}} the Boston Public Library. George Ticknor, a Harvard professor and trustee of the Boston Athenaeum, <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> establishing a public library in Boston beginning as early as 1826. At the time, Ticknor could not generate enough interest.|$|E

25|$|The work of Bell <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> {{using these}} super-strong {{correlations}} {{as a resource}} for communication. It led to the discovery of quantum key distribution protocols, most famously BB84 by Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard and E91 by Artur Ekert. Although BB84 does not use entanglement, Ekert's protocol uses the violation of a Bell's inequality as a proof of security.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, a {{study in}} Bombay found the {{prevalence}} of T. gondii in strict vegetarians {{to be similar to}} that found in nonvegetarians. This <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> a third major route of infection, beyond congenital and carnivorous transmission. In 1970, the existence of oocysts was discovered in cat feces, and the fecal-oral route of infection via oocysts was demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March, Michel Abu Arraj, the Lebanese {{magistrate}} {{responsible for}} the internal Lebanese investigation of the assassination asked to be excused, citing a heavy court schedule. The Judicial Council of Lebanon was expected to rule on his request the next day.
