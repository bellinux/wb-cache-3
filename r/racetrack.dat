5|$|In 1955, the New York Racing Association {{chose to}} upgrade Aqueduct <b>Racetrack</b> in South Ozone Park {{in part because}} of its {{proximity}} to the Rockaway Beach Branch. As part of the modernization of the <b>racetrack,</b> the Racing Association built a station with ramps leading directly to the track and facilities that could handle <b>racetrack</b> crowds. Once the work was finished, it was handed over to the city. The new station was for northbound trains to Brooklyn and Manhattan, and it was built north of the existing Aqueduct station. In order to allow for the switching maneuvers required for southbound trains to stop at the station, major signal changes were made on the line. The single-platform station was built by Aqueduct <b>Racetrack</b> owners at the cost of $1 million. The Aqueduct <b>Racetrack</b> station opened on September 14, 1959, on the same date as the renovated Aqueduct <b>Racetrack.</b>|$|E
5|$|Training for the Beta tracks {{shifted from}} the XAX to the XBX {{training}} and development <b>racetrack</b> in November 1943. A second Alpha I <b>racetrack</b> became operational in January 1944. The first Beta <b>racetrack</b> and the third and first Alpha racetracks, now repaired, became operational in March 1944, and the fourth Alpha <b>racetrack</b> in April 1944. A third building, 9201-3, contained a fifth <b>racetrack</b> that incorporated some modifications, and was known as Alpha I. This became operational on 3 June 1944. Work on the Alpha and Beta chemistry buildings, 9202 and 9203, commenced in February 1943, and was completed in September. Work on the Beta process building, 9204-1, began in May 1943, and was ready for operation on 13 March 1944, but was not completed until September 1944.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12 on the usual cost plus fixed fee basis, with a fee of $22,500 per month plus $7,500 per <b>racetrack</b> for the first seven racetracks and $4,000 per {{additional}} <b>racetrack.</b> Workers were recruited in the Knoxville area. The typical recruit was a young woman, a recent graduate of a local high school. Training was initially conducted at the University of Tennessee. Training switched to Berkeley from April to September 1943, where it {{was conducted on the}} XA calutron and a 1:16 scale model of the Alpha <b>racetrack,</b> and then to Oak Ridge when the XAX calutron became available. Some 2,500 operators would be required once all the Alpha II calutrons were available. The Tennessee Eastman payroll at Y-12 ballooned from 10,000 in mid-1944 to 25,000 in mid-1945. For security reasons, the trainees were not informed of the purpose of the equipment they were taught to operate.|$|E
5|$|Another {{significant}} race {{run at the}} new {{track was}} the Grade 2 stakes Washington Park Handicap for three-year-olds and up. It was first held at Washington Park in 1926, and continued to be held there until 1958, when it was moved to Arlington Park, where {{it continues to be}} held to the present day and commemorates the Washington Park <b>racetrack.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2001, the New York State Legislature {{passed a}} bill to allow New York State <b>racetracks</b> to have video lottery {{terminals}} (VLTs) inside the <b>racetracks,</b> making them “racinos”.|$|R
5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha <b>racetracks,</b> and two units for final processing, known as Beta <b>racetracks.</b> In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more <b>racetracks,</b> known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>racetracks</b> {{offer little}} in the way of {{permanent}} infrastructure other than the track; others incorporate spectator facilities such as grandstands, hospitality or facilities for competitors, such as pit lanes and garages, paddocks and stables. Several <b>racetracks</b> are incorporated into larger venues or complexes, incorporating golf courses, museums, hotels, and conference centres. Some <b>racetracks</b> are small enough to be contained indoors, for sports such as motocross, cycling, and athletics.|$|R
5|$|Beginning on April 15, 1978, during racing season one train {{ran from}} 57th Street on the IND Sixth Avenue Line to Aqueduct <b>Racetrack,</b> leaving 57th Street at 11 A.M. and {{arriving}} at Aqueduct at 11:35 AM. The train {{left for the}} return trip after the final race.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it mainly serves Aqueduct <b>Racetrack,</b> the station is not well-used {{compared}} to other stations in the system. During the 1970s ridership at the station declined, from 1.1 million passengers in 1975 to 573,000 in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{authorized}} Alpha II in September 1943. This {{consisted of}} two new Alpha process buildings, 9201-4 and 9201-5, another Beta, 9204-2, an extension to the Alpha chemistry building, and a new Beta chemistry building, 9206. When 9206 opened, the old Beta chemistry building, 9203, was converted into a laboratory. Work started on the new Alpha II process buildings on 2 November 1943; the first <b>racetrack</b> was completed in July 1944, and all four were operational by 1 October 1944. The Alpha II racetracks were configured in a linear layout rather than an oval, although they were still called racetracks. In all, there were 864 Alpha calutrons, arranged in nine racetracks of 96. There were only 36 calutrons in each Beta <b>racetrack,</b> {{for a total of}} 288 calutrons, although only 216 of them were ever operated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Racetracks</b> are {{primarily}} designed for competition through speed, featuring defined start-finish lines or posts, {{and sometimes even}} a series of defined timing points that divide the track into time sectors. Some sports merely measure endurance, or how long a competitor can race. <b>Racetracks</b> can host individual or team sports. <b>Racetracks</b> can feature rolling starts, or fixed starts, with associated equipment (starting blocks, cages, wheel traps etc.) They invariably feature a pit lane, and usually timing equipment.|$|R

5|$|In 1954, William E. Miller {{died from}} a heart attack while driving a horse at Harrington Raceway. After Miller's death, Rosecroft hosted the William E. Miller Memorial race. Over the years, this race {{attracted}} several notable horses, including Cam's Card Shark, the 1994 Horse of the Year. John W. Miller, William's son, owned Rosecroft until his death in 1969. In 1961, the owners of Rosecroft resurfaced and regraded the track. Following John, Earle Brown owned the <b>racetrack.</b> John Wager, Maryland's all-time most winning driver, started to work at Rosecroft in 1974. Earle Brown moved to a different position at the <b>racetrack</b> in 1980 and William E. Miller II, William E. Miller's grandson, took over operations.|$|E
5|$|The route widens {{to eight}} lanes {{and enters the}} New Jersey Meadowlands, {{crossing}} into East Rutherford and then passing over the Berrys Creek. Route 3 passes {{to the south of}} the Meadowlands Sports Complex and has access to Route 120, MetLife Stadium (the home stadium of the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League), and the Meadowlands <b>Racetrack</b> in the eastbound direction and to MetLife Stadium and the Meadowlands <b>Racetrack</b> in the westbound direction. The route narrows back to six lanes and comes to a ramp which provides access to the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95). Route 3 interchanges with Route 120 and the carriageways separately. The route passes under the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike and becomes eight lanes again.|$|E

Ultimately, his {{ownership}} and breeding rights were split into 60shares worth $500,000 each—a total of $30million. By 1993, the year after his death, his foals had earned more than $25million on the <b>racetrack.</b>|$|E
5|$|By May 3, 1986, {{production}} {{had moved}} to New Orleans. In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker and his crew discovered a plantation village that {{would serve as a}} graveyard. An unused Louisiana field was used to create a <b>racetrack</b> where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu). On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as they had to deal with shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially trained to fall on top of Rourke's stuntman.|$|E
5|$|Dolph Lundgren has a brief {{appearance}} {{as one of}} General Gogol's KGB agents.

In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.|$|E
