25|$|Palynology is {{the study}} of {{contemporary}} and fossil palynomorphs, including pollen. Palynology is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant species, which vary under different climate conditions. Different groups of plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures, and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very <b>resilient</b> <b>material,</b> they resist decay. Changes in the type of pollen found in different layers of sediment in lakes, bogs, or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities. These changes are often a sign of a changing climate. As an example, palynological studies have been used to track changing vegetation patterns throughout the Quaternary glaciations and especially since the last glacial maximum.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is to use an {{explicit}} finite element code to model the impact behavior of a heavyweight impact source like rubber ball and to predict the floor impact vibration of <b>resilient</b> <b>materials,</b> which are used in the floor coverings construction for sound insulation. To simulate the impact force of rubber balls, the hyperviscoelastic rubber model is applied. Then, this rubber model is used in the simulation for the impact vibration of <b>resilient</b> <b>materials.</b> The results indicate that the hyperviscoelastic rubber model could precisely simulate the impact force of rubber balls, as its two parameters are properly chosen according to the desired impact force. Also, the present model could capture the impact and vibration behavior of the considered materials and reasonably evaluate the insulation effect of <b>resilient</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Objective. This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} microwave sterilization on the hardness of silicone and acrylic based relining materials. Material and Method. Acrylic resin specimens were fabricated and the <b>resilient</b> <b>materials</b> (GC Extra soft and Trusoft) were bonded to these specimens, which acted as a denture base. The specimens were divided into 6 groups (n= 10); i. e. 3 groups of silicone and 3 groups of acrylic liner specimens. The specimens were stored in artificial saliva and were exposed to 5 min and 15 min microwave sterilization per cycle per day for 45 days. The control group was not exposed to any sterilization. Pre-treatment and post treatment hardness reading (Shore A) of the <b>resilient</b> <b>materials</b> were taken at 0, 15, 30 and 45 days respectively. Data was analyzed statistically with {{one-way analysis of variance}} and independent sample t test. Results. The analysis revealed that, the mean hardness of the silicone relining material sterilized for 15 min had significant increase of 5. 81 % than that of the specimens sterilized for 5 mins. The mean hardness of acrylic relining material after 5 min of sterilization had significant increase of 39. 09 % than the of the control group. st Acrylic relining material showed deterioration at 15 min of sterilization on the 1 day. Conclusion. Based on the results, it can be assumed that silicone <b>resilient</b> relining <b>material</b> was <b>resilient</b> after being submitted to the experimental conditions, with no detrimental effect caused by microwave sterilization. However, acrylic relining material showed distortion for 15 min sterilization and it emphasizes that 15 min sterilization regime canot be advised for acrylic liners.

50|$|Amides are {{pervasive}} {{in nature and}} technology as structural materials. The amide linkage is easily formed, confers structural rigidity, and resists hydrolysis. Nylons are polyamides, as are the very <b>resilient</b> <b>materials</b> Aramid, Twaron, and Kevlar. Amide linkages constitute a defining molecular feature of proteins, the secondary structure of which {{is due in part}} to the hydrogen bonding abilities of amides. Amide linkages in a biochemical context are called peptide bonds when they occur in the main chain of a protein and isopeptide bonds when they occur to a side-chain of the protein. Proteins can have structural roles, such as in hair or spider silk, but also nearly all enzymes are proteins. Low molecular weight amides, such as dimethylformamide (HC(O)N(CH3)2), are common solvents. Many drugs are amides, including paracetamol, penicillin and LSD. Moreover, plant N-alkylamides have a wide range of biological functionalities.|$|R

50|$|A train wheel or {{rail wheel}} {{is a type}} of wheel {{specially}} designed for use on rail tracks. A rolling component is typically pressed onto an axle and mounted directly on a rail car or locomotive or indirectly on a bogie (UK), also called a truck (North America). Wheels are cast or forged (wrought) and are heat-treated to have a specific hardness. New wheels are trued, using a lathe, to a specific profile before being pressed onto an axle. All wheel profiles need to be periodically monitored to ensure proper wheel-rail interface. Improperly trued wheels increase rolling resistance, reduce energy efficiency and may create unsafe operation. A railroad wheel typically consists of two main parts: the wheel itself, and the tire (or tyre) around the outside. A rail tire is usually made from steel, and is typically heated and pressed onto the wheel, where it remains firmly as it shrinks and cools. Monobloc wheels do not have encircling tires, while resilient rail wheels have a <b>resilient</b> <b>material,</b> such as rubber, between the wheel and tire.|$|E
50|$|These {{earliest}} {{examples of}} stone carving {{are the result}} of hitting or scratching a softer stone with a harder one, although sometimes more <b>resilient</b> <b>materials</b> such as antlers are known to have been used for relatively soft stone. Another early technique was to use an abrasive that was rubbed on the stone to remove the unwanted area.Prior to the discovery of steel by any culture, all stone carving was carried out by using an abrasion technique, following rough hewing of the stone block using hammers. The {{reason for this is that}} bronze, the hardest available metal until steel, is not hard enough to work any but the softest stone. The Ancient Greeks used the ductility of bronze to trap small granules of carborundum, that are naturally occurring on the island of Milos, thus making a very efficient file for abrading the stone.|$|R

Inclusion of <b>resilient</b> <b>materials</b> such as geosynthetics {{to reinforce the}} track substructure has been observed in the laboratory to be viable at reducing the impact of such adverse effects. Despite this, the ‘field’ performance of different geosynthetics to reinforce ballasted tracks has not been investigated in a systematic manner. An extensive field study was therefore undertaken on experimental track sections near Singleton, New South Wales. Four types of geosynthetics were installed at the ballast-subballast interface of track sections constructed on subgrades with three distinctly different values of stiffness. It was found that geogrids can decrease vertical strains of the ballast with obvious benefits of improved track stability and reduced maintenance cost. It was also found that a few selected types of geogrids can be effectively used for soft subgrade soils...|$|R
50|$|Before surgery can be started, {{the patient}} has to be {{positioned}} {{in such a way}} that the wrist is stabilized. In order to do this, {{the patient has}} to be placed on the operating table with his or her face upward. The wrist of the arm on which will be operated on, has to be placed on a separate operating table on the side of the other operating table. To properly stabilize the wrist, the patient's elbow is flexed and the forearm is immobilized by using a traction apparatus. By using a traction apparatus, it will also become easier to insert the instruments. In general, 4.5-6.8 kilograms of traction is implemented with the aid of finger traps. The surgeon can either opt for nylon finger traps or for wire traps. In most cases, nylon finger traps will be preferred to wire traps, as nylon is a more <b>resilient</b> <b>material</b> and thus distributes the traction force to the skin more evenly. Usually, traction is applied to two fingers, namely the index finger and middle finger. Sometimes it may be necessary to more evenly distribute the traction force on the skin, as the patient's skin may be too fragile or atrophic. The traction brought about by the traction apparatus is then applied to three or even four fingers.The surgeon can either opt for dry arthroscopy or for wet arthroscopy. When performing a dry procedure the wrist can still, if necessary, be approached using open surgery. This may, for example, be required when a TFCC lesion is diagnosed. The latter is not possible when a wet procedure is performed, because the fluid that is used causes expansion of the tissue. To improve visualization within the wrist, an inflow irrigation system is used during surgery. Currently, several systems are available, such as gravity flow, a hand pump, large syringes, or a mechanical infusion pump. For irrigation, lactated Ringer’s solution is generally used. The characteristics of lactated Ringer’s solution are that it is physiological and rapidly absorbed. Moreover, the right equipment must be available to finish a complete diagnostic arthroscopy, as well as to perform various operative procedures. Complications of using an irrigation system is that fluid extravasation into the soft tissues of the forearm can result in a compartment syndrome.|$|E

To solve these issues, {{a substantial amount of}} sound <b>resilient</b> <b>material</b> is installed between the concrete slab and the foamed concrete during construction. A new place-type <b>resilient</b> <b>material</b> is made from cement, silica powder, sodium sulfate, expanded-polystyrene, anhydrite, fly ash, and acrylic polymer emulsion resin.

The remanent strain, related to the serviceability of a structure, is found to be inversely proportional to the density and strength.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present a method that {{simplifies}} the standard procedure to determine the yield point providing complementary information about changes in the behaviour of the materials under study. It is generally accepted that the yield point is determined by the inflection point of the curve of pressure versus apparent volume of the sample, P(V), from Hg porosimetry runs. Although compressible materials present an easily identifiable neat inflection point, in <b>resilient</b> <b>materials,</b> the inflection point is not easy to identify by simple visual inspection of the curve. A physical magnitude (K') is introduced to characterise the evolution of the material's compliance under isotropic pressure. The physical meaning of K' is the variation in the resistance to uniform compression with the pressure applied, helping to identify the yield point and the plastic mechanism beyond the yield point in a single run. © 2009 Académie des sciences.
