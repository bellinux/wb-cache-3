50|$|Critics {{disagree}} {{over which}} band {{can be thought}} of as the first true heavy metal band, with American commentators tending to favour Led Zeppelin and British commentators tending to favour Black Sabbath. Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and was made up of two London-based musicians from The Yardbirds and two from the Birmingham-based Band of Joy, marking an explicit combination of the musical influences of the two cities. The Yardbirds had extended the instrumental textures of the blues through extended jamming sessions, but it was the influence of the Midlands-based musicians - drummer John Bonham and vocalist Robert Plant - that would provide Led Zeppelin's harder edge and focus, and bring a more eclectic range of stylistic influences. While it remained based in blues and rock and <b>roll</b> <b>conventions,</b> the music of Led Zeppelin blended these with extreme volume and a highly experimental melodic and rhythmic approach, forging a much harder and heavier sound. This combination of intensity and finesse in Led Zeppelin's output redefined both mainstream and alternative rock music for the 1970s, particularly in the United States, where they remain the fourth bestselling act in music history.|$|R

50|$|The Bolivian National Convention of 1938 was {{an elected}} {{constituent}} assembly held from May 23 to October 30, {{and charged with}} rewriting the constitution of Bolivia. President David Toro called for the National Convention in 1937, but {{had been replaced by}} Germán Busch {{by the time it was}} held. Voter <b>rolls</b> for electing <b>Convention</b> members were opened in August 1937, and the vote was held in March 1938.|$|R
500|$|Clark's father's {{family was}} Jewish; his {{paternal}} great-grandfather {{immigrated to the}} United States from Belarus {{in response to the}} Pale of Settlement and anti-Jewish violence from Russian pogroms. Clark's grandfather, Jacob Kanne, graduated from the Chicago-Kent College of Law and served in the U.S. Naval Reserve as an ensign during World War I, although he was never assigned to a combat mission. Kanne, living in Chicago, became involved with ward politics in the 1920s as a prosecutor and served in local offices. He served as a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention that nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt as the party's presidential candidate (though his name does not appear on the published <b>roll</b> of <b>convention</b> delegates). [...] His mother was of English ancestry and was a Methodist.|$|R
50|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{spoke at}} a {{campaign}} appearance on August 29, 1964 at Convention Hall. He appeared at the Hall alongside many notable Philadelphia and Pennsylvania Democratic leaders. Four days later, The Beatles played the venue on September 2, 1964 during their first tour of the United States. Tickets went on sale in May 1964 and sold out within 90 minutes. The <b>Rolling</b> Stones played <b>Convention</b> Hall on May 1, 1965 during their third American tour.|$|R
50|$|When the 1926 <b>Convention</b> <b>rolled</b> around, certain notable {{changes were}} made in the National Organization. Amendments to the Constitution {{provided}} for a new governing body, one with greater power and resources. This body, the Supreme Board of Chancellors, included the Supreme Exalted Ruler, Supreme Mortal Ruler, Exalted Mortal Ruler, Supreme Exchequer, Supreme Scribe, and the preceding Supreme Exalted Ruler plus three Chancellors, and was to be elected annually by the National Executive Council (Delegates from each Chapter).|$|R
2500|$|After {{all states}} had voted, Sanders stated, [...] "I move that the {{convention}} suspend the procedural rules. I move that all votes, all votes cast by delegates {{be reflected in}} the official record, and I move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States." [...] Clinton had made a similar motion during the 2008 <b>convention</b> <b>roll</b> call; however, Sanders (unlike Clinton in 2008) did not move to nominate Clinton by acclamation. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.|$|R
50|$|When the July 1964 CBS Television {{coverage}} of the Republican National Convention in San Francisco (anchored by Walter Cronkite) was trounced in the ratings by NBC's Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, CBS replaced Cronkite with Bob Trout and Roger Mudd for the Democratic party's August gathering in Atlantic City. The duo failed to overtake Huntley and Brinkley, and Cronkite {{was back at the}} TV anchor desk when the <b>conventions</b> <b>rolled</b> around again four years later in Miami and Chicago. Trout remained on radio but also did in-depth news features for the TV network, including field reports for the CBS News broadcast 60 Minutes.|$|R

25|$|The 2016 Democratic National Convention was {{a presidential}} nominating {{convention}}, {{held at the}} Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from July 25 through to July 28, 2016.

40|$|Granular convection/separation {{of single}} and binary {{component}} particles are studied {{in a narrow}} vibration bed, respectively. With filling the single light particles (molecular sieve beads), the bed exhibits five different states successively by increasing the vibration frequency f from 15 Hz to 70 Hz (vibration strength Γ> 3), as the global convection, symmetrical heap, unsymmetrical heap, local convection and pseudo solid. Comparatively, the granular bed of the single heavy particles (steel beads) is only in pseudo solid state at the above vibration condition. By filling binary component particles (molecular sieve and same size steel beads) instead of the single component, the bed shows similar convection state {{with that of the}} single molecular sieve beads, and the heavy steel beads are aggregated in the centre of <b>convention</b> <b>roll</b> as a core. Varying the initial distribution of binary component particles, the final convection and separation are not influenced, although the aggregation process of steel beads changes...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{typically}} {{view the}} National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a joint marketing organization designed {{to advance the}} economic interests of member schools. Yet many journalists {{and much of the}} public reject this unidimensional view of the NCAA as an organization. In fact, the NCAA's wide authority over all aspects of the athletic side of major colleges and universities has not been limited to issues that are solely related to the financial returns of its members. In this paper we use data on NCAA <b>convention</b> <b>roll</b> call votes between 1986 and 1994 to investigate the intraorganizational decision making process. A spatial model of voting decisions, which is similar to models used previously to analyze voting in Congress, is used to analyze the votes. We can explain variation in decisions of schools on restructuring issues quite well. This is consistent with an economic view of NCAA voting, since restructuring of the NCAA rank and file {{can be thought of as}} an exercise in raising entry barriers. However, the same estimation procedure is only moderately successful for other issues. It thus seems unlikely that decisions on academic reform are motivated solely by economic considerations. ...|$|R
5000|$|Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine was {{critical}} of the albums musical direction: [...] "As was the case when Jerry Only resurrected the band in the 1990s, the Misfits have incorporated a dose of not-especially-heavy metal into their sound; {{on a scale of}} Winger to Slayer, this rocks at about Scorpions." [...] He also criticized the lyrical content: [...] "The lyrics are as absurd as ever: Think of something that scared the crap out of you when you were seven, and its probably mentioned in Ghost of Frankenstein, Curse of the Mummys Hand, or Cold in Hell ... The Devils Rain is the work of a band that aspires to give the genre little more than its answer to the Monster Mash." [...] Joe Hemmerling of Tiny Mix Tapes also remarked on the musical direction of the album, saying that it [...] "continues to straddle the line between punk and metal, combining muscular, thrashy riffs with punk punchiness and the Misfits own idiosyncratic penchant for melody. The best songs on the album still tend to be the ones that shoehorn in those famous whoa-oh-ohs wherever they can, with the under-two-minute Black Hole being an obvious standout. For the most part, though, those big, sloppy harmonies seem less prominent, often relegated to the background." [...] He singled out [...] "Death Ray", [...] "Sleepwalkin, and [...] "Where Do They Go?" [...] as standout tracks, calling the latter [...] "the undisputed masterpiece of this album ... The song reframes a story of real-life violence, the las meurtas de Juarez, as a 50s sock-hop torch song, complete with handclaps and female backup singers. It’s a spot-on appropriation of golden age rock n <b>roll</b> songwriting <b>conventions</b> on a topic thats in such deliciously poor taste that it recalls similar forays such as Famous Monsters Saturday Night, or the classic lineups American Nightmare." [...] He concluded that [...] "its not that The Devils Rain is a bad album, but its by far the weakest link in the bands catalog, and coming at a time when faith in the group is at an all-time low." ...|$|R
