5000|$|Beginning with Samuel Denne's Letter to Lord Ladbroke (1771) and Jonas Hanway's Solitude in Imprisonment (1776), philanthropic {{literature}} on English penal reform began {{to concentrate on}} the post-conviction <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminals</b> in the prison setting. Although they did not speak with a single voice, the philanthropist penologists tended to view crime as an outbreak of the criminal's estrangement from God.

50|$|Earl Long's gubernatorial {{predecessor}} (and third successor in {{the office}} as well), Jimmie Davis, created the office of superintendent at Angola by combining the former general manager and warden positions. In 1950, Long brought back the office of warden to meet patronage demands of office-seekers who had supported him for governor in the bitter race in 1948 against Sam H. Jones. The return of the warden's position created renewed infighting with the subsequent superintendents over the division of authority. In 1948, with {{the start of his}} second term, Long appointed Rollo Lawrence as the penitentiary superintendent. Though he was not a professional penologist, Lawrence had a strong interest in <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminals.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sentimental novel complemented social {{trends of}} the time toward humanism and the {{heightened}} value of human life. The literature focused on weaker members of society, such as orphans and condemned criminals, and allowed readers to identify and sympathize with them. This translated to growing sentimentalism within society, and led to social movements calling for change, such as {{the abolition of the}} death penalty and of slavery. Instead of the death penalty, popular sentiment called for the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminals,</b> rather than harsh punishment. Frederick Douglass himself was inspired to stand against his own bondage and slavery in general in his famous Narrative by the speech by the sentimentalist playwright Sheridan in The Columbian Orator detailing a fictional dialogue between a master and slave.|$|E
50|$|After {{the release}} of Anderson from prison, Jennifer Baker, writing in the Springfield News-Leader, also {{raised the issue of}} whether <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminals</b> can be {{adequately}} accomplished in correction facilities. She notes several disadvantages a person faces after leaving prison that makes it more likely to return to prison. After spending time in prison, it is more difficult to find a job, estrangement of family is more likely, and child support continues to accrue while in prison. Moreover, people in prison often learn more about how to be a criminal than how to live successfully in the outside world. Anderson managed to rehabilitate himself without going through the prison system. According to Baker, Anderson's case suggests that there must be alternatives that can more successfully rehabilitate criminals and save public money.|$|E

Steiner was appointed Professor of Sociology at Sonoma State University, California, in 1968, where he taught until achieving Emeritus status in 1997. Subsequent research projects in Germany and Austria were financed with grants from the Fulbright Commission in 1974/1975 and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in 1981/1982.

50|$|Phrenology {{was one of}} {{the first}} to bring about the idea of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminals</b> instead of vindictive punishments that would not stop criminals, only with the reorganizing a disorganized brain would bring about change. Voisin {{believed}} along with others the accuracy of phrenology in diagnosing criminal tendencies. Diagnosis could point to the type of offender, the insane, an idiot or brute, and by knowing this an appropriate course of action could be taken. A strict system of reward and punishment, hard work and religious instruction, was thought to be able to correct those who had been abandoned and neglected with little education and moral ground works. Those who were considered mentally challenged could be put to work and housed collectively while only criminals of intellect and vicious intent needed to be confined and isolated. Phrenology also advocated variable prison sentences, the idea being that those who were only defective in education and lacking in morals would soon be released while those who were mentally deficient could be watched and the truly abhorrent criminals would never be released. For other patients phrenology could help redirect impulses, one homicidal individual became a butcher to control his impulses, while another became a military chaplain so he could witness killings. Phrenology also provided reformist arguments for the lunatic asylums of the Victorian era. John Conolly, a physician interested in psychological aspects of disease, used phrenology on his patients in an attempt to use it as a diagnostic tool. While the success of this approach is debatable, Conolly, through phrenology, introduced a more humane way of dealing with the mentally ill.|$|E

The present research examines authoritarianism as a possible moderator of this seemingly robust finding. We obtained consistent evidence from two studies that authoritarianism (right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation) moderates the relationship between need for cognition and punitiveness. Among low authoritarians, need for cognition was negatively associated with punitiveness and dispositional attribution of crimes and positively associated with support for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminals.</b> However, among high authoritarians, the pattern reversed.

40|$|This article {{attempts}} to interpret Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Blithedale Romance（ 1852 ）as a literary version {{of one of}} those social reform projects which were prevalent in the mid-nineteenth century. Here the mesmeric entertainment called“the Veiled Lady” is focused upon to investigate the aim of the social reform that the text and the experimental community,“the Blithedale,”try to achieve. The analyses of the relationships among the characters in terms of“the Veiled Lady”reveal the narrator's homosexual desire for the leader of the community. For the narrator, the aim of the community is to reform the prevailing marriage/family system; he imagines a polygamous family including marriage between the same sexes. His hope is, however, actually destroyed because for the leader of this community its aim is to construct a facility for the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminals</b> who could be interpreted as including sexual perverts. On the other hand, the text itself can be regarded as subversive of the hegemonic heteronormality, by delineating the process that the social acceptance is almost given to deviant sexualities. It presents, as a literary form of“romance,”a possibility for new forms of family and intimacies to its readers...|$|E
40|$|Germany and the USA both industrialized between 1860 and 1925, {{but they}} {{developed}} different systems for industrial and technical education. The Germans developed a more comprehensive, system, with three distinct levels; lower, middle and higher education. The higher engineering schools were {{separate from the}} traditional universities but granted equal status. Industrial education in Germany was primarily part of a mobilization for technik, industrial growth, social unity and nationalism. Engineering education was used to establish a link between vocational schools and academic education. The American field of technical education around 1925 consisted largely of engineering colleges, which {{to a large extent}} was integrated in the traditional university system. Engineering colleges had multiplied as in no other country, and the training of artisans, foremen and technicians had been neglected. There was a clear social distinction between engineering schools and institutions for vocational education, the latter being partly associated in the public mind with <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminals</b> and school dropouts. Engineering educators contributed to this mindset by distancing themselves from vocational schools and institutions for manual training. I account for the different outcomes and ideologies by emphasizing differences in organizational resources and worldviews among four groups; teachers and academics, engineers in professional associations, politicians/civil servants and business managers. The educational revolution and the academization process in engineering started earlier in Germany, and the rise of large corporations increased the influence of practitioners and industrialists in the education system. Engineering in the United States was originally a practical and shop-based profession. Academic entrepreneurs and teachers had the initiative in education, and they were more firmly in control also after the industrial revolution...|$|E

40|$|Although much {{research}} has been conducted on violence, its effects, and which circumstances put an individual at risk of becoming a potential victim, there is a paucity of studies that focus on the perpetrators of violence. Much of the literature available on this subject is dated, providing information which is already dated and, frequently no longer relevant. This research has sought to explore and understand violent crimes from the psychological and emotional standpoint of the individual who perpetrated them. One objective {{of the study was to}} facilitate the development of a profile of youths who chronically commit crime, and more specifically crimes of violence. This study utilised the qualitative research design of Phenomenology, which allows for the exploration of the phenomena from the perspective of the participants. The sample for this study consisted of five male individuals who are currently incarcerated in a correctional institution situated in the Eastern Cape. The sample was chosen according to the non-probability purposive-sampling technique, based on their relevance to the study. The selected male offenders from the correctional institution ages ranged between 18 and 31. Specific criteria were identified against which participants were measured in order to be selected to participate in the research. Data was obtained from the participants via a questionnaire, a journal, and semi-structured interviews conducted by the researcher. Other data for the study was obtained from official documents. The study was embedded in the ecological theory of Bronfenbrenner, which provided the psychological framework in which to explain and understand the results of the study and the development of violence. The major findings of this study include; growing up violently, the reasons for violence, justificationa and perseptions of violence, society and the culture of 10 violence, and the environmental impact. These findings will contribute to the development of treatment programmes, which better facilitate the reformation and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminals...</b>|$|E

The paper highlights inherent problems associated with immediate post-war inequalities in accessing mental health resources between military personnel, veterans and convicted war criminals on one hand and victims of the conflict on the other, who {{are more likely to be}} recipients of reconstruction efforts and help from international organisations. Dealing with mental health issues of those who have or are perceived to have committed crimes, or have been convicted of war crimes, is more difficult, as this requires greater social and political will as well as infrastructure.

Generally, military rules provide little privilege on information offered by those seeking therapy, such as admissions of war crimes, which may result, through the suppression of guilt, anxiety or depression for instance, in misdiagnosis and/or aggravation of symptoms for which help is sought in the first place. Two issues are considered here. Firstly, the extent to which military confidentiality rules hinder psychotherapist-patient relationship and secondly, the impact this has on the effectiveness on collective reconciliation, coupled with issues of stigmatization of mental health...|$|R
