50|$|Detection and {{measurement}} of atmospheric <b>radioxenon</b> {{is an important}} component of international monitoring systems for nuclear weapons testing. Monitoring stations separate xenon from air and perform isotopic analysis of the <b>radioxenon.</b> In one such <b>radioxenon</b> measurement scheme, the isotopes of interest are identified by coincident spectroscopy of electrons and photons in a β/γ coincidence spectrometer (BGCS). The β spectrometer is a plastic scintillator, manufactured as a cylindrical cell containing the separated xenon sample. This cell is surrounded by the NaI(Tl) γ spectrometer. We report here the development of a calibration process for the BGCS suitable for use in remote sampling systems. This procedure is based upon γ-ray Compton scattering, resulting in a true coincident signal in both detectors, generation of electrons over a wide energy range that matches the energy distribution of electrons from <b>radioxenon</b> decay, and a relative insensitivity to source location. In addition to gain calibration, this procedure determines the resolution of the β detector as a function of energy.|$|E

It is loaded into capsules of the zirconium alloy zircaloy-2 (a very nonreactive alloy transparent to neutrons) to a pressure of about 100 bars (about 100 atmospheres). Upon irradiation with slow neutrons in a nuclear reactor, several radionuclides of xenon are produced. Only the decay of 125Xe leads to a radioiodine, and this is 125I, however. The other <b>radioxenon</b> isotopes decay either to stable xenon, or to various cesium isotopes, some of them radioactive.|$|E
5000|$|Another way of {{detecting}} a nuclear detonation is through air sampling; in nuclear explosions there are radioactive isotopes that get {{released into the}} air which can be collected by plane. Radionuclides include Americium-241, Iodine-131, caesium-137, krypton-85, strontium-90, plutonium - 239, tritium, and xenon. By sending planes over an area equipped with sensors they could reveal {{if there was a}} nuclear detonation but most air samples are taken at one of many radionuclide stations set throughout the world. Even underground detonations will eventually release radioactive gases most notably xenon to be detected. Although there are some flaws to this method; depending on where the explosion was air currents could move the gases or radionuclides in another direction. The process involves taking in air samples with a filter paper and the radioactive material is counted by a machine and analyzed by a computer. Which means if there is outside “noise” (other forms of radiation like some released from factories or nuclear plants) it can throw off the results.An example of air currents moving radioactive particles is the Chernobyl disaster. As the reactor started failing a large amount of radionuclides were released into the air which were then spread by air currents; leading to radiation that could be detected all the way in Sweden and other countries hundreds of miles away within a few days. The same occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The spread of <b>radioxenon</b> gas, iodine -131, and ceasium - 137 could be detected at different continents many miles away ...|$|E

There are over 25 different isotopes of interest being produced by more than 35 research reactors across the United States. A key component in medical isotope production is the isotope separation process. During this process, several types of radioactive gases are released that would otherwise not leave the nuclear fuel component. One of these radioactive gases is <b>radioxenon.</b> The release of <b>radioxenon</b> into the environment is of concern to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) as one of the key critical sampling techniques utilized to detect a nuclear detonation is the presence of <b>radioxenon.</b> As more facilities release <b>radioxenon,</b> background levels increase, desensitizing the equipment, and making it more difficult to detect. For this purpose, the detection of a medical isotope facility through the use of <b>radioxenon</b> is an interest to the CTBTO as an attempt to reduce the background levels of <b>radioxenon</b> and ensure that the detonation capabilities remain unaffected.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 As {{mandated}} by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the United States (US) {{is involved in the}} development and deployment of an International Monitoring System (IMS) for monitoring nuclear explosions. The US system, developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, is known as the Automated <b>Radioxenon</b> Sampler/Analyzer (ARSA). The US plans to implement a large number of monitoring stations around the world, so reductions must be made in power requirements, complexity, size and cost. Research suggests the potential of using a Phoswich-based detector system that will meet these reduction requirements while increasing reliability of nuclear-detonation <b>radioxenon</b> detection. In 2005 the research team at Oregon State University began seeking ways to optimize detection of <b>radioxenon</b> gas produced during fission processes, including the detonation of nuclear weapons. The research described herein is part of this effort. The objectives of this research are as follows: (1) to review fission mechanisms for <b>radioxenon</b> production, (2) to model a triple-layer prototype phoswich detector and determine detector response on exposure to radioxenons, and (3) to predict detector responses from various energy deposition patterns. Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) version 5 was used to model the phoswich detector and to simulate energy deposition from <b>radioxenon</b> sources. The simulations revealed that the phoswich detection system achieves excellent detection of photon and electron energies associated with <b>radioxenon</b> decay.

Efforts to raise a global <b>radioxenon</b> emission inventory revealed that the yearly global total emission from MIPF’s is around 15 times higher than the total <b>radioxenon</b> emission from nuclear power plants (NPP's). Given that situation, from mid 2008 until early 2009 two out of the ordinary hemisphere-specific events occured: 1) In the Northern hemisphere, a joint temporary suspension of operations of the three largest MIPF's made it possible to quantify the effects of the emissions related to NPP’s. The average activity concentrations of 133 Xe measured at a monitoring station close to Freiburg, Germany, went down significantly from 4. 5 ± 0. 5 mBq/m 3 to 1. 1 ± 0. 1 mBq/m 3 and in Stockholm, Sweden, from 2. 0 ± 0. 4 mBq/m 3 to 1. 05 ± 0. 15 mBq/m 3. 2) In the Southern hemisphere the only radioxenon-emitting MIPF in Australia started up test production in late November 2008. During eight test runs, up to 6. 2 ± 0. 2 mBq/m 3 of 133 Xe was measured at the station in Melbourne, 700 km south-west from the facility, where no <b>radioxenon</b> had been observed before, originating from the isotopic production process.

40|$|Several of the <b>radioxenon</b> {{detection}} systems {{developed for}} the International Monitoring System use beta/gamma coincidence detection to achieve high sensitivity. These systems, e. g., the Automated <b>Radioxenon</b> Sampler and Analyzer (ARSA) or the Swedish Automatic Unit for Noble gas Acquisition (SAUNA), currently use an arrangement of separate beta and gamma detectors to detect beta/gamma coincidence events characteristic of the different <b>radioxenon</b> isotopes. While they {{are very sensitive to}} small amounts of <b>radioxenon,</b> they also require careful calibration and gain matching of several detectors and photomultiplier tubes. An alternative approach is the use of a single phoswich detector in which beta-gamma coincidences are detected by pulse shape analysis (PSA).

These detectors thus require only a single photomultiplier tube and an electronics readout channel.

40|$|<b>Radioxenon</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the monitoring of nuclear explosions, particularly in the detection of nuclear tests. Due to its inert character as a noble gas it is a likely candidate to escape from the cavity of an underground nuclear explosions. In any case, once in the atmosphere it is subject to prevailing winds and can be transported over vast distances, while the dispersion in the atmosphere leads to a dilution of the concentration. Beta-gamma coincidence and high-resolution gamma techniques allow to detect concentration as small as 1 mBq=m 3 and below. A worldwide monitoring system is currently under construction by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization and already over 80 % operational. However, besides nuclear explosions also other sources of <b>radioxenon</b> exist. Nuclear ssion processes involving heavy nuclei produce a certain yield of <b>radioxenon</b> isotopes. The strongest atmospheric emitters are nuclear power plants and medical isotope production facilities. Atmospheric Transport Modelling (ATM) has the potential to support the analysis of <b>radioxenon</b> detections. It is a relatively new tool that has come available in recent years due to improvements in computation power and data storage capabilities. The Lagrangian particle dispersion model Flexpart can simulate the sensitivity between sources and receptors on a global scale. The importance of ATM in <b>radioxenon</b> monitoring of nuclear explosions has increased since the existence and strength of background sources are known. The role of ATM in monitoring of nuclear explosions against this <b>radioxenon</b> background are examined in this work. The results can be divided in three parts. First, the general <b>radioxenon</b> background was analysed. The background for all 39 IMS noble gas stations was simulated for the course of one year and the time series of each station follows a certain distribution. The simulated data are compared with experimental data for stations with available data. Regionally dominant emitters of <b>radioxenon</b> and the impact of the availability of known, time resolved source term - opposed to a yearly average - on the ATM prediction capability is validated. Also, using the Fukushima nuclear accident as an example it is demonstrated that it is possible to reconstruct a source term of known location. The problem of reconstruction is reduced to solving an overdetermined set of linear equations. Secondly, possible roles of ATM in the automatic categorisation are suggested. ATM can be used to train categorisation schemes that inherently do not apply ATM. On the other hand ATM itself can be incorporated in such a scheme. Third, the network coverage of the IMS noble gas component is de ned in order to quantify its capability to detect nuclear explosions worldwide. Di erent emission and background scenarios are used to determine the ratio of detected and undetected hypothetical events, and recommendations to improve this value are given...|$|E

Forward dispersion analyses were used to estimate release magnitudes and transport times. The estimated 133 Xe release magnitude of the largest event (between 0. 2 and 34 TBq over a 2 d window), was in close agreement with the stack emission releases estimated by the facility for this time period (between 0. 5 and 2 TBq).

The main objective of this dissertation is to design, build and test a new <b>radioxenon</b> detection system to study the response of CdZnTe (CZT) detectors to xenon radioisotopes in order to support the CTBT for discovering clandestine nuclear weapon tests. This prototype detection system was intended to be small and compact with minimal number of channels which reduces complexity, power and size and still can achieve good energy resolution at room temperature compared with other scintillator-based <b>radioxenon</b> detectors. The prototype design uses two CZT crystals for this purpose, with the ultimate goal of using six CZT crystals for optimum geometric efficiency. The system measures xenon radioisotopes through beta-gamma coincidence detection between the two detection elements. The CZT-based detection system was characterized with radioactive lab sources and four radioxenons produced in the OSU's TRIGA reactor. The detection system offers excellent energy resolution and background count rate compared with scintillator-based beta-gamma coincidence detectors currently in operation at the IMS stations. The detection system was also simulated using MCNP to understand the response of the system to radioxenons of interest. PTRAC card was used for this purpose to find the track of beta/conversion electrons and gamma/X-rays in each CZT detector. The MCNP simulations were compared with the measurement results and shows very good consistency. The minimum detectable concentration (MDC) of this system for ¹³³Xe is estimated to be less than the requirement set by the IMS (1 mBq/m³).

It {{has been shown that}} by utilizing beta-gamma coincidence techniques, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) can reliably detect the presence of these isotopes in the atmosphere to verify the nuclear nature of clandestine explosions. In an effort to mitigate conversion electron backscatter effects observed in a Two-Element CZT (TECZT) coincidence <b>radioxenon</b> detection system previously designed at Oregon State University, a new prototype beta-gamma coincidence detection system has been developed. The detection system consists of a coplanar CZT detector, an array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), and a well-type plastic scintillator. Radioactive gas samples are injected via a tube into the plastic scintillator gas cell, the base of which is coupled to the SiPM array for light readout. This scintillator is used to detect the full energy deposition of beta particles and conversion electrons without significantly attenuating gamma and X-rays. A coplanar CZT detector, chosen for its excellent energy resolution, simple readout electronics, and room temperature operation, is positioned beside the scintillator to detect gamma radiation and X-rays that are emitted in coincidence with the beta particles and conversion electrons. The system is directly mounted onto a custom printed circuit board (PCB) for low noise readout using a custom field-programmable gate array (FPGA) -based dual-channel digital pulse processor.

This European cluster of six stations is particularly interesting because it is highly influenced by a high density of nuclear power reactors and some radiopharmaceutical production facilities.

The concentration technique {{is based on the}} discovery of a phenomenon where certain organic fluids absorb heavy noble gases with very high efficiency at room temperature and release the noble gases when slightly warmed (about 60 {degrees}C). Research has been conducted to study the application of this technology to the design of an ultra sensitive <b>radioxenon</b> measurement system. Such a system could be used to monitor or sample the atmosphere for noble gas fission products ({sup 133 }Xe, {sup 133 m}Xe, and {sup 135 }Xe) generated by nuclear testing. A system that utilizes this fluid-based technology provides a simpler, more portable, less-expensive means of concentrating xenon than current cryogenic techniques and avoids some of the complications associated with charcoal-based systems. Preliminary experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing this fluid-based technology in the design of an atmospheric <b>radioxenon</b> measurement have been very promising and research is continuing toward applying this technology to monitoring activities which support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) ...|$|E
40|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} (ANNs) {{are used to}} determine the state-of-health (SOH) of the Automated <b>Radioxenon</b> Analyzer/Sampler (ARSA). ARSA is a gas collection and analysis system used for non-proliferation monitoring in detecting <b>radioxenon</b> released during nuclear tests. SOH diagnostics are important for automated, unmanned sensing systems so that remote detection and identification of problems can be made without onsite staff. Both recurrent and feed-forward ANNs are presented. The recurrent ANN is trained to predict sensor values based on current valve states, which control air flow, so that with only valve states the normal SOH sensor values can be predicted. Deviation between modeled value and actual is an indication of a potential problem. The feed-forward ANN acts as a nonlinear version of principal components analysis (PCA) and is trained to replicate the normal SOH sensor values. Because of ARSA’s complexity, this nonlinear PCA is better able to capture the relationships among the sensors than standard linear PCA and is applicable to both sensor validation and recognizing off-normal operating conditions. Both models provide valuable information to detect impending malfunctions before they occur to avoid unscheduled shutdown. Finally, the ability of ANN methods to predict the system state is presented...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{establish}} a commonly acceptable format for storing beta-gated coincidence data for stations in the International Monitoring System (IMS) for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The current aerosol RMS type data format is not applicable for <b>radioxenon</b> in that the current format contains implicit assumptions specific to conventional gamma-ray spectrometry. Some assumptions in the current RMS format are not acceptable for the beta-gated spectra expected from the U. S. Department of Energy PNNL Automated <b>Radioxenon</b> Sampler-Analyzer (ARSA) and other similar systems under use or development from various countries. The RMS data format is not generally applicable for <b>radioxenon</b> measurements in the CTBT for {{one or more of the}} following main reasons: 1) The RMS format does not currently support 2 -dimensional data. That is, the RMS data format is setup for a simple l-dimensional gamma-ray energy histogram. Current data available from the ARSA system and planned for other <b>radioxenon</b> monitors includes spectral information from gamma-rays and betas/conversion electrons. It is worth noting that the beta/conversion electron energy information will be used to separate the contributions from the different radioxenons. 2) The RMS data format assumes that the conversion between counts and activity can be calculated based (in part) on a simple calibration curve (detector efficiency curve) that depends only on energy of the gamma-ray. In the case of beta-gated gamma-ray spectra and for 2 -dimensional spectra, there are generally two detector calibration curves that must be convoluted, the lower energy cutoff for the betas must be considered, and the energy acceptance window must be taken into account to convert counts into activity.. 3) The RMS format has header information that contains aerosol-specific information that allows the activity (Bq) calculated to be converted into a concentration (Bq/SCM). This calculation is performed by dividing the activity calculated (Bq) into number of standard cubic meters of air (SCM) passed through the filters. Most xenon-samplers do not have a 100 % collection and transfer efficiency, and these efficiencies should not be assumed constant, so that the total volume flow through the sampler may not be used to convert activity into concentration. There is a pretty straightforward analogy that requires, instead, the total volume of xenon gas measured by the xenon station for the conversion. The following paper describes one possible file format for storing the multi-parameter beta-gamma coincidence spectra generated by the DOE PNNL ARSA sampler. This format proposal was generated as a draft guide to begin discussions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates surface {{coatings}} as xenon diffusion barriers on plastic scintillators. The {{motivation for the}} work is improved <b>radioxenon</b> detection systems, used within the verification regime of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). One type of <b>radioxenon</b> detection systems used {{in this context is}} the Swedish SAUNA system. This system uses a cylindrical plastic scintillator cell to measure the beta decay from <b>radioxenon</b> isotopes. The detector cell also acts as a container for the xenon sample during the measurement. One problem with this setup is that part of the xenon sample diffuses into the plastic scintillator material during the measurement, resulting in residual activity left in the detector during subsequent measurements. This residual activity is here referred to as the memory effect. It is here proposed, and demonstrated, {{that it is possible to}} coat the plastic scintillator material with a transparent oxide coating, working as a xenon diffusion barrier. It is found that a 425 nm Al 2 O 3 coating, deposited with Atomic Layer Deposition, reduces the memory effect by a factor of 1000, compared an uncoated detector. Furthermore, simulations show that the coating might also improve the light collection in the detector. Finally, the energy resolution of a coated detector is studied, and no degradation is observed. The focus of the thesis is measurements of the diffusion barrier properties of Al 2 O 3 films of different thicknesses deposited on plastic scintillators, as well as an evaluation of the expected effect of a coating on the energy resolution of the detector. The latter is studied through light transport simulations. As a final step, a complete coated plastic scintillator cell is evaluated in terms of memory effect, efficiency and energy resolution. In addition, the xenon diffusion process in the plastic material is studied, and molecular dynamics simulations of the Xe-Al 2 O 3 system are performed in order to investigate the reason for the need for a rather thick coating to significantly reduce the memory effect...|$|E
40|$|To {{facilitate}} airborne <b>radioxenon</b> monitoring, a xenon concentration method {{with potential}} advantages over current technology in simplicity, size, and cost has been developed. The concentration technique {{is based on}} the preferential absorption of heavy noble gases (krypton, xenon, and radon) by certain organic fluids. To implement this concentration technique, a <b>radioxenon</b> monitoring system requires three integrated sub-systems: (1) an absorption sub-system; (2) a degassing sub-system; and (3) a radiation detection sub-system. This study is focused on the characterization and optimization of the first two sub-systems. Measurements using a small prototype absorption tower have indicated a xenon removal factor of approximately 50 % and the specific concentration at saturation of certain organic fluids to be about 2. 5 times the specific concentration in the sampled air. Various techniques for degassing have been investigated, including heating, purging, agitation and vacuum. Ultrasonic agitation of a thin film in a strong vacuum {{has been shown to be}} an effective means of degassing the transfer fluid continuously. Various schemes for integrating all of the sub-systems are considered. Combining the small prototype absorption and degassing sub-systems should result in a transfer efficiency of about 33 % and a single stage concentration factor of about 6. 7...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{perfusion}} measurements {{derived from}} the clearance of <b>radioxenon</b> injected in saline are useful {{in the investigation of}} several clinical problems including: (a) presurgical assessment of limb amputation level (1 â€” 3);(b) the evaluation of peripheral vascular disease (4); (c) evaluation ofcerebral blood flow (5); (d) diagnosis of strangulated small bowel (6); and (e) assessing pla cental perfusion (7). <b>Radioxenon</b> has several advantages as a tracer for measuring regional blood perfusion:predictabletissueclearance proportional to perfusionovera broad rangeof flowrates; rapid clearance from the body through the lungs, resulting in minimal recirculation; a short biologic half-time and low radiation exposure; simple in strumentation required; and universal availability. Despite these advantages, at least one major obstacle prevents wider use: namely, high cost. Commercially prepared xenon- I 33 in sterile saline is currently available at about nine times the cost of the gaseous form. High cost prompted us to seek a simple, inexpensive method of producing this solution with facilities available in most nuclear medicine laboratories. Previous methods of preparation have included the use of reservoirs with large amounts of activity, specially prepared xenon vials, and elaborate dispensing systems (6, 7). Xenon-I 33 gas iscurrently availableat lessthan $ 1. 00 per mCi in small vials containing 10 â€” 30 mCi of activity. Parenteral, nonangiographic perfusion studies are easily performed wit...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} {{concentrate}} heavy noble gases {{from the atmosphere}} using certain organic fluids is being developed. To use this technique in a system to monitor the atmosphere for important noble gas fission products (Xe- 131, Xe- 131 m, Xe- 133, Xe- 133 m, and Xe- 135) generated by nuclear testing, the radionuclides captured in the fluid must either be detected in the fluid or degassed. This study presents experimental results {{for a number of}} possible degassing methods, including heating bubbling with a purge gas, ultrasonic agitation, vacuum, and combinations thereof. Methods were evaluated for energy and time requirements and dilution of the degas product. Initial experiments indicate that in addition to overcoming the standard desorption process dictated by partial pressures per Henry`s Law, a capture mechanism must also be overcome to degas. Some type of agitation, thermal or mechanical, can be used to release weakly trapped gas atoms from the fluid, while diffusional mass transfer can be enhanced through entrainment with a purge gas or use of a vacuum. Ultrasonic agitation of a thin film in a strong vacuum {{has been shown to be}} the most effective method of those tested. Implementation of an efficient degas system, along with an absorption system and <b>radioxenon</b> detector could result in an ultrasensitive fluid-based <b>radioxenon</b> measurement system that is more portable, less expensive, and simpler than charcoal-based systems which use cryogenic techniques...|$|E
