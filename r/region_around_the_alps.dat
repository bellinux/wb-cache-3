40|$|Economie {{dynamics}} {{has always}} been accompanied by spatial dynamics: economie heartlands come and go. The economie history of mankind shows many fluctuations in the functioning of major economie power blocks. For example, the dominant position of Western Europe is in fact fairly recent (see Olson, 1982). But also within Western Europe remarkable shifts {{can be observed in}} the past centuries, for instance, from Italy to the Iberian Peninsula and next to North-West Europe. Especially af ter the Industrial Revolution major changes have taken place in Europe, in which- besides geographical shifts of economie core areas- also drastic (inter) sectoral shifts could be observed (cf. Suarez-Villa, 1989). In recent years there is an increasing recognition of the rise in economie importance of <b>regions</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> <b>the</b> 'European Snowbelt'. This snowbelt comprises the following regions: Baden-Württemberg, Lombardia, Rhöne-Alpes, Provence-Alpes-Cóte d'Azur, and Switzerland and Austria. The rapid growth of the European Snowbelt is not only reflected in the rise in service employment in thes...|$|R
40|$|The {{first true}} witch hunts began in western Europe {{in the early}} fifteenth century. The {{earliest}} series of trials took place in Italy and in French- and German-speaking <b>regions</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> western <b>Alps.</b> Of course, concern about harmful sorcery had deep roots in medieval Europe, and both officially sanctioned prosecution and popular persecution {{had been brought to}} bear on its supposed practitioners long before. But only in the fifteenth century did the full stereotype of diabolical witchcraft develop, which would endure throughout the period of the major witch hunts in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries...|$|R
40|$|The garden dormouse, Eliomys quercinus (Rodentia, Gliridae), {{displays}} a surprisingly high karyotypic diversity, {{with the number}} of chromosomes varying between 2 N ¼ 48 and 2 N ¼ 54. We aimed to assess whether the karyotypic diversity is congruent with the mitochondrial differentiation of the populations; improve our understanding of the taxonomic relationships between garden dormouse populations based on both chromosomal and mitochondrial information; and establish the phylogeographic history of the species and the time of differentiation of mitochondrial lineages of E. quercinus and E. melanurus. For this purpose we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome-b (Cytb) gene for 62 E. quercinus and 4 E. melanurus from 27 localities representing all the known chromosomal races of the genus Eliomys in the western Palearctic region. Our results 1 st showed that populations of E. quercinus are separated into 4 evolutionarily significant units partially congruent with the chromosomal races and corresponding to Iberian (2 N¼ 48), Italian (2 N¼ 48 or 50), western European (2 N¼ 48, 49, or 50), and Alpine (2 N ¼ 52 or 54) mitochondrial lineages or clades. The existence of hybrid individuals between chromosomal races and the presence of several chromosomal races within each mitochondrial lineage both indicate that gene flow persists between chromosomal races. Second, we estimated that the major mitochondrial lineages differentiated from each other around 4. 2 6 SD 1 million years ago, thus predating the Quaternary glaciations. Third, E. quercinus displayed a higher haplotypic variability in the Mediterranean peninsula than in the northwestern European populations. However, E. quercinus did not show a pattern of ostglacial recolonization of northwestern Europe from Iberian or Italian populations. Our results also suggest that additional, unexpected refuge <b>regions</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> exist for <b>the</b> species. Such information will be useful for deciphering the priorities for the protection of E. quercinus, which is listed as ‘‘Near Threatened’’ on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species and is protected by Appendix III of the Bern Convention.

40|$|Background: Within the European Union (EU), {{substantial}} {{efforts are}} being made to achieve economic and social cohesion, and the reduction of health inequalities between EU regions is integral to this process. This paper {{is the first to}} examine how self-reported conditions and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) vary spatially between and within countries. Methods: Using 2014 European Social Survey (ESS) data from 20 countries, this paper examines how regional inequalities in self-reported conditions and NCDs vary for men and women in 174 regions (levels 1 and 2 Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units, ‘NUTS’). We document absolute and relative inequalities across Europe in the prevalence of eight conditions: general health, overweight/obesity, mental health, heart or circulation problems, high blood pressure, back, neck, muscular or joint pain, diabetes and cancer. Results: There is considerable inequality in self-reported conditions and NCDs between the regions of Europe, with rates highest in the regions of continental Europe, some Scandinavian regions and parts of the UK and lowest <b>around</b> <b>regions</b> bordering <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> in Ireland and France. However, for mental health and cancer, rates are highest in regions of Eastern European and lowest in some Nordic regions, Ireland and isolated regions in continental Europe. There are also widespread and consistent absolute and relative regional inequalities in all conditions within countries. These are largest in France, Germany and the UK, and smallest in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. There were higher inequalities amongst women. Conclusion: Using newly available harmonized morbidity data from across Europe, this paper shows that there are considerable regional inequalities within and between European countries in the distribution of self-reported conditions and NCDs...|$|R
