5000|$|Roundness is {{the measure}} of how closely {{the shape of an}} object {{approaches}} that of a mathematically perfect circle. Roundness applies in two dimensions, such as the cross sectional circles along a cylindrical object such as a shaft or a cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>for</b> a <b>bearing.</b> In geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, control of a cylinder can also include its fidelity to the longitudinal axis, yielding cylindricity. The analogue of roundness in three dimensions (that is, for spheres) is sphericity.|$|R
40|$|Cylindrical roller {{bearings}} typically employ roller profile modification to equalize load distribution, minimize stress concentration at roller ends {{and allow for}} {{a small amount of}} misalignment. The 1947 Lundberg-Palmgren analysis reported an inverse fourth power relation between load and life <b>for</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> with line contact. In 1952, Lundberg and Palmgren changed their load-life exponent to 10 / 3 <b>for</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> assuming mixed line and point contact. The effect of roller-crown profile was reanalyzed in this paper to determine the actual load-life relation <b>for</b> modified <b>roller</b> profiles. <b>For</b> uncrowned <b>rollers</b> (line contact), the load-life exponent is p = 4, in agreement with the 1947 Lundberg-Palmgren value but crowning reduces the value of the exponent, p. The lives of modern {{roller bearings}} made from vacuum-processed steels significantly exceed those predicted by the Lundberg-Palmgren theory. The Zaretsky rolling-element bearing life model of 1996 produces a load-life exponent of p = 5 <b>for</b> flat <b>rollers,</b> which is more consistent with test data. For the Zaretsky model with fully crowned rollers p = 4. 3. For an aerospace profile and chamfered rollers, p = 4. 6.
