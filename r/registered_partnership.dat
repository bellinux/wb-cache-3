50|$|<b>Registered</b> <b>partnerships</b> {{have been}} {{recognized}} since 1 January 2007, when the Partnership Act came into force.

25|$|<b>Registered</b> <b>partnership</b> was {{by civil}} {{ceremony}} only, but the Church of Denmark allowed priests to perform blessings of same-sex couples, as it {{stated that the}} church blesses people, not institutions.

25|$|On January 27, 2004, the Canton of Neuchâtel voted a law on cantonal level, the Partenariat enregistré (the Cantonal <b>Registered</b> <b>Partnership).</b> It grants {{unmarried}} couples, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, {{the same}} rights as married couple for cantonal matters such as responsibilities and protections, benefits in taxation, social security, or health insurance premiums.|$|E
25|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} became {{legal in}} Norway on 1 January 2009 when a gender-neutral marriage bill was enacted after being {{passed by the}} Norwegian Parliament in June 2008. Norway became the first Scandinavian country and the sixth {{country in the world}} to legalize same-sex marriage. Gender-neutral marriage replaced Norway's previous system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Couples in registered partnerships are able to retain that status or convert their <b>registered</b> <b>partnership</b> to a marriage. No new registered partnerships may be created.|$|E

50|$|On 22 August 2016, Desirée de Sousa-Croes, an {{openly gay}} MP, who married her {{same-sex}} {{partner in the}} Netherlands, introduced a bill to legalize <b>registered</b> <b>partnerships.</b> However, {{a vote on the}} bill was postponed to 8 September 2016 because some MPs still needed time to make up their minds. On 8 September 2016, the Aruban Parliament voted 11-5 to legalize <b>registered</b> <b>partnerships.</b> The law went into effect on 10 October 2016. <b>Registered</b> <b>partnerships</b> are open to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples.|$|R
25|$|Civil union, civil partnership, {{domestic}} partnership, <b>registered</b> <b>partnership,</b> unregistered partnership, and unregistered cohabitation statuses offer varying legal {{benefits of}} marriage.

Indian direct investments abroad began in 1992, and Indian corporations and <b>registered</b> <b>partnership</b> firms are now allowed to invest in businesses up to 100 percent of their net worth. India's largest outgoing investments are in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 54.8 percent of the country's foreign investments. The second largest are in non-financial services (software development), accounting for 35.4 percent of investments.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, rites of {{marriage}} for same-sex couples without legal recognition became increasingly common. The first law providing for marriage {{of people of}} the same sex in modern times was enacted in 2001 in the Netherlands. , same-sex marriage is legally recognized (nationwide or in some parts) in the following countries: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. Polls show rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage in the Americas, Australia and most of Europe. United States, and Uruguay, as well as 4 states of Mexico (Mexico City, Quintana Roo, Chihuahua and Coahuila) permit same-sex marriages. Both Israel and Malta recognizes same-sex marriages abroad - but does not allow same-sex marriages to be performed within its borders. In 21 countries worldwide and in several US Counties and/or Cities, a same-sex couple can be legally partnered in a civil union, domestic partnership or <b>registered</b> <b>partnership.</b> Couples in these unions or partnerships are afforded rights and obligations similar to, but not identical to, those of a married couple.|$|E
50|$|On 1 January 1998, <b>registered</b> <b>partnerships</b> (geregistreerd partnerschap) were {{introduced}} in Dutch law. The partnerships were meant for same-sex couples {{as an alternative to}} marriage, though they can also be entered into by opposite-sex couples, and in fact about one third of the <b>registered</b> <b>partnerships</b> between 1998 and 2001 were of opposite-sex couples. In law, <b>registered</b> <b>partnerships</b> and marriage convey the same rights and duties, especially after some laws were changed to remedy inequalities with respect to inheritance and some other issues.|$|R

25|$|Same-sex couples {{may enter}} into civil unions in the Australian Capital Territory and civil {{partnerships}} in Queensland. Both unions allow couples to have state-sanctioned ceremonies and Queensland's law is {{commonly referred to}} as civil unions. In New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia, same-sex couples can enter into domestic registered partnerships/relationships. These provide conclusive proof of the existence of the relationship, thereby gaining the same rights afforded to de facto couples under state and federal law without having to prove any further factual evidence of the relationship. In this way, a registered relationship is similar to a <b>registered</b> <b>partnership</b> or civil union {{in other parts of the}} world. Victoria and Tasmania's domestic partnership laws also allow any couple the option of having an official ceremony when registering their relationship. South Australia's law allowing registered relationships and recognised overseas and interstate same-sex unions went into effect on 1 August, 2017. In Western Australia and the Northern Territory, same-sex couples must often seek juridical approval to prove a de facto relationship exists. Norfolk Island from 1 July 2016, have been incorporated into NSW legislation, under both the Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015 and the Territories Legislation Amendment Act 2016.|$|E
25|$|For instance, with {{relation}} {{to social security}} and general family law, same-sex couples were not previously recognised as a couple for social security or family assistance purposes. A person who had a same-sex de facto partner {{was treated as a}} single person. The reforms ensured that same-sex couples were (for the first time under Australian law) recognised as a couple akin to opposite-sex partners. Consequently, a same-sex couple receives the same rate of social security and family assistance payments as an opposite-sex couple. Generally speaking a couple in a de facto relationship is treated equally to a married couple in legal proceedings, though a few small differences exist in family law disputes, including property settlements and entitlements to spousal maintenance. A partner in a de facto relationship may also be required to prove the existence of a relationship before a court in order to access benefits, a process which is automatic for married couples and consequently can have a discriminatory impact on same-sex couples, who cannot yet marry in Australia. De facto relationships also have different time eligibility requirements than marriages when it comes to laws dealing with Centrelink, migration, family law matters and assisted reproduction. The greater burden of proof can impact on a person's ability to arrange their partner's funeral, and the rights of a de facto partner may be poorly understood by government departments. Despite large equality of rights, Australia does not have a national <b>registered</b> <b>partnership,</b> civil union or same-sex relationship scheme.|$|E
