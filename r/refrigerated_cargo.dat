In the paper the risk factors capable of influencing quality of cargoes during their servicing in sea port, are identified, and the elaborated model for assessing risk level with the use of assumptions of fuzzy logic theory, is presented. Also, a simulation of servicing reefer containers in port, was performed. Moreover a prototype of an expert system which makes it possible to take correct decisions on servicing reefer containers in sea port, depending on impact level of risk factors, was propose...|$|R
