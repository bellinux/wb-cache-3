25|$|Montgomery {{held the}} first patent on a <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> mower. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, mowers were {{equipped}} with a rotating reel assembly that was either pushed by hand or was propelled by a small gasoline engine. This kind of mower worked well in short grass, but it clogged up in tall grass. Montgomery did not invent this mower, but he obtained the patent from a frustrated inventor in Chicago, Illinois. The first commercially produced rotary mower, the Yazoo Master Mower, was then produced by a small manufacturing plant in Jackson, Mississippi. Montgomery was the Louisiana distributor of Yazoo until 1981, when he closed his lawnmower business in Ruston.|$|E
25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|E

50|$|The {{electric}} razor (electric shaver) {{consists of}} a set of oscillating or rotating blades, which are held behind a perforated metal screen which prevents them from coming into contact with the skin and behaves much like the second blade in a pair of scissors. When the razor is held against the skin, the whiskers poke through the holes in the screen and are sliced by the moving blades. In some designs the blades are a rotating cylinder. In others they are one or more rotating disks or a set of oscillating blades. Each design has an optimum motion over the skin for the best shave and manufacturers provide guidance on this. Generally, circular or cylindrical blades (rotary-type shaver) move in a circular motion and oscillating blades (foil-type shaver) move left and right. Hitachi has produced foil-type shavers with a <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> that operates similarly to the blade assembly of a reel-type lawn mower. The first electric razor was built by Jacob Schick in 1928.|$|E

5000|$|At the time, larger {{sport utility}} {{vehicles}} tended to use pickup truck-based, body-on-frame designs. Other car makers, Jeep and Toyota, had been offering smaller unibody designs, the Jeep Cherokee (XJ) and RAV4, respectively. Solid rear axles were commonly used due {{to their ability to}} carry heavy loads at the expense of a comfortable ride and good handling. Ford and Mazda then decided to offer a car-like, unibody design with a fully independent suspension and rack and pinion steering, the Escape. Although not meant for serious off-roading, a full-time all-wheel-drive (AWD) system supplied by Dana was optional, which included a locking center differential activated by a switch on the dashboard. The AWD system normally sends most of the power from the engine to the front wheels. If slipping is detected at the front, more power will be sent to the rear wheels in a fraction of a second. The four wheel drive system was a newer version of Ford's [...] "Control Trac" [...] 4x4 system, dubbed the Control Trac II 4WD in the Escape. This system allowed the front wheels to receive 100% of the torque until a slip was detected. Using a <b>Rotary</b> <b>Blade</b> Coupling, the rear wheels could be sent up to 100% of the power in fractions of a second. When switching the system from [...] "Auto" [...] to [...] "On," [...] the front and rear axles are locked at a 50/50 split; the reaction time necessary to engage the rear wheels is reduced via an integrated bypass clutch. The Control Trac II system allows for a four-wheel drive vehicle without the use of a center differential. The entire braking system was built by Continental Teves, including the ABS and various related suspension components. CKD production began in 2002 at Ford Lio Ho Motor Co. in Taiwan for various Asian markets.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Power {{lawnmowers}} {{can pose}} significant {{danger of injury}} to both the operator and the bystander, from {{direct contact with the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> or missile injury. Our objective was to review our experience with paediatric lawnmower-associated trauma, and the safety recommendations available to operators of power lawnmowers. METHODS: The patient cohort comprised paediatric (< 16 years of age) patients treated for lawnmower-associated trauma, by the plastic surgery service, between 1996 and 2003. These patients were identified retrospectively. Age at the time of injury, location and extent of bony and soft tissue injuries sustained, treatment instituted and clinical outcome were recorded. Brochures and instruction manuals of six lawnmower manufacturers were reviewed, and safety recommendations noted. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were identified. The majority of injuries occurred from direct contact with the <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> (93 %); the remaining child sustained a burn injury. Fourteen children (93 %) required operative intervention. Seven patients (46 %) sustained injuries resulting in amputation, two of whom had major limb amputations. All children, except the burns patient, underwent wound debridement and received antibiotic therapy. Reconstructive methods ranged from primary closure to free tissue transfer. Many patients required multiple procedures. In all instruction manuals, instructions to keep children and pets indoors or out of the yard when mowing were found. CONCLUSIONS: Lawnmower injuries can be devastating, particularly in children. Many victims have lasting deformities {{as a result of their}} injuries. Awareness of and stringent adherence to safety precautions during use of power lawnmowers can prevent many of these accidents...|$|R

Moreover, there is no obvious weight loss in boronizing-status sample after 168 hours’ corrosion in the fertilizer-containing soil, while the weight of lonnealing-status sample is lighter than the original weight after about 150 hours’ corrosion. The improvement of the corrosion resistance lies in the significant reduction of the anodization speed in strong acid medium and the effective prevention of phosphorization reaction in weak acidic medium...|$|E
40|$|The {{rotary tiller}} slot planter {{of the present}} {{invention}} comprises a subsoiler shank positioned to engage the soil and make a trench therein. A pair of <b>rotary</b> tiller <b>blades</b> are rotatably mounted on the opposite sides of the sub-soil shank in planes parallel thereto. The center-lines of the rotary tiller wheels are located behind the subsoil shank.

40|$|Purpose: Walking type {{cultivator}} {{used for}} weeding generated excessive handle vibration {{as well as}} bouncing motion depending on the weeding speed. This research was conducted to define a design factor of the <b>rotary</b> weeding <b>blades</b> for reducing soil reaction forces as well as hand vibration. Methods: The motion and forces acting on the <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> were reviewed {{to find out the}} most influencing parameter on hand vibration. The installation angle (IA) of the blade was selected and analyzed to determine the condition of no reaction force less. For removing the unnecessary upward soil reaction, the design factor theory of weeding blade was suggested based on geometrics and dynamics. For evaluation of design factor theory, the experiment in situ was performed base on ISO 5349 : 1. The vibration ahv and theoretical value XMF were compared with two groups that one was positive group (XMF> 0) and the other was negative group (XMF < 0). Results: XMF was derived from rotational velocity, forward velocity, disk diameter, weeding depth, blade’s width and IA of blade. Two groups had significant difference (p < 0. 05). In aspect of the group mean total exposure duration, positive group was 17. 53 % bigger than negative group. When disk radius 100, 150 and 200 mm, minimum IAs were 4 ~ 27 °, 3 ~ 15 ° and 2 ~ 10 °, respectively. A spread sheet program which calculated XMF was developed by Excel 2013.
