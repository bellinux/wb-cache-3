40|$|Access to {{funding is}} {{one of the keys to}} success in {{academic}} careers, both for women and for men, providing essential support for research and publications. Indeed, the role of competitive funding is increasing in many European national settings and success in the competition for <b>research</b> <b>funding</b> is now often used as a measure of scientific excellence at both individual and institutional level. Those who decide on allocation of <b>research</b> <b>funding</b> play thus an important gatekeeping role shaping the research system. In this article, we explore gatekeeping of <b>research</b> <b>funding</b> in Europe from a gender perspective.

25|$|He {{argues that}} the {{availability}} of federal <b>research</b> <b>funds</b> distorts “the natural market for scientific research” by inducing scientists to eschew pursuit of radical lines of potentially promising research that might not appeal to politicians and bureaucrats who hold influence over the allocation of grant monies. “Federal funding of medical research guarantees the politicization of decisions about what types of research for what diseases will be funded. Scarce tax resources are allocated according to who has the most effective lobby, {{rather than on the}} basis of need or even likely success. Federal funding also causes researchers to neglect potential treatments and cures that do not qualify for federal funds.” In his view, eliminating government sources of funds for medical research would probably improve the quality of research being performed.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} attract greater <b>research</b> <b>funds</b> is needed to meet {{the goals of the}} plan, and the {{university}} has set a goal of $100million annually. Fourteen years later, in FY2013, research expenditures reached this goal. To help raise money the university mounted a $1billion capital campaign, of which the public phase began in September 2004 and was expected to finish by 2008. In 2001, a major milestone of the campaign was the pledging of an unrestricted gift of $360million by an anonymous donor, believed to be the largest such gift to a U.S.university at the time. The university had been a relative stranger to such generosity as the prior largest single gift was $15million. By September 2006, the $1billion goal has been exceeded much in part to an in-kind contribution of software commercially valued at $513.95million by the Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education (PACE). In light of this, the board of trustees increased the goal of the $1billion capital campaign to $1.4billion by June 30, 2009. The new goal was met by October 1, 2008.|$|E

500|$|Another of Romney's {{initiatives}} was [...] "Operation Breakthrough," [...] {{which was}} intended {{to increase the amount}} of housing available to the poor and which initially had Nixon's support. [...] Based on his automotive industry experience, Romney thought that the cost of housing could be significantly reduced if in-factory modular construction techniques were used. [...] HUD officials believed that introduction of this technique could help bring about desegregation; Romney said, [...] "We've got to put an end to the idea of moving to suburban areas and living only among people of the same economic and social class". [...] This aspect of the program brought about strong opposition at the local suburban level and lost support in the White House as well. [...] Over half of HUD's <b>research</b> <b>funds</b> during this time were spent on Operation Breakthrough, and it was modestly successful in its building goals. [...] It did not revolutionize home construction, and was phased out once Romney left HUD. But it resulted indirectly in more modern and consistent building codes and introduction of technological advances such as the smoke alarm.|$|E
