It still may be possible to restore a FAT or NTFS partition if a backup boot sector is available.|$|R

50|$|For many purposes, the NTFS {{file system}} is {{superior}} to FAT in terms of features and reliability; its main drawbacks are its complexity and the size overhead for small volumes {{as well as the}} very limited support by anything other than the NT-based versions of Windows, since the exact specification is a trade secret of Microsoft. The availability of NTFS-3G since mid-2006 has led to much improved NTFS support in Unix-like operating systems, considerably alleviating this concern. It is still not possible to use NTFS in DOS-like operating systems without third-party drivers, which in turn makes it difficult to use a DOS floppy for recovery purposes. Microsoft provided a Recovery Console to work around this issue, but for security reasons it severely limited what could be done through the Recovery Console by default. The movement of <b>recovery</b> <b>utilities</b> to boot CDs based on BartPE, Linux (with NTFS-3G), or WinPE is eroding this drawback, but the complexity of NTFS prevents its implementation in light-weight operating systems or most embedded systems.|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: This study {{proposed}} a robust algorithm named as Backward <b>Recovery</b> Preemptive <b>Utility</b> Accrual Scheduling (BRPUAS) algorithm that implements the Backward Recovery (BR) mechanism as a fault recovery solution under the existing utility accrual scheduling environment. The problem {{identified in the}} TUF/UA scheduling domain is that the existing algorithms only considers the Abortion Recovery (AR) as their fault recovery solution in which all faulty tasks are simply aborted to nullify the erroneous effect. The decision to immediately abort the affected tasks is inefficient because aborted tasks produce zero utility causes the system to accrue lower utility. Approach: The proposed BRPUAS algorithm enabled the re-execution of the affected tasks rather than abortion {{to reduce the number}} of aborted task in the existing algorithm known as Abortion <b>Recovery</b> Preemptive <b>Utility</b> Accrual Scheduling (ARPUAS) algorithm that employed the AR mechanism. The BRPUAS ensure the correctness of the executed tasks in the best effort basis in such a way that the infeasible tasks are aborted and produced zero utility, while the feasible tasks are re-executed to produce positive utility and consequently maximized the total accrued utility to the system. The performances of these algorithms are measured by using discrete event simulation. Results: The proposed BRPUAS algorithm achieved higher accrued utility compared to ARPUAS for the entire load range. Conclusion: Simulation results revealed that the BR mechanism is more efficient than the existing AR mechanism, producing higher accrued utility ratio and less abortion ratio making it more reliable and efficient for adaptive real time application domain...|$|R
