40|$|The Lower Palaeozoic Southern Uplands terrane shows a NE–SW, strike-parallel {{coincidence}} of regional geochemical lineaments defined from stream-sediment data, and major lithostratigraphically significant structures. West of Moffat, Silurian strata of the Gala and Hawick groups are divided by geochemical lineaments coincident with the Laurieston Fault. East of Moffat, the geochemical lineaments diverge towards the NE with Gala-type <b>regional</b> <b>geochemistry</b> (high Sr and Ba, low CaO) {{to the north}} of the Moffat Valley Fault, whilst Hawick-type <b>regional</b> <b>geochemistry</b> (low Sr and Ba, high CaO) continues to the south of the Laurieston Fault; between the faults lies the recently-defined Ettrick Group. Beyond the eastern end of the Lower Palaeozoic outcrop, its geochemical lineaments extend across the unconformable cover of Devonian ‘Old Red Sandstone’. This is partly a drainage catchment effect, but two other possible explanations are considered: a localized derivation of the Devonian clastic rocks, such that they inherit the compositional patterns of the underlying Lower Palaeozoic sandstones; or a geochemical signature imposed by glacial deposits derived from the Lower Palaeozoic outcrop. The local effect of glacial dispersion is confirmed by the distribution of TiO 2; anomalously high levels associated with Carboniferous mafic lavas have been transported NE across the low-TiO 2 Carboniferous sedimentary rocks of the Tweed Basin. ...|$|E

The management of large volumes of mine tailings represents a major challenge to the mining industry and environmental managers. This field-scale study evaluates the impact of two highly contrasting remediation approaches to the management and stabilisation of mine tailings. The geochemistry of the tailings, overlying amendment layers and vegetation are examined {{in the light of}} the different management approaches. Pseudo-total As, Cd and Pb concentrations and solid-state partitioning (speciation), determined via sequential extraction, were established for two Tailings Management Facilities (TMFs) in Ireland subjected to the following: (1) a â��walk-awayâ�� approach (Silvermines) and (2) application of an amendment layer (Galmoy).

New U–Pb zircon data and <b>regional</b> <b>geochemistry</b> suggest that the Tyrone Plutonic Group represents the uppermost portions of a c. 480 Ma suprasubduction-zone ophiolite accreted onto an outboard segment of Laurentia prior to 470. 3 ± 1. 9 Ma. The overlying Tyrone Volcanic Group formed as an island arc that collided with the Laurentian margin during the Grampian phase of the Caledonidan orogeny. Early magmatism is characterized by transitional to calc-alkaline, light REE (LREE) -enriched island-arc signatures, with an increasing component of continentally derived material up sequence. Tholeiitic rhyolites with flat to U-shaped REE profiles and LREE-depleted basalts, located stratigraphically below a c. 473 Ma rhyolite of the upper Tyrone Volcanic Group, suggest initiation of intra-arc rifting at c. 475 Ma. Metamorphic cooling ages from the Tyrone Central Inlier imply arc–continent collision before 468 ± 1. 4 Ma, with the emplacement of the Tyrone Volcanic Group onto the margin.

40|$|Compositional data (almost {{all data}} in geochemistry) are closed data, i. e. they sum up to a {{constant}} (e. g. 100 weight percent). Thus the correlation structure of compositional data is strongly biased and results of many multivariate techniques become doubtful without a proper {{transformation of the}} data. The centered logratio transformation (clr) {{is often used to}} open closed data. However the transformed data do not have full rank following a logratio transformation and cannot be used for robust multivariate techniques like principal component analysis (PCA). Here we propose to use the isometric logratio transformation (ilr) instead. However, the ilr transformation has the disadvantage that the resulting new variables are no longer directly interpretable in terms of the originally entered variables. Here we propose a technique how the resulting scores and loadings of a robust PCA on ilr transformed data can be back-transformed and interpreted. The procedure is demonstrated using a real data set from <b>regional</b> <b>geochemistry</b> and compared to results from non-transformed and non-robust versions of PCA. It turns out that the procedure using ilr transformed data and robust PCA delivers superior results to all other approaches.

40|$|Water {{quality in}} the Sierra Vista Ground-Water Basin is of extreme {{importance}} due to the basin's unique ecosystem and predicted future population growth. Portions of the Upper San Pedro River, flowing through the Sierra Vista Basin, contain some {{of the few remaining}} perennial streamflows in the southwest. Baseflow in the perennial reaches of the river are maintained almost entirely by the regional and floodplain aquifer systems. A population increase is predicted for the Sierra Vista Basin, and an impact on groundwater quality and availability can be expected. Due to the closely linked hydrologic systems within the basin, contamination or depletion of the regional aquifer could have direct implications for the San Pedro River. Water samples were collected within the study area from the regional and floodplain aquifers, the San Pedro River, and a bedrock spring in the Huachuca Mountains.

40|$|Karst {{aquifers}} {{occur in}} a range of climatic and geologic settings. Nonetheless, they are commonly characterized by their vulnerability to water-quality impairment. Two karst aquifers, the Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas and the Upper Floridan aquifer in western Florida, were investigated to assess factors that control the movement of contaminants to public-supply wells (PSWs). The geochemistry of samples from a selected PSW or wellfield in each aquifer was compared with that from nearby monitoring wells and <b>regional</b> PSWs. <b>Geochemistry</b> results were integrated with age tracers, flow modeling, and depth-dependent data to refine aquifer conceptual models and to identify factors that affect contaminant movement to PSWs. The oxic Edwards aquifer is vertically well mixed at the selected PSW/wellfield, although regionally the aquifer is geochemically variable downdip. The mostly anoxic Upper Floridan aquifer is affected by denitrification and also is geochemically variable with depth. In spite of considerable differences in geology and hydrogeology, the two aquifers are similarly vulnerable to anthropogenic contamination. Vulnerability in studied PSWs in both aquifers is strongly influenced by rapid karst flowpaths and the dominance of young (< 10 years) groundwater. Vulnerability was demonstrated by the frequent detection of similar constituents of concern in both aquifers (nitrate, atrazine, deethylatrazine, tetrachloroethene, and chloroform). Specific consideration of water-quality protection efforts, well construction and placement, and aquifer response times to land-use changes and contaminant loading are discussed, with implications for karst groundwater management...|$|R

The study aims {{to assess the}} likely natural baseline chemistry of the groundwater. Data have been collected from strategic sampling of 24 groundwater sources, in conjunction with collation of existing groundwater, rainfall, and mineralogical data. The Corallian aquifer comprise Upper Jurassic shallow shelf marine sediments, {{with a variety of}} facies including muds to micritic limestone and oolites, to bioclastic limestones with interbeds of silts and sands. These strata represent an important groundwater source in north-east England. The main chemical properties of the groundwater are determined by the interaction of rainwater recharge reacting with the aquifer minerals. Within the Corallian aquifer, groundwater major ion composition is dominantly influenced by reaction with calcite, and little variation is seen within the major ion proportions. Human impacts on the water quality are clearly evident, mainly through the presence of NO 3 -N as an indicator contaminant. The widespread presence, commonly in excess of the drinking water limit and the increases over time suggest that the aquifer is heavily influenced by agricultural practices. Agricultural land dominates the area underlain by the unconfined aquifer. With the exception of NO 3 -N, the available data for groundwater within the Corallian aquifer of the Vale of Pickering indicate they are of good quality for the analytes tested, with few elevated concentrations of potentially harmful trace elements. For many analytes the 95 th percentile serves as a first approximation of the upper limit of the baseline range of concentrations, as this serves to eliminate the most extreme outlier concentrations...|$|E

However, {{little research has been}} done to identify the sources of such elements as natural or manmade. Whilst the mining industry has traditionally used hydrogeochemical baselines for exploration, this study has evaluated the use of such baselines for environmental assessments of drainage systems, particularly the identification and quantification of natural and anthropogenic sources. The results are discussed in the context of water quality regulation and guideline values. The research generated the first systematic regional geochemical baseline of Central Chile including the classic Andean copper mineral province and the Andina – Los Bronces mining district. The study area included three major catchments flowing from the Andean Cordillera into inhabited valleys, with the potential for contamination from agriculture and the urban environment. Waters were sampled at a density of 1 per 100 sq. km. over 20000 sq. km. in five seasons over three years. Multi-element chemistry and stable isotopes were determined. The geochemical baseline was prepared using high quality geochemical data. The distribution patterns of the anomalously high geochemistry showed strong relationships with bedrock geology, including the presence of evaporites, sulphide mineralisation and hydrothermally altered rocks (differentiated using isotopes in sulphate). High concentrations of nitrate and phosphate were identified in agricultural areas reflecting pollution from fertilisers and sewage (distinguished using isotopes in nitrate). Areas affected by fertilisers and sewage were significantly greater than those affected by mining. Waters draining unmined Cu-mineralisation had much higher Cu and Ni levels and lower pH than Cu-mine area waters.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the <b>regional</b> <b>geochemistry</b> of groundwater from the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer of Devon and Somerset. In {{order to assess}} the likely natural baseline chemistry of the groundwater in the area, information has been gathered from the strategic collection of 21 new groundwater samples, and from collation of existing groundwater, rainfall, mineralogical and geochemical data. The Sherwood Sandstone aquifer results from continental deposition during the early Triassic period. The deposition comprised thick clastic deposits in basins created during the late Permian. There are two distinct units: the Otter Sandstone Formation and the underlying Budleigh Salterton Pebble Beds Formation. These units form the most important aquifer in south-west England. The main chemical properties of the groundwater are determined by rainwater recharge reacting with the aquifer minerals. Of these minerals carbonates are the dominant influence on the water chemistry. While Ca is dominant in groundwaters from both aquifer units, the water types from the two units can be distinguished: the Otter Sandstone Formation aquifer has mainly Ca-HCO 3 type waters, with some mixing towards Mg, and the groundwaters in the Budleigh Salterton Pebble Beds Formation aquifer are of Ca-HCO 3 type to Na+K-Cl type. There is little variation in the major ion proportion of the groundwaters from the Otter Sandstone Formation, most likely as these represent groundwater in equilibrium with the minerals which give it this character. There is greater variation in the Budleigh Salterton Pebble Beds Formation groundwaters. Besides the difference in groundwater types, the groundwater from the Budleigh Salterton Pebble Beds Formation is more acidic, more oxic, has lower SEC values, and HCO 3, Cr, U and Mg concentrations, and higher concentrations of Al, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Tl and REE than the groundwater from the Otter Sandstone Formation.

Multivariate and univariate analysis are used to illustrate distribution and sources of elements and organic compounds, both on land and in sea sediments for Naples and Salerno Gulfs. Different pollution impact factors and risk assessment factors are estimated for soils and sediments that easily comes to contact with human beings. The results suggest that Naples city territory, and Naples and Pozzuoli Gulfs are characterized by highly incremental lifetime cancer risk. An attempt of applying in situ Raman spectroscopic detection of pollutants started {{with a series of}} laboratory experiments. With the help of capillary high pressure optical cell, following results are achieved: 1) methane diffusion coefficients in water under high pressure and wide temperature range, and the relationship of diffusion coefficients with temperature was established; 2) Raman intensity ratio of asymmetric stretching vibration (ν 3) and asymmetric bending overtone (2 ν 2) of methane were numerically described vs temperature, pressure and gas phase density; 3) reactions of goethite and magnetite with sulfide solutions under CH 4 and/or CO 2 atmospheres were monitored at room temperature. Pyrrhotite and mackinawite were observed in final products. A demanding of innovative approach to detect organic contaminants encourages various researches to improve in-situ techniques. A new substrate embedding silver nanoparticles into siloxane polymer is used as the platform to generate Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). Polymer serves as supporting material of silver nanoparticles as well as a stationary phase. After a short period of extraction, certain partition of organic compounds from aqueous solution accumulates into polymer. When silver nanoparticles is in touch with organic compounds, enhanced Raman scattering is obtained with 104 ~ 106 orders of magnitude. Raman scattering is obtained. Because of these two-steps amplification, SERS, which is typical applied strictly at lab condition, could be compromised when applied for field survey. Crystal violet (CV) is chosen to evaluate extraction properties of polymer. Color “transferring” indicates effective extraction of crystal violet into polymer. Intensive Raman bands include SERS effects and resonance scattering of CV. Low concentration of 4 -nitrophenol (PNP) and 4 -nitroaniline (PNA) in solution (as low as 10 - 7 M) are dropped onto substrate and generate SERS fingerprint.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the <b>regional</b> <b>geochemistry</b> of groundwater from the Magnesian Limestone aquifer of County Durham and North Yorkshire. The study aims {{to assess the}} likely natural baseline chemistry of the groundwater by identifying the dominant controlling processes. Data have been collected from strategic sampling of 36 groundwater sources, in conjunction with collation of existing groundwater, rainfall, mineralogical and geochemical data. The Magnesian Limestone aquifer comprises a series of marine limestones and dolomites, marls and evaporites which reflect cycles of transgression, regression and evaporation of a shallow tropical sea. The depositional basin was divided by an area of high ground. As a result of this, the geology and hence groundwater are chemically different in regions known as the Durham Province and the Yorkshire Province. The aquifer is regionally important for public and domestic supply, agriculture and industry. It provides significant baseflow to the River Skerne, and minor baseflow contributions to the Rivers Wear and Tees. The groundwaters have notable regional variation in chemistry. Groundwater in County Durham is mainly of Ca-Mg-HCO 3 type with some mixing towards SO 4, Na, and Cl compositions. In Yorkshire, groundwaters are most frequently of Ca-HCO 3 type and show some mixing towards Ca-SO 4 type. The differences in water type reflect differences in the strata in these two regions, most notably the presence of dissolving gypsum in Yorkshire. Groundwaters with high salinity (Na up to 4600 mg L– 1, Cl up to 9000 mg L– 1) {{have been found in}} the coastal areas, particularly around Hartlepool. These are associated with saline intrusion. Relatively saline waters are also present in the area around the Durham coalfield in {{the central part of the}} study area. These waters have high concentrations of Ca, Cl, Ba, Fe, and SO 4, and likely result from minewater rebound following closure of the mines in the 1970 s. Human impacts are mainly visible in the presence of indicator contaminants such as nitrate from agricultural or domestic sources or trace metals from urban or industrial sources. The widespread presence of nitrate and increasing concentrations indicates the extent to which the aquifer is influenced by modern farming practices. Concentrations of Cu, and Pb are relatively high around areas of industry and near major roads. Anomalous concentrations of a suite of trace metals (Fe, Co, Cr, Cu and Ni in particular) observed in groundwater from one site have been were attributed to contamination from the borehole metalwork. Most of the sampled groundwaters from Magnesian Limestone aquifer of the study area are of relatively good inorganic quality, although concentrations of some solutes approach or exceed current national drinking-water limits in some areas.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the <b>regional</b> <b>geochemistry</b> of groundwater from the Palaeogene aquifer of the Thames Basin. The {{aim of the}} study is to assess the likely natural baseline chemistry of the groundwater by identifying the dominant controlling processes. Data have been collected from strategic sampling of 19 new groundwater samples, along with collation, from various sources, of existing groundwater, rainfall, mineralogical and geochemical data. The Palaeogene aquifer results from the cyclical deposition of shallow marine and coastal sediments and comprises sand and clay layers which display large lateral and vertical variation. This variation gives rise to localised regions of productive aquifer, and localised geochemical variations. For these reasons the Palaeogene strata only provide minor aquifers of regional significance. That said, these can be important when managing the water supply in London and the surrounding urbanised areas. The geological differences between formations within the Palaeogene strata mean that the water type is generally a continuum between Ca-HCO 3 type to Ca-SO 4 type. Other differences in groundwater quality caused by geological variation are evident in the minor and trace element concentrations. The main water quality problems are associated with oxidation of pyrite, which occurs sporadically throughout the Palaeogene beds, and has the ability to produce acidic, hard, metal-rich waters. In beds underlying the confining London Clay, this has occurred as a result of anthropogenic groundwater extraction from the Chalk below. In beds above the London Clay this process can occur entirely naturally, owing to a ready supply of oxygen and water. In addition human impacts are mainly visible in the presence of indicator contaminants, such as nitrate. The widespread presence and increasing concentrations of nitrate indicate {{the extent to which the}} unconfined aquifer is influenced by modern farming practices or urban pollution. Trace metals associated with the oxidation of pyrite within the aquifer (Fe, Ni, Co) also affect the water quality. Whilst these are released as a result of natural geochemical reactions, historic pumping regimes have also exerted an influence. Lead is found in elevated concentrations (up to 13. 3 μg L- 1) in samples taken in close proximity to major roads, and it is likely that these derive from the past usage of leaded petrol in motor vehicles. While some of the groundwaters investigated in this study are of good inorganic quality, and of a soft nature, there are many notable exceptions which contain elevated concentrations of Fe, SO 4, Ni and Co. The distribution of these is generally so sporadic that water quality would be difficult to predict prior to drilling a borehole. It is recommended to drill into the underlying Chalk for a groundwater source of more reliable quality and quantity...|$|E

A detailed geochemical study of relatively fresh basalts and diabases (LOI< 3 wt%) from the GE indicates that the rocks were formed {{by a variety of}} magmatic processes and probably from different mantle sources. The trace-element data, and REE patterns show depleted-, transitional- and enriched-type trends. The higher TiO 2 values and La/Sm ratios in some of the rocks suggest a transform fault effect on mantle melting, where decreasing amounts of melt are formed at lower temperatures as the Gorda spreading ridge approaches the MTF. These compositions occur in addition to lavas with relatively fractionated seamount-like compositions. The wide range of Mg # and CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratios suggest extensive fractionation in shallow level magma chambers. This resulted in varying phenocryst assemblages (ol±plg±cpx) and crystallization orders. The chemistry of the GE rocks match those of axial lava flows, and off-axis seamounts from the Gorda ridge. In addition, {{the eastern part of the}} GE shows more enriched compositions than the off-axis Gorda ridge seamounts. However, these are not as enriched as the Pacific Plate seamount lavas. 40 Ar- 39 Ar dates of the rocks also support their origin form the Gorda Ridge. The rocks on GE have since been transferred from the Gorda Plate to the Pacific Plate as coherent slabs by N-S compression. The transfer as coherent slabs is supported by <b>regional</b> consistency in <b>geochemistry,</b> and exposed sections of intact oceanic crust as seen during ROV dives...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, the {{delivery}} of geological information for industry and public was achieved by geological mapping. Now pervasively available computers mean that 3 D geological models can deliver realistic representations of the geometric location of geological units, represented as shells or volumes. The next phase {{of this process is}} to populate these with physical properties data that describe subsurface heterogeneity and its associated uncertainty. Achieving this requires capture and serving of physical, hydrological and other property information from diverse sources to populate these models. The British Geological Survey (BGS) holds large volumes of subsurface property data, derived both from their own research data collection and also other, often commercially derived data sources. This can be voxelated to incorporate this data into the models to demonstrate property variation within the subsurface geometry. All property data held by BGS has for many years been stored in relational databases to ensure their long-term continuity. However these have, by necessity, complex structures; each database contains positional reference data and model information, and also metadata such as sample identification information and attributes that define the source and processing. Whilst this is critical to assessing these analyses, it also hugely complicates the understanding of variability of the property under assessment and requires multiple queries to study related datasets making extracting physical properties from these databases difficult. Therefore the PropBase Query Layer has been created to allow simplified aggregation and extraction of all related data and its presentation of complex data in simple, mostly denormalized, tables which combine information from multiple databases into a single system. The structure from each relational database is denormalized in a generalised structure, so that each dataset can be viewed together in a common format using a simple interface. Data are re-engineered to facilitate easy loading. The query layer structure comprises tables, procedures, functions, triggers, views and materialised views. The structure contains a main table PRB_DATA which contains all of the data with the following attribution: •	a unique identifier •	the data source •	the unique identifier from the parent database for traceability •	the 3 D location •	the property type •	the property value •	the units •	necessary qualifiers •	precision information and an audit trail Data sources, property type and units are constrained by dictionaries, a key component of the structure which defines what properties and inheritance hierarchies are to be coded and also guides the process as to what and how these are extracted from the structure. Data types served by the Query Layer include site investigation derived geotechnical data, hydrogeology datasets, <b>regional</b> <b>geochemistry,</b> geophysical logs as well as lithological and borehole metadata. The size and complexity of the data sets with multiple parent structures requires a technically robust approach to keep the layer synchronised. This is achieved through Oracle procedures written in PL/SQL containing the logic required to carry out the data manipulation (inserts, updates, deletes) to keep the layer synchronised with the underlying databases either as regular scheduled jobs (weekly, monthly etc.) or invoked on demand. The PropBase Query Layer’s implementation has enabled rapid data discovery, visualisation and interpretation of geological data with greater ease, simplifying the parameterisation of 3 D model volumes and facilitating the study of intra-unit heterogeneity. ...|$|E
40|$|The fine-grained, laminated, {{stratiform}} zinc-lead ores of the McArthur River (HYC) {{ore deposit}} {{have been the}} subject of continued debate in regard to the timing of zinc-lead mineralization. Early workers (e. g., Croxford and Jephcott, 1972; Lambert, 1976) considered the ores to be sedimentary-exhalative (sedex), while more recent researchers (e. g., Williams, 1978 a; Eldridge et al., 1993; Hinman, 1996) have argued for a syndiagenetic replacement origin. Several lines of evidence, including studies on the <b>regional</b> Sedimentology, sediment <b>geochemistry,</b> nature of sulfide layering, paragenesis, and chemistry of base metal transport and deposition, are used here to demonstrate that a synsedimentary origin is likely for the HYC deposit. Studies on the <b>regional</b> Sedimentology and <b>geochemistry</b> of the Barney Creek Formation have shown that the host rocks to the ore deposit, the HYC Pyritic Shale, represent a period of water deepening. Water depth was probably in excess of several hundred meters, with the deepest water euxinic facies corresponding to the ore position at the base of the HYC Pyritic Shale. A widespread manganese halo, developed in the W-Fold Shale Member below the ore horizon, is considered to relate to the start of the basin-deepening event, with manganese-bearing connate brines released into the basin along marginal rift faults. Manganese deposition occurred in the transitional dolomitic shale facies, where shallow-water, oxidized basin fluids intermittently mixed with deeper-water, reduced fluids along a redox interface. Sedimentary manganese deposition was immediately followed by zinc-lead mineralization in the deep-water, reduced facies of the HYC Pyritic Shale Member. The intimate relationship between the eight stratiform ore lenses and inter-ore sedimentary breccias indicates that sedimentary breccia deposition and ore formation are genetically linked. It is suggested that deep seismic events led to the following ore cycle: fault movement; sediment breccia deposition sourced from faults; episodic release of hot metalliferous brines along faults accompanied by sedimentary turbidites; and metal sulfide deposition in muds and turbidites adjacent to faults. The three modes of base metal sulfide occurrence in the ores, each considered by Eldridge et al. (1993) to have formed by replacement, are shown to have separate origins. The fine-grained sphalerite-galena bands (Mode 1) are intricately interlayered with pelagic organic-rich beds and thin turbidite beds. They exhibit classic sedimentary textures, such as load casts and flames, indicative of a synsedimentary origin. Coarser-grained Mode 2 base metal sulfides show complex intergrowths with nodular dolomite bands, and are considered to form by replacement during diagenesis. The discrete patches of coarse, Mode 3 base metal sulfides are interpreted to represent clastic input from turbidity currents sourced partly by the erosion of vein-style mineralization from the faulted margins of the basin. The detailed nature of the layering in the ores suggests that the introduction of metalliferous brines into the basin was not continuous but occurred as a series of pulses interspersed with pelagic sedimentation and turbidite deposition. Preliminary calculations suggest that On the order of 10, 000 discrete pulses of brine were required to form each ore lens, and it is suggested these pulses were related to microseismic activity following each major seismic event in the basin. Solubility considerations indicate that the mineralized brines were most probably sulfate-rich (SO (super 2 -) 4 > H 2 S) and capable of transporting up to several thousand parts-per-million zinc and lead at moderate temperatures (150 degrees - 250 degrees C), and near-neutral pH. Zinc-lead deposition was the result of two possible processes: (1) thermochemical reduction of brine sulfate by organic matter in anoxic basin water, and (2) diffusion of H 2 S from the anoxic water column into the metalliferous brine layer. Sulfur isotope data are best explained if both processes operated together to deposit galena and sphalerite...|$|R
40|$|The Neoproterozoic {{was a time}} {{of major}} change in Earth’s {{surficial}} history, including a major rise in atmospheric oxygen, the first appearance of complex metazoan life, and a series of worldwide glaciations. A particular interesting element of these so called “snowball Earth” glacial deposits is the presence of iron formation, a distinctive Precambrian rock type that is largely absent from the post-Paleoproterozoic record. Despite being relatively poorly studied with respect to their geochemistry and sedimentology, Neoproterozoic iron formations are used to support many models for the record of oxygen concentrations of the Earth. The classical example of Neoproterozoic iron formation is the Rapitan iron formation of northwestern Canada. This hematite-jasper iron formation is associated with glaciogenic turbidites and diamictites. Despite being the archetype, the Rapitan iron formation has not been studied in the context of recent ideas about the Neoproterozoic. In this thesis, the stratigraphy, geochemistry, and basin architecture of the Rapitan iron formation are reassessed. Using the REE+Y and the redox-sensitive elements Mo and U, it is shown that the Rapitan iron formation was deposited in a partially restricted basin from biogenically reduced iron under variable redox conditions. Elemental Re and Mo isotopes further show that although oxic and ferruginous conditions predominated during deposition of the iron formation, a transition towards a sulfidic water column locally terminated deposition. Finally, <b>regional</b> stratigraphy and <b>geochemistry</b> show that the iron formation was preferentially deposited in deep, newly formed basins that were protected from significant siliciclastic sedimentation. These basins were delimited by inferred crustal-scale faults trending roughly perpendicular to the axis of the rift basin, and allowed significant changes in thickness and sedimentological character over short distances along strike. These factors help build an overall geotectonic regime under which Neoproterozoic iron formations were deposited: young, deep rift basins that had undergone marine incursion, and were intermittently sealed by an ice shelf, allowing for the generation of an anoxic, iron-rich water column. The absence of the Eu anomaly and the heavy Mo isotopic signature indicate that the open ocean was fully oxygenated at the time of Rapitan iron formation deposition, as opposed to ferruginous as previously suggested.

40|$|The Devonian (345 ± 10 my) Ackley City {{batholith}} is an oval, approximately 5, 400 km² granitoid which intrudes Ordovician and Precambrian {{rocks of}} the Gander and Avalon zones, respectively, in southeast Newfoundland. It {{is a composite}} intrusion consisting of K-feldspar mega-crystic granite in the north, east and west, intruded in the southeast by genetically related, more differentiated, alaskitic granite. Spatially related to the southeast contact of the latter are younger, fine grained and pegmatitic intrusive phases, within which are six separate Mo showings. Contacts of the batholith are sharp and characterized by low grade contact metamorphism. [...] The granitoid phases are composed essentially of quartz, perthite, plagioclase (andesine to albite) and minor biotite, magnetite, sphene, zircon, fluorite, and tourmaline. The pegmatite is composed of large quartz crystals (up to 50 cm diameter) and orthoclase. Myrmekitic texture is common in the megacrystic granite while granophyric texture s rare in the alaskitic granite but common in the aplitic and pegmatic phases. [...] The Mo host intrusives are all extreme differentiates and consequently show little variation in major elements. However, fractionation trends of trace elements and elemental ratios indicate they are more highly differentiated than the alaskitic granite. The latter shows a <b>regional</b> variation in <b>geochemistry,</b> indicating that its degree of differentiation increases gradationally toward the intrusive contact. [...] The alaskitic and fine grained intrusive phases crystallized between. 5 and 1 Kb PH₂₀ and resemble a hypersolvus granite. The fine grained and pegmatite phases are explicable as erosional remnants of a once extensive roof zone complex possibly formed by in situ differentiation resulting in concentration of volatile and Mo rich, highly fractionated magma in {{the roof of the}} alaskitic granite. [...] The different showings exhibit variation in lithology of host rocks, mode of mineralization and associated trace metals, although Mo is the only economically important element. They represent a gradation between magmatic (pegmatite) and hydrothermal (porphyry affinity) deposits, resulting essentially from retention and release of volatiles, respectively. The roof zone localization of the granitoid mineralization has important ramifications for exploration on a local and regional scale. The porphyry affinities of some showings indicates that models of absence of porphyry deposits in pre-Mesozoic-Cenozoic orogenic belts due to erosional level may not be valid...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the <b>regional</b> geology, <b>geochemistry</b> and petrogenesis of volcanic rocks from Central Mindanao Volcanic Arc (CMVA), Philippines. This NNW-trending arc, from Lat 6 °N-Long 125 ºE to Lat 90 15 '-Long 125 º 30 'E occurs {{parallel to the}} Philippine Trench and to regional structures E of Lake Lanao. CMVA centres occur 15 - 200 km above a W-dipping subduction system. Subduction associated with the Philippine Trench probably produced the CMVA. CMVA can be grouped into 3 volcanically and seismically active arc segments from N to S: i) Misamis, ii) Bukidnon and iii) Davao. Camiguin Island is the most active volcanic field and resulted from SE-NW progression of volcanism from late Pliocene-Pleistocene lavas of Butay, Cabuan, Mt Ginsiliban and Mt Mambajao to Pleistocene-Recent lavas of Mt Catarman and Hibok-Hibok. Stratigraphy of historical deposits from Hibok-Hibok shows a range of volcanic products typical of other centres: domes, lava flows and pyroclastic flows. The rocks of CMVA are crystal-rich (40 - 50 vol% average) with a main phenocryst assemblage of plagioclase (An 84 - 31) + clinopyroxene (augite, diopside) ± olivine (Fo 84 - 72). Timagnetite usually crystallised late. Two types of andesite occur: pyroxene (augite ± enstatite) and homblende (magnesium-ferri homblende) andesite. Two dacite types are also recognised. Type 1 dacite (Mt Katanglad, Butay) usually has fine grained plagioclase + clinopyroxene whereas Type 2 dacite (Hibok-Hibok, Mt Apo) has medium-coarse grained amphibole ± biotite. Phenocryst chemistry shows that with increasing bulk-rock SiO 2. plagioclase. olivine, clinopyroxene and Ti-magnetite follow chemical trends consistent with equilibrium crystallisation. Exceptions occur in basaltic andesite and some SiO 2 -rich andesite in which olivine is Fe-enriched, plagioclase is more calcic than in basalts (An 78 - 84 vs An 50 - 78) {{and there is a}} large incidence of reverse zoning in clinopyroxene. The most widespread lavas are medium-K calcalkaline (CA) basalt, andesite and dacite with occasional low-K and high-K CA lavas. Major and trace element variations are similar with other island arc basalt (IAB) and exhibit the characteristic depletion in Zr, Ti, Y and to a lesser extent, of Ce relative to N-MORB. N-MORB normalised trace element contents are generally > 1. 0 and have low Zr/Nb ratios (7 - 14) indicating an E-MORB/OIB type mantle wedge. All CMVA basalt-basaltic andesites have lower Mg#, Cr and Ni relative to primitive MORB, probably a result of olivine-dominated fractionation. Silica activity (- 0. 33 to - 0. 36 log units) and crystallisation temperatures (1, 090 - 1, 161 °C) of CMVA basalts suggest a source region geochemically between olivine tholelite and alkaline olivine basalt. Basaltic analyses, corrected for olivine fractionation, suggest primitive CMVA compositions resemble magnesian MORSs. Assuming equilibrium batch melting, CMVA parental magmas segregate from residues at 10 - 15 kbar after 10 - 14 % partial melting. The resultant melts are LIL-element enriched with high Ba/Nb and Ce/Nb ratios indicating a slab contribution although crustal contamination was probably low, based on low Rb/Sr ratios (0. 015 - 0. 026) relative to other lAB (0. 03) and continental crust (0. 12). Andesite and dacite can be modelled satisfactorily by low pressure closed-system crystal fractionation. The main fractionating assemblage is olivine + clinopyroxene + plagioclase ± Timagnetite in basalt-basaltic andesite melts whereas plagioclase + amphibole ± Ti-magnetite fractionate from basaltic andesites to form SiO 2 -rich andesite and dacite. Magma mixing and assimilation probably occurred at Mt Apo. In summary, the deeper seismic zone beneath CMVA relative to other island arcs may be explained by lateral transport of fluids from subducted slab (Davies and Stevenson, 1992) using a slab-induced convection model (Tatsumi, 1986; Saunders et ai, 1991). Partial melts segregate at depth (spinel peridotite field) to form olivine or nepheline to diopside-normative tholeiites. As these magmas ascend, they cool, become more dense and pond at the lower crust where they differentiate to high-AI basalt and basaltic andesite. Diapirs then migrate from lower crust to shallow magma chambers (< 5 km) where extensive fractional crystallisation results in andesitic magmas. Disequilibrium features of phenocrysts from basaltic andesites support the concept of mixing between a lower basaltic layer and an upper intermediate composition layer. Predominance of intermediate to SiO 2 -rich lavas suggest that i) most eruptions tap only the upper portion of compositionally-zoned chambers and/or ii) magma chambers are at a mature stage of chemical evolution...|$|R
40|$|This report details {{one-dimensional}} (1 D) maturity modelling of well 110 / 07 b- 6 in the Carboniferous {{rocks of}} the UK Irish Sea for the 21 CXRM Palaeozoic project. The {{aim of the}} maturity modelling was to predict when the source rock reached {{the oil and gas}} maturity windows, and predict the timing of generation of potential hydrocarbons. Unravelling the burial and thermal history of the Irish Sea has entertained geologists for over 25 years and been subject to numerous studies (e. g. Cowan et al., 1999; Quirk et al., 1999; and references therein). This study specifically focusses on the 1 D burial and thermal modelling of well 110 / 07 b- 6 in the East Irish Sea area using BasinMod™ (Platte River Associates software). The regional Palaeozoic stratigraphy is described in Wakefield et al. (2016), the <b>regional</b> source rock <b>geochemistry</b> from legacy well reports is described in Vane et al. (2016) and the regional petroleum system analysis in Pharaoh et al. (2016 b). Well 110 / 07 b- 6 was chosen from a restricted number of potential wells as it contained the most comprehensive collection of geochemical data collected from released legacy well reports. The modelled maturity curve with depth was matched to best fit both measured maturity data (vitrinite reflectance) and calculated maturity data (calculated from RockEval Tmax values). A Variscan uplift of 700 m was modelled, as well as a 150 m Cimmerian uplift event and a two-stage Cenozoic uplift of 650 m in the Palaeocene and 450 m from the Eocene to recent. The uplift amount falls to {{the lower end of the}} published 1 - 3 km Cenozoic uplift estimates, and was modelled with a base heat flow of 50 mWm- 2 increasing to a 70 mWm- 2 peak during the Palaeocene. Deepest burial was reached in the early Cenozoic and the base of the drilled section of Bowland Shale Formation reached main gas generation (base of formation not reached). Main oil and gas generation for the Millstone Grit Group occurred equally in the Jurassic, Cretaceous and early Cenozoic. Oil and gas generation for the Bowland Shale Group occurred mainly in the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, with minor oil generation also in the Late Carboniferous. Both the Millstone Grit Group and Bowland Shale Formation in this well have fair source potential remaining. The use of one well for a regional scale study has its obvious limitations. The well chosen is fairly representative of the southern area of the East Irish Sea Basin (EISB) hydrocarbon province, south of the large Morecambe fields and near to the recently discovered Conwy Field (Figure 1). For a more complete understanding of the Solway and Peel-Manx basins to the north-west and Quadrant 109 (Figures 1, 3), geochemical sampling of well cuttings and/or core would be required...|$|R
