25|$|The Malvern <b>Roller</b> <b>Mill</b> {{was added}} to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 1995 because of its local {{significance}} in the areas of industry and commerce. The building operated as a grinding mill for farmers and the nearby community of Malvern from its construction until it closed in 1942. It is the only known mill in northwestern Illinois that retains all of its equipment for an all roller and no grindstone process. If the millrace and turbines are clean the mill could operate as it did when it was in business. The Malvern <b>Roller</b> <b>Mill</b> provides a glimpse at the complexity of late 19th century milling operations.|$|E
25|$|Millwright George Appel, from Sterling, Illinois, leased the mill, {{adjacent}} {{land and buildings}} in 1892. Appel, a recent German immigrant to the United States, oat huller and made oatmeal, corn meal, flour, and bran at the mill with his son. The mill, properly known as the Malvern <b>Roller</b> <b>Mill</b> or Malvern Milling Company, {{became known as the}} Appel Mill during this time period. The Appel family held the mill from its purchase in 1892 until 1985. Flour and meal, marketed under the Malvern <b>Roller</b> <b>Mill</b> name, was marketed in Sterling, shipped out the railroad and sold in far away location such as New York City and England.|$|E
25|$|The Malvern <b>Roller</b> <b>Mill,</b> {{also known}} as Appel Mill and Malvern Milling Company, is a 19th-century grist mill located near the unincorporated village of Malvern, Illinois, in rural Whiteside County, north of Morrison, Illinois, United States. The {{original}} mill on the site, built by 1853, was destroyed by a flood and the present mill was erected in 1858. The mill's first owner was William P. Hiddleson who operated the mill until he sold to Benjamin Hough in 1871. The mill changed hands over the years until it landed {{under the control of}} George Appel in 1892. The Appel family closed the mill in 1942 but it remained in their family until 1985. The Malvern <b>Roller</b> <b>Mill</b> was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1995.|$|E

25|$|The {{property}} where Malvern <b>Roller</b> <b>Mill</b> {{is located}} {{was purchased by}} William P. Hiddleson on October 1, 1845. No records exist to indicate when Hiddleson built the mill on the east bank of Rock Creek in Clyde Township, Whiteside County but {{it is known that}} the country mill was in place by 1853. In addition to the mill building Hiddleson built a dam across the creek. The original mill was destroyed by a flood along the Rock Creek and the current mill building constructed in 1858. On September 27, 1871 the mill complex was sold to Benjamin Hough and became known as Hough's Mill. Hough sold the mill to Jacob Geyer on January 6, 1875 and Geyer's son later owned the property. During S.L. Geyer's ownership the mill became known as Geyer's Mill. Balthaser Schriner bought the mill on April 27, 1887.|$|E
25|$|Soap pellets are {{combined}} with fragrances {{and other materials}} and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner, which, {{by means of an}} auger, forces the soap through a fine wire screen. From the refiner, the soap passes over a <b>roller</b> <b>mill</b> (French milling or hard milling) {{in a manner similar to}} calendering paper or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|E
25|$|The Malvern <b>Roller</b> <b>Mill</b> is {{a country}} grist mill located in Whiteside County, Illinois along Old Clover Road. The mill {{building}} sits about 300 feet (91.4 m) from the present-day roadway, Felton Road, which was rerouted in 1992. The mill is near the small northeastern Whiteside County community of Malvern, about nine miles (14km) northeast of Morrison, Illinois. The mill building sits on the south bank of Rock Creek, {{a tributary of the}} Rock River, and to its northeast is a stone faced dam. The dam stretches the 80 to 90 feet (24.4 m to 27.4 m) across the Rock Creek, it is about 5 feet (1.5 m) thick and was reinforced with concrete during the 1950s. The 1858 mill building is of studded wall construction. The rectangular shaped building is 26½ feet (8.1 m) by 38 feet (11.6 m). To the west of the mill building is a circa 1890 Pratt truss bridge.|$|E

40|$|The {{mathematical}} relationship (breakage equation) {{between the}} inlet and outlet particle-size distributions of a <b>roller</b> <b>milling</b> operation is described, and the breakage function linking {{the two is}} defined. The forms of the breakage equation and the breakage function are different for <b>roller</b> <b>milling</b> than for other comminution operations, such as hammer milling or ball milling. The breakage equation is discretised to give a matrix form, from which it is demonstrated that during <b>roller</b> <b>milling</b> of wheat, particles break independently of one another. This is an important assumption of breakage equations for many comminution operations and experimental results are presented, which confirm its applicability to the <b>roller</b> <b>milling</b> of wheat grains. Breakage matrices are successfully used to predict the outlet particle-size distributions from First Break milling of wheat. Later papers in this series consider {{the form of the}} breakage function...|$|R

25|$|After the American Civil War, {{the western}} Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains to its west, where large fertile lands were available, {{resulted}} in expanding wheat farming. By this time, better tillage equipment was in use, railroads provided {{better access to}} world markets, better trading and warehousing facilities were facilitated, and more particularly introduction of hard winter was introduced. In the 1870s, Turkey red wheat, a hard variety of wheat, {{was introduced to the}} farmlands of Kansas by Russian Mennonite immigrants. This wheat variety spread quickly. New technology substantially enhanced productivity in the 19th century, as sowing with drills replaced broadcasting, cradles took the place of sickles, and the cradles in turn were replaced by reapers and binders. Steam-powered threshing machines superseded flails. By 1895, in Bonanza farms in the Dakotas, it took six different people and 36 horses pulling huge harvesters, working 10 hours a day, to produce 20,000 bushels. Following the invention of the steel <b>roller</b> <b>mill</b> in 1878, hard varieties of wheat such as Turkey Red became more popular than soft, which had been previously preferred because they were easier for grist mills to grind.|$|E

Cattle are also fed oats, either whole or ground into a coarse flour using a <b>roller</b> <b>mill,</b> burr mill, or hammer mill.

[...] In 1885 due to declining attendance and Barton S. Tibbits' own financial difficulties, the opera house faced the very real possibility of being turned into a <b>roller</b> <b>mill.</b> The local community however had become too invested in the theatre to let it go. [...] Carolyn Gillespie has noted that [...] "although a privately owned theatre, the Tibbits functioned more like a public institution." [...] Thus the community, {{with the help of the}} local press, launched the first of what would be a long string of unrelenting attempts to save the theatre.|$|E

2500|$|Briggate Mill is {{sometimes}} known as Worstead Mill, {{since it is}} in Worstead. It had a brick base, with two timber-framed weatherboarded storeys above, but was re-clad in corrugated iron when the weatherboarding deteriorated. The waterwheel was [...] in diameter and [...] wide, and was configured as a breastshot wheel. A steam <b>roller</b> <b>mill</b> was added in 1890, and the mill was subsequently converted to use electric power. The waterwheel had been removed by 1955, and the mill ceased to be used commercially in 1969, when Cubitt and Walker moved the business to Ebridge Mill. After being sold, the buildings were destroyed by fire on 7 August 1975, in what {{proved to be an}} attempt to defraud an insurance company. After a trial lasting 83 days, four men were sent to jail for the crime. Ownership of the mill pond, which lies {{on the opposite side of}} the road to the mill site and dried up in the 1970s, is uncertain. The residents of Briggate tried to get the land around the mill registered as a village green, but a public enquiry in 2010 ruled against this. Residents assisted the EAWA and Trust working parties to clear part of the mill pond, which was rewatered in 2011. It is expected to become a haven for wildlife.|$|E
