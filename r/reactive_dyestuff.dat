40|$|Interface {{phenomena}} have {{a significant}} role in the wet finishing processes. Therefore in this paper the electrokinetic phenomena of cotton fabric cationised with a commercial cationic compound were researched. After cationisation, characterisation of the surface and chemical composition was performed by FTIR-ATR. Electokinetic phenomena - Zeta potential, Isoelectric point (IEP) and Point of zero charge (PZC), were determined according to the streaming current/streaming potential method and a specific amount of surface charge according to the back-titration method. The affinity of such modified cotton to <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuff</b> of different functional groups was investigated through the K/S values. The influence of electrolyte addition to the dye bath was investigated as well...|$|E
40|$|Ag {{deposited}} N-TiO 2 composite nanoparticles {{were prepared}} via NH 3 plasma treatment. X-ray diffraction, UV-vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy {{were used to}} characterize the prepared TiO 2 samples. The plasma treatment did not change the phase composition and particle sizes of TiO 2 samples, but extended its absorption edges to the visible light region. The photocatalytic activities were tested in the degradation of an aqueous solution of a <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuff,</b> methylene blue, under visible light. The photocatalytic activities of Ag deposited N-TiO 2 composite nanoparticles were much higher than Ag-TiO 2, N-TiO 2, and P 25. A possible mechanism for the photocatalysis was proposed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract−Wastewaters {{obtained}} from bromamine acid dye and reactive dye manufacturing were treated by ozone bubbling in a cylindrical batch reactor {{for the purpose}} of reducing COD to below 150 mg/L, which is the environmental discharge standard of the Republic of Korea. Remarkable COD reduction and decolorization were observed at pH over 11. High inlet gas flowrate and high concentration of ozone gave better results. Little precipitation was observed under the conditions of remarkable COD reduction. At pH of 11, 15 LPM of inlet gas flowrate and 89. 3 g/Nm 3 of ozone flowrate, the COD of bromamine acid dyestuff wastewater was reduced to 95 mg/L after 90 minutes, and the COD of <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuff</b> wastewater was reduced to 120 mg/L after 120 minutes. Decolorization was completed after 30 minutes of reaction...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of mixing {{intensity}} and reagents addition strategy on Fenton's reagent degrading a common <b>reactive</b> diazo type <b>dyestuff,</b> <b>Reactive</b> Black 5. Within the experimental conditions used in the study, {{the effect of}} mixing intensity on TOC removal was observed to be both significant and complex. Using factorial analysis, {{it was found that}} if the reagents are added near to each other, higher mixing intensity will enhance the effectiveness of the degradation process. However, a very high mixing level may cause reduction in performance. It was also observed that the mixing intensity effect interacts with Fe 2 + or/and H 2 O 2 dosage. The benefit of increasing mixing intensity appears to be higher for lower reagents dosage. The effect of reagents addition strategy was found to be inter-dependent with mixing intensity level. It was also deduced that proper chemical addition strategy could be used to reduce the mixing intensity requirement of the process...|$|R
40|$|Various {{polymeric}} materials were prepared {{and used to}} coat two nature fibre surfaces (cotton and wool). These {{polymeric materials}} have been deposited onto the surfaces to impart different characteristics according to their structure. Thermoregulation, textile gloss and dyeing properties were modified by the deposition of these materials. Phase Change Materials (PCM) were used to improve thermoregulation, thermo-sensitive microgels were prepared to improving textile gloss and polyethylene imine (PEI) was functionalise with quaternary amine (QI) and new <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuff</b> (RD) to improve fibre properties. The prepared polymer were characterised using NMR, IR, SEM, DSC. Treated fibres were characterised using different ways according to the required application. Summing up, Fiber surface properties by selecting appropriate polymer structure and adjust the treatment parameters can be controlled to improve the desired properties...|$|E
40|$|Moringa oleifera seeds contain {{about 40}} % of highly valued oil {{due to its}} wide range of applications, from {{nutritional}} issues to cosmetics or biodiesel production. The extraction of Moringa oil generates a waste (65 %– 75 % of seeds weight) which contains a water soluble protein able to be used either in drinking water clarification or wastewater treatment. In this paper, the waste of Moringa oleifera extraction was used as coagulant to remove five reactive dyes from synthetic textile effluents. This waste constitutes a natural coagulant which was demonstrated to be effective {{for the treatment of}} industrial <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuff</b> effluents, characterized by alkaline pH, high NaCl content and hydrolyzed dyes. The coagulation yield increased at high NaCl concentration, whereas the pH did not show any significant effect on dye removal. Moringa oleifera showed better results for dye removal than the conventional treatment of coagulation-flocculation with FeCl 3 and polyelectrolyte. Treated water can be reused in new dyeing processes of cotton fabrics with high quality results...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented research {{was to examine the}} potential of capillary electrophoresis (CE) for the analysis of structurally different reactive dyestuffs, their activation and posterior hydrolysis, with special focus on optimization of the working conditions. Preliminary, the effect of various additives to the background electrolyte on the resolution improvements versus migration time of Reactive Black 5 as a model dyestuff was investigated. Based on these results, the electropherograms of eight commercially interesting reactive dyestuffs of various chemical structures and their converted forms upon alkaline pH were carried-out. In order to examine the behavior of the <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuff</b> during the dyeing process, the dye-bath absorbance was monitored throughout the Reactive Black 5 exhaustion, and the conversion of the dye 2 ̆ 7 s form was highlighted using the CE technique. The obtained results unequivocally prove that CE could offer a fast and efficient detection method of structurally different reactive dyestuffs, as well as their hydrolysis products in the dye-baths and effluents later on...|$|E
40|$|Photo-Fenton {{degradation}} of a <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuff,</b> Reactive Black 5, {{was investigated in}} this study. The effects of UV light on Fenton Reagent process {{and the influence of}} reagents dosage, UV light intensity and initial dissolved oxygen concentration on photo-Fenton were explored. The experiments were conducted in a 3 -L batch-mode reactor and were designed using Response Surface Method. The performance of the systems was assessed based on TOC removal. UV light was found to increase the efficiency of Fenton Reagent process by about 100 %, reduce the reaction time by half and lessen the iron requirement by about 85 %. Within the range used in the experiments, UV light intensity, and iron and hydrogen peroxide dosages were found to have significant positive influence on the efficiency of the photo-Fenton process. Iron dosage was significant in the early stage, peroxide dosage was significant at the later stage while UV light intensity was significant throughout the reaction period. The initial dissolved oxygen concentration was not a significant factor for photo-Fenton. Depending on the conditions of the reaction, TOC removal of 41. 3 % to 88. 2 % was obtained by photo-Fenton oxidation after 30 minutes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to examine, if wet {{processing}} of wool e. g. chlorination, chlorine/Hercosett treatment and reactive wool dyeing, generates modified lipids, which might contribute to skin irritation. Therefore, the composition of solvent extractable cell membrane lipids of industrially processed wool {{has been compared to}} that of raw white wool top. To assess possible modifications of the cell membrane lipids, several chromatographic techniques, mainly Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Gas-Liquid Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry coupling (GC/MS), have been used. In the cases where modified lipid components were detected in the solvent extractable lipids of industrially processed wool, the solubility of the modified lipid components in artificial sweat solutions was analyzed. Due to their amino function sphingolipids are possible targets for modification by reactive dyeing. However, since comparatively little is known about their chemical composition in wool, the sphingolipids were extracted from the wool by chloroform/methanol and characterized by GC/MS. As a consequence of the high oxidation potential of free chlorines, the chlorination treatment in the shrinkproofing process of wool leads mainly to the formation of hydroxy fatty acids, but not to the formation of chlorinated lipids. 9, 10 -Dihydroxy stearic acid represents {{the main part of the}} reaction products when the lipid reference oleic acids is subjected to chlorination. It was only detected in the ethanol-soluble lipids of the wool samples which had been chlorinated in model laboratory experiments, but not in the lipid fractions of wool samples with industrial chlorination or Hercosett-treatment TLC revealed that the lipid fractions of wool samples, which had been dyed with <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuff</b> combinations (consisting of Lanasol, Remazol and Realan dyestuffs) contain UV active and coloured compounds. In one case a yellow component was detected which is directly derived from a dyestuff (Realan Golden yellow RC 84 %), in another case a lipid compound modified by the applied dyestuffs was detected. GC/MS analyses of chloroform/methanol-soluble sphingolipids showed that the free ceramides of wool consist mainly of nonhydroxy acid (C 16 : 0, C 18 : 0, C 20 : 0 C 22 : 0, C 24 : 0) amidified sphinganine- and sphingosine related ceramides. Sphinganine was found to be the main long-chain base in the free ceramides of wool. A similar composition for the long-chain bases is described in the in the literature for the ceramides of human hair. In contrast to the ceramides of human hair, the ceramide fraction of wool do not contain alpha-hydroxy fatty acids. To analyze the chloroform/methanol-soluble cerebrosides of wool by GC/MS the amide-linked fatty acids and the glycosidic carbohydrates were released by acid methanolysis. A methyl galactoside was determined to be present as the basic carbohydrate compound of the cerebrosides in wool. No major changes were observed in the qualitative composition of ceramides after dyeing of wool...|$|E
