5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions {{that he should not}} be allowed to live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Broda was {{replaced}} by Rudy Ramcharan on the team. With his new team, Martin won another provincial title, and at the 1997 Labatt Brier, he once again finished the round robin with a 10–1 win-loss record. His only loss came to the undefeated Vic Peters rink of Manitoba. However, Martin met and defeated Peters twice in the playoffs, including winning the final with a score of 10–8. With this win, Martin won his second Brier and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the 1997 Ford World Men's Curling Championship. Martin topped the round robin at the Worlds, with a 7–2 win-loss record, but lost to Sweden in the semifinal with a score of 6–4 and then to Scotland in the bronze medal match with a score of 8–4.|$|E

5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year. Since 1996, European Summer Time {{has been observed}} from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to the previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history. The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim the jackpot, a contestant had to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot, regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.|$|E

As the Colombia Congress failed to pass a same-sex marriage bill, the courts instead began approving marriages themselves.

25|$|In early 1786, the Enderby family lobbied the {{government}} for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the South Pacific (an area in which the East India Company had historically enjoyed a monopoly). The lobbying efforts were eventually successful, and on 1 September 1788, the 270 ton whaling vessel Amelia, owned by Samuel Enderby & Sons and commanded by Captain James Shields, departed London. The ship went west around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean to become the first ship of any nation to conduct whaling operations in the Southern Ocean. A crewman, Archelus Hammond of Nantucket, killed the first sperm whale there off the coast of Chile on 3 March 1789. Amelia returned to London on 12 March 1790 with a cargo of 139 tons of sperm oil. The Amelia voyage marked {{the beginning of a new}} era for the company---one in which many great voyages of oceanographic and geographic exploration were accomplished, but which would ultimately prove to be a drain on company profits.|$|E

James Graham, on a positive note, made it a hat—trick of ex—Blackbrook Royals to win the Man of Steel Award whilst playing for St Helens. This would be Anderson's last game in charge of the club, as he announced he was to return to Australia and the Parramatta Eels of the NRL. St Helens fans and players alike were saddened to see Anderson leave, after not only upholding the tradition of St Helens exciting brand of rugby, but giving them a defensive and disciplined edge that was never apparent under Ian Millward. His personality and relationship with the fans was an additional reason why St Helens fans were disgruntled in him leaving after four years in charge and why next boss Mick Potter faced a fair amount of criticism in his initial period as boss.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, John Bachini {{started a}} claim against Celador, ITV, and five {{individuals}} {{who claimed that}} they had created Millionaire. Bachini claimed they had used ideas from his 1982 board game format, a two-page TV format concept known as Millionaire dating from 1990, and the telephone mechanics from another of his concepts, BT Lottery, also dating from 1990. Bachini submitted his documents to Paul Smith, from a sister company of Celador's, in March 1995 and again in January 1996, and to Claudia Rosencrantz of ITV in January 1996. Bachini claimed that they used 90% of his Millionaire format, which contained all of the same procedures as the actual British Millionaires pilot: twenty questions, three lifelines, two safe havens (£1,000 and £32,000), and even starting from £1.00. Bachini's lifelines were known by different names; he never claimed he coined the phrase phone-a-friend, but Bull and Tim Boone claimed they did. Celador claimed the franchise originated from a format known as The Cash Mountain, a five-page document created by either Briggs or his wife Jo Sandilands in October 1995. The defendants brought Bachini to a summary hearing, and lost. Bachini won the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to trial, but could not continue at trial due to serious illness, so Celador reached an out-of-court settlement with Bachini.|$|E

25|$|Then 1985 saw Middle Tennessee {{embark on}} a string of five {{consecutive}} seasons with a post-season berth, either in the NCAA Tournament or the National Invitational Tournament. Their best post-season run was in the 1988 NIT. In the first round coach Bruce Stewart's Raiders hosted in-state rival Tennessee and beat the Volunteers 85-80 {{in front of a}} full-house in the Murphy Center. Four nights later Middle Tennessee hosted another Southeastern Conference foe Georgia. Ty Baynham and Randy Henry led Middle Tennessee to another victory, this time 69-59. After beating the Bulldogs, the Blue Raiders hosted Boston College for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Madison Square Garden and the NIT Semifinals. However Murphy's Magic ran out, and the Eagles defeated Middle Tennessee 78-69. The following season the Blue Raiders once again made the NCAA Tournament. Earning a 13-seed, the Raiders defeated the Florida State Seminoles 97-83. Middle Tennessee was down by 17 (67-50) with 16 minutes left in the game. Freshman Mike Buck put the team on his shoulders at that point, and with a career high 26 points, led the Raiders on a 47-16 run to end the game and advance the team to the round of 32. Middle Tennessee's dream season would end in the second round {{at the hands of the}} Virginia Cavaliers with a 104-88 loss. After Stewart was let go amid NCAA rules violations after the 1990-91 season, the Blue Raiders enjoyed only modest success until the 2011-12 season.|$|E
25|$|Kentucky {{entered the}} 2015 SEC Tournament as the top-overall seed and bye until the quarterfinals. The SEC Tournament {{took place at}} Bridgestone Arena in Nashville. On March 13 Kentucky met Florida {{for the third time}} of the season with the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the semifinals of the SEC Tournament. In the day prior, Florida {{defeated}} Alabama in the second round to advance to the quarterfinals. Aaron Harrison and Towns each scored 13 points and Kentucky shut down Florida in the second half to pull away for a 64 to 49 victory. The height advantage helped Kentucky outrebound Florida 39 to 33, including a 16 to 11 edge offensively that created extra chances and earned frequent trips to the free-throw line. Towns also had 12 boards. On March 14 Kentucky met Auburn in the semifinals of the SEC Tournament. In the day prior, Auburn upset LSU in overtime. Kentucky poured it on against an Auburn squad that lost two players in less than 24 hours. Auburn forward Jordon Granger was suspended for fighting in Friday's quarterfinal win over LSU, and the school announced just before the tipoff that forward Cinmeon Bowers had been suspended for a potential rules violation. Cauley-Stein scored 18 points and Andrew Harrison added 15 to help Kentucky improve to 33-0 in a 91 to 67 victory over the Tigers and advance to the finals of the SEC Tournament. The win broke the school-record winning streak of 32 games set from December 5, 1953, to January 8, 1955. On March 15 Kentucky met Arkansas in the finals of the SEC Tournament. The Razorbacks defeated Georgia in the semifinals the day prior. Cauley-Stein scored 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and Kentucky never trailed in beating No. 21 Arkansas 78 to 63 for the program's 28th SEC Tournament title. Kentucky scored the first eight points as Andrew Harrison hit two 3s early. Arkansas had not trailed in this tournament, yet against Kentucky the best the Razorbacks could do was tie the game four times with the last at 19-all on a 3-pointer by Qualls with 7:59 left. By the time the Razorbacks worked the ball inside against Kentucky's blue wall, they struggled to knock down shots. After Qualls' 3, they didn't score another field goal the rest of the half. Kentucky scored seven straight as part of a 16-4 run to finish the half with a 41 to 25 lead.|$|E
