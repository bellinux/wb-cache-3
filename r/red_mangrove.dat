5|$|Arboreal carton nests of {{mangrove}} swamp-dwelling Nasutitermes are {{enriched in}} lignin and depleted in cellulose and xylans. This change {{is caused by}} bacterial decay in the gut of the termites: they use their faeces as a carton building material. Arboreal termites nests can account {{for as much as}} 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from the stems and branches of mangrove trees, namely, Rhizophora mangle (<b>red</b> <b>mangrove),</b> Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemose (white mangrove).|$|E
5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the <b>red</b> <b>mangrove</b> that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of factors creates the necessary conditions for bioluminescence: <b>red</b> <b>mangrove</b> trees surround the water (the organisms have been related to mangrove forests although mangrove is not necessarily associated with this species); a complete lack of modern development around the bay; the water is cool enough and deep enough; and a small channel to the ocean keeps the dinoflagellates in the bay. This small channel was created artificially, being the result of attempts by the occupants of Spanish ships to choke off the bay from the ocean. The Spanish believed that the bioluminescence they encountered there while first exploring the area, {{was the work of}} the devil ('El Diablo') and tried to block ocean water from entering the bay by dropping huge boulders in the channel. The Spanish only succeeded in preserving and increasing the luminescence in the now isolated bay.|$|E

25|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the region}} is mostly tropical but differences in topography, soil and climatic conditions increase species diversity. Where there are porous limestone terraced islands these are generally poor in nutrients. It is estimated that 13,000 species of plants grow in the Caribbean of which 6,500 are endemic. For example, guaiac wood (Guaiacum officinale), the flower {{of which is the}} national flower of Jamaica and the Bayahibe rose (Pereskia quisqueyana) which is the national flower of the Dominican Republic and the ceiba which is the national tree of both Puerto Rico and Guatemala. The mahogany is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and Belize. The caimito (Chrysophyllum cainito) grows throughout the Caribbean. In coastal zones there are coconut palms and in lagoons and estuaries are found thick areas of black mangrove and <b>red</b> <b>mangrove</b> (Rhizophora mangle).|$|E
500|$|Like all Cyclura species, the Cuban iguana is {{primarily}} herbivorous; 95% of its diet {{consists of the}} leaves, flowers and fruits from as many as 30 plant species, including the seaside rock shrub (Rachicallis americana), thistle, prickly pear (Opuntia stricta), black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), <b>red</b> <b>mangrove</b> (Rhizophora mangle), olives, and various grasses. Aiding in the digestion of this high-cellulose diet, colonies of nematodes occupy 50% {{of the contents of}} Cuban iguanas' large intestines. Cuban iguanas occasionally consume animal matter, and individuals have been observed scavenging the corpses of birds, fish and crabs. Researchers on Isla Magueyes observed a single episode of cannibalism in 2006 when an adult female iguana chased, caught, and ate a hatchling. [...] The researchers wrote that the dense population on Isla Magueyes could have caused this incident.|$|E
500|$|The {{mainland}} shorelines {{are dominated}} by a marshy transitional zone chiefly populated by <b>red</b> <b>mangrove</b> and black mangrove growing from the shallow water, with white mangrove growing farther back from the water's edge. [...] The trees' aerial root structure provides a sheltered habitat for crabs, fish and wading birds. The brown waters within the mangrove thickets are nurseries for fish, mollusc and crustacean larvae that require a quiet sheltered environment before the immature animals can disperse into open waters. Mangroves shed leaves at about [...] per year, providing food for fish, worms and crustaceans. Because the carbon in the leaves is sequestered by incorporation into animals, the mangrove swamp is estimated to have {{two to three times}} the ability to sequester carbon of terrestrial forests. The mangrove forest on Biscayne Bay is the longest on Florida's east coast. Shoreline and island mangrove swamps, together with the bay, represent a significant nursery for the marine life of southeast Florida.|$|E

50|$|In Puerto Rico {{there is}} a clear {{succession}} of these three trees from the lower elevations which are dominated by <b>red</b> <b>mangroves</b> to farther inland with a higher concentration of white mangroves. Mangrove forests {{are an important part of}} the cycling and storage of carbon in tropical coastal ecosystems. Using this it is possible to attempt to reconstruct the environment and investigate changes to the coastal ecosystem for thousands of years by using sediment cores. However, an additional complication is the imported marine organic matter that also gets deposited in the sediment due to tidal flushing of mangrove forests.|$|R
50|$|The main {{threat to}} this species is hunting. In Florida {{a major cause}} of {{mortality}} is collision with man-made objects. Another main threat to this species is loss of habitat. The white-crowned pigeon needs two distinct habitats, one for nesting and one for feeding. They typically breed in coastal <b>red</b> <b>mangroves</b> (Rhizophora mangle), which continue to be clear-cut for crops such as sugarcane. Agriculture and deforestation have become a problem for the species' feeding grounds, typically inland hardwood forests. The bird is very skittish, and is known to simply abandon its nest when it is encroached upon.|$|R

50|$|The pygmy three-toed sloth {{is unique}} {{in that it is}} found {{exclusively}} in the <b>red</b> <b>mangroves</b> of Isla Escudos de Veraguas; it is confined to a small area of approximately 4.3 sqkm sq mi. A 2012 census of pygmy three-toed sloths estimated the total population at 79 - of which 70 occurred on mangroves and 9 in the surroundings. The population density was calculated as 5.8 per hectare. The total area occupied by mangroves on the island was estimated to be around 10.67 ha. While their population has presumably always been low due to their restricted range, the 2012 census found far lower numbers than had been estimated (less than 500) by the IUCN in 2010.|$|R
50|$|Water is a {{focal point}} {{in all areas of}} the garden.

5|$|Three {{species of}} {{mangrove}} trees {{exist in the}} region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and <b>red</b> <b>mangroves</b> filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges.|$|R
