40|$|The rapid {{worldwide}} {{growth of}} {{offshore renewable energy}} production will provide marine organisms with new hard substrate for colonization, thus acting as artificial reefs. The artificial <b>reef</b> <b>effect</b> is important when constructing, for example, scour protections since it can generate an enhanced habitat. Specifically, artificial structures can create increased heterogeneity in the area important for species diversity and density. Offshore energy installations also have the positive side effect as they are a sanctuary area for trawled organisms. Higher survival of fish and bigger fish is an expected outcome that can contribute to a spillover to outer areas. One negative side effect is that invasive species can find new habitats in artificial reefs and thus influence the native habitats and their associated environment negatively. Different scour protections in offshore wind farms can create new habitats compensating for habitat loss by offshore energy installations. These created habitats differ from the lost habitat in species composition substantially. A positive <b>reef</b> <b>effect</b> {{is dependent on the}} nature and the location of the reef and the characteristics of the native populations. An increase in surface area of scour protections by using specially designed material can also support the <b>reef</b> <b>effect</b> and its productivity...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{growth of}} {{offshore}} renewable energy production will provide marine organisms with new hard substrate for colonization in terms of artificial reefs. The artificial <b>reef</b> <b>effect</b> is important when planning offshore installations since it can create habitat enhancement. Wind power is the most advanced technology within {{offshore renewable energy}} sources {{and there is an}} urgent need to study its impacts on the marine environment. To test the hypothesis that offshore wind power increases the abundance of reef species relative to a reference area, we conduct an experiment on the model species common shore crab (Carcinus maenas). Overall, 3962 crabs were captured, observed, marked and released in 2011 and 1995 crabs in 2012. Additionally, carapace size, sex distribution, color morphs and body condition was recorded from captured crabs. We observed very low recapture rates at all sites during both years which made evaluating differences in population sizes very difficult. However, we were able to estimate population densities from the capture record for all three sites. There was no obvious artificial <b>reef</b> <b>effect</b> in the Lillgrund wind farm, but a spill-over effect to nearby habitats cannot be excluded. We could not find any effect of the wind farm on either, morphs, sex distribution or condition of the common shore crab.

The impacts on people's values (and hence welfare) of changes in ecology and amenity that could arise from the installation of a windfarm in the Irish Sea were assessed using a discrete choice experiment administered through an online survey. The ecological changes investigated were: increased species diversity resulting from artificial <b>reef</b> <b>effects,</b> and the effect of electromagnetic fields from subsea cables on marine life; whilst the amenity change was the visibility of offshore turbines from land. Respondents expressed preferences for ecological improvements but had less clear preferences regarding the height and visibility of the turbines.

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in development of offshore wind energy in European waters has raised concern for the possible environmental impacts of wind farms. We studied whether harbour porpoise occurrence has {{been affected by the}} presence of the Dutch offshore wind farm Egmond aan Zee. This was done by studying acoustic activity of porpoises in the wind farm and in two reference areas using stationary acoustic monitoring (with T-PODs) prior to construction (baseline: June 2003 to June 2004) and during normal operation of the wind farm (operation: April 2007 to April 2009). The results show a strong seasonal pattern, with more activity recorded during winter months. There was also an overall increase in acoustic activity from baseline to operation, in line with a general increase in porpoise abundance in Dutch waters over the last decade. The acoustic activity was significantly higher inside the wind farm than in the reference areas, indicating that the occurrence of porpoises in this area increased as well. The reasons of this apparent preference for the wind farm area are not clear. Two possible causes are discussed: an increased food availability inside the wind farm (<b>reef</b> <b>effect)</b> and/or the absence of vessels in an otherwise heavily trafficked part of the North Sea (sheltering effect...|$|E
40|$|Coral reef {{ecosystem}} management benefits from continual {{quantitative assessment of}} the resources being managed, plus assessment of factors that affect distribution patterns of organisms in the ecosystem. In this study, we investigate the relationships among physical, benthic, and fish variables {{in an effort to}} help explain the distribution patterns of organisms on patch reefs within Biscayne National Park, FL, USA. We visited a total of 196 randomly selected sampling stations on 12 shallow (< 10 m) patch reefs and measured physical variables (e. g., substratum rugosity, substratum type) and benthic and fish community variables. We also incorporated data on substratum rugosity collected remotely via airborne laser surveying (Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar—EAARL). Across all stations, only weak relationships were found between physical, benthic cover, and fish assemblage variables. Much of the variance was attributable to a “reef effect,” meaning that community structure and organism abundances were more variable at stations among reefs than within reefs. However, when the <b>reef</b> <b>effect</b> was accounted for and removed statistically, patterns were detected. Within reefs, juvenile scarids were most abundant at stations with high coverage of the fleshy macroalgae Dictyota spp., and the calcified alga Halimeda tuna was most abundant at stations with low EAARL rugosity. Explanations for the overwhelming importance of “reef” in explaining variance in our dataset could include the stochastic arrangement of organisms on patch reefs related to variable larval recruitment in space and time and/or strong historical effects due to patchy disturbances (e. g., hurricanes, fishing), as well as legacy effects of prior residents (“priority” effects) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{offshore}} wind {{sector in the}} UK is expanding rapidly and is set to occupy significant areas of the coastal zone, making it necessary to explore the potential for co-location with other economic activities. The presence of turbine foundations introduces hard substrates into areas previously dominated by soft sediments, implying that artificial <b>reef</b> <b>effects</b> may occur, with potential benefits for fisheries.

To assess the effect of the large scale habitat creation on MDM-stocks, the foundations of the wind farm alpha ventus were systematically scrutinized by diving. Two years after construction, hard bottom species already reached 100 fold higher abundances at the foundations than at autochthonous soft sediments. Large concentrations of pouting (Trisopterus luscus) and the Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) were detected. The brown crab (Cancer pagurus) reached abundances of 2, 300 at single foundations, whereas it was only 29 individuals at the reference areas of comparable sizes. The uppermost parts of the foundations were densely colonised exclusively by young C. pagurus– potentially functioning as a nursery ground. The adjacent sea floor was inhabited by adults. The stocks of predatory hard bottom species could multiply with the establishment of numerous foundations in the North Sea. Calculative, 5, 000 tripods provide habitat for up to 275 % more C. pagurus in the German Bight.

To find out if the presence of wind farms is influencing the feeding behaviour of both demersal fish, stomach content analyses were performed for both demersal fish species originating from the wind farm and from a nearby control area. Results on stomach fullness, frequency of occurrence and numerical percentage of prey taxa, prey diversity and prey species composition are discussed. The fullness index and prey diversity of lesser weever was not affected by the presence of the wind farm. However, the diet composition did change: lesser weever consumed significantly more of the species Jassa herdmani - which is typically associated with hard substrates and highly available in the wind farm- in both the control and to a greater extent in the impact area. The fullness index of dab also displayed no significant differences. The prey diversity and the diet composition of dab however, were influenced by the presence of the wind farm. The ampipods Nototropis swammerdamei and J. herdmani and the tube-building polychaete Lanice conchilega were responsible for those differences. The latter species is a well-known ecosystemengineer with the potential to enhance habitat complexity and heterogeneity. Its presence might have led to a significant higher prey diversity in the wind farm and hence in the diet of dab. The differences in feeding behaviour between wind farm and control area can in part be related to the presence of the wind farm, its associated fauna and the expanding <b>reef</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the macrofaunal TR associated with Sabellaria bio-constructions (platform and reef types) on hard substrates along the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula. Spatial analysis allows us to distinguish three groups among the studied sites. Champeaux is different from the other sites because the reef has developed on a soft substrate and the platform is located in the upper part of the mid-littoral zone. Lingreville is characterized by the presence of dead reef, which clearly reflects a degraded phase. The sites of Blainville-sur-Mer and Saint-Germain-sur-Ay are located in the north of the study area, and show similar patterns. The different study sites are found to display highly variable states ranging from a flourishing reef at Champeaux to a completely degraded reef at Lingreville. Some reef destruction is also observed at Blainville-sur-Mer. These results highlight a difference in TR between platforms and reefs, with platforms showing higher TR. Such variability supports the <b>reef</b> <b>effect</b> proposed in previous studies, i.e. a decrease in the TR of other resident macrofauna species in zones more intensely colonized by the honeycomb worm Sabellaria alveolata. Therefore, well-developed reefs in a flourishing state do not represent the most diversified habitats in terms of TR. This is because S. alveolata occupies all the space, inhibiting the creation of crevices, fissures and pits which offer the best refuges for TR in mosaic habitats developed during the construction and destruction phases of a reef. The project for the creation of a Natural Marine Park should be an opportunity to recognize and manage the natural heritage interest of such temporary reefs on hard bottom habitats along the western coast of Cotentin.|$|E

In order to increase the necto-benthic colonization potencial, an artificial reef was installed on the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro (21 º 27 'S, 41 ºOO'W), an area with typically low relief bottom. Measuring nearly 1500 m², the reef consisted of four sets of different materials randomly disposed: concrete pipes (N = 12); tires structures (N = 20); and cement tanks (N = 7) and pre-made blocks (N = 4). ln {{order to determine the}} artificial <b>reef</b> <b>effects</b> on the teleost community, trammel nets were used for monthly sampling the reef site (RA) and on a control area (AC) with sandy bottom.

Correlation analysis indicated that salinity and precipitation were the most significant environmental factors correlated with the temporal fish community variation.

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are heavily promoted as a panacea for marine conservation, but lagging and sometimes idiosyncratic protection effects bring their overall effectiveness into question. In Kenyan lagoons, seagrass overgrazing {{by the sea}} urchin Tripneustes gratilla {{has been linked to}} removal of predators, but overgrazing has also been observed within well-protected MPAs. In this study we investigated the effectiveness of Kenyan MPAs in facilitating predation control over sea urchins, particularly T gratilla, in relation to system (seagrass or coral reef), distance to reefs, and seagrass presence. A strong protection effect on urchin densities on reefs and a negative correlation between T gratilla density and predation pressure (from sea stars, fish and gastropods) in seagrass beds (r(2) = 0. 345) confirmed the importance of top-down control. Yet there were no clear effects of protection or distance to reefs in seagrass beds, most likely due to (1) low predator densities in the recently established Mombasa MPA; (2) 'spill-in' of aggregated T gratilla into the older Watamu MPA (potentially facilitated by low predation pressure on the large urchins and nutrient enrichment); and (3) a potential buffering effect of seagrass canopies on predation, regardless of distance to <b>reefs.</b> <b>Effects</b> of seagrass presence differed between areas, but indicated that overgrazing in some areas could be self-regulated by inducing higher urchin mortality.

Two years after construction, hard-bottom species already reached 100 fold higher abundances at the foundations than at autochthonous soft sediments. Large concentrations of pouting (Trisopterus luscus) and the Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) were detected at the foundations. The brown crab (Cancer pagurus) reached abundances of 2, 300 individuals at single foundations, whereas it reached only 29 individuals in the reference areas. The uppermost parts of the foundation structures were densely and exclusively colonised by young C. pagurus – they potentially function as nursery grounds.

The effects of alpha ventus on pelagic fish were investigated by hydroacoustic surveys, by sampling with net catches and by fish stomach content analysis. A relative decline in abundance of pelagic fish in alpha ventus during the construction phase suggests scaring effects on fish caused by pile driving and other construction related activities. Stomach content analysis shows that hard substrate associated organisms were an insignificant food component of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and T. trachurus captured within the alpha ventus wind farm. Mackerels caught within the wind farm showed a significantly reduced degree of stomach fullness compared to mackerels caught outside the wind farm, suggesting disturbed food gathering behaviour or differences in food composition and distribution within the wind farm area. ...|$|R

In the original David V procedure, they put plication stitches at sinotubular junction level, although the <b>reefing</b> <b>effect</b> is limited and distal graft remains larger than native. Other modified techniques are two-grafts technique and ready-made Valsalva graft. However, the former needs graft–graft anastomosis {{and may not be}} cost-effective, while in the latter, the shape of sinus is fixed and minor adjustment is difficult. David V University of Tokyo modification (David V-UT) is our original solution to that, creating pseudosinus with one straight graft by longitudinal size-reduction running sutures above each pseudosinus. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate long-term outcome of David V-UT. MethodsWe analyzed 59 David V-UT patients from February 2004 to February 2013 and long-term outcomes were investigated by Kaplan–Meier methods. Risk factors for adverse events “death or recurrent aortic insufficiency (AI) with or without aortic valve reoperation” were analyzed by using Cox proportional hazard models. ResultsMean age was 33. 1 ± 14. 5 years, and 38 patients (64 %) were male. Marfan syndrome (MFS) accounts for 47 patients (80 %). Only one patient was with bicuspid aortic valve. No in-hospital mortality was observed. Mean follow-up was 4. 9 ± 2. 4 years. Estimated survival was 94. 0 ± 3. 4 % at 5 years. Freedoms from aortic valve reoperation and recurrent AI greater than mild were 95. 7 ± 3. 0 % and 88. 9 ± 4. 7 % at 5 years, respectively. In Cox proportional hazard analysis, preoperative AI greater than mild and Z score of annular diameter were significant risks for adverse events (p= 0. 027 and 0. 045, hazard ratio 6. 084 and 1. 432, 95 % C.

Area closures had greater effect on the more sedentary coral trout, in the areas outside the closures and accessible to the fishery, and little effect on red throat emperor, which was assumed to move among <b>reefs.</b> The <b>effects</b> of effort levels were greater than area closures on the harvest of both species and were seen not only in the areas accessible to the fishery, but also in the biomass of red throat emperor in the areas closed to the fishery. The catch and biomass resulting from a given effort level did not appear to have an equivalent effect attributable to any area closure. Although the effects of effort levels and area closures are confounded in reality by the coincidental implementation of area closures and restructuring of the fishery, the simulation model separated these factors to show that the closures under the 2004 rezoning should have had minimal effect on total-stock biomass and that a greater effect would result from changes in fishing effort...|$|R
40|$|Benthic reefs are the {{principal}} type of artificial habitat deployed in coastal waters worldwide to achieve fishery, ecosystem and other purposes. Ancient techniques to attract fishes to submerged natural objects for subsistence food harvest continue to be used, especially in tropical areas, while larger and more complex reefs commonly built of manmade materials and designed to meet an ecological life history requirement or limiting factor {{have been used in}} commercial fishing over the past 50 years, and more lately in marine ranch-ing. Geographic centers of long-term artificial reef research and development include eastern Asia, the Mediterranean basin, India and North America. Trends in the use of this technology include a wider number of non-fishery applica-tions, such as protection of habitat, conservation of biodiversity and socio-economic development, at a growing number of sites in over 50 countries. This paper presents significant findings and trends concerning the ecology of artificial <b>reefs,</b> their <b>effects</b> on fisheries and ecosystems, and appropriate ap-plications of the technology. The maturation of long-term biological datasets has enabled quantification of ecological processes such as production of biomass at artificial reef sites, characterization of functional equivalence for artificial and natural reefs, and determination of sustainability of certain local-ized fishery harvests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{ecological}} resilience of coral reefs depends critically on {{the capacity of}} coral popu-lations to re-establish in habitats dominated by macroalgae. coral reefs globally are under rapidly increasing pressure from human activities, especially from climate change, with serious environ-mental, social and economic consequences. coral mortality is usually followed by colonisation by benthic algae of various forms, so that algae dominate most degraded and disturbed reefs. The capacity of coral populations to re-establish in this algal-dominated environment will depend on direct and indirect impacts of the algae on the supply of coral larvae from remnant adults, on settle-ment of coral larvae and on the post-settlement survival and growth of juvenile corals. The effects of benthic algae on coral replenishment vary considerably but the thick mats or large seaweeds typical of degraded reefs have predominantly negative impacts. some algae, mostly calcareous red algae, may enhance coral settlement on healthy <b>reefs.</b> Algal <b>effects</b> on coral replenishment include reduced fecundity and larval survival, pre-emption of space for settlement, abrasion or overgrowth of recruits, sloughing or dislodgement of recruits settled on crustose algae, and changes to habitat conditions. There is {{a serious lack of}} information about these effects, which are likely to cause bottlenecks in coral recovery and significantly reduce the resilience of coral reefs...|$|R

Difficulties in scaling up theoretical and experimental results have raised controversy over the consequences of biodiversity loss for the functioning of natural ecosystems. Using a global survey of reef fish assemblages, we show that in contrast to previous theoretical and experimental studies, ecosystem functioning (as measured by standing biomass) scales in a non-saturating manner with biodiversity (as measured by species and functional richness) in this ecosystem. Our field study also shows a significant and negative interaction between human population density and biodiversity on ecosystem functioning (i. e., for the same human density there were larger reductions in standing biomass at more diverse <b>reefs).</b> Human <b>effects</b> were found to be related to fishing, coastal development, and land use stressors, and currently affect over 75 % of the world's coral reefs. Our results indicate that the consequences of biodiversity loss in coral reefs have been considerably underestimated based on existing knowledge and that reef fish assemblages, particularly the most diverse, are greatly vulnerable to the expansion and intensity of anthropogenic stressors in coastal areas...|$|R
