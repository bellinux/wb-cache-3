40|$|Background: An {{increasing}} number of children are exposed to <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> levels {{that may lead to}} adverse effects on health and daily functioning. Childhood is a period of intense growth and brain maturation, and children may therefore be especially vulnerable to <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise.</b> The objective {{of the present study was}} to examine whether <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> was associated with reported inattention symptoms in children, and whether this association was mediated by sleep duration. Methods: This study was based on the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Parental reports of children’s inattention at age 8 were linked to modelled levels of residential <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise.</b> We investigated the association between inattention and noise exposure during pregnancy (n = 1934), noise exposure averaged over 5 years (age 3 to 8 years; n = 1384) and noise exposure at age 8 years (n = 1384), using fractional logit response models. The participants were children from Oslo, Norway. Results: An association with inattention at age 8 years was found for <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> exposure at age 8 years (coef =. 0083, CI = [. 0012,. 0154]; 1. 2 % point increase in inattention score per 10 dB increase in <b>noise</b> level), <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> exposure average for the last 5 years (coef =. 0090, CI = [. 0016,. 0164]; 1. 3 % point increase/ 10 dB), and for pregnancy <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> exposure for boys (coef =. 0091, CI = [. 0010,. 0171]), but not girls (coef = −. 0021, CI = [−. 0094,. 0053]).

The SoundPLAN ® Version 7. 1 software package was used to model noise levels and simulated <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> maps were created. The people exposed to daytime/nighttime <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> were also estimated. The proportions of the population exposed to <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> in major cities in the EU were also estimated and compared. Eight (8) districts show the exceeded rate (percentage of the exposed population exceeding the daytime standard) of 20 % or more, and eleven (11) districts show 10 %- 20 % and six (6) districts show less than 10 %, which indicates considerable variation among districts. Two districts (Nowon-gu and Yangcheon-gu) show the highest exposure rate during the daytime (35. 2 %). For nighttime noise levels, fourteen (14) districts show the exceeded rate (percentage of exposed population exceeding the nighttime standard) over 30 %.

40|$|This {{research}} has been motivated {{by the fact that}} present <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> prediction models have not improved significantly since their development in the 1970 s and 1980 s, although <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> nuisance is a significant and growing issue in Australia and elsewhere. This thesis reviews the nature of <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise,</b> its measurement, and interpretation of noise levels in terms of noise nuisance. It then examines the principal noise propagation influences that are described by <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> prediction models such as ST AM SON and TNOISE, and outlines how these quasi-empirical models produce noise level predictions. Present <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> prediction models are essentially pattern recognition tools, but while they perform satisfactorily for very simple situations, accurate noise prediction in more complex situations is beyond their ability. However, artificial intelligence pattern recognition tools have proven their power and usefulness in a variety of applications in recent years, and this thesis examines the hypothesis that a neural network approach to predicting <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> offers a way to move forward in noise impact assessment. A simple two-layer feed-forward neural network architecture is found to be able to easily mimic present <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> prediction models, with tangent-sigmoidal transfer functions specified for the input layer of 20 - 30 neurons, and a linear transfer function specified for the single output neuron. A priori rescaling of input values to roughly match the requirements of the transfer function facilitates the neural network training using a backpropagation algorithm with momentum and adaptive learning. Ways of avoiding the problem of overfitting are discussed. A case study based on a 1993 noise impact assessment project is presented that demonstrates that a neural network can easily be trained from fairly limited field data to satisfactorily predict <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> in site-specific situations, and the case study was one in which a model such as STAMSON or TNOISE is not able to perform well. The effort and expertise needed for this exercise is comparable to an air emission dispersion modelling exercise, a conclusion that should prove of great interest to road and environment authorities. The thesis then proposes a strategy whereby grid-based neural networks can be developed to enable <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> prediction in complex situations. The methodology is explained {{with the aid of a}} barrier adjustment calculation. The development of such a model for a sitespecific situation is quite straightforward, but there is also clear potential to develop a generic 2 -dimension modelling capability. The basic approach to this parallels the modelling strategy of present noise prediction models, but with reference sound levels and adjustments referred to a grid, and determined using neural networks...|$|R

METHODS In a population-based cohort of 57 053 people aged 50 to 64 years at enrolment in 1993 - 1997, we identified 1600 cases of first-ever MI between enrolment and 2006. The mean follow-up time was 9. 8 years. Exposure to <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> and air pollution from 1988 to 2006 was estimated for all cohort members from residential address history. Associations between exposure to <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> and incident MI were analysed in a Cox regression model with adjustment for air pollution (NO(x)) and other potential confounders: age, sex, education, lifestyle confounders, railway and airport noise. RESULTS We found that residential exposure to <b>road</b> traffic <b>noise</b> (L(den)) was significantly associated with MI, with an incidence rate ratio IRR of 1. 12 per 10 dB for both of the two exposure windows: yearly exposure at the time of diagnosis (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 02 - 1. 22) and 5 -years time-weighted mean (95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 23) preceding the diagnosis.
