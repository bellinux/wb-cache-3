2500|$|Concrete pouring and {{placement}} occurred for 18 months, {{of which the}} maximum poured in a day was [...] and in a month, [...] The aggregate for the concrete [...] was obtained from a quarry near the construction site. The high-quality and strength gneiss-rock was ground in a <b>rotary</b> <b>crusher</b> and prepared in the concrete mixture. To facilitate the contraction and settling of the concrete in the dam, it was cooled {{with a series of}} steel pipes that ran throughout the mass of concrete, {{with the exception of the}} top [...] of the dam. A grout curtain was placed around and below the dam as well to prevent leakage, which consumed a large amount of cement. In August 1964, the reservoir began to fill and in September 1965, the reservoir was full and the dam completed.|$|E
40|$|The disc in a <b>rotary</b> <b>crusher</b> {{of glass}} and metal in a mercury {{recycling}} system encounters fracture failure due to unknown reason. Possible causes are identified and investigated both numerically by finite element analysis and experimentally including modal analysis and materials, acoustic signature and destructive load characterisation. Knowledge is developed on the conditions needed for failure. It is concluded that the observed fracture during operation occur due to a large force rather than fatigue, and a hypothesis on how this may be realized is put forward. + 4670408886...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of organic fertilizer was still constrained by low crushing capacity, especially for paddy straw. This material {{has not been}} utilize optimally for organic fertilizer. Paddy rice harvest index is about 0, 5, meaning paddy rice plant produced straw as much as 50 {{percent of the total}} material which was yielded by paddy plantation. It is a potential source for organic fertilizer. The problem is that farmers could cut it into small piece in high capacity. Several machines have been designed to solve this low capacity but many trouble operations found by these machines. In this research, the knives were replaced by rotary saws. These rotary saws were connected to the shaft by screw mode. The objective of this research was to create a capable machine that could crush the paddy straw and overcome the disadvantage of previous machines. Another objective was to get the yield as small as possible so the decomposition process will run rapidly. This research used an engineering design method. It was conducted through 5 steps; they were Definition of the problem, Gathering of information, Generation of alternative solutions, Evaluation of alternatives and decision making, and Communication of the results. The designed machine was drawn into technical drawing and then fabricated it at the Agricultural Engineering Workshop. The rotary saws were rotated by a 7. 5 hp-diesel engine. The material capacity was 190. 6 kg per hour at 1400 rpm while the fuel consumption was 0. 85 L/hour. In conclusion, the shaft to shaft transmision could be applied to the <b>rotary</b> saw <b>crusher</b> with a lighter fibration and smaller size.

40|$|Organic {{matter from}} plants {{have not been}} used optimally, {{especially}} paddy straw. Paddy straw was not strongly suggested to burn because it just left ash that not so useful to increase land fertility and plant nutrient. Organic matter decomposition can be accelerated by decreasing its size. This material can be more useful when it converts into organic fertilizer where some other materials were added and mixed thoroughly, and the proccess could be accelerated by adding activated microorganism. This process could made faster if {{the size of the}} organic matter is small. Several types of crusher have been designed either by big companies from the industrial countries or small companies like Indonesia. Crushers made by big countries are usually used by big companies. The main problem of the major types of crushers fabricated by big company was that the size of the crushing material was not small enough so it needed longer time to decomposite by microorganism. The classic problem encountered at the machine itself was that the blades was not strong enough that they could break if the impact was too high. 	This research was aimed to design a crusher machine that could produce a smaller size of plant residus than the other machines could do. The knives consisted of 10 rotary saws with 10 inches in diameter installed at certain distance among them. At the left and right side of every rotary saw were installed a plate with 1 cm in thick that functioned as a flywheel and made the rotary saws strong. A 7. 5 HP diesel engine used as a power source and double belt-pulley as transmition power. A V-shaped hopper was installed {{on the left side of}} the concave and outlet was at the right bottom of the concave. The raw material was thrown into the crushing chamber manually. The machine was tested using 100 kg of paddy straw (10 bags). 	The results showed that the effective capacity was 206, 2 kg/hr. The main result was released from the screen of 100 mesh. The weight of the machine was 191 kg (included engine) and it consumed 0, 9 liter per hour of diesel fuel and the average rotating speed 812 RPM. Generally, the machine was able to operate without worrying of knives would break. Keywords: Plants residus, <b>rotary</b> saw, <b>crushing</b> machine, material capacity...|$|R
