5|$|After {{reading about}} the case while in college, Peirce {{conducted}} extensive <b>research</b> <b>for</b> a screenplay, which she worked on for almost five years. The film focuses {{on the relationship between}} Brandon and his girlfriend Lana Tisdel. The script took dialogue directly from archive footage in the 1998 documentary The Brandon Teena Story. Many actors sought the lead role during a three-year casting process before Swank was cast. Swank was chosen because her personality seemed similar to Teena's. Most of the film's characters were based on real-life people; others were composites.|$|E

5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were particularly interested in how glucose is metabolized {{in the human body}} and the hormones that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to the one who had done most of the <b>research</b> <b>for</b> a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E

5|$|Basic {{research}} on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have anti-disease effects. Such compounds include sulforaphane and other glucosinolates which may stimulate {{the production of}} detoxifying enzymes during metabolism.

5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} {{measurements for}} stars were obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness, {{a process that}} was slow and inexact. Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on a photographic plate. Regardless, neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy. Joel Stebbins' pioneering <b>research</b> <b>for</b> astronomical photometry {{took place at the}} observatory.|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to <b>research</b> <b>for</b> alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown to be safe and effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E
