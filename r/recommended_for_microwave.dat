40|$|Planting and {{harvesting}} times drive cropland phenology. There are few datasets that derive explicit phenological metrics, and these datasets use the visible to near infrared (VNIR) spectrum. Many different {{methods have been}} used to derive phenometrics such as Start of Season (SOS) and End of Season (EOS), leading to differing results. This discrepancy is partly due to spatial and temporal compositing of the VNIR satellite data to minimize data gaps resulting from cloud cover, atmospheric aerosols, and solar illumination constraints. Phenometrics derived from the downward Convex Quadratic model (CxQ) include Peak Height (PH) and Thermal Time to Peak (TTP), which are more consistent than SOS and EOS because they are minimally affected by snow and frost and other non-vegetation related issues. Here, we have determined PH using the vegetation optical depth (VOD) in three microwave frequencies (6. 925, 10. 65 and 18. 7 GHz) and accumulated growing degree-days derived from AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS) data at a spatial resolution of 25 km. We focus on 50 AMSR-E cropland pixels in the major grain production areas of Northern Eurasia (Ukraine, southwestern Russia, and northern Kazakhstan) for 2003 – 2010. We compared the land surface phenologies of AMSR-E VOD and MODIS NDVI data. VOD time series tracked cropland seasonal dynamics similar to that recorded by the NDVI. The coefficients of determination for the CxQ model fit of the NDVI data were high for all sites (0. 78 < R 2 < 0. 99). The 10. 65 GHz VOD (VOD 1065 GHz) achieved the best linear regression fit (R 2 = 0. 84) with lowest standard error (SEE = 0. 128); it is therefore <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> <b>microwave</b> VOD studies of cropland land surface phenology. Based on an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) analysis, the slopes from the linear regression fit were not significantly different by microwave frequency, whereas the intercepts were significantly different, given the different magnitudes of the VODs. PHs for NDVI and VOD were highly correlated. Despite their strong correspondence, there was generally a lag of AMSR-E PH VOD 10. 65 GHz by about two weeks compared to MODIS peak greenness. To evaluate the utility of the PH determination based on maximum value, we correlated the CxQ derived and maximum value determined PHs of NDVI and found that they were highly correlated with R 2 of 0. 87, but with a one-week bias. Considering the one-week bias between the two methods, we find that PH of VOD 10. 65 GHz lags PH of NDVI by three weeks. We conclude, therefore, that maximum-value based PH of VOD can be a complementary phenometric for the CxQ model derived PH NDVI, especially in cloud and aerosol obscured regions of the world...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} two tasks {{performed}} in this report. To do {{an evaluation of the}} software Saber® from Synopsys Inc, and to design a model of an airborne distributed power system. By building a simple system from hardware measurements and model it a good start of the project was made, and thereby learning the basics of Saber®. The design was later expanded to be similar to the next generation of distributed power systems. A special interest has been in cables and verification of cable models in Saber®. The final design is the stepping stone for a continuation of further simulations. The conclusion is that Saber® is <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> Saab <b>Microwave</b> Systems and will most likely {{have a positive effect on}} the process of developing new products and making changes to existing power systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} part of the FP 7 MCure project on the {{development}} and demonstration of an energy efficient system for accelerated curing during repair of concrete structures. It provides laboratory results on temperature development in microwave cured specimens of six commercial repair materials and a CEM II mortar. Specimens were cast in 100 mm polystyrene moulds and exposed to 60 Watts microwave power to reach approximately 40 °C <b>recommended</b> temperature <b>for</b> <b>microwave</b> curing. Temperature development of specimens was monitored for 24 hours after mixing. The results show that microwave curing triggers the peak heat of hydration and brings it forward for all repair materials. In addition, internal temperatures of specimens are higher than the top surface temperatures and the difference increases with increasing temperature. These laboratory based results are backed by the currently confidential data obtained from pre-industry prototype tests which are being used to upgrade the technology to industrial scale...|$|R
