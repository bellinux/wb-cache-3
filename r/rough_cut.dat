5|$|Despite a rushed {{post-production}} schedule, Universal was {{so impressed}} with Jackson's <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> on The Frighteners, the studio moved the theatrical release date closer by four months. The film was not a box office success, but received generally positive reviews from critics. Despite its lackluster performance at the box office, the film has gained a cult following in more recent years.|$|E
5|$|The film {{score for}} Angel Heart was {{produced}} and composed by South African composer Trevor Jones, with saxophone solos by British jazz musician Courtney Pine. Parker hired Jones after being {{impressed by his}} orchestral score for the 1986 film Runaway Train. Jones viewed a <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of Angel Heart prior to scoring the film.|$|E
5|$|Unusual for a {{television}} series, the sound team receives a <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> {{of a full}} season and approaches it as a ten-hour feature film. Although seasons one and two had different sound teams, one team has {{been in charge of}} sound since then. For the show's blood-and-gore sounds, the team often uses a chamois. For dragon screams, mating tortoises and dolphin, seal, lion and bird sounds have been used.|$|E

5|$|A <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, but {{post-production}} work continued, and {{the film}} was not released in France until almost a year later. A cut-down version was released in the United States and United Kingdom in September 2010. The critical response was sharply divided: positive reviews described the film as captivating and innovative, while negative critics called it tedious and puerile. The film performed poorly at the box office.|$|E
5|$|The Kids Are Alright {{was also}} {{completed}} in 1979. It was a retrospective of the band's career, directed by Jeff Stein. The film included {{footage of the}} band at Monterey, Woodstock and Pontiac, and clips from the Smothers Brothers' show and Russell Harty Plus. Moon had died one week after seeing the <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> with Daltrey. The film contains the Shepperton concert, and an audio track of him playing over silent footage of himself {{was the last time}} he ever played the drums.|$|E
5|$|The film's budget {{climbed from}} an initial US$150 {{million to a}} then-record-breaking $207 million, making it {{at one point the}} most {{expensive}} film yet made. Universal only agreed to such an outlay after seeing a screening of the unfinished film, to which executives responded enthusiastically. Marketing and promotion costs were an estimated $60 million. The film's length also grew; originally set to be 135 minutes, it soon grew to 200, prompting Universal executives to fly to New Zealand to view a <b>rough</b> <b>cut,</b> but they liked it so their concerns were addressed.|$|E

5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began on}} June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, {{primarily}} {{taking place at}} Leavesden Film Studios in England. Leavesden was leased for a {{two and a half}} years so the production company could leave the sets intact and return after principal photography had been completed. The forest scenes on Naboo were filmed at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire. Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened a <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film for friends and colleagues in May 1998. Most of the action and stunts were filmed by Roger Christian's second unit, which worked alongside the main unit instead of afterwards because of the high number of shots to be completed daily.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg and Williams both {{watched a}} <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> {{of the film}} to {{determine}} what scenes would have music. The two decided to leave music out of the fighting sequences, in favor of playing it over long sequences of eight to nine minutes that lack action. The playing of music between fighting sequences gives a moment of reflection for what happened. Tom Hanks came to {{a portion of the}} recording session and read the Bixby letter – which appears in the movie – to the orchestra at the behest of Williams. This caused the musicians to shuffle their feet in appreciation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rough</b> <b>Cuts</b> is a blog and podcast {{published}} by National Public Radio. The {{purpose of the}} project is to invite the public {{to participate in the}} development of new radio programs. Traditionally, radio programs would be created behind closed doors, then premiered when they had been considered suitable for public consumption. <b>Rough</b> <b>Cuts</b> takes a different approach, publishing rough drafts of radio segments and soliciting public feedback. The feedback is then used {{to improve the quality of}} the show, in the hopes of premiering a better radio program. NPR describes this process as open piloting, its name inspired by the open source and open content movements.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{radio show}} to [...] "graduate" [...] from <b>Rough</b> <b>Cuts</b> is Tell Me More, hosted by {{journalist}} Michel Martin. That program began national production in April, 2007. <b>Rough</b> <b>Cuts</b> {{will also be}} used to help develop a new morning radio program targeting a younger audience. That program, tentatively titled The Bryant Park Project, seeks to compete with Morning Edition. Bryant Park may be offered on digital sub-channels of a station's frequency, or as a stream on the station's website. Hosted by Luke Burbank and Alison Stewart, the Bryant Park Project will be produced at NPR's New York bureau, and is expected to launch in September 2007.|$|R
5|$|The film's {{score was}} written, co-produced and {{composed}} by English singer and songwriter Peter Gabriel. It marked his first {{work on a}} feature film, {{as well as his}} first collaboration with music producer Daniel Lanois. Parker first met Gabriel during the film's post-production, as he had been experimenting with his music, incorporating the percussive rhythms from the musician's solo albums into the film. Parker contacted Gabriel's manager, record producer David Geffen, who advised him that producing the soundtrack would be a slow process, as Gabriel was known for working at his own pace. While working on his fifth studio album So, Gabriel agreed to score Birdy after viewing a <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film.|$|E
5|$|Editing began {{later that}} day, {{with the first}} <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> {{completed}} on March 18. A version was screened on March 30 for Moore, Peter Lauritson, Dan Curry, J. P. Farrell and Dawn Velazquez to better inform the post-production optical effects which were under production at the time. Cast audio re-recording took place from April 9 onwards depending on the individual actor's availability, supervised by Velazquez. Composer Dennis McCarthy first saw a cut of the episode on April 21. He worked with Velazquez and music editor Gerry Sackman to develop some musical cues which could recur throughout the episode as well as working out what type of work {{will need to be}} completed. For example, although he couldn't see the visual effects at the time as they were not yet complete, Velazquez explained what they should look like.|$|E
5|$|Hawks' friend Howard Hughes finally {{suggested}} Cary Grant for the role. Grant {{had just}} finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The Awful Truth, and Hawks may have seen a <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the unreleased film. Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving. Grant was initially concerned {{about being able to}} play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. Grant met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rough</b> <b>Cuts</b> was a Canadian {{television}} series, which {{aired on}} CBC Newsworld. Launched in 1994, the series presents documentary films by new and independent journalists and producers. One of its hosts was Michaëlle Jean, who subsequently served as Governor General of Canada from 2005 to 2010.|$|R
5|$|Lynch's {{original}} <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> ran {{for approximately}} four hours. He was contractually obligated {{to deliver a}} two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes. He also made cuts {{at the request of}} the MPAA. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the deleted scenes, long thought lost, had been discovered. The material was subsequently included on the Blu-ray disc release of the film. The final cut of the film runs at just over two hours.|$|E
5|$|Keith Baxter {{said that}} the film's soundtrack was post-dubbed months after filming was completed, and that actors Fernando Rey and Marina Vlady were dubbed by {{different}} actors because of their heavy accents. Baxter also stated that he, Welles and Michael Aldridge recorded voices for several characters in post-production. Mistress Quickly's speech after Falstaff's death, which was disrupted by the audible hum of a power generator, used the original version of the soundtrack because Welles liked Margaret Rutherford's performance enough to keep it. The score was composed by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, {{who had worked with}} Welles on Othello. The score was recorded in an Italian studio, which paid Lavagnino for his work on the film in exchange for the rights to the music, and later released a soundtrack album in Italy and the UK. During the editing, Welles showed a <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> to the visiting head of the Cannes Film Festival, who immediately wanted to include the film in the festival, and Welles had to finish the editing more quickly than he preferred.|$|E
5|$|The Tunisia battle {{sequence}} {{that opened the}} film was the last major sequence filmed. The filmmakers wanted to avoid the appearance that von Stauffenberg wanted to kill Hitler because of the injuries he suffered in the battle. They began a <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> in October 2007, and between then and June 2008, there were several test screenings without the battle sequence. By June 2008, the filmmakers felt that {{they knew how to}} adequately frame the characters when filming the battle sequence. Singer scouted Jordan and Spain for locations, but the candidates did not meet the aesthetic and economic criteria. The Cougar Buttes desert in California was ultimately chosen to represent Tunisia. Since the production budget was adjusted to provide visual effects to make von Stauffenberg's injuries realistic, not enough was left for solely computer-generated fighter planes. Singer instead used two P-40 Warhawks in the battle sequence. The budget increased in the course of production due to the filming in Germany, the rebuilding of sets, and lost shooting days, but German tax rebates tempered the growth. The studio reported its final production budget to be $75 million, but competing studios believed it to be closer to $90 million.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roughing</b> <b>cuts</b> {{are used}} to remove large amount of {{material}} from the starting workpart as rapidly as possible, i.e. with a large Material Removal Rate (MRR), {{in order to produce}} a shape close to the desired form, but leaving some material on the piece for a subsequent finishing operation.Finishing cuts {{are used to}} complete the part and achieve the final dimension, tolerances, and surface finish. In production machining jobs, one or more <b>roughing</b> <b>cuts</b> are usually performed on the work, followed by one or two finishing <b>cuts.</b> <b>Roughing</b> operations are done at high feeds and depths - feeds of 0.4-1.25 mm/rev (0.015-0.050 in/rev) and depths of 2.5-20 mm (0.100-0.750 in) are typical, but actual values depend on the workpiece materials. Finishing operations are carried out at low feeds and depths - feeds of 0.0125-0.04 mm/rev (0.0005-0.0015 in/rev) and depths of 0.75-2.0 mm (0.030-0.075 in) are typical. Cutting speeds are lower in roughing than in finishing.|$|R

5|$|The second unit filmed {{part of the}} prologue's 1912 segment from August 29 to September 3. The {{main unit}} began two days later with the circus train {{sequence}} at Alamosa, Colorado, on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. They filmed at Pagosa Springs on September 7, and then at Cortez on September 10. From September 14 to16, filming of Indiana falling into the train carriages took place in Los Angeles. The production then moved to Utah's Arches National Park to shoot more of the opening. A house in Antonito, Colorado {{was used for the}} Jones family home. The production had intended to film at Mesa Verde National Park, but Native American representatives had religious objections to its use. When Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn viewed a <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film in late 1988, they felt it suffered from a lack of action. The motorcycle chase was shot during post-production at Mount Tamalpais and Fairfax near Skywalker Ranch. The closing shot of Indiana, Henry, Sallah and Brody riding into the sunset was filmed in Texas in early 1989.|$|E
