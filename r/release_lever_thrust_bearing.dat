Both these developments {{have been reported}} to improve the bearing load capacity compared to conventional aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> with rigid surfaces. This development is carried one stage further in a porous and compliant aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> incorporating both a porous pad and an opposing compliant surface. The thin elastomer layer forming the compliant surface is bonded to a rigid backing and is of a soft rubber like material. Such a bearing is studied experimentally and theoretically under steady state operating conditions. A mathematical model is presented to predict the bearing performance. In this model is a simplified solution to the elasticity equations for deflections of the compliant surface. Account is also taken of deflections in the porous pad due to the pressure difference across its thickness. The lubrication equations for flow in the porous pad and bearing clearance are solved by numerical finite difference methods. An iteration procedure is used to couple deflections of the compliant surface and porous pad with solutions to the lubrication equations. Comparisons between experimental results and theoretically predicted bearing performance are in good agreement. However these results show that the porous and compliant aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> performance is lower than that of a porous aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> with a rigid surface in place of the compliant surface.
