5|$|By {{this time}} the synagogue had around 1,200 member families, and over 600 {{children}} in its <b>religious</b> <b>school.</b> Wax initiated {{some changes in the}} congregation's religious practices. One was to have a real ram's horn shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not become common until the 1970s.

40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} merits of an opt-in {{approach}} to regulating the employment decisions of <b>religious</b> <b>schools</b> in Australia under anti-discrimination legislation.

The legislature, executive and judiciary are provided with significant supervisory roles under the proposed model to address the potential for <b>religious</b> <b>schools</b> to abuse the protections provided. The article argues that the opt-in model has the potential to more appropriately regulate the employment decisions of <b>religious</b> <b>schools</b> compared to the other approaches currently relied upon in Australia...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} <b>religious</b> {{independent}} <b>schools</b> {{and its impact}} on society. The purpose of this essay has been to examine what various teachers from both <b>religious</b> independent <b>schools</b> and public schools have for perception of <b>religious</b> independent <b>schools.</b> The questions highlighted in the study is the teachers´ general view to <b>religious</b> independent <b>schools,</b> teachers´ perception of the Education Act " a denominational education, but a non- denominational teaching", and what teachers believe to be segregated or inclusive. The study has consisted of five qualitative interviews with different teachers, where three of them work at <b>religious</b> independent <b>schools,</b> while the other two teachers work in public schools. The study shows that there are prominent differences of approach to <b>religious</b> independent <b>schools.</b> Teachers who work at <b>religious</b> independent <b>schools</b> avert criticism of <b>religious</b> independent <b>schools</b> and argue that teaching in <b>religious</b> independent <b>schools</b> do not differ appreciably from the public <b>schools.</b> Instead can <b>religious</b> independent <b>schools</b> serve as a good alternative to the public school.
