40|$|Abstract—We have {{recently}} introduced an algorithm for semi-automatic segmentation {{of the left}} ventricular wall in short-axis echocardiographic images (EMBC 30 : 218 – 221). In its preprocessing stage, the algorithm uses temporal averaging for image denoising. Motion estimation is used to detect and <b>reject</b> <b>frames</b> that do not correlate well with the set of images being averaged. However, the process of estimating motion vectors is computationally intense, which increases the algorithm’s computation time. In this work, we evaluate the viability of replacing the motion estimation stage with less computationally intense approaches. Two alternative techniques are evaluated. The ventricular contours obtained {{from each of the}} three algorithm variants were quantitatively and qualitatively compared with contours manually-segmented by a specialist. We show {{that it is possible to}} reduce the algorithm’s computational load without significantly reducing the segmentation quality. The proposed algorithms are also compared with three other techniques from the literature...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} thought {{to be one of the}} most {{pressing}} environmental problems facing humanity. However, due in part to failures in political communication and how the issue has been historically defined in American politics, discussions of climate change remain gridlocked and polarized. In this dissertation, I explore how climate change has been historically constructed as a political issue, how conflicts between climate advocates and skeptics have been communicated, and what effects polarization has had on political communication, particularly on the communication of climate change to skeptical audiences. I use a variety of methodological tools to consider these questions, including evolutionary frame analysis, which uses textual data to show how issues are framed and constructed over time; Kullback-Leibler divergence content analysis, which allows for comparison of advocate and skeptical framing over time; and experimental framing methods to test how audiences react to and process different presentations of climate change. I identify six major portrayals of climate change from 1988 to 2012, but find that no single construction of the issue has dominated the public discourse defining the problem. In addition, the construction of climate change may be associated with changes in public political sentiment, such as greater pessimism about climate action when the electorate becomes more conservative. As the issue of climate change has become more polarized in American politics, one proposed causal pathway for the observed polarization is that advocate and skeptic framing of climate change focuses on different facets of the issue and ignores rival arguments, a practice known as “talking past. ” However, I find no evidence of increased talking past in 25 years of popular newsmedia reporting on the issue, suggesting both that talking past has not driven public polarization or that polarization is occurring in venues outside of the mainstream public discourse, such as blogs. To examine how polarization affects political communication on climate change, I test the cognitive processing of a variety of messages and sources that promote action against climate change among Republican individuals. Rather than identifying frames that are powerful enough to overcome polarization, I find that Republicans exhibit telltale signs of motivated skepticism on the issue, that is, they <b>reject</b> <b>framing</b> that runs counter to their party line and political identity. This result suggests that polarization constrains political communication on polarized issues, overshadowing traditional message and source effects of framing and increasing the difficulty communicators experience in reaching skeptical audiences.

But the link between statistical significance and financial significance is indirect, and there has been little or no research into it. This paper presents a new approach to the simulation selection problem, one that maximizes the expected net present value of decisions made when using stochastic simulation. We provide a framework for answering these managerial questions: When does a proposed system design, whose performance is unknown, merit the time and money needed to develop a simulation to infer its performance? For how long should the simulation analysis continue before a design is approved or <b>rejected?</b> We <b>frame</b> the simulation selection problem as a "stoppable" version of a Bayesian bandit problem that treats the ability to simulate as a real option prior to project implementation. For a single proposed system, we solve a free boundary problem for a heat equation that approximates the solution to a dynamic program that finds optimal simulation project stopping times and that answers the managerial questions. For multiple proposed systems, we extend previous Bayesian selection procedures to account for discounting and simulation-tool development costs. simulation, ranking {{and selection}}, economics of simulation, optimal stopping, free boundary problem...|$|R

He thereby <b>rejected</b> the still-prevalent <b>framing</b> assumption of factoring external-physical and internal-mental processes. The interactionist alternative, which focuses on processes of agent-situation interactions, is taken in ecological psychology as well as in recent research on conversational communication, research on complex, socially organized activity, and philosophical situation theory. The concepts of qffordance and ability are key ideas in an interactionist account. In situation theory, abilities in activity depend on attunements to constraints, and affordances for an agent can be understood as conditions in the environment for constraints to which the agent is attuned. This broad view of affordances includes affordances that are recognized as well as affordances that are perceived directly. In his 1954 article on visual perception of motion and movement, Gibson discussed several ways in which perceptions of motion and movement have to be understood relationally.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores Liberian market women's {{food distribution}} activities and specifically focuses on their organizations {{and practices in}} postconflict times. During the last few years, Liberian market women have received considerable national and international attention. They have been hailed as heroines because of the significance they played in supplying food to Liberians during the civil war. However, little is known of their micro-world. This paradox constitutes {{the starting point of}} my dissertation, which explored market women's micro-level understandings and practices as related to peacebuilding. I used African feminist ethnography as a theoretical and methodological lens to investigate market women's organizations and practices surrounding food distribution in the capital city of Monrovia. African feminist ethnography incorporates insights from African feminist theory and feminist ethnography. It gives attention to issues of importance in West Africa like food and violent conflict. It also <b>rejects</b> the <b>framing</b> of African women as victims of war and recognizes their full agency. I conducted 40 in-depth semi-structured interviews with market women as well as observations in Fiamah, a daily food market located in central Monrovia. I examined market women's grassroots organizations called susu groups. Susu groups are informal credit unions that provide money to market women, necessary to purchase food items and maintain the market business. Findings illuminated the significance of wartime memories on postconflict susu group organizing practices. In this sense, memories of disruption and distrust engendered susu groups that were different from their prewar counterparts. Results also pointed at the invisible nature of susu groups, which had to balance their tendency towards secrecy with the pressure to become visible in a postconflict context where questions of organizational transparency dominated. I also investigated how market women made sense of their food distribution position in the peacebuilding era. Findings revealed that the women framed their role as one of community keeping. They emphasized the physical nature of food distribution which also necessitated maneuvering. Ultimately, food distribution gave them a sense of empowerment in postconflict times. These understandings reified class distinctions between market women and Liberian elites...|$|R

Speeches given by the Spanish Prime Minister and the official opposition in reaction to a terrorist attack in Madrid are analysed.

In the proposed workflow, data is obtained using mass-market devices such as a compact camera (Canon G 9) and a smartphone (iPhone 5). The volume is computed using free open source software (VisualSFMv 0. 5. 23, CMPMVSv 0. 6. 0., MeshLab) on a PCclass computer. The input data is acquired from video frames. To verify the method laboratory tests on the embankment of a known volume has been carried out.

The volumes of the models differed from the actual volume just by 0. 7 ‰ and 2 ‰. After a successful laboratory verification, field measurements were carried out in the same way.

40|$|The faintest object {{which can}} be {{observed}} with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) is set by the detector cosmic-ray background and not by object flux. We use data from Beaver and Lyons to show that 48 % of the background counts are from cosmic rays which each generate a near instantaneous burst {{of two or more}} counts. Setting the FOS threshold parameter REJLIM = 1, which <b>rejects</b> all <b>frames</b> with more than one count increases the ratio of signal-to-dark counts (S/D) by a factor of 1. 94, regardless of the frame time or the object signal, because half of the dark counts which arrive in single counts (from either cosmic-ray bursts or thermal dark current photoemission) are rejected {{at the same rate as}} the object signal. But the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR proportional to S/square root of S + D) increases by at most a factor of 1. 35, and for realistic parameters and taking into account dead time, we expect a gain in SNR of only 1. 18. If a diode has failed and now emits noise, no data at all will be recorded. The chance of this occurring is approximately = 10 %, and for this reason we do not recommend the use of REJLIM. The two-point correlation function of dark counts per pixel has strong peaks every four pixels, caused by the action of quarter-stepping on the counts from large bursts. The counts from such bursts spread over at least 80 - 100 diodes, and we show that such bursts can be rejected during data reduction if the data are recorded in RAPID mode with individual exposures of about 35 seconds. The SNR of the spectrum can also be improved by weighting each exposure by its SNR (a function ofthe mean dark count rate at that time), since dark varies by a factor of 2 around an orbit. These two procedures together increase the SNR by a factor of 1. 1. 3 (a 28 % gain in exposure time) in regions of a spectrum where the object is much fainter than the background. We find that the Ly-alpha and O I sky emission lines give at most 4 (counts/array/s/sq arcsec), and typically half this number. With a small frame time and a small entrance aperture, these counts cause REJLIM = 1 to reject only a few percent of the data. We discuss only the HST FOS blue side detector, but the same ideas apply to any photon counter which records bursts of noise, and the calculations resemble those for the loss of signal due to coincidences in photon counters. In the ideal photon counter the dark counts are readily distinguished from photons. One way to do this is to add detectors which records only dark current, so that every cosmic ray produces more than one count and the instrument can be operated in an anti-coincidence mode...|$|R

Perhaps the greatest pleasure is to answer, especially insofar as one feels that one 2 ̆ 7 s critics have misunderstood or gone wrong. But although it is sometimes helpful to clarify confusions, there is always the risk that an effort to be exhaustive in this respect will become exhausting instead and that a rigorous emphasis on small differences will suppress larger and more important ones. For this reason, and also in order not to abuse the luxury of writing (at least for the moment) last, I shall resist the temptation to defend my earlier argument against every objection at every turn and instead use these pages (in the main) to emphasize the principal themes of the discussion and to articulate continuing disagreements. This approach has its drawbacks, to be sure. For example, the effort to emphasize larger themes requires me to leave many excellent smaller points unaddressed. Moreover, I will undoubtedly fall short of my ambition to convey a fair account of the main lines of disagreement. My view of the broader terrain is itself influenced by the peculiar ground upon which I stand, and even a dispassionate treatment of the differences that these Responses illustrate will inevitably take on something of the character of a rebuttal. But even as I recognize the shortcomings of this approach - and my own shortcomings in executing it - I shall continue to emphasize the main lines of disagreement that the Responses display rather than to vindicate my own position. This effort will be most useful in propelling the discussion forward, even if progress necessarily occurs only in fits and starts. The account of the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s ethical position that I propose in Legal Ethics from the Lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s Point of View may be broken, roughly, into three parts, and the three Responses to my argument fortuitously divide their attentions more or less evenly among them.

I argue that the single-minded pursuit of third-personal impartial morality undermines the integrity of the moral personality, which I claim depends upon sustaining free-standing first-personal ethical commitments. These ideas form the backdrop against which the 2 ̆ 2 extraordinary complexity and intractability 2 ̆ 2 that I claim characterizes the modem adversary lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s ethical position arises.

Frank Brennan will shortly be publishing Acting on Conscience: When Personal Beliefs and Public Life Collide. We have gone from a famine to a feast {{in just a couple}} of years. Amanda Lohrey and Tom Frame have each written short, readable books for a general audience, though at times Frame is heavier going and unduly immersed in academic arguments. Each is stimulated by current developments, particularly by what is often described as the evangelical revival or the rise of the religious right. Lohrey explicitly chooses two moments in 2004 as illustrations: the address by federal Treasurer Peter Costello to Sydney’s Hillsong Church and the success of the new Family First Party in electing a senator in the federal election. Frame is less explicit, but he is clearly concerned by these developments and addresses those Christians who are attracted by them. He writes that “some denominations and individuals are in real danger of fusing religion and politics, and of failing to maintain the necessary distance between church and state that is needed for their healthy interaction”. He is critical of both the Christian Democratic Party and the Family First Party. He is more favorably inclined towards evangelical Christian pressure group activities, such as those of the Australian Christian Lobby, though he still expresses some concerns. Frame, Anglican Bishop to the Australian Defence Force, is an insider, both as a Christian clergyman rather than a non-believer and as member of one of the older established churches rather than one of the newer evangelical churches. In a passage likely to unsettle many of the new religious warriors he writes: From my observations as an “insider”, I would say that many within the church do not understand the questions, appreciate the character of the debate, grasp the attendant theological complexities, acknowledge the lessons of church history, display sufficient humility about the church’s shortcomings, concede a lack of consensus among Christians, understand the nature of political discourse or value the integrity of the state in this country. Sadly, the loss of spiritual authority has created a desire for political influence that has warped religious life in this country. Lohrey, a political observer and well-published novelist, is a sceptical outsider to activist Christianity: “It troubles me when I hear the bishops and Christian politicians pontificate. ” She would rather listen to young Christians. She is sympathetic to liberal humanist values and in a previous Quarterly Essay, Groundswell: The Rise of the Greens, showed considerable sympathy for Green values and political influence. Her final words, after her discussions with some young Christians, reveal her as a not unsympathetic outsider to their values and aspirations: I look at these young adults and they truly are wonderfully made, and I wish we could agree on more; could meet up on some other wordless, plane, free of dogma, free of all this stuff. But unhappily, for me at least, we are here, now, across the divide of the literal Word. Still, the Word notwithstanding, I am left with the impression that some commonality remains. If in their mature years they are still “children of the Reformation” then we will continue to share a commitment to that great humanist project, a secular liberal democracy in which freedom of conscience is paramount; in which the mysterious unknowability of someone else’s faith is respected and protected, but not at the expense of those for whom that mystery is of an altogether different order. It may be that I would choose to emphasise the “secular” in that formulation rather more than these young people, but for now the system embraces us in a broadly consensual understanding of civic virtue. I hope that consensus holds. The two authors disagree about the nature of the Australian state. For Lohrey there is no doubting the “secular state”. She argues that “the poisonous sectarian disputes of the nineteenth century were uppermost in the minds of the framers of the constitution when they formulated section 116 in the hope that this would guarantee the new commonwealth a secular state. ” She emphasises the separation of church and state, with reference to the work of Helen Irving, and concludes that: “This makes Australia the most secular liberal democracy in the world. ” She is at odds with Frame, who concludes that section section 116 was just “a minimalist stab at setting some parameters for the interaction that would inevitably occur” between religion and politics. In fact Frame takes issue most strongly with Irving for claiming that “Australia has a secular heritage” which was “reflected nationally in the Commonwealth Constitution”. But Frame and Lohrey are more inclined to agree that claims about the power of the churches in contemporary Australian politics are overblown. According to Lohrey, “Arguably the most distinctive feature of the Christian Right in Australia is not its actual numbers but its proselytising zeal” which “begins to look like a strategy to manufacture the appearance of a Christian ‘groundswell’. ” Here <b>Frame</b> <b>rejects</b> the claims of Max Wallace and the general tenor of Maddox’s arguments. He believes that “A scent of Christianity continues to pervade the public square but it is fading fast”. The styles of the two books differ. Much of Frame’s is a general introduction to the question of church and state without particular reference to Australia. It draws on political philosophy and history to sketch the evolution of the interrelationship. Only later does it become more oriented to personal observations about Australian developments. Lohrey’s style is of informed and critical journalism. Most of her sources are recent Australian media reports. She chooses “a somewhat unorthodox form for this essay” by opening and closing with “the voices of ordinary believers” - reports of discussions with sixteen year olds and with university students. They make up a considerable part of the book: sixteen of the 75 pages. She too is sometimes passionate, but this time the targets are some church leaders. What really interests Lohrey is the new political right. After an introductory discussion of “The Cool Girls”, a lengthy section on “Selling the Sacred”, containing a most informative analysis of the modern marketing of religion, is devoted to Pastor Brian Houston, Hillsong and the other mega-churches. “Voting for Jesus” includes a substantial discussion of Family First. Later, in “Managing the Culture Wars”, she turns to two examples of the extremist face of the religious right: the Exclusive Brethren and Opus Dei. Lohrey’s chapter “Still the Main Game” recognises the pre-eminent place of the established churches. “Despite all the colour and movement of the Pentecostals, all the clapping and swaying and the number of CDs to hit the charts,” she writes, “the traditional churches are still the main religious game in town. ” She points briefly to their self-interested lobbying successes for the churches’ own infrastructure and efforts in education and welfare. And she recognises their social justice lobbying, which has met “with a singular lack of success” because they have been brushed off by the Howard government when they have protested against government policies on refugees, war and industrial relations. She also examines the attempt by Kevin Rudd and other Labor MPs to articulate Christian Labor values. What really interests Frame is the separation or non-separation of church and state. The first two chapters (almost half of this 95 page book) are devoted to successfully putting church-state discussion in historical and international context. The third chapter, “Whose wall?”, turns to Australia less successfully. His history is too fragmentary to convey fully the lively politics of sectarianism and section 116. The fourth chapter, “No wall, two people?”, contains personal reflections on religion and politics from the late 1960 s, when “the Australian churches were politically influential and active”, to the present day. He is uncomfortable with the new Christian parties and lobbies but also critical of what he sees as militant secularists like the Humanist Society of New South Wales. He takes issue with Maddox, and rightly argues that the evidence that the religious right is ascendant is still thin. But he wrongly suggests that Maddox wants to eliminate religious ideals from the public square; rather her main concern is that the religious right has taken over the expression of religion in public debate from the Christian left, to the disadvantage of Labor and to the advantage of the Howard government. The reality of extensive church-state relations in Australia is largely neglected in these two books. This can either be church delivery of public services in health, education and welfare, or it can be church lobbying efforts to influence government economic and social policies across the board. Lohrey notes: “At any given time religious lobbies work away to influence governments and this is sometimes perceived as sinister, though arguably it is no less or more so than the efforts of other interest groups seeking to influence public policy. ” This all happens in an environment described by Frame in his final chapter as “A land without walls” between church and state. Yet what is most lacking in these books is adequate description of the thicket of relations between church and state. Most of these still involve the major churches rather than representatives of the religious right. The distraction from the main game that the latter represents permeates these two books to their detriment. Frame and Lohrey, the insider and the outsider, may not be too far apart in the role that they would like to see religion playing in politics. Both may underestimate the actual influence that religion does exert. Frame, for instance, reflects the pessimistic view of many inside the churches: Whereas previously the church’s position meant a great deal in national affairs and Christian thinkers were accorded a prime place in the public square, Christians can no longer presume they will even be heard, let alone heeded, in an increasingly indifferent and hostile society. Christians are one among many “special interest” groups vying for influence and the crowd’s ear. Yet in another way both are optimists, Frame confident and Lohrey more tentative. She sees an emerging consensus in the community about civic virtue. He reckons a new relationship is currently under negotiation: The absence of any wall points to the sophistication of Australia’s public life and the quality of its democracy. It also reflects a commitment to shared values and common aspirations that are just as important to those with religious beliefs as to those with none. Even together these books cannot represent the final word. There is a larger story that two short books cannot hope to tell. What is still needed is a better integrated account of the role of both the old and new politics of religion in Australia. • John Warhurst is professor of political science at the Australian National university.
