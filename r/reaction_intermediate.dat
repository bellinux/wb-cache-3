5000|$|A {{reaction}} step of {{a chemical}} reaction is defined as: [...] "An elementary reaction, constituting one of the stages of a stepwise reaction in which a <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediate</b> (or, for the first step, the reactants) is converted into the next <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediate</b> (or, for the last step, the products) in the sequence of intermediates between reactants and products".|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{provides}} some {{new insights into}} the pyrolysis mechanism of cellulose as a model compound of lignocellulosic biomass, focusing more on the formation and characterisation of the <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediates</b> as important precursors of volatiles produced from cellulose pyrolysis.

5000|$|<b>Reaction</b> <b>intermediates</b> are {{chemical}} species, often {{unstable and}} short-lived (however sometimes can be isolated), {{which are not}} reactants or products of the overall chemical reaction, but are temporary products and/or reactants in the mechanism's <b>reaction</b> steps. <b>Reaction</b> <b>intermediates</b> are often free radicals or ions.|$|R

50|$|OGA catalyzes O-GlcNAc {{hydrolysis}} via an oxazoline <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediate.</b> Stable compounds which {{mimic the}} <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediate</b> {{can act as}} selective enzyme inhibitors. Thiazoline derivatives of GlcNAc {{can be used as}} a <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediate.</b> An example of this includes Thiamet-G as shown on the right. A second form of inhibition can occur from the mimicry of the transition state. The GlcNAcstatin family of inhibitors exploit this mechanism in order to inhibit OGA activity. For both types of inhibitors, OGA can be selected apart from the generic lysosomal hexosaminidases by elongating the C2 substituent in their chemical structure. This takes advantage of a deep pocket in OGA's active site that allow it to bind analogs of GlcNAc.|$|E

50|$|An {{elementary}} reaction is a chemical reaction {{in which one}} or more chemical species react directly to form products in a single reaction step and with a single transition state. In practice, a reaction {{is assumed to be}} elementary if no <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediates</b> have been detected or need to be postulated to describe the reaction on a molecular scale.

EcoRI, a {{bacterial}} sequence-specific S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent DNA methyltransferase, {{relies on a}} complex conformational mechanism to achieve its remarkable specificity, including DNA bending, base flipping and intercalation into the DNA. Using transient fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime studies with cognate and noncognate DNA, we have characterized several <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediates</b> involving the WT enzyme. Similar studies with a bending-impaired, enhanced-specificity M. EcoRI mutant show minimal differences with the cognate DNA, but significant differences with noncognate DNA.

50|$|The {{steady state}} approximation, {{occasionally}} called the stationary-state approximation, involves setting {{the rate of}} change of a <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediate</b> in a reaction mechanism equal to zero so that the kinetic equations can be simplified by setting the rate of formation of the intermediate equal to the rate of its destruction.|$|E

50|$|Increased {{specificity}} {{is obtained}} by introducing an irreversible step exiting the pathway, with <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediates</b> leading to incorrect products {{more likely to}} prematurely exit the pathway than <b>reaction</b> <b>intermediates</b> leading to the correct product.

(If the next step is fast relative to the exit step, specificity will not be increased because there will not be enough time for exit to occur.) This can be repeated more than once to increase specificity further.|$|R
