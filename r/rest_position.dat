25|$|The {{purpose of}} a DAO action in a {{semi-automatic}} is mostly to avoid the change in trigger pull {{between the first and}} subsequent shots that one experiences in a DA/SA pistol, while avoiding the perceived danger of carrying a cocked single-action handgun, although it also avoids having to carry a cocked and loaded pistol, or having to lower the hammer on a loaded chamber, if one only fires a partial magazine. A good example of this action in a semi-automatic is the SIG Sauer DAK trigger, or the DAO action of the Sig P250. For striker-fired pistols such as the Taurus 24/7, the striker will remain in the <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> through the entire reloading cycle. This term applies most often to semi-automatic handguns; however, the term can also apply to some revolvers such as the Smith & Wesson Centennial, the Type 26 Revolver, and the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolvers, {{in which there is no}} external hammer spur, or which simply lack the internal sear mechanism capable of holding the hammer in the cocked position.|$|E
2500|$|Harpsichords vary in {{size and}} shape, but {{all have the same}} basic mechanism. The player {{depresses}} a key that rocks over a pivot in the middle of its length. The other end of the key lifts a jack (a long strip of wood) that holds a small plectrum (a wedge-shaped piece of quill, often plastic in the 2010s), which plucks the string. [...] When the player releases the key, the far end returns to its <b>rest</b> <b>position,</b> and the jack falls back. The plectrum, mounted on a tongue that can swivel backwards away from the string, passes the string without plucking it again. [...] As the key reaches its <b>rest</b> <b>position,</b> a felt damper atop the jack stops the string's vibrations. These basic principles are explained in detail below.|$|E
2500|$|When the diver {{starts to}} inhale, {{the removal of}} gas from the casing lowers the {{pressure}} inside the chamber, and the external water pressure moves the diaphragm inwards operating a lever. This lifts the valve off its seat, releasing gas into the chamber. The inter-stage gas, at about [...] over ambient pressure, expands through the valve orifice as its pressure is reduced to ambient and supplies the diver with more gas to breathe. When the diver stops inhaling the chamber fills until the external pressure is balanced, the diaphragm returns to its <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> and the lever releases the valve to be closed by the valve spring and gas flow stops.|$|E

The aim of this study was to define the <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the GH joint by quantifying the humeral head translation and axial rotational range of motion (ROM). Subjects and Methods The anterior and posterior translation of the humeral head and the rotational ROM of the dominant arm were assessed in the seated position at multiple abduction posi-tions in 15 subjects who were healthy by use of an electromagnetic tracking device. A force of 80 N and a torque of 4 Nm were applied during the measurement procedures for the translation of the humeral head and the rotational ROM, respectively. Results The mean <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> determined by rotational movement was located at 49. 8 degrees of GH abduction.

2500|$|Most saxophones, {{past and}} present, {{are made from}} brass. Despite this, they are {{categorized}} as woodwind instruments rather than brass, as the sound waves are produced by an oscillating wooden reed, not the lips against a mouthpiece as in a brass instrument, and because pitches are produced by breath wind passing opening and closing keys. The screw pins that connect the rods to the posts, {{as well as the}} needle and leaf springs that cause the keys to return to their <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> after being released, are generally made of blued or stainless steel.

2500|$|The {{causes of}} the Casimir effect are {{described}} by quantum field theory, which states {{that all of the}} various fundamental fields, such as the electromagnetic field, must be quantized at each and every point in space. In a simplified view, a [...] "field" [...] in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field can be visualized as the displacement of a ball from its <b>rest</b> <b>position.</b> Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate wave equation for the particular field in question. The second quantization of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. At the most basic level, the field at each point in space is a simple harmonic oscillator, and its quantization places a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the elementary particles of particle physics. However, even the vacuum has a vastly complex structure, so all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.|$|E

In this context, the <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the head could be responsible for several skeletal and dental occlusal disorders among patients with cerebral palsy. Objective: To assess the presence of malocclusions in patients with cerebral palsy, define the most frequent types of malocclusions, and evaluate how the <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the head may be implicated in the development of such malocclusions. Study design: Forty-four patients aged between 12 - 55 years (18 males and 26 females) were studied. Occlusal conditions, the Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI), changes in the <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the head, and breathing and swallowing functions were assessed. Results: Orthodontic treatment was required by 70. 8 % of the patients, the most frequent malocclusions being molar class II, open bite and high overjet. These individuals showed altered breathing and swallowing functions, as well as habit and postural disorders. The <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the head, especially the hyperextended presentation, was significantly correlated to high DAI scores. Conclusions: The results obtained suggest that patients with cerebral palsy are more susceptible to present malocclusions, particularly molar class II malocclusion, increased open bite, and high overjet. Such alterations in turn are more common in patients with a hyperextended position of the head...|$|R

The design was refined by Herman Gerhard Jan Voogd of the Netherlands eliminating the awkward 4 bar mechanism {{taking on the}} general outline that it has kept since. Wood, now of Rockville IL, added reinforcements, replaceable blades, and blade stops in 1943 The 1943 design was also equipped to block the halves open after stripping to avoid crushing the freshly stripped wire as it returned to its <b>rest</b> <b>position.</b> A second actuation released the mechanism {{to return to the}} <b>rest</b> <b>position.</b> The action was further refined by Wood and finally by Eugene D. Hindenburg of DeKalb, IL. The final refinement of the action shifted the sequence of operations so that the stripping blades opened before any other part of the mechanism began to return to the <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> while the clamping jaws retraced the sequence of operation, remaining closed until the handles were fully released.|$|E

30|$|Gestures that {{conveyed}} relevant semantic content {{were coded}} and analyzed. A gesture {{was defined as}} a movement of hand(s) accompanied by speech to express an idea or meaning. A gesture unit was defined as “the period of time between successive rests of the limbs (McNeill, 1992).” Movement of the hand(s) starting from a <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> and returning to a <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> was regarded as one gesture. If the hands did not return to a <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> between two gestures, the boundary was defined by a pause in motion and an obvious change in shape or trajectory. When a participant used both hands simultaneously to describe one object, concept, or part, it was regarded as one gesture. If a participant used both hands and one described an object, a concept, or a part and the other hand a different concept, the gestures were coded as two different gestures. Beats, which serve to advance the discourse, and emblems, which have conventionalized meanings like “OK,” were excluded as were {{a very small number of}} metaphoric gestures expressing abstract ideas.|$|R
40|$|Although resting {{is one of}} the {{dominant}} behaviors of foregut fermenting primates (i. e., colobines), their resting posture has rarely received attention. We hypothesize that colobines are more constrained in their <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> than hindgut fermenting primates and that colobines assume a sitting <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> for specific reasons. To test this hypothesis, we followed two approaches. First, we observed <b>resting</b> <b>positions</b> in two captive individuals each of eight species and tested whether colobines rested in a sitting position more than other primates. Second, we collected literature data on free-ranging specimens of 31 species and again tested whether colobines rested in a sitting position more than other primates. Both approaches indicated that colobines spent more time in a sitting posture than other primates (73. 0 % vs. 23. 2 % in captivity and 83. 0 % vs. 60. 9 % in the wild, respectively). We hypothesize that the position of the digestive chamber and the necessity of frequently having to eructate digestion gases force colobines to take a sitting posture to avoid pressure on the thorax and respiratory organs...|$|R
