2500|$|After the 1870s, stagecoaches {{provided}} the primary form of local passenger and mail transportation between inland towns {{that were not}} connected to a railroad, with sailing ships and paddle wheel steamships connecting port cities. Freight wagons still hauled nearly all cargo. Even when railroads arrived, stages were essential to link more remote areas to the railheads. Top of the line in quality, with crowded discomfort, was the nine-passenger Concord stagecoach, but the cheaper, rougher [...] "mud wagons" [...] were also in general use. The Wells Fargo company contracted with independent lines to deliver its express packages and transport gold bullion and coins. Stagecoach travel was usually uncomfortable as passengers were often crowded together in limited space, dust pouring through open windows from <b>rough</b> unpaved <b>roads,</b> <b>rough</b> <b>rides,</b> un-bathed fellow passengers and poorly sprung steel tired stagecoaches. Some drivers were famous for their skill in driving six horses down winding roads at top speed, fortunately only rarely overturning. Rate competition from competing stage lines reduced fares to as little a two cents per mile on some routes—a $1.00/day was then a common wage. Bandits found robbing coaches a profitable if risky venture {{as they may be}} shot or hanged if caught. U.S. government mail subsidies provided essential base income for many stage lines, but running a stage line was often a financially unstable business enterprise.|$|R
40|$|To {{solve the}} cycle {{shifting}} problem caused by double-parameter shifting schedule on the <b>rough</b> <b>road,</b> it is {{need to recognize}} <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> and then take corresponding control strategy. Firstly, vehicle longitunal dynamic on <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> is analyzed, which verified the possibility using longitudinal acceleration to recognize <b>rough</b> <b>road.</b> Then longitudinal acceleration expressions on the <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> are analyzed, which proves the turbine speed change rate is effective on <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> recognition, and time domain analysis of turbine speed change rate is done. With the above analysis, a method combined with frequency of turbine speed change rate passing through the limits and receding horizon is used to recognize <b>rough</b> <b>road.</b> Finally, the fixed method of shift schedule on <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> is proposed based on the above passing through frequency, and control strategy of automatic transmission under the condition of road recognition is also given. Road experiments show that road roughness is effectively recognized and cycle shifting problem can be effectively solved...|$|R
