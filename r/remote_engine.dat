40|$|With the {{popularity}} of computer and network technologies, the number of web sites have rapidly increased, which has significantly stimulated the development of search engines. In recent years, {{a considerable number of}} search engines have been developed. The problem of how to find information on the Internet has been replaced with the problems of where to find the search engines, what they are designed to retrieve, and how to make the best use of them. Metasearch engine is a technique to cope with these problems by selecting and interfacing with multiple <b>remote</b> search <b>engines</b> at one time. One important issue on metasearch is how accurately it can select and rank feasible <b>remote</b> search <b>engines</b> for user queries. In this paper, a ratio-based metaindex approach is proposed for selecting <b>remote</b> search <b>engines.</b> Based on the novel approach, an experimental metasearch engine has been implemented.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of information {{available on the}} Web has been explosive. The initial approach of collecting all Web pages into a single location and indexing them is limited {{in its ability to}} deal with this explosion. Different search engines provide access to different collections, requiring users to access multiple information sources to meet their needs. A scalable approach to information gathering from multiple sources is described which is based on the use of distributed information agents to route queries to the most appropriate sources and fuse information they provide. This paper describes an intelligent, adaptive Web search tool that can not only locate relevant information sources for the user, but also adapt to the frequent changes of the dynamic Web environment. We employ a multiple agent architecture to intelligently categorize and broker queries to <b>remote</b> search <b>engines,</b> learn and continuously update confidence factors for the quality of results provided by each search engine, and automatically detect and adapt to changes in the syntax used by the search engines.
