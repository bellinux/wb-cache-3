40|$|Abstract Background Clinician {{adherence}} to obesity screening guidelines from United States health agencies remains suboptimal. This study explored how personal and career demographics influence pediatricians' <b>weight</b> <b>assessment</b> and management practices. Methods A web-based survey was distributed to U. S. pediatricians. Respondents {{were asked to}} identify the weight status of photographed children and about their <b>weight</b> <b>assessment</b> and management practices. Associations between career and personal demographic variables and pediatricians' <b>weight</b> perceptions, <b>weight</b> <b>assessment</b> and management practices were evaluated using univariate and multivariate modeling. Results 3, 633 pediatric medical providers correctly identified the weight status of children at a median rate of 58 %. The majority of pediatric clinicians were white, female, and of normal weight status with more than 10 years clinical experience. Experienced pediatric medical providers were less likely than younger colleagues to correctly identify the weight status of pictured children and were also less likely to know and use BMI criteria for assessing weight status. General pediatricians were more likely than subspecialty practitioners to provide diverse interventions for weight management. Non-white and Hispanic general practitioners were more likely than counterparts to consider cultural approaches to weight management. Conclusion Pediatricians' perceptions of children's weight and their <b>weight</b> <b>assessment</b> and management practices are influenced by career and personal characteristics. Objective criteria and clinical guidelines should be uniformly applied by pediatricians to screen for and manage pediatric obesity. </p...|$|R
25|$|On any {{bike with}} only rear wheel braking, the maximum {{deceleration}} is {{significantly lower than}} on a bike equipped with a front brake. As a vehicle <b>brakes,</b> <b>weight</b> can be transferred towards the front wheel {{and away from the}} rear, decreasing the amount of grip the rear wheel has. Transferring the rider's weight back increases rear wheel braking efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the braking power when braking hard.|$|R
50|$|By way of example, when {{a vehicle}} accelerates, a weight {{transfer}} {{toward the rear}} wheels can occur. An outside observer might witness this as the vehicle visibly leans to the back, or squats. Conversely, under <b>braking,</b> <b>weight</b> transfer {{toward the front of}} the car can occur. Under hard braking it might be clearly visible even from inside the vehicle as the nose dives toward the ground (most of this will be due to load transfer). Similarly, during changes in direction (lateral acceleration), weight transfer to the outside of the direction of the turn can occur.|$|R
40|$|National data {{indicate}} that {{there was almost no}} change in the accuracy of body <b>weight</b> <b>assessments</b> of overweight women over the past 20 Â years. The accuracy in <b>weight</b> <b>assessment</b> is influenced by a number of social-demographic and economic factors; many of them have opposite effects and cancel out each other. This paper examines changes in misperception of body weight among overweight women in the United States, using data from the 1988 - 1994 and 1999 - 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Changes in characteristics of the population, such as the increased share of Hispanics in the US population, between these two time periods explain {{only a small portion of}} the changes in the accuracy of body <b>weight</b> <b>assessment.</b> Most of the differences come from changes in the association between population characteristics and the likelihood an overweight woman underestimates her weight status. Results also indicate that overweight women who receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly Food Stamp Program) are consistently more likely to misperceive themselves as healthy weight or underweight than higher income overweight women.

40|$|Abstract Background Adolescent weight {{status is}} a {{cumulative}} effect of health and nutritional problems. Adolescent weight problems often go unnoticed as <b>weight</b> <b>assessment</b> is not considered a priority in adolescents. Objectives To determine the weight status of adolescents using BMI and to identify the contributing factors to adolescent weight problems. Methods In April 2010, 960 adolescents aged 10 – 19 [*]years in secondary schools in Port Harcourt were selected for the study using a stratified multi-staged sampling method. Structured questionnaires were filled by the investigators while weight and height were measured. BMI was calculated using the formula weight/height 2 (kg/m 2). Results The prevalence of underweight, overweight, obesity and stunting were 6. 4 %, 6. 3 %, 1. 8 % and 5. 4 % respectively. Factors which were commoner in overweight adolescents were high socioeconomic class, higher maternal education, spending > 3 hours a day watching television and frequent ingestion of snacks. Conclusion There {{is a need for}} periodic <b>weight</b> <b>assessment</b> of adolescents and health education to promote healthy eating habits and regular physical exercise as part of the School Health Programme. </p...|$|R

5000|$|As a car {{approaches}} {{the end of}} a straightaway, the downforce generated by the body of the car should increase the sprung weight until the coil springs compress until they bind and the suspension can no longer travel (hence the name). [...] The goal of coil bind is to keep the air dam (or splitter if applicable) {{at the front of the}} car as low to the ground as possible to create an area of low pressure under the car. The result is similar to ground effects. Under <b>braking,</b> <b>weight</b> transfer causes more weight to shift forward as the vehicle decelerates. This helps to maintain the low-pressure area below the car by keeping the front of the car low to the ground. While coil bind setups do yield faster lap times, the cars are more sensitive to turbulence generated by nearby cars.|$|R

50|$|The use of four-coupled wheels for a fast express {{was unusual}} by this time, as the Atlantic arrangement, a four-coupled tender {{locomotive}} with a four-wheel leading bogie for high-speeds, had by now largely {{been replaced by}} the larger Pacific. One exception was the US Hiawatha , a 4-4-2 of the same period. US track loadings were higher though, and this locomotive had a driving axle loading twice that of the Hungarian design. With the relatively short range of 250 km required, the Class 242 could afford to be a tank locomotive, even though this reduced the water and fuel capacity available. Avoiding the weight of a tender, and a large fuel capacity, further reduced the axle loading. A modern feature required by these increased speeds, and the lack of <b>braking</b> <b>weight</b> in the locomotive itself, was improved continuous braking throughout the train, by compressed air brakes to the Knorr system.|$|R
5000|$|Stopping is a {{considerable}} source of inefficiency. Modern electric trains like the Shinkansen (the Bullet Train) use regenerative braking to return current into the catenary while they brake. A Siemens study indicated that regenerative braking might recover 41.6% of the total energy consumed. The Passenger Rail (Urban and Intercity) and Scheduled Intercity and All Charter Bus Industries Technological and Operational Improvements - FINAL REPORT states that [...] "Commuter operations can dissipate {{more than half of}} their total traction energy in braking for stops." [...] and that [...] "We estimate head-end power to be 35 percent (but it could possibly be as high as 45 percent) of total energy consumed by commuter railways." [...] Having to accelerate and decelerate a heavy train load of people at every stop is inefficient despite regenerative braking which can recover typically around 20% of the energy wasted in <b>braking.</b> <b>Weight</b> is a determinant of braking losses.|$|R

Studies that do include females have examined only the aerobic contribution to middle distance running performance. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate aerobic, anaerobic and muscle function factors that could be used to predict middle distance running performance in female runners. This study was performed at an altitude of 1800 m. Eleven middle distance female runners aged 18 - 20 were selected for the study. Aerobic capacity was assessed by measuring the maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max), running velocity at maximal oxygen consumption (vVO 2 max), running economy (RE) and onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA). The blood lactate curve of each subject was constructed by relating the oxygen consumption, to the plasma lactate concentrations. Anaerobic capacity was determined by measuring the maximum accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) on a treadmill.
