60|$|Father {{raised his}} head in stupefied alarm. She drew him down, put his head on her shoulder. She took his hand, to lead him, her little boy, into a land of summer dreams where they would always be together. The Innocents were going their way, asking no one's permission, yet harming no one.... His hand was {{twitching}} a little; he coughed with a sound of hurt bewilderment; but she held his hand firmly, and over this first <b>rough</b> <b>part</b> of the road the mother of tenderness led him pityingly on.|$|E

60|$|It {{happened}} {{on the evening of}} a very bright day. He had been unfortunate. The sun being too bright, the fish would not rise. This annoyed him much, because on that particular day he had been accompanied by the Captain and Bob Bowie, as well as his two companions, all of whom were anxious to see him catch fish, and learn a lesson in the art. Fred was up to his middle in a <b>rough</b> <b>part</b> of the river. It was all he could do to retain his foothold, the water was so strong.|$|E
60|$|Looking {{out between}} the trees {{we could see a}} great side of mountain, running down {{exceeding}} steep into the waters of the loch. It was a <b>rough</b> <b>part,</b> all hanging stone, and heather, and bit scrogs of birchwood; and away at the far end towards Balachulish, little wee red soldiers were dipping up and down over hill and howe, and growing smaller every minute. There was no cheering now, for I think they had other uses for what breath was left them; but they still stuck to the trail, and doubtless thought that we were close in front of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear, but {{you must}} {{remember}} it was so I felt the many times that your father went to the war. It is so with the wife of every knight and noble in the land. And not only these, but also the wives of the men-at- arms and archers, {{and it will be}} yours when you too have a lord. Men risk their lives in battle; women stay at home and mind their castles. We each have our tasks. You know the lines that the priest John Ball used, they say, as a text for his harangues to the crowds, When Adam delved and Eve span. You see, one did the <b>rough</b> <b>part</b> of the toil, the other sat at home and did what was needful there, and so it has been ever since. You know how you shared our feelings of delight that your brother had grown stronger, and would be able to take his own part, as his fathers had done before him, to become a brave and valiant knight, and assuredly it is not for you to repine now that a fair opportunity offers for him to prepare for his career." ...|$|E

40|$|In <b>rough</b> {{machining}} of <b>parts</b> with sculptured surfaces, {{two main}} objectives are usually considered: machining time and overall removed material {{at the end}} of the roughing phase. The outcome of that phase is critical for the subsequent finishing phase. This paper proposes a method for measuring <b>roughed</b> <b>part</b> quality through calculation of the local difference between the <b>roughed</b> <b>part</b> geometry and the ideally finished part geometry. The method calculates the height from a point lying on the roughed surface to its projection on the ideally finished part surface. Using the API of a CAD system for this purpose proves computationally inefficient. Therefore, a mean distance between a triangle of the roughed surface triangular mesh and the ideally finished part surface region lying in a suitable envelope is calculated instead. The calculation is repeated not for all triangles of the mesh, but for a sample as low as 3 %, which, according to the Levene statistical test suffices, thereby, reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. The method ultimately yields a single figure, i. e. the standard deviation of local differences between the <b>roughed</b> and finished <b>part,</b> normalized by the mean difference. The concept was tested on sculptured surface parts of various mechanical and operational properties and was proven efficient in all test cases...|$|R

6000|$|... "`And here, fill my cup,' said old Rogan, {{interrupting}} {{himself in}} an earnest conversation, {{into which he}} had plunged with the gentleman on his left hand. As he said this he lifted his cup to empty the slops, but without {{paying attention to what}} he was doing. As luck would have it, the slop-basin was not at hand, and Peterkin's cup was, so he emptied it innocently into that. Peterkin hadn't courage to arrest his hand, and when the deed was done he looked timidly round to see if the action had been observed. Nearly half the table had seen it, but they pretended ignorance of the thing so well that he thought no one had observed, and so went quietly on with his breakfast, and drank the tea! But I am wandering from my story. Well, about this time there was a young Indian who shot himself accidentally in the woods, and was brought to the fort to see if anything could be done for him. The doctor examined his wound, and found that the ball had passed through the upper part of his right arm and the middle of his right thigh, breaking the bone of the latter in its passage. It was an extraordinary shot for a man to put into himself, for it would have been next to impossible even for another man to have done it, unless the Indian had been creeping on all fours. When he was able to speak, however, he explained the mystery. While running through a <b>rough</b> <b>part</b> of the wood after a wounded bird, he stumbled and fell on all fours. The gun, which he was carrying over his shoulder, holding it, as the Indians usually do, by the muzzle, flew forward, and turned right round as he fell, so that the mouth of it was presented towards him. Striking against the stem of a tree, it exploded, and shot him through the arm and leg as described ere he had time to rise. A comrade carried him to his lodge, and his wife brought him in a canoe to the fort. For three or four days the doctor had hopes of him, but at last he began to sink, and died on the sixth day after his arrival. His wife and one or two friends buried him in our graveyard, which lies, as you know, on that lonely-looking point just below the powder-magazine. For several months previous to this our worthy doctor had been making strenuous efforts to get an Indian skull to send home to one of his medical friends, but without success. The Indians could not be prevailed upon to cut off the head of one of their dead countrymen for love or money, and the doctor had a dislike to the idea, I suppose, of killing one for himself; but now here was a golden opportunity. The Indian was buried near to the fort, and his relatives had gone away to their tents again. What was to prevent his being dug up? The doctor brooded over the thing for one hour and a half (being exactly the length of time required to smoke out his large Turkey pipe), and then sauntered into Wilson's room. Wilson was busy, as usual, at some of his mechanical contrivances.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is, at first, to show the inefficacy of {{traditional}} costing systems for management and specification analysis of <b>rough</b> <b>parts.</b> This problem is critical on parts specification, concerning low production batches. It is known that the unit cost of forged of low volume is high. The inadequacy of traditional costing lays on the incapacity to identify and quantify the various factors which compose the cost of a piece-besides the direct costs - and its variations caused by alterations of production batches. Through the Activity-Based Costing system it is possible to identify those cost composing factors. Because it presents more accurate form of allocation, the ABC allows a more criterious costing analysis concerning the process of production. Therefore, this methodology may contribute on choosing the best alternative for <b>rough</b> <b>parts,</b> enhancing choice for the production schedule at a lower cost. This work presents some results of ABC modelling at a forging, showing the skills of this tool on identifying and quantifying cost factors not found through the traditional costing systems...|$|R
