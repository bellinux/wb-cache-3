500|$|... "Lola" [...] {{was written}} as a {{critique}} of mainstream societal treatment of romantic love and heartbreak society. [...] "A wife’s just a whore with a diamond ring", Ndegéocello's sang. She drew inspiration from matchmaking reality television shows that presented love as a [...] "really clear exchange". [...] "I hear young women going 'well if he can buy me something'", Ndegéocello explained. [...] "That song—'Put It in the Bag'—which is based on 'can you buy me some things?' And then the male counterpart, all he can <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> is sex and if the woman can cook. And it’s funny to me. That you're {{no more than a}} whore, you just have a wedding ring." [...] "Bright Shiny Morning" [...] was titled after the book of the same name by James Frey. Ndegéocello wrote the song after reflecting on her past lies and misrepresentations, particularly those she made in an attempt to be accepted in the music industry. [...] "People change themselves", she said. [...] "Almost in the sense of creating mental anguish in order to make other people happy and to obtain celebrity and fame. That's why the lyric is 'you do anything.' Some people do anything for their big dreams of sunshine." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{expanding}} their musical boundaries with The Hot Rock, the band {{decided not to}} worry about what their next album was going to sound like. Tucker explained, [...] "It was so spontaneous [...] The songs just kept popping up one after another. We didn't <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> anything. It just kind of happened." [...] She also said that they wanted to write songs that were [...] "really straightforward but also a bit more mature in their structure and delivery than [...] earlier songs." [...] All Hands on the Bad One is also the first Sleater-Kinney album where drummer Janet Weiss provides backing vocals on some tracks. Tucker remarked that they initially wanted her to sing on The Hot Rock, but the idea was ultimately rejected due to the album's complex melodies. All Hands on the Bad One was produced by John Goodmanson, who previously produced the band's third studio album, Dig Me Out. The band decided to work with him again because, according to Weiss, Goodmanson [...] "has the incredible ability of capturing our live sound and heightening it, so we sound better". The album was recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot! Recording Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington.|$|E

There's nothing 'gay' about the show and he doesn't <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it on air. Viewers trust Kelly's expertise based {{on the strength of}} his choices rather than on the 'he's gay and he should know' fashion theory." ...|$|E

2500|$|Matt Sweeney, who {{initiated}} the band with Corgan, said in 2017, [...] "We had a friendship from {{before he was}} famous. One on one, we had a pretty great thing going. We had a great year were we made like a hundred songs. Nobody’s ever heard that stuff. But once it went public, everything was different. I was confused, it started to feel like fulfilling a commitment where the game had changed. It was interesting, I’m still sort of unpacking that experience. We all had to sign confidentiality agreements, so I can’t <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard's mother [...] "was a {{nice little}} woman with an even and happy disposition," [...] {{according}} to a grandchild's description. She was never mentioned in Kierkegaard's works. Ane died on 31 July 1834, age 66, possibly from typhus. His father died on 8 August 1838, age 82. On 11 August, Kierkegaard wrote: [...] "My father died on Wednesday (the 8th) at 2:00a.m. I so deeply desired {{that he might have}} lived a few years more... Right now I feel there is only one person (E. Boesen) with whom I can <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> him. He was a 'faithful friend.'" [...] Troels Frederik Lund, his nephew, was instrumental in providing biographers with much information regarding Søren Kierkegaard. Lund was a good friend of Georg Brandes and Julius Lange.|$|E

Speaking to Spanish-language sport show República Deportiva, De La Hoya briefly talked about {{the current status of}} negotiations and, with a grin on his face, said that the two sides were extremely close to making the biggest fight in boxing a reality. [...] "These negotiations have been real difficult for various reasons, but we're really close to finalizing the contracts, even though they've been complicated," [...] he commented. [...] "Today, I can't <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the negotiations, but we're really close." [...] A week later, Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer refuted De La Hoya's comments. [...] "I saw those quotes as well, and I had no idea what Oscar was talking about. And I called him up and asked him about them, {{and he said that he}} was misquoted," [...] Schaefer explained to Lem Satterfield of FanHouse.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, Crow {{released}} The Globe Sessions. During this period, she {{discussed in}} interviews having {{gone through a}} deep depression, and there was speculation about a brief affair with Eric Clapton. The debut single from this album, [...] "My Favorite Mistake," [...] was rumored to be about Clapton, but Crow says otherwise—that the song is about a philandering ex-boyfriend. Crow has refused to say who the song was about, telling Billboard Magazine on the release of her album, [...] "Oh, there will be just so much speculation, {{and because of that}} there's great safety and protection in the fact that people will be guessing so many different people and I'm the only person who will ever really know. I'm really private about who I've had relationships with, and I don't talk about them in the press. I don't even <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> them with the people around me." [...] Despite the difficulties in recording the album, Crow told the BBC in 2005 that, [...] "My favorite single is 'My Favorite Mistake.' It {{was a lot of fun}} to record and it's still a lot of fun to play." [...] The album won Best Rock Album at the 1999 Grammy Awards. It was re-released in 1999, with a bonus track, Crow's cover of the Guns N' Roses song [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine," [...] which was included on the soundtrack of the film Big Daddy. The song won the 1999 Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Other singles included [...] "There Goes the Neighborhood," [...] "Anything but Down," [...] and [...] "The Difficult Kind." [...] Crow won the 2001 Grammy best female rock vocal performance for There Goes the Neighborhood. The Globe Sessions peaked at No.5 on the Billboard 200 chart, achieving US sales of 2 million as of January 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan Pundik later accounted, [...] "I'm not {{comparing}} my band to the Beatles whatsoever, {{but their}} [...] records were simple songs {{about love and}} relationships, and people could relate to their songs because they understood what {{they were trying to}} say. That's what this record reminds me of. There's not weird metaphors. It's just straight up, wearing your heart on your sleeve." [...] Steve Klein emphasised the shift in mood from their previous album by stating, [...] "I think every record we make we try and capture a time period. When writing the songs for Coming Home it was more positive than negative. I felt on the last record, Catalyst, we were very negative lyrically. You can tell that by the titles [...] "All Downhill From Here" [...] and [...] "This Disaster," [...] it was a heavier record. Coming Home on the other hand takes you to a different place. It’s the record I feel we’ve been waiting our whole career to do, taking everything people love about NFG and bringing it to the next level." [...] Bassist Ian Grushka further explained, [...] "We only <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> personal things that have affected us first-hand, our songs are about emotions rather than some political agenda." [...] The song, [...] "When I Die" [...] was written by Gilbert about the death of his father. When initially writing the bridge section for the song, Gilbert found the experience emotionally draining and had to leave the studio in order to compose himself. Despite this, he maintains that while song is [...] "sad", it remains [...] "a good sad." [...] He reflected this in the album's liner notes by adding, [...] "It is a song about accepting death and finding the bright side of the situation. I'm no longer afraid to die because I have my father there waiting for me on the other side." ...|$|E
60|$|Any fair {{critical}} {{account of}} Dickens must always make him out {{much smaller than}} he is. For any fair criticism of Dickens must take account of his evident errors, as I have taken account {{of one of the}} most evident of them during the last two or three pages. It would not even be loyal to conceal them. But no honest criticism, no criticism, though it spoke with the tongues of men and angels, could ever <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Dickens. In all this that I have said I have not been talking about Dickens at all. I say it with equanimity; I say it even with arrogance. I have been talking about the gaps of Dickens. I have been talking about the omissions of Dickens. I have been talking about the slumber of Dickens and the forgetfulness and unconsciousness of Dickens. In one word, I have been talking not about Dickens, but about the absence of Dickens. But when we come to him and his work itself, what is there to be said? What is there to be said about earthquake and the dawn? He has created, especially in this book of David Copperfield, he has created, creatures who cling to us and tyrannise over us, creatures whom we would not forget if we could, creatures whom we could not forget if we would, creatures who are more actual than the man who made them.|$|E
