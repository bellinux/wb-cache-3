Kim brought back three Usando natives. Kim {{reported that there}} were fifteen households living on the island, summing to the figure of eighty-six inhabitants. On their {{way back from the}} island, Kim Inu's expedition went through two typhoons, barely reaching the mainland alive.|$|E

CXJZU- 120 were {{conducted}} and evaluated comparing {{the processes of}} traditional chemical degumming and bio-chemical degumming. Results revealed that over 90 % of the gum in <b>raw</b> <b>ramie</b> could be removed only with Pectobacterium sp. CXJZU- 120 in 6 h. The rapid process was not only suitable for the extraction of ramie fibers from different grades of raw material and retaining the inherent morphological structures and textile properties, but also could reduce the production cost up to 20. 5 %, raise resource utilization by more than 50 % and reduce pollution charge by more than 80 % compared with the traditional chemical degumming. It is a breakthrough in the degumming of ramie and has great application potential in the extraction of herbaceous fiber materials...|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} restore these {{incomplete}} cultural relics, the craftsmen used a unique skill, namely [...] "dried lacquer and ramie process" [...] (...) [...] The craftsmen used 13 raw materials, such as <b>raw</b> lacquer, <b>ramie,</b> colorful stone powder and tung oil to wrap and glue the linen and paint and then polished repeatedly. Then, they painted auxiliary materials, such as cinnabar, at last, they pasted gold foil.|$|R
