40|$|Although several {{observations}} of material changes on-orbit have been reported, mechanistic understanding {{has not yet}} become clear because new sets of non-intuitive processes are occurring on orbit. Reactant kinetic energy, low collision rates and surface/adsorbate interactions {{must be considered in}} the analysis of these observations. The specific example of oxide formation of elemental materials is examined in terms of thermodynamics and possible reaction pathways. On the basis of this approach, a <b>rational</b> <b>trend</b> emerges from the orbital behavior of these samples. The role of reactant kinetic energy as opposed to internal energy in chemiluminescent product formation is also presented. Development of a systematic thermochemical approach may be useful in making screening predictions of long-term material behavior on-orbit...|$|E
40|$|Usually, in the {{philosophical}} literature ethics is differentiated from morals, being {{defined as the}} rational analysis of value-loaded statements and their validity. 1 Morals, on the other hand, are a set of practical statements or opinions about values usually treated in moralistic literature such as sermons and various specific codes of behavior. These normative statements derive from the necessity of coping in human societies with various human interactions. They by necessity cannot be unconditional and are in most cases ambiguous. Moral acts are performed {{out of a sense}} of obligation, duty, a moral law. Thus ethics as the theory of morals deals with the justification or grounds of morals and attempts to establish a fundamental principle or principles on which the moral codes could be based. There were many attempts at finding these grounds of morals, e. g., in the nature of man, in the circumstances of his existence, as given by the transcendental being or as a priori concepts of reason. Most often it is impossible to separate ethics and morality and they are treated together. Though all these grounds may be useful in practice, it seems, however, that if moral action, by definition, is moral in the strictest sense because it is done for its intrinsic value, it should be independent of all motives and conditions. The last position we may call absolutist and it itself can be divided into two trends: rational and transcendental. The <b>rational</b> <b>trend,</b> exemplified by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804), claims only reason as th...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) built 12 asphalt {{pavements}} in 1993 {{to validate}} Superpave tests and specifications {{used to measure}} the rutting and fatigue cracking performances of hot-mix asphalts and asphalt binders. Each pavement had four test sites. These sites were tested for either rutting or fatigue cracking using the FHWA’s Accelerated Loading Facility (ALF). The main objective of the study documented in this paper was to compare the fatigue performance results from laboratory bending beam fatigue tests to the ALF fatigue cracking data obtained for these sites from lanes 1 through 4. The four lanes consisted of two asphalt pavement layer thicknesses (100 and 200 mm) and two asphalt binders (PG 58 - 34 and PG 64 - 22). Each lane was tested at three temperatures 10, 19, and 28 °C. Another objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between the asphalt binder parameter for intermediate temperature performance (G*sinδ) and asphalt pavement fatigue life. Findings of this study showed that a relatively good correlation was obtained between the ALF pavement fatigue life and the asphalt mixture fatigue life from the strain-controlled bending beam fatigue tests. Comparison of the fatigue results at the three test temperatures showed <b>rational</b> <b>trends</b> with the longest fatigue life at 28 °C and the shortest fatigue life at 10 °C.

40|$|Tesis Doctoral leída en la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid en 2012. Directores de la Tesis: Dr. Ferreira Cascão y Dr. Mónica Segóvia PérezThe {{consumer}} decision-making models evolved essentially from {{a perspective}} rationally based to emotions {{integration in the}} decision process. The Homo Economicus, that makes objective choices and that finds the necessary information about each alternative, has given up the place to the thinking man that is able to process cognitively the collected environment informations. Finally this thinking man has given up the place to the feeling man that is able to integrate the emotions in the decision process. Nevertheless, the emotions integration in the consumer decision-making process has not been pacific topic for the researchers. The followers of the traditional paradigm defend that the cognition precedes the emotion, being the latter consequence of the former. The defenders of the emotion¿s primacy claim that the first decision of the consumer is emotional, justifying subsequently his decision rationally. Other researchers advocate the existence of two independent decision processes: a rational and an emotional. This thesis argues for the complementarity of emotion and reason in consumer decision process. It is further demonstrated that the rational or emotional preponderance of the consumer purchase decision {{is related to the}} interaction between the relative importance of emotion and reason at the level of environmental stimuli (products/services), the degree of involvement (emotional and reasoning intensity) of the products and services and the consumer purchase <b>trend</b> (<b>rational</b> or emotional preponderance). The presented {{studies have shown that the}} independent variables: relative importance of emotions and reason in terms of products and services, measured by the ratio E/R and the degree of involvement of the same products and services, measured by the ratio (E+R) / 2, have a major effect on the rational or emotional preponderance and intensity of the purchase decision. The independent variable: consumer purchasing trend, although contributing to the strengthening of the rational or emotional component in the purchasing decision, is not sufficient to determine the rational or emotional preponderance of buying decision, in both high and low involvement products.

40|$|Energy renovations {{have been}} on the agenda since the energy crisis in the 1970 s, and {{different}} kinds of measures have been introduced {{to increase the number of}} energy renovations, e. g. increase the knowledge on insulation and heating systems, introduce renewable technologies as solar power, introduce policies as energy label, introduce subsidies, increase consumer awareness as saving energy and costs or better indoor climate or environmental reasons like climate change. About 40 years after the energy crisis in the 70 s, the energy literature is not only about the energy reduction potentials any more. The knowledge is quite good about those potentials. What is not known are the drivers and barriers is especially since the introduction of the energy label: why do homeowners perform energy efficiency measures and why not? Renovating kitchen and bathroom has become quite popular due to the general increase in comfort, but are these comfort issues more popular than energy efficiency measures? The goal of this literature study, performed in 2010, is to give an overview over recent European studies on energy renovations in Europe and their driver/barriers and trends. The specific questions have been: What are the drivers and the barriers of energy renovations in Europe? What are the (energy) renovation trends in Europe? The study on driver/barriers shows that cultural differences between the countries seem small. Interesting is that information and attitude matters most for energy renovation, while regulation and economy least matter. Weak drivers are technical conditions of buildings (except Switzerland), regulation (except the Netherlands and Eastern European countries), and economy (except Ireland). Strong drivers are information and social networks (except Ireland), awareness/attitude/aesthetics (except Ireland). Socio-economic aspects, such as age effects and education and income has no effect goes for all countries. Trends in all countries are to introduce policy measures and energy advice regarding information n and adapted to the homeowners to increase the number of energy measures. The study of renovation trends shows that most popular are comfort renovations, while insulation and heating systems are less performed. Regarding energy renovation measures, the trends are cultural different. While in the UK all measures are popular, Switzerland/Germany/Austria is focusing on insulation and comfort, and France is focusing on insulation, Finland on heating system and NL on comfort. For both part studies it seems that theories based on consumer psychology and consumer sociology matter more than the economic theories based on consumer rationality.

40|$|Several hundred {{chemical}} analyses of early Proterozoic lavas of the Witwatersrand triad (incorporating the Dominion Group, Witwatersrand Supergroup and Ventersdorp Supergroup) in the Klerksdorp area, have revealed {{the presence of}} various distinct magma types. These essentially correspond to formally defined lithostratigraphic units, but several inconsistencies have necessitated the use of informal nomenclature. The lavas have been regionally metamorphosed to low-grade, greenschist facies assemblages. Original igneous textures are preserved, despite a metamorphic overprint. Metamorphism {{has resulted in a}} certain degree of random chemical remobilization. Ba, Sr, Rb, K₂ 0, Na₂ 0 and CaO have been highly mobile, and their usefulness in petrogenetic modelling is extremely limited. In contrast, Zr, Nb, Y, LREE's, Cr, Ni, Ti 0 ₂ P₂ 0 ₅ and Al₂ 0 ₃ have remained immobile. Ti/Zr and Ti/P ratios together constitute efficient discriminating variables for characterizing the different magma types. Lava compositions range from primitive Mg-rich tholeiites to rhyolites, the bulk being tholeiitic andesites. Al₂ 0 ₃ contents do not exceed 15 %, a feature which reflects the tholeiitic, as opposed to calcalkaline, character of these lavas. Two magma-types are present within the Dominion Group, which is a typical example of bimodal volcanism. The Dominion basic lavas are overlain by the Dominion acid porphyries, with a limited amount of interfingering. The basic lava suite is highly fractionated, with compositions ranging from Mg-, Cr- and Ni-rich tholeiites (close to primary mantle melts) to evolved tholeiitic andesites. The most primitive liquids evolved by 45 % fractional crystallization of hornblende, followed by a further 70 % crystallization of an orthopyroxene-plagioclase assemblage containing up to 3 % sulphides. The Dominion porphyries are rhyolitic, display very limited compositional variation, and probably represent a crustal melt related to the same magmatic event which produced the basic lavas. The only lavas from the Witwatersrand Supergroup present in the Klerksdorp area are those of the Crown Formation (Jeppestown amygdaloid). These are tholeiitic dacites which display extremely limited compositional variation, and are unrelated to any of the other magmas of the Witwatersrand triad. The Ventersdorp Supergroup comprises 4 magma-types: The Kliprivierberg Group lavas at the base are subdivisible into 3 sub-types on the basis of Zr contents. (Zr> 11 Oppm) are the most evolved. They are tholeiitic andesites which display fairly limited compositional variation. It is likely that more evolved compositions are present in other areas where the porphyritic lavas which characterize this unit are better developed. The overlying Orkney lavas are characterized by 110 ppm>Zr> 90 ppm. They are tholeiitic andesites of similar composition to the Alberton lavas, but have lower incompatible element levels, higher siderophile element levels, and are of extremely uniform composition. The uppermost Loraine/Edenville lavas range from magnesian tholeiites to tholeiitic andesites. They are distinguished by Zr< 90 ppm, and contain the most primitive magmas af the Witwatersrand triad, with up to 17, 5 % MgO, 2600 ppm Cr, 600 ppm Ni and M-values up to 77. The most primitive liquids evolved by 38 % fractional crystallization of orthopyroxene ∓ chromite, followed by 35 % fractional crystallization of an extract containing clinopyroxene and plagioclase. The absence of olivine precipitation {{is a result of the}} inherently high Si 0 ₂ content of the magma. The Loraine/Edenville, Orkney and Alberton lavas do not lie on a common liquid line of descent, but are probably consanguinous. The Platberg Group overlies the Kliprivierberg Group, and has a coarse-clastic sedimentary unit, the Kameeldoorns Formation, at the base. Three petrographically distinct porphyritic lava sequences overlie the Kameeldoorns Formation, namely the informal "Goedgenoeg formation", the Makwassie quartz-feldspar porphyries and the Rietgat Formation. Despite petrographic differences, the Goedgenoeg and Rietgat lavas are chemically indistinguishable and thus form a single magma-type. The Makwassie porphyries are dacitic in composition with a high proportion of feldspar and quartz phenocrysts. <b>Rational</b> variation <b>trends</b> are attributed to a nett loss of Si 0 ₂ during secondary alteration. The porphyries are probably of crustal origin. The Goedgenoeg/Rietgat lavas display unusual chemistry and a broad, irrational compositional spectrum. They contain very high incompatible element levels, high nonnative quartz, as well as high MgO, M-values, Cr and Ni relative to the other tholeiitic andesites of the Witwatersrand triad. It is tentatively suggested that they are hybrid magmas containing both crust and mantle components, the former possibly represented by the Makwassie porphyries. Field evidence suggests that Platberg volcanism commenced directly after Klipriviersberg volcanism ceased, and was accompanied by a period of enhanced tectonic activity. The Platberg lavas thus probably reflect a crustal melting cycle associated with the Klipriviersberg magmatic event. The Allanridge lavas are the youngest rocks of the Witwatersrand triad. They are separated from the Platberg Group by a unit of flat-lying sediments, the Bothaville Formation, which was deposited after an extended period of peneplanation. The Allanridge lavas form a separate magma-type. They are tholeiitic andesites of similar composition to the Alberton lavas, but have higher incompatible element levels and are not consanguinous. The compositional similarities amongst the basic magma-types of the Witwatersrand triad suggests that all were generated in an hydrous mantle. Interelement ratio differences between the various magma-types nevertheless support the concept that the mantle was chemically heterogeneous during the early Proterozoic...|$|R
