40|$|Abstract-As {{the demand}} for the telecom/server power is growing exponentially, the need for higher power density {{increases}} each year. Increasing power density relies on less component counts, smaller reactive component size, and/or better system efficiency. Higher switching frequency leads to the smaller reactive and filter component size. Better efficiency, which reduces the heat sink or paralleled devices, requires the reduction either in conduction losses or switching losses, or both. Therefore, phase-shifted zero-voltageswitching (ZVS) full bridge topologies are gaining popularity due to their extremely low switching losses in the power devices even at higher switching frequency. However the intrinsic body diode is required to conduct {{in order to create}} the ZVS turn-on condition for the power MOSFET. Due to the extremely low reverse voltage, the <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>charges</b> might not be swept out before turning off the MOSFET. Therefore, the body diode might be subjected to the dv/dt stress when it is not yet capable of blocking reverse voltage. Also not able to maintain the ZVS operation at low load will force the on-state MOSFET to turn off at hard-switching condition. Like in the hard-switched full bridge topology, the cdv/dt shootthrough current might produce a voltage spike at the gate of the off-state MOSFET on the same leg and cause devices failure. Several silicon technologies will be presented to resolve the abovementioned failure modes in the ZVS topology. Fast <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> time and better dv/dt ruggedness make this new MOSFET technology suitable for higher frequency ZVS full-bridge applications. Inherent with extremely high silicon density and low gate charge, these new MOSFETs can reduce the component count with the same or better performance and will enable much higher power density for the next generation telecom/server SMPS designs.

40|$|Abstract. The 4 H-SiC Schottky barrier diodes {{for high}} {{temperature}} operation over 200 oC {{have been developed}} using buried grids formed by implantation. Compared to a conventional JBS-type SBD with surface grid (SG), JBS-type SBD with buried grid (BG) has significantly reduced leakage current at reverse bias due to a better field shielding of the Schottky contact. By introducing the BG technology, the 1. 7 kV diodes with an anode area 0. 0024 cm 2 (1 A) and 0. 024 cm 2 (10 A) were successfully fabricated, encapsulated in TO 220 packages, and electrically evaluated.

These devices, specifically high-power thyristors and diodes, offer the advantages of improved energy efficiency, reduced volume, and reduced auxiliaries over spark-gaps and ignitrons. Proper application of these devices requires understanding of their behavior both during forward conduction and during reverse recovery. The semiconductor device models available in most circuit simulation software packages do not accurately characterize large power thyristors and diodes for thermal management and snubber design.

30|$|In fact, it is {{reported}} that the reverse recovery effect should be mainly from the parasitic inductance and interface trapping of SBDs [25, 26]. Considering that the contribution of parasitic inductance is characterized {{in the form of}} oscillation current which is not obviously observed in these reverse recovery curves, thus, the changing of reverse recovery time and <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>charge</b> should have resulted from the traps [27, 28]. Since the concentration of traps is uniform in vertical SBDs, the Qrr would depend on the contact area of the device and finally increase with the electrode area as shown in Fig.  6. Thus, the traps act as an electric field stopper in the interface. During the ta period, the delay was strongly influenced by carrier trapping in the Schottky junction, while in the tb period, reverse recovery speed is also slowed by the time for sweeping the stored charge out of the junction. These results are consistent with our previous report [29], which suggested the RC time constant increases with the increase of device diameter and shows a good dependency with the reverse recovery time. And a further improvement of reverse recovery characteristics could be expected from a smaller electrode or thinner drift layer in these devices.|$|E
30|$|Meanwhile, {{since the}} ohmic contact {{technique}} has been continuously explored to improve device performance in many published papers [18], heavily doped n-type GaN {{is a key}} link for fabricating nitride devices. Lately, Ge is proposed {{as an alternative to}} Si dopant in GaN, because both of them share a similar characteristic of shallow level impurity (the activation energy is reported to be 20 and 17 [*]meV for Ge and Si, respectively) and the lattice distortion caused by Ge atoms substituting into Ga sites would be smaller owing to their closer ionic radii [19, 20]. The Ge doping is believed to form a smoother surface with fewer defects [21, 22]. Moreover, with the lower lattice distortion and film stress, this doping also shows a promise in high-temperature electronic devices that put more emphasis on the thermal stability. Although the Ge-doped GaN has been studied theoretically, it is essential to investigate the real impact on the relevant device. In this paper, the novel vertical GaN SBDs fabricated on Ge-doped free-standing (FS) GaN substrate are proposed. The vertical GaN SBDs exhibit a superior crystal quality and electronic property.

The same rectifiers {{are used to}} charge a number of batteries which serve as a backup power source in case of power outage or failure of rectifiers. However, the stored energy in the backup batteries is not utilized efficiently due to reliable source of power from the mains. Therefore, the industry is demanding a highly efficient PFC converter with bidirectional power flow. Significant improvement has been observed {{in the performance of}} power converters since the existence of wide band gap (WBG) devices in the power electronics industry. WBG devices provide high breakdown voltage and high thermal conductivity which enable to produce a more efficient and higher power density converter. In this master thesis, a novel bidirectional PFC converter with totem pole topology is presented for energy storage application. The totem pole topology employs two fast WBG switches and another two slow but very low on-resistance Si MOSFET switches. Since the current is not flowing through the body diode of power MOSFETs the reverse recovery dissipation of the active switches are significantly reduced. The proposed topology provides high PF with minimum input current harmonics, high efficiency and high power density. A literature review on wide band gap devices such as SiC and GaN has been done. The dual benefits of low on-resistance and <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>charge</b> from GaN enhance the performance of the totem pole topology, especially in terms of efficiency.

In a p-n diode, the <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> time {{can be in the}} order of several microseconds to less than 100 ns for fast diodes. Schottky diodes do not have a recovery time, as there is nothing to recover from (i.e., there is no charge carrier depletion region at the junction). The switching time is ~100 ps for the small-signal diodes, and up to tens of nanoseconds for special high-capacity power diodes. With p-n-junction switching, there is also a <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> current, which in high-power semiconductors brings increased EMI noise. With Schottky diodes, switching is essentially [...] "instantaneous" [...] with only a slight capacitive loading, which is much less of a concern.|$|R
40|$|Short <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> {{time of a}} p-n {{junction}} is critical for high speed semiconductor device operation. This time period {{is a result of}} recombination processes when a {{p-n junction}} is switched from forward bias to reverse bias. Minority carrier lifetime is the major parameter determining the duration of <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery.</b> Three main poly-types of Silicon Carbide (SiC) including 4 H-SiC, 6 H-SiC and 3 C-SiC were examined. Vanadium impurity defects in three SiC poly-types are considered with fixed capture cross section and defect density. Vanadium has deep level defect states in SiC and as such is active as a recombination center. The study finds that <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> time depend not only on the ratio between the magnitude of forward and reverse current, but also on temperature and the comparison between forward voltage versus the gap between the impurity level and the middle of band gap...|$|R
