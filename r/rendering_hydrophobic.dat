40|$|Abstract Background Curcumin, {{a yellow}} {{polyphenol}} {{extracted from the}} rhizome of turmeric (Curcuma longa), has potent anti-cancer properties as demonstrated in a plethora of human cancer cell line and animal carcinogenesis models. Nevertheless, widespread clinical application of this relatively efficacious agent in cancer and other diseases has been limited due to poor aqueous solubility, and consequently, minimal systemic bioavailability. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery approaches {{have the potential for}} <b>rendering</b> <b>hydrophobic</b> agents like curcumin dispersible in aqueous media, thus circumventing the pitfalls of poor solubility. Results We have synthesized polymeric nanoparticle encapsulated formulation of curcumin – nanocurcumin – utilizing the micellar aggregates of cross-linked and random copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM), with N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (VP) and poly(ethyleneglycol) monoacrylate (PEG-A). Physico-chemical characterization of the polymeric nanoparticles by dynamic laser light scattering and transmission electron microscopy confirms a narrow size distribution in the 50 nm range. Nanocurcumin, unlike free curcumin, is readily dispersed in aqueous media. Nanocurcumin demonstrates comparable in vitro therapeutic efficacy to free curcumin against a panel of human pancreatic cancer cell lines, as assessed by cell viability and clonogenicity assays in soft agar. Further, nanocurcumin's mechanisms of action on pancreatic cancer cells mirror that of free curcumin, including induction of cellular apoptosis, blockade of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activation, and downregulation of steady state levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNFα). Conclusion Nanocurcumin provides an opportunity to expand the clinical repertoire of this efficacious agent by enabling ready aqueous dispersion. Future studies utilizing nanocurcumin are warranted in pre-clinical in vivo models of cancer and other diseases that might benefit from the effects of curcumin. </p...|$|E

Using silane self-assembled monolayers, SiO 2 substrates are <b>rendered</b> <b>hydrophobic</b> and provide a strong slip rather than a no-slip solid/liquid boundary condition. On undergoing these changes, the thin-film breakup morphology changes dramatically – from a spinodal mechanism to a breakup which is governed by nucleation and growth.

The combination of lowered surface energy and hydrodynamic slip brings the studied system closer to the conditions encountered in bursting unsupported films. As for unsupported polymer films, a critical nucleus size is inferred from a free energy model.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a summary and {{discussion}} of four papers, mainly dealing with reactions at the ZnS/water interface. The main analysis method has been spectroscopy. In mineral concentration plants valuable minerals are <b>rendered</b> <b>hydrophobic</b> {{by the action of}} certain surface active molecules, so called collectors. Other molecules, depressors, are used to prevent the collectors from acting also on the less desirable minerals. Even if many potent reagents are available the selectivity is not always satisfying. To design new, selective molecules an understanding of the fundamental reactions at the ZnS/water interface is essential. The acidic and alkaline sites of Zns have been identified by FI-IR spectroscopy. The dependence of stoichiometry and pH has been determined. Adsorption onto ZnS of one common collector, amyl xanthate, one potential collector, thionalide an one depressor has been investigated.

In both cases, the forces were purely attractive, stronger than van der Waals, and of long-range, as previously reported, {{with those of the}} asymmetric, hydrophobic–hydrophilic system being even stronger and of longer range. Atomic force microscopy images of these surfaces show that the monolayers transform into patchy bilayers when the surfaces are immersed in water, and that the resulting surfaces contain large micrometer-sized regions of positive charges (bilayer) and negative charges (bare mica) while remaining overall neutral. The natural alignment of oppositely charged domains as two such surfaces approach would result in a long-range electrostatic attraction in water, but the short-range, “truly hydrophobic” interaction is not explained by these results...|$|R

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to fabricate patterned arrays of micrometer-sized monodisperse solid particles of ammonium nitrate on hydrophobic silicon surfaces using inkjet printing. The method relies on dispensing one or more microdrops of a concentrated aqueous ammonium nitrate solution from a drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet printer at specific locations on a silicon substrate <b>rendered</b> <b>hydrophobic</b> by a perfluorodecytrichlorosilane monolayer coating.

The use of DOD inkjet printing for fabrication of discrete particle arrays allows for precise control of particle characteristics (mass, diameter and height), as well as the particle number and spatial distribution on the substrate. The final mass of an individual particle is precisely determined by using gravimetric measurement of the average mass of solution ejected per microdrop.

40|$|The strong {{attraction}} between hydrophobic moieties in aqueous solutions {{has been}} a topic of much interest due to {{the significance of the}} interaction in biological and industrial processes. In recent years, the attraction {{has been a}}ttributed to the nanobubble bridging mechanism, the so called nanobubble bridging capillary force (NBCF). In this paper, atomic force microscopy was used to show that hydrophobic solid surgaces can repel each other due to the NBCF between a silica colloidal probe and a silica wafer <b>rendered</b> <b>hydrophobic</b> by esterification. Nanobubbles were produced on the solid surfaces by the solvent-exchange and surface scanning method. In pure water a strong, long range attractive force with a single jump in step was measured, typical of an interaction between two nanobubbles attached to the hydrophobic surfaces. The attaraction was found to reduce with increasing ethanol concentration, changing to repulsion at ethanol concentratins above 40 % by mass. A capillary bridge model with constant bridge volume and changing contact angle due to line tension was developed to explain the change in the interaction force with ethanol concentration. The reduced attraction at small separation distances common with the NBCF is explained by the decrease contact angel due to line tension.

The latter permits one to compute the intradomain vector pair correlation function of the particle centers, from which they can accurately determine the lattice spacing and the coherent domain size. From these data the gap between the particles in the coherent domains can be determined {{as a function of the}} thiol chain length.

It was found that, in all extracts, a continuous layer of saline adjacent to the adsorbed surface would break up spontaneously to expose dry surface when the thickness was reduced to an average of 764 micron, corresponding to several alveolar diameters. This phenomenon is discussed as a possible means of establishing dry patches on the alveolar membrane, especially in the new-born after the fetal alveolar wall has been exposed to the same surfactants in much the same physical form as found in amniotic fluid.

40|$|Epoxy-based polymer (EP) {{membrane}} with 3 D bicontinuous {{skeleton structure}} was firstly processed into tubular membrane {{and used in}} membrane emulsification for water-in-oil (W/O) microspheres. Since uniform MO microspheres have not been obtained using shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane unless SPG membrane was <b>rendered</b> <b>hydrophobic</b> by treatment with silanes, it is desired to find a hydrophobic polymer membrane which is capable of providing uniform W/O microspheres. To testify the feasibility of EP membrane in membrane emulsification, uniform agarose (coefficient variation (CV) 11. 8 %) and Ca-alginate (CV= 11. 4 %) microspheres were achieved with EP membrane by direct and premix membrane emulsification, respectively. In comparison with SPG membrane, EP membrane showed good performance in whether direct or premix membrane emulsification {{in terms of the}} droplets size distribution and stability of membranes due to its narrow pore size distribution and uniform hydrophobic surface. SPG membrane is chemically unstable and dissolves under basic aqueous condition. However, it was found that EP membrane could tolerate 1 M NaOH aqueous solution for at least one week and keep its stable hydrophobic surface. Hence, EP membrane could be used in alkali condition, which enables to extend the range of applications in membrane emulsification. So EP membrane had huge potential in further preparation of MO emulsions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. </p...|$|R
