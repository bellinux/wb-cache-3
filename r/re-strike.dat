40|$|Switching of shunt {{reactors}} and {{capacitor banks}} {{is known to}} cause a very high rate of rise of transient recovery voltage across the circuit breaker contacts. With improvements in circuit breaker technology, modern SF 6 puffer circuits have been designed with less interrupter per pole than previous generations of SF 6 circuit breakers. This has caused modern circuit breakers to operate with higher voltage stress in the dielectric recovery region after current interruption. Catastrophic failures of modern SF 6 circuit breakers have been reported during shunt reactor and capacitor bank de-energisation. In those cases, evidence of cumulative <b>re-strikes</b> {{has been found to}} be the main cause of interrupter failure. Monitoring of voltage waveforms during switching would provide information about the magnitude and frequency of small re-ignitions and <b>re-strikes.</b> However, measuring waveforms at a moderately high frequency require plant outages to connect equipment. In recent years, there have been increasing interests in using RF measurements in condition monitoring of switchgear. The RF measurement technique used for measuring circuit breaker inter-pole switching time during capacitor bank closing is of particular interest. In this thesis, research has been carried out to investigate switching transients produced during circuit breaker switching capacitor banks and shunt reactors using a non-intrusive measurement technique. The proposed technique measures the high frequency and low frequency voltage waveforms during switching operations without the need of an outage. The principles of this measurement technique are discussed and field measurements were carried out at shunt rector and capacitor bank installation in two 275 kV air insulated substations. Results of the measurements are presented and discussed in this thesis. The proposed technique shows that it is relatively easy to monitor circuit breaker switching transients and useful information on switching instances can be extracted from the measured waveforms.

To achieve this, the major point {{is to build a}} knowledge foundation regarding: - available information and how to get the right information, - existing equipment and - methods used for analysis. In this study are used fault records and other data relevant to fault analysis obtained from the utility. All data is recorded in a program called OSCOP (Siemens. 1999 : 2). To analyze it with signal decomposition method we have to convert these analogue recordings into a standard data format called Comtrade (IEEE 1991 : 3). The derivation of the signal decomposition method is presented in the dissertation. A number of real-life records are used for testing and verification. In the short circuit examples, the parameters of fundamental frequency and exponentially decaying DC offset have been calculated with high accuracy. We have tested the method in the analysis of inrush currents present in the system during transformer energization process. Very accurate power swing frequencies are calculated using the voltage signal recorded during a major disturbance in the utility Transmission Network. An excellent example in using the proposed method is the estimation of resonant frequencies on the line with shunt reactor compensation. Here the method showed a clear advantage over the existing Discrete Fourier Transform method. Extracted resonant frequencies are in the range 30 Hz to 45 Hz. This information, so far, wasn’t available directly from measurements. The method can play a very important role as a part of automated fault and disturbance analysis.

40|$|During {{switching}} of disconnectors (DS) in GIS a varying {{number of}} pre-strikes and <b>re-strikes</b> occur. Due {{to the very}} short duration of the voltage collapse, traveling surges are generated in the busbar duct. These very fast transient overvoltages (VFTO) can become the limiting dielectric stress which defines the dimensions at UHV voltage levels. The decision shall {{be based on the}} maximum VFTO peak value that occurs with reference to the rated lightning impulse withstand voltage (LIWV) of the equipment. If the maximum VFTO is higher than the LIWV, it is necessary to consider the VFTO level as dimensioning criteria or to suppress VFTO by suitable measures. The main challenges are the reduction in VFTO amplitudes and finally the reduction of the effects of VFTO on the equipment. For the different sources of VFTO and for the different equipment different mitigation methods are known. The damping of VFTO by integration of a damping resistor is a well proven technology. The way to overcome the drawback of such unwieldy designs is to use other internal damping measures. Several methods have been proposed and examined in the past, such as ferrite material or high frequency (RF) resonators. The VFTO damping solution utilizing ferrite rings has been analysed and tested and will be described here. The measurements show that a damping effect can be achieved, but with an important drawback: the magnetic material goes easily into saturation, which complicates the design and reduces its general applicability and robustness. A new approach for damping is to implement compact electromagnetic high-frequency resonators with low quality factor specially designed to cover a wider frequency range. The novelty of this idea is not only to design the resonators but also to dissipate the VFTO energy. The VFTO damping effect of the developed RF resonator tuned to the dominant harmonic component was confirmed by experiments.

40|$|Electricity is a {{necessity}} of the modern life due to its everywhere usage. Its proper continuity depends on {{the reliability of the}} equipments used in power system. The transformer is one of the basic components which are commonly used in the power system, generation, transmission or distribution. Its high cost and difficult maintenance highlights its importance in power system. Proper protection is necessary to protect this costly equipment from any damage. Therefore, surge arresters are installed near to the transformer to protect from high voltages. However, during lightning and switching of circuit breakers, <b>re-strikes</b> and pre-strikes during opening and closing of a circuit breaker may lead to a broad band frequency spectrum of overvoltages. Such overvoltages may have an oscillating character and lower amplitude at the transformer terminals. In addition they may arrive at the transformer input without any changes in amplitude and waveform so the surge arrestor will not able to detect any overvoltages near the terminals {{as well as at the}} input sides.. If the oscillating frequency component of the external overvoltage is equal to the natural frequency of the windings, then the magnitude of the internal resonance overvoltage has its maximum value. Therefore, overvoltages generated in transients and switching stages in electrical power equipment may be dangerous for the insulating system despite the applied overvoltage protection. The resonance frequencies for transformer winding have been experimentally determined. The frequency band taken into account was between 10 Hz and 10 MHz, in addition the band has been divided into lower frequency band (10 Hz- 200 KHz) and higher frequency band (200 KHz- 10 MHz). Then applying sinusoidal waves with the resonance frequencies, voltage stresses on different nodes along the winding have been located. From these voltages stressed nodes it was concluded that the stressed nodes are shifting from centre of the winding towards the upper part of the winding as from lower to higher resonance frequencies. After that the voltage distribution at different resonance frequencies was analyzed. At lower frequency band, the voltage stress between turn to ground in terms of standing wave was observed whereas at higher frequency band inter layer stress was the concluded result. Voltage stress on different nodes under wider frequency was also investigated where the same behavior was seen. Step responses were also applied at the input to investigate the resonance frequencies and their voltage stressed along the length of the windings. Finally the results for sinusoidal wave and step response were compared...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work is mainly concerned {{about dealing with}} temporary short circuit faults in power system transmission lines. In fact, {{there are two types}} of electrical faults in power systems, namely temporary and permanent. When a fault is permanent, the only way to clear it is to de-energize the transmission line by opening the associated circuit breakers. However, in many cases the fault is not solid and is caused by objects such as flying birds or broken branches of trees. For these cases, electrical arc plays a major role. For such fault cases, it is also possible to de-energize the faulted phase, temporarily, and re-energize it after a short delay by reclosing the opened circuit breakers. This operation is called single-phase reclosing. There is a chance that the fault becomes clear by natural extinction of the arc after the faulted phase isolation in case the fault is temporary. There are two considerable challenges regarding traditional single-phase reclosing in transmission lines. The first challenge is the determination of the fault type, i. e., permanent or temporary, as there is no guarantee that the fault is temporary. This is crucially important as reclosing-on-fault, i. e., reclosing the opened breakers while the fault still stands, is harmful for both power system stability and power system equipment. The second challenge which is regarding temporary faults only, is that there is still no guarantee that the arc is extinguished by the moment of reclosing. In such cases, reclosing leads in <b>re-striking</b> of arc and therefore, an unsuccessful reclosing. This {{research work}} is conducted in two phases. At the first phase, two adaptive methods are developed to improve the traditional reclosing method upon the two challenges mentioned in the second paragraph. The developed methods are capable of recognition of the fault type in a reasonable amount of time after single-phase isolation of the line. Therefore, the protection system will be able to block the reclosing function in case the fault is recognized as permanent and to issue three-phase-trip signal as the next action. For temporary faults, re-energizing of the isolated phase by reclosing the opened breakers is the next action which has to be performed after the arc extinction. The developed methods also have the capability of detection of the arc extinction and therefore, a better performance for temporary fault cases is guaranteed. This is the second feature required for an adaptive reclosing method. The second phase of the research project is to estimate the arc extinction time well in advance in case the fault is temporary. The idea is that three-phase tripping could be the right action if the arc extinction time is too long as working under unbalanced conditions for an unnecessarily long time duration is harmful for the power system. Both of the proposed adaptive single-phase reclosing methods in this research work employ local voltage information. Therefore, communication facilities are not needed for implementation of the proposed methods. It is shown in the thesis that the proposed methods are able to quickly detect the fault type and also the arc extinction if the fault is temporary. Also, the two proposed arc extinction time prediction methods are capable of prediction of the arc extinction time well in advance and with acceptable precision. All four proposed methods are effective for various system configurations including ideally-transposed, untransposed and partially-transposed transmission lines and also for transmission lines with different compensation conditions including with and without shunt reactor. Superior performance of the proposed methods have been verified using 550 case studies simulated in PSCAD and Matlab, and also a field recorded temporary fault case associated with a 765 kV transmission line. The 550 simulated case studies include 100 ideally-transposed, 240 untransposed and 210 partially-transposed line cases. The performances of the two proposed reclosing methods are also compared with two of the existing adaptive reclosing methods where considerable improvements are observed...|$|R

The phenomenon of electric arcing in such dc systems, arising {{due to the}} absence of zero crossing of current during normal operation, has impeded the widespread proliferation of dc-based technologies in the market. Considering the advantages presented by adopting dc over the ac systems in terms of efficiency and compatibility with renewable energy, it is of great interest to remove any such impediments involved in developing a mature, viable and sophisticated dc system. In context of low voltage dc microgrids, a novel arc detection method has been proposed and validated through simulations as well as real time experiments. It is shown that the detection scheme is able to rapidly and selectively identify series arcing by solely monitoring the load side voltage. The boundaries associated with threshold trigger voltage selection and detection time are defined based on varied circuit configurations. The algorithm is designed to be tolerant to the grid side voltage fluctuations in order to avoid spurious triggering. In context of arc characterization in high voltage dc systems, the bus transfer facilitated by GIS disconnector is studied. Analytical expression for recovery and <b>re-strike</b> voltage is derived to enable their estimation from the measurable space variables of the experimental set-up. The simulation model emulating the experimental set-up and the parameter estimation methodology is developed and validated. By varying the configurable parameters like initial capacitor voltage, switching frequency and source inductances, the possible recovery voltages across the disconnector is simulated.

40|$|Abstract. Springback or shape {{change has}} been one of the major {{challenges}} in sheet metal fabrication, particularly with increase application of high strength steel (HSS) and aluminum alloys in automotive stamping. Springback, an elastic material recovery after the unloading of stamping tools, causes variations and inconsistencies of final part dimensions. Minor or mild springback usually can be corrected in the <b>re-strike</b> process. Excessive springback must be corrected so the part will be produced within the given design tolerance and dimension. The commonly used Spring Forward approaches and shape compensations such as over-crown and over-bending are proven effective to alleviate excessive springback. To enhance these approaches, a new strategy of Die Face Engineering (DFE) based processing is proposed to quickly and easily to achieve the maximum allowable compensation using the under cut (or die lock) as the primary criteria. The implementation of the die face compensation through iterative FEA calculation, automatic surface mapping, projection and manual morphing are crucial to meet production environment requirements in terms of generating NC quality CAD surfaces of the compensated or morphed die face. In this paper, the strategy of the die face compensation with the consideration of the under cut criteria is presented.

40|$|Capacitor {{banks are}} {{installed}} in {{an increasing number}} {{in order to control}} power quality issues in the transmission and distribution networks. Due to load fluctuation, switching of capacitor banks is normally a daily operation. Although the current to be switched (e. g. the normal load current) is far below the maximum capability of circuit breakers, the transient current upon making (the so-called inrush current) {{has proven to be a}} major challenge for circuit breakers. The often very high value of (inrush) current flowing during the closing (pre-) arc between breaker contacts is potentially harmful for the contact system. The IEC circuit breaker 62271 - 100 standard specifies 20 kA peak while energizing (an) additional bank(s) to those already energized, the so-called back-to-back configuration. It will be demonstrated that three-phase energization with full inrush current cannot be reliably performed in test-circuits. Statistics will be presented on the number of (transmission, distribution) circuit breakers that were tested for this duty. The probability of a late breakdown in vacuum, after energization with inrush current, is rising with rated voltage. Absence of late breakdown of vacuum interrupters after capacitive current switching is especially challenging at higher voltage levels, and is a main barrier to develop vacuum interrupters for transmission voltages having very low probability of <b>re-strike.</b> It was observed that in SF 6 circuit breakers, the very intense pre-arc can damage the nozzle, whereas in vacuum circuit breakers, the inrush current arc may deteriorate the dielectric withstand of the switching gap, sometime leading to (late) breakdown after load current interruption. A new measurement method is described to monitor the field electron emission (FEE) current that flows in a pulsating manner in vacuum gaps after current interruption. This measurement system is able to deal (and measure) currents varying as wide as nine decades, from full breakdown currents of several tens of kA to FEE currents of tens of µA). Research tests in full-power test-circuits (following the IEC standard) with a number of prototype vacuum interrupters of different geometry and contact material show a very large range (from micro-amperes to milli-amperes) of current during recovery voltage after load current interruption. It was observed that the load current at longer arcing times reduces the electrical emission activity of the contact surfaces. Large inrush current increases the FEE current. No relationship between steady state FEE current intensity and breakdown probability could be established...|$|E
40|$|Spinosad aerosol has {{undergone}} extensive field testing to confirm its efficacy {{for the treatment}} of blowfly strike and the prevention of subsequent <b>re-strike</b> in sheep. Spinosad aerosol has been tested in 22 field efficacy studies on 331 sheep with fly strike. Of the 332 strikes treated, 319 resolved after treatment with spinosad aerosol, representing > 96 % cure rate, and only 12 treated strike sites (3. 6 %) were subsequently re-struck. The mean dose of spinosad delivered per strike was 191. 37 mg (range= 18. 4 - 426. 7 mg), while the mean dose per cm 2 was 6 mg (range= 0. 1 – 80 mg). Strike wounds ranged in size from 0. 1 cm 2 to 63 cm 2 with a mean of 42. 5 cm 2. Field efficacy data was supported by implant studies. In the first implant study, sheep (n= 14) were implanted with 300 recently hatched larvae of Lucilia cuprina at 4 sites 2 days before treatment. Immediately before treatment, 2 of the strikes were shorn leaving 1 cm wool over the strikes. On each sheep, a shorn and unshorn site was treated with spinosad aerosol at 2 doses delivering approximately 4 mg or 20 mg spinosad, and larval viability was assessed at 3 h and 24 h post-treatment. Each site was re-implanted with larvae at 1, 3, 8, 15 and 22 days post-treatment and larval viability assessed 24 h after implantation. The high dose of spinosad protected against re-infestation for 22 days, while the low dose provided 100 % protection against infestation in short wool, but only 64 % protection in unshorn strikes. In a similar study (n= 20), spinosad aerosol was applied to implanted sites at 2 doses (approximately 2 mg and 11 mg per strike). Of the 20 implanted sites for each treatment, spinosad successfully killed all maggots at all sites at the high dose, and at 19 sites at the low dose. Spinosad treatment at both doses prevented the establishment of implants for 7 days after treatment. By 14 days post-treatment, spinosad at the low dose was 100 % effective at preventing re-infestation, while the high dose prevented re-infestation in 85 % of sites. Spinosad aerosol is a highly efficacious treatment for L. cuprina myiasis in sheep and inhibits subsequent restrike for up to 22 days...|$|E
40|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} (PM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} cost effective methods for manufacturing structural components with complex shapes. Utilisation of the metal powder to shape the components allows to minimise material waste and increase energy efficiency. However, with the increased usage of PM parts in high performance applications, there is a demand for components with properties that can withstand extreme loading conditions and are equivalent or better than the properties of their wrought counterparts. The PM steels fabricated with press and sinter, even with all its advantages have limitations due to the presence of residual porosity. Hence, reaching full density is necessary to meet the high performance demands. The scope of this study covers different approaches of powder consolidation with the aim of reaching near full density. Liquid phase sintering and double pressing-double sintering approach for water atomised powders, high velocity compaction approach for agglomerated gas atomised powders, and finally additive manufacturing approach to produce samples with almost full density were utilised. These approaches were complimented by capsule free hot isostatic pressing (HIP) to reach full density and improve component performance. The liquid phase sintering approach utilised is based on addition of Ni-Mn-B master alloy for enhanced sintering and densification. The results obtained clearly indicated that the master alloy addition effectively enhances the densification process through the liquid phase generation. The mechanical properties were improved when boron content was optimised from 0. 2 to 0. 12 wt. %. Density levels up to 98 % were realised after sintering with addition of this master alloy. In the double pressing-double sintering process, cylindrical and gear samples, fabricated from water atomised powder, prealloyed with Mo were studied. The studies included the comparison of using both standard and fine (< 63 µm) powder for the compacts investigated. The process route provides pore free surface and full density is then realised by means of subsequent HIP after second sintering. Fine powder shows better densification but the density variation after the first pressing persists as a low density region in the middle of the compact, i. e. at the neutral zone. Hence, optimisation during first pressing is necessary in order to avoid this phenomenon. High velocity compaction (HVC) is a means of tailored densification. There is an industrial processing route that takes advantage of this effect, involving conventional pressing of agglomerated gas-atomised powder and sintering followed by HVC <b>re-strike</b> and hot isostatic pressing for reaching full density. In this study, the said approach was evaluated for agglomerated alloyed tool steel powder type 100 Cr 6 when processed to reach almost full density of about 99. 5 % relative density. The additive manufacturing approach includes the assessment of material fabricated by means of electron beam melting (EBM), involving both solid and shell samples from Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder. The studies showed that either samples were printed solid or as shells filled with powder, the subsequent HIP led to full densification. Furthermore, good bonding between the shell and the interior material was obtained after HIP. The above presented approaches all represent ways of achieving full density. Based on the analysis of the different methods it can be concluded that the combination of the tailored alloy concepts and consolidation techniques allows manufacturing complex-shaped full-density components for high-performance applications...|$|E
