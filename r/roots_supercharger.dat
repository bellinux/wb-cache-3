5000|$|Pressing the {{throttle}} pedal fully engaged the <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger,</b> inducing the five litre straight-eight engine to produce up to [...] {{and making the}} car capable of over 160 km/h, while consuming fuel {{at the rate of}} up to 30 l/100 km as it did so.|$|E
50|$|The Type 35C {{featured}} a <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger,</b> despite Ettore Bugatti's disdain for forced induction. Output was nearly 128 hp (95 kW) {{with a single}} Zenith carburettor. Type 35Cs won the French Grand Prix at Saint-Gaudens in 1928, and at Pau in 1930. Fifty examples left the factory.|$|E
50|$|It {{was closely}} {{derived from the}} Tipo 26 with the same steel ladder-type frame and a similar {{aluminum}} two-seater bodywork. The main difference was in the inline-8 engine being enlarged to 2-litres, otherwise it still featured a crankshaft-driven <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger,</b> twin gear-driven overhead camshafts and dry sump lubrication. Two engines were rebored to 2.1-litres.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotary screw}} {{compressor}} has low leakage levels and low parasitic losses vs. <b>Roots</b> type. The <b>supercharger</b> is typically driven directly from the engine's crankshaft via a belt or gear drive. Unlike the <b>Roots</b> type <b>supercharger,</b> the twin-screw exhibits internal compression which {{is the ability of}} the device to compress air within the housing as it is moved through the device instead of relying upon resistance to flow downstream of the discharge to establish an increase of pressure.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "blower" [...] is {{commonly}} used to define a device placed on engines with a functional need for additional airflow using a direct mechanical link as its energy source. The term blower is used to describe different types of superchargers. A screw type <b>supercharger,</b> <b>Roots</b> type <b>supercharger,</b> and a centrifugal supercharger are all types of blowers. Conversely, a turbocharger, using exhaust compression to spin its turbine, and not a direct mechanical link, is not generally regarded as a [...] "blower" [...] but simply a [...] "turbo".|$|R
50|$|The rebuilds {{included}} new cabs, Dash 2 electronics, ZTR {{traction control}} equipment, EMD 645E engines from 1502s and {{the replacement of}} the <b>roots</b> blower <b>supercharger</b> with a turbocharger. They were also ballasted to 110 t as they only operate on heavy coal trains.|$|R
50|$|Because {{they were}} {{primarily}} built for racing, these cars typically had the engine swapped {{to a larger}} or more powerful one, or the existing stock engine modified (often heavily). It was very common to fit a <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger</b> modified from original use on General Motors two-cycle diesel truck engines and mechanical fuel injection, manufactured by Algon, Hilborn, or Crower.|$|E
5000|$|The straight-8 {{cylinder}} {{engine of}} the 500K was enlarged in displacement to , It was fed by twin pressurized updraft carburetors, developing a [...] In addition, there was an attached <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger,</b> which could either be engaged manually for short periods, or automatically when the accelerator was pushed fully to the floor. This increased power to , enabling {{a top speed of}} 170 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|The Holden Efijy is {{a concept}} car created in Australia by Holden. It pays tribute to the Holden FJ, the second model built by Holden. The concept {{is based on the}} Chevrolet Corvette floor pan, a 6.0 litre V8 engine with <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger</b> putting out [...] at a little shy of 6500 r.p.m. It rides on an air {{suspension}} system that lowers the car when the car is stopped, and also has electronic instrumentation including a multi-use display screen that disappears into the dash.|$|E
50|$|In 1900, Gottlieb Daimler, of Daimler-Benz (Daimler AG), was {{the first}} to patent a forced-induction system for {{internal}} combustion engines, superchargers based on the twin-rotor air-pump design, first patented by the American Francis Marion Roots in 1860, the basic design for the modern <b>Roots</b> type <b>supercharger.</b>|$|R
50|$|The AE92 Levin and Trueno {{were also}} {{fitted with a}} {{supercharged}} engine. It used an SC12 <b>roots</b> type <b>supercharger</b> and a top mounted intercooler that was fed cool air via a scoop on the bonnet. They generated 206 Nm at 4400 rpm {{as opposed to the}} naturally aspirated 4A-GE's 136 Nm at 4,800 rpm.|$|R
50|$|All 2.0 L (1,969 cc) petrol engines have a bore of 82 mm and {{a stroke}} of 93.2 mm with a {{compression}} ratio of 10.3:1. All engines are turbocharged and intercooled with direct injection. More powerful versions are equipped with a <b>roots</b> type <b>supercharger</b> {{in addition to being}} turbocharged and intercooled.All engines come with an electric water pump and balancer shafts.|$|R
50|$|Peter Westbury, an {{engineer}} from Surrey, England, competed in hillclimbing events in cars powered by Daimler V8 engines. Between {{the end of}} the 1962 RAC Hillclimb Championship season, in which he finished seventh in a V8-powered Cooper, {{and the beginning of the}} 1963 season, Westbury built a new hillclimbing special called the Felday-Daimler powered by a 2.5-litre Daimler V8 with a 2 in SU carburettor and a <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger.</b> Westbury won the 1963 RAC Hillclimb Championship in the Felday-Daimler, setting course records at Craigantlet in Ulster and Dyrham Park in Gloucestershire.|$|E
5000|$|Homologation {{requirement}} for Group B rally necessitated, at minimum, 200 certified, verifiable road-going {{examples of the}} vehicle archetype Lancia presented to FiA, for which to contest the international world rally championship. The road-going 037 variant was equipped an Abarth developed 16-valve four-cylinder in-line 2000 cc engine, mated to an Abarth Volumex <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger</b> developing [...] capable of pushing the 037 to over 220 km/h and reaching 100 km/h from a standstill in less than seven seconds. Pininfarina production records show 220 cars built under the 'Montecarlo Corsa' name.|$|E
5000|$|For the 2001 model year, {{the engine}} design was {{slightly}} altered to produce [...] @ 4,750 rpm and [...] @ 3,250 rpm. Also, the previously leaky intercooler was redesigned. This problem was addressed as a recall in earlier models. A cast iron block was {{used instead of}} aluminum. These upgrades were critical {{in order to support}} the 8 psi (0.55 bar) of boost delivered from the stock Eaton M112 <b>roots</b> <b>supercharger.</b> Another engine revision came in the 2003 Model Year when a weakness in the heads, the lack of sufficient threads for spark plugs, was addressed and fixed, although [...] "piston slap", a mild knocking noise while the engine is cold, was still present. At {{the other end of the}} drivetrain, the final drive ratio was shortened to 3.73:1 with a 9.75 inch rear end in 2001. Also, in 2001 the drive shaft was increased in size to a 4.5 in aluminum unit, from the previous 3.5 in steel unit. The specially developed 295/45ZR-18 Goodyear Eagle F1-GS unidirectional tires were upgraded utilizing a new generation F1 GS rubber compound. With these engine and drivetrain revisions, Car and Driver magazine drove a Lightning from zero to 60 mi/h km/h in 5.2 seconds. For 2003, the Lightning's cargo capacity was raised from 800 lb to 1350 lb.|$|E
5000|$|The rebuilds {{included}} new cabs, Dash 2 {{electronics and}} {{the replacement of}} the <b>roots</b> blower <b>supercharger</b> with a turbocharger. In 2007 seven (2356, 2349, 2361, 2370, 2372, 2373 and 2374) were allocated to Queensland Rail's Australian Railroad Group subsidiary and transferred to Western Australia where they were re-numbered as DFZ2401-DFZ2407.currently only DFZ2405 is operational with all other class members in storage (Forresfield) ...|$|R
5000|$|The W07 {{version of}} the 770 was powered by an inline eight-cylinder engine of [...] {{capacity}} with an overhead camshaft and aluminium pistons. [...] This engine produced [...] at 2800 rpm without <b>supercharging.</b> An optional <b>Roots</b> type <b>supercharger,</b> which was engaged at full throttle, would raise the output to [...] at 2800 rpm, which could propel the car to 160 km/h. The transmission had four forward ratios, of which third was direct and fourth was an overdrive (mechanics).|$|R
25|$|The 86 Supercharger was {{produced}} by Team Netz with TOM'S is {{a version of the}} Toyota 86 built for the online community Area 86. It included 6-speed manual transmission, <b>roots</b> style <b>supercharger,</b> exclusive ECU, water-cooled intercooler, exclusive muffler, original aero kit, Saten white pearl 37J body panel, TEAM NETZ original front bumper (made by ABS), TOM'S side step, TOM's rear under spoiler, TOM'S ADVOX suspension kit with exclusive setting, TOM'S brake pad and brake line, 8.0J INSET44-inch TWS T66F wheel in original gun metal colour, 225/40R18 Michelin　Pilot Sport 3 tires.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, {{based on}} the S-197 Mustang, Roush {{introduced}} the Sport, Stage 1, and Stage 2 editions. In 2006, the [...] "Stage 3" [...] edition was introduced. The Sport package was the Roush base model, and came with a body kit and high-performance exhaust systems. The Stage 1 came with 18 in chrome wheels and aggressive tires, a high-performance exhaust system, a body kit, and a vast option menu of visual upgrades. The Stage 2 enhanced the Stage 1 by upgrading the stock suspension with high-performance front struts, rear shocks, front and rear springs, front and rear sway bars, and Pinion snubbers. The Stage 3 came with 18 in, forged chrome wheels and high-performance tires, and 14 in rotors with four-piston Stop-Tech produced calipers, in addition to numerous [...] "Stage 3" [...] plaques, custom embroidered leather upholstery, and a custom dash instrument cluster. The Eaton M90 supercharged 4.6 L V8 now had the output of 415 hp (268.4 kW) and 385 ft·lb (521 Nm) with a Roush supercharger and an air-to-water intercooler. The {{top of the line}} was the Stage 3 Mustang, but Roush recognized that many buyers did not want all the features (particularly cosmetic) that the Stage 3 offered, so beginning in 2007, Roush introduced the 427R. The 427R featured the same suspension, power-train, and most of the body-kit of the Stage 3, but it lacked the rear fascia and rectangular exhaust tips of the Stage 1-3 models. It produced an additional 20-horsepower (14.91 kW) and [...] of torque over the Stage 3 Mustang, due to an upgraded ECM (Electronic Control Module). In addition, it was equipped with a [...] "hockey stick stripe" [...] appearance package in lieu of the two racing stripes found on the Sport through Stage 3 models. In 2008, Roush produced the limited edition 428R Mustang (followed by the limited edition 429R Mustang in 2009), which was the same concept as the previous year's 427R, but featured a horizontal nine-bar grille, Sparco captive hood pins, and a chrome supercharger. Four and six-piston brakes were an option on both cars, but not standard. Also, in 2007 and 2008, Roush produced 100 per year of the all-black Blackjack Mustang, and the top shelf P-51A and P-51B mustangs. These cars featured a Vapor Silver / green paint scheme, accented with Satin Silver hood scoop, chin spoiler and rear wing (in a tribute to the P-51 Mustang fighter plane of WW-II). The engine internals were upgraded to a forged rotating assembly, allowing a larger Eaton TVS R2300 <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger.</b> This produced 510 crank horsepower and 510 foot pounds of torque. The difference between the A and B models is the belt drive for the supercharger - the A series uses a single belt, the B series uses a dual-belt system Front-End Accessory Drive (FEAD). Other Roush cars produced in this era were the 2008-only Roush 427R TrakPak, with upgraded suspension components, forged wheels and large APC carbon fiber wing, Roush Drag-Pak Mustangs, and various one-offs for Cooper Tires and certain dealers of Roush products.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the comparative flight {{results of a}} <b>roots</b> <b>supercharger</b> and a turbocentrifugal supercharger. The tests were conducted using a modified DH- 4 M 2 airplane. The rate of climb and the high speed in level flight of the airplane were obtained for each supercharger from sea level to the ceiling. The unsupercharged performance with each supercharger mounted in place was also determined. The results of these tests show that the ceiling and rate of climb obtained were nearly the same for each supercharger, but that the high speed obtained with the turbocentrifugal was better than that obtained with the roots. The high-speed performance at 21, 000 feet was 122 and 142 miles per hour for the roots and turbocentrifugal, respectively...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the suitability of the N. A. C. A. Roots type aircraft engine supercharger to flight-operating conditions, as determined {{the effects of the}} use of the supercharger upon engine operation and airplane performance, is described in this report. Attention was concentrated on the operation of the engine-supercharger unit and on the improvement of climbing ability; some information concerning high speeds at altitude was obtained. The supercharger was found to be satisfactory under flight-operating conditions. Although two failures occurred during the tests, the causes of both were minor and have been eliminated. Careful examination of the engines revealed no detrimental effects which could be attributed to supercharging. Marked improvements in climbing ability and high speeds at altitude were effected. It was also found that the load which could be carried to a given moderate or high altitude in a fixed time was considerably augmented. A slight sacrifice of low-altitude performance was necessitated, however, by the use of a fixed-pitch propeller. From a consideration of the very satisfactory flight performance of the <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger</b> and of its inherent advantages, it is concluded that this type is particularly attractive for use in certain classes of commercial airplanes and in a number of military types...|$|E

These cars were elegant and full of technical innovations. Independent front suspension and the world's first all-synchromesh gearbox came in 1933 followed by servo assisted brakes. The Alvis 12/75 model was introduced in 1928, a model bristling with innovation, such as front-wheel drive, in-board brakes, overhead camshaft and, as an option, a <b>Roots</b> type <b>supercharger.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{compressor}} {{is necessarily}} {{the core of}} the unit. Compressors used for this application are usually of the centrifugal type, or positive displacement units such as the Roots blowers, similar to the (much smaller) <b>Roots</b> type <b>supercharger.</b> Very large units (evaporation capacity 100 metric tons per hour or more) sometimes use Axial-flow compressors. The compression work will deliver the steam superheated if compared to the theoretical pressure/temperature equilibrium. For this reason, the vast majority of MVR units feature a desuperheater between the compressor and the main heat exchanger.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of tests of a Power plus supercharger and a comparison of its performance with the performance previously obtained with an N. A. C. A. Roots-type supercharger. The Powerplus supercharger is a positive displacement blower of the vane type having mechanically operated vanes, the movement of which is controlled by slots and eccentrics. The supercharger was tested at a range of pressure differences from 0 to 15 inches of mercury and at speeds from 500 to 2, 500 r. p. m. The pressure difference across the supercharger was obtained by throttling the intake of a depression tank which was interposed in the air duct between the supercharger and the Durley orifice box used for measuring the air. The results of these tests show that at low pressure differences and at all speeds the power required by the Powerplus supercharger to compress a definite quantity of air per second is considerably higher than that required by the Roots. At pressure differences from 10 to 14 inches of mercury and at speeds over 2, 000 r. p. m. the power requirements of the two superchargers are practically the same. At a pressure difference of 15 inches of mercury or greater and at a speed of 2, 500 r. p. m. or greater the performance of the Powerplus supercharger is slightly better than that of the Roots. Because the Powerplus supercharger cannot be operated at a speed greater than 3, 000 r. p. m. as compared with 7, 000 r. p. m. for the Roots, its capacity is approximately one-half that of the Roots for the same bulk. The Powerplus supercharger is more complicated and less reliable than the <b>Roots</b> <b>supercharger...</b>|$|E

50|$|With no {{regulations}} limiting engine size, {{other than}} the 750 kg total car weight limit, Mercedes designed a 5.6 litre engine configured with eight inline cylinders and double overhead camshaft for the W125. Named the M125, the engine was also fitted with a <b>Roots</b> type <b>supercharger</b> producing 632 lbft Nm of torque {{at the start of}} the season. The engines built varied in power, attaining an output between 560 and 640 horse power (418-444 kW) at 5800 rpm. Fuel used was a custom mix of 40% methyl alcohol, 32% benzene, 24% ethyl alcohol and 4% gasoline light. The engine weighed 222 kg (490 lbs) - approximately 30% of the total weight of the car, and was mounted in the front of the car.|$|R
5000|$|The Gen IV LS9 is a {{supercharged}} [...] engine, {{based on}} the LS3; the LS7 block was not used due to the higher cylinder pressures created by the supercharger requiring the thicker cylinder walls of the LS3. Cylinder dimensions are now 4.06 in bore and 3.62 in stroke. It is equipped with an Eaton four-lobe <b>Roots</b> type <b>supercharger</b> and has a compression ratio of 9.1:1. Power output is rated [...] at 6500 rpm and 604 lbft Nm at 3800 rpm. Note: GM previously used the LS9 RPO code on 1969 and later Chevrolet trucks (both 2WD and 4WD) including Blazers, Jimmys, Suburbans, as well as car carriers. The original LS9 was a 350 cu in V8, developing 160 hp and 245 Ft/lbs of torque.|$|R
5000|$|The Ford E93A engines were mildly tuned {{and many}} used twin SU's on a cast alloy 'Dellow' manifold. However, {{as an option}} the factory also offered the car with a Wade-Ventor (<b>Roots</b> type) <b>supercharger</b> installation. The MkII saw the {{introduction}} of a new and much more robust rear chassis section with coil springs, separate telescopic shock absorbers and a Panhard rod. This stiffer chassis allowed doors to become an optional fitting. The Mk V version was derived from the [...] "Lightweight" [...] Dellow (WRF 81) constructed by Tony Marsh for speed events in 1954. It saw coil springs introduced at the front (over telescopic dampers) although still with a one-piece Ford beam axle. About 300 Dellows in total are believed to have been constructed.|$|R
5000|$|Available as a coupe only, the SS Supercharged {{featured}} the 2.0 L LSJ Ecotec engine with an Eaton M62 <b>Roots</b> type <b>supercharger</b> and air&#8209;to&#8209;liquid intercooler. [...] The engine makes 205 hp at 5600 rpm and [...] at 4,400 rpm. 18&#8209;inch broad spoke wheels with P215/45R18 summer Pirelli tires were standard. Optional for the LSJ was a performance package coded G85 that added Recaro bucket seats and a {{limited slip differential}} (LSD). LSD was optional for 2005 models (performance package came with LSD) and was standard in models from 2007 to 2010. The G85 option continued in the LNF Cobalt, but added only the LSD. The car became notable for a high&#8209;profile spoiler that was standard in 2005, but optional from 2008 when a lower profile spoiler used on all other Cobalt coupes became an option.|$|R
