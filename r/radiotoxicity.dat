40|$|A {{commonly}} held {{perception is that}} disposal of spent nuclear fuel or high-level waste presents a risk of unprecedented duration. The EPA requires that projected releases of radioactivity be limited for 10, 000 years after disposal with the intent that risks from the disposal repository be no greater than those from the uranium ore deposit from which the nuclear fuel was originally extracted. This study reviews issues involved in assessing compliance with the requirement. The determination of compliance is assumption dependent primarily due to uncertainties in dosimetric data, and relative availability of the radioactivity for environmental transport and eventual assimilation by humans. A conclusion {{of this study is}} that, in time, a spent fuel disposal repository such as the projected Yucca Mountain Project Facility will become less hazardous than the original ore deposit. Only {{the time it takes to}} do so is in question. Depending upon the assumptions selected, this time period could range from a few centuries to hundreds of thousands of years considering only the inherent <b>radiotoxicities.</b> However, if it can be assumed that the spent fuel radioactivity emplaced in a waste repository is less than 1 / 10 as available for human assimilation than that in a uranium ore deposit, then even under the most pessimistic set of assumptions, the EPA criteria can be considered to be complied with. 24 refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R

The fuel of such reactors being liquid, it can be easily reprocessed to overcome neutronic limits.

Such a transition appears slow and difficult, since it is very sensitive to the fissile quality of the plutonium used. Deployment scenarios of 232 Th/ 233 U MSBR-like systems from the existing French PWRs demonstrate the advantage of an upstream 233 U production in other reactors, allowing a direct start of the MSBR-like systems with 233 U. This finally leads us to explore alternatives to some MSBR features, for energy production with 232 Th/ 233 U fuel from the start.

40|$|Compared with beta emitters, {{radionuclides}} that decay by {{electron capture}} or solely by isomerie transition are generally considered preferable for nuclear medicine {{because they do}} not release paniculate radiations from the nucleus during decay, and hence presumably con tribute less absorbed dose and biological damage to surrounding tissue. In this regard, the recent article by Rao, Govelitz, and Sastry (/) is of considerable interest because it reveals similar <b>radiotoxicities</b> for the elec tron-capture radionuclide Tl- 201 and the beta-emitting radionuclide Tl- 204, in spite of the 6 : 1 ratio of absorbed dose from Tl- 204 compared with Tl- 201 as computed by conventional dosimetrie methods. This observation implies that the radiobiological effectiveness is consid erably greater for radiations from Tl- 201 than for those from Tl- 204. As the authors point out, the radiations responsible for the local absorbed dose from Tl- 201 are principally low-energy electrons resulting from nonradiative Auger and Costcr-Kronig transitions. From questions asked by a number of individuals, it appears that these transitions are not familiar to all readers of the Journal. Hence, an explanation in relatively nontechnical terms may be useful. The Tl- 201 nucleus decays by electron capture, in which an electron, usually one occupying an inner shell, is captured by the nucleus. This process leaves a vacancy in the electron shell. The capture process reduces the atomic number of the nucleus by one to form Hg- 201 in an excited energy state. Decay to the ground state of Hg- 201 occurs by isomerie transition, in which energy is released, cither as 7 (radiative transitions) or through the process of internal conversion (nonradiative transi tions).

40|$|The most {{important}} lessons about managing radiation safety programs often {{are derived from}} involvement in accidents that release unusual amounts of contamination or result in unusually high doses to persons. Large releases result in contamination levels, air concentrations, and intakes that are measurable and {{can be related to}} amounts and <b>radiotoxicities</b> of nuclides in specific processes, and to probabilities of escape and intake. This information then can be used to better establish design and operational requirements. Lessons presented here include: the need to convince management that at least monthly routine inspection of safety interlocks, equipment and procedures are necessary by independent inspectors (e. g., Radiation Safety staff) when lethal exposures are possible; at least three independent checks of treatment plans and exposures should be required in radiation oncology treatments; detailed quantitative analyses of staffing requirements should be performed at least annually by Radiation Safety Officers to advise their administrators of the minimum staff needed to ensure safe operations; and internal laboratory procedures, or appropriate contractual arrangements with commercial bioassay services, must be prepared in advance of work with highly radiotoxic quantities of radioactive material. Examples of situations managed or audited by the author that revealed these principles are: a Van de Graaff incident ultimately resulting in quadruple amputation of an experienced operator; several overexposures in radiation oncology at a major university medical center that was required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to employ an independent auditing team; an extensive contamination incident at a major medical research center that resulted in the shutdown of a multi-million dollar research program by the NRC; and internal exposure cases managed at the University of Pittsburgh that resulted from inadequate safety and health physics procedures...|$|R
40|$|PACSThe coming {{century will}} see the {{exhaustion}} of standard fossil fuels, coal, gas and oil, which today represent 75 % of the world energy production. Moreover, their use will have caused large-scale emission of greenhouse gases (GEG), and induced global climate change. This problem is exacerbated by a growing world energy demand. In this context, nuclear power is the only GEG-free energy source available today capable of responding significantly to this demand. Some scenarios consider a nuclear energy production of around 5 Gtoe in 2050, wich would represent a 20 % share of the world energy supply. Present reactors generate energy from the fission of U- 235 and require around 200 tons of natural Uranium to produce 1 GWe. y of energy, equivalent to the fission of one ton of fissile material. In a scenario of {{a significant increase in}} nuclear energy generation, these standard reactors will consume the whole of the world's estimated Uranium reserves in a few decades. However, natural Uranium or Thorium ore, wich are not themselves fissile, can produce a fissile material after a neutron capture (239 Pu and 233 U respectively). In a breeder reactor, the mass of fissile material remains constant, and the fertile ore is the only material to be consumed. In this case, only 1 ton of natural ore is needed to produce 1 GWe. y. Thus, the breeding concept allows optimal use of fertile ore and development of sustainable nuclear energy production for several thousand years into the future. Different sustainable nuclear reactor concepts are studied in the international forum "generation IV". Different types of coolant (Na, Pb and He) are studied for fast breeder reactors based on the Uranium cycle. The thermal Thorium cycle requires the use of a liquid fuel, which can be reprocessed online in order to extract the neutron poisons. This paper presents these different sustainable reactors, based on the Uranium or Thorium fuel cycles and will compare the different options in term of fissile inventory, capacity to be deployed, induced <b>radiotoxicities,</b> and R&D efforts...|$|R
500|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} from normal light water {{reactors}} contains plutonium, {{but it is}} a mixture of plutonium-242, 240, 239 and 238. The mixture is not sufficiently enriched for efficient nuclear weapons, but can be used once as MOX fuel. Accidental neutron capture causes the amount of plutonium-242 and 240 to grow each time the plutonium is irradiated in a reactor with low-speed [...] "thermal" [...] neutrons, so that after the second cycle, the plutonium can only be consumed by fast neutron reactors. If fast neutron reactors are not available (the normal case), excess plutonium is usually discarded, and forms the longest-lived component of nuclear waste. The desire to consume this plutonium and other transuranic fuels and reduce the <b>radiotoxicity</b> of the waste is the usual reason nuclear engineers give to make fast neutron reactors.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{particularly}} relevant {{in the preparation}} of high-grade plutonium-239 for use in weapons. It is not practical to separate Pu-239 from Pu-240 or Pu-241. Fissile Pu-239 is produced following neutron capture by uranium-238, but further neutron capture will produce Pu-240 which is less fissile and worse, is a fairly strong neutron emitter, and Pu-241 which decays to Am-241, a strong alpha emitter that poses self-heating and <b>radiotoxicity</b> problems. Therefore, the uranium targets used to produce military plutonium must be irradiated for only a short time, to minimise the production of these unwanted isotopes. [...] Conversely, blending plutonium with Pu-240 renders it less suitable for nuclear weapons.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{long-lived}} waste. LFTRs can dramatically {{reduce the}} long-term <b>radiotoxicity</b> of their reactor wastes. Light water reactors with uranium fuel have fuel {{that is more}} than 95% U-238. These reactors normally transmute part of the U-238 to Pu-239, a long-lived isotope. Almost all of the fuel is therefore only one step away from becoming a transuranic long-lived element. Plutonium-239 has a half life of 24,000 years, and is the most common transuranic in spent nuclear fuel from light water reactors. Transuranics like Pu-239 cause the perception that reactor wastes are an eternal problem. In contrast, the LFTR uses the thorium fuel cycle, which transmutes thorium to U-233. Because thorium is a lighter element, more neutron captures are required to produce the transuranic elements. U-233 has two chances to fission in a LFTR. First as U-233 (90% will fission) and then the remaining 10% has another chance as it transmutes to U-235 (80% will fission). The fraction of fuel reaching neptunium-237, the most likely transuranic element, is therefore only 2%, about 15kg perGWe-year. This is a transuranic production 20x smaller than light water reactors, which produce 300kg of transuranics per GWe-year. Importantly, because of this much smaller transuranic production, {{it is much easier to}} recycle the transuranics. That is, they are sent back to the core to eventually fission. Reactors operating on the U238-plutonium fuel cycle produce far more transuranics, making full recycle difficult on both reactor neutronics and the recycling system. In the LFTR, only a fraction of a percent, as reprocessing losses, goes to the final waste. When these two benefits of lower transuranic production, and recycling, are combined, a thorium fuel cycle reduces the production of transuranic wastes by more than a thousand-fold compared to a conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactor. The only significant long-lived waste is the uranium fuel itself, but this can be used indefinitely by recycling, always generating electricity.If the thorium stage ever has to be shut down, part of the reactors can be shut down and their uranium fuel inventory burned out in the remaining reactors, allowing a burndown of even this final waste to as small a level as society demands. The LFTR does still produce radioactive fission products in its waste, but they don't last very long - the <b>radiotoxicity</b> of these fission products is dominated by cesium-137 and strontium-90. The longer half-life is cesium: 30.17 years. So, after 30.17 years, decay reduces the radioactivity by a half. Ten half-lives will reduce the radioactivity by two raised to a power of ten, a factor of 1,024. Fission products at that point, in about 300 years, are less radioactive than natural uranium. What's more, the liquid state of the fuel material allows separation of the fission products not only from the fuel, but from each other as well, which enables them to be sorted by the length of each fission product's half-life, so that the ones with shorter half-lives can be brought out of storage sooner than those with longer half-lives.|$|E
40|$|A new high-fidelity {{integrated}} system method and analysis approach {{was developed and}} implemented for consistent and comprehensive evaluations of advanced fuel cycles leading to minimized Transuranic (TRU) inventories. The method has been implemented in a developed code system integrating capabilities of MCNPX for highfidelity fuel cycle component simulations. The impact associated with energy generation and utilization is immeasurable due to the immense, widespread, and myriad effects it has on {{the world and its}} inhabitants. The polar extremes are demonstrated on the one hand, by the high quality of life enjoyed by individuals with access to abundant reliable energy sources, {{and on the other hand}} by the global-scale environmental degradation attributed to the affects of energy production and use. Thus, nations strive to increase their energy generation, but are faced with the challenge of doing so with a minimal impact on the environment and in a manner that is self-reliant. Consequently, a revival of interest in nuclear energy has followed with much focus placed on technologies for transmuting nuclear spent fuel. In this dissertation, a Nuclear Energy System (NES) configuration was developed to take advantage of used fuel recycling and transmutation capabilities in waste management scenarios leading to minimized TRU waste inventories, long-term activities, and <b>radiotoxicities.</b> The reactor systems and fuel cycle components that make up the NES were selected for their ability to perform in tandem to produce clean, safe, and dependable energy in an environmentally conscious manner. The reactor systems include the AP 1000, VHTR, and HEST. The diversity in performance and spectral characteristics for each was used to enhance TRU waste elimination while efficiently utilizing uranium resources and providing an abundant energy source. The High Level Waste (HLW) stream produced by typical nuclear systems was characterized according to the radionuclides that are key contributors to long-term waste management issues. The TRU component of the waste stream becomes the main radiological concern for time periods greater than 300 years. A TRU isotopic assessment was developed and implemented to produce a priority ranking system for the TRU nuclides as related to long-term waste management and their expected characteristics under irradiation in the different reactor systems of the NES. Detailed 3 D whole-core models were developed for analysis of the individual reactor systems of the NES. As an inherent part of the process, the models were validated and verified by performing experiment-to-code and/or code-to-code benchmarking procedures, which provided substantiation for obtained data and results. Reactor core physics and material depletion calculations were performed and analyzed. A computational modeling approach was developed for integrating the individual models of the NES. A general approach was utilized allowing for the Integrated System Model (ISM) to be modified in order to provide simulation for other systems with similar attributes. By utilizing this approach, the ISM is capable of performing system evaluations under many different design parameter options. Additionally, the predictive capabilities of the ISM and its computational time efficiency allow for system sensitivity/uncertainty analysis and the implementation of optimization techniques. The NES has demonstrated great potential for providing safe, clean, and secure energy and doing so with foreseen advantages over the LEU once-through fuel cycle option. The main advantages exist due to better utilization of natural resources by recycling the used nuclear fuel, and by reducing the final amount and time span for which the resulting HLW must be isolated from the public and the environment due to radiological hazard. If deployed, the NES can substantially reduce the long-term radiological hazard posed by current HLW, extend uranium resources, and approach the characteristics of an environmentally benign energy system...|$|R

The fraction of fuel reaching neptunium-237, the most likely transuranic element, is therefore only 2%, about 15 kg per GWe-year. This is a transuranic production 20x smaller than light water reactors, which produce 300 kg of transuranics per GWe-year. Importantly, because of this much smaller transuranic production, {{it is much easier to}} recycle the transuranics. That is, they are sent back to the core to eventually fission. Reactors operating on the U238-plutonium fuel cycle produce far more transuranics, making full recycle difficult on both reactor neutronics and the recycling system. In the LFTR, only a fraction of a percent, as reprocessing losses, goes to the final waste. When these two benefits of lower transuranic production, and recycling, are combined, a thorium fuel cycle reduces the production of transuranic wastes by more than a thousand-fold compared to a conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactor. The only significant long-lived waste is the uranium fuel itself, but this can be used indefinitely by recycling, always generating electricity.If the thorium stage ever has to be shut down, part of the reactors can be shut down and their uranium fuel inventory burned out in the remaining reactors, allowing a burndown of even this final waste to as small a level as society demands. The LFTR does still produce radioactive fission products in its waste, but they don't last very long - the <b>radiotoxicity</b> of these fission products is dominated by cesium-137 and strontium-90. The longer half-life is cesium: 30.17 years. So, after 30.17 years, decay reduces the radioactivity by a half. Ten half-lives will reduce the radioactivity by two raised to a power of ten, a factor of 1,024. Fission products at that point, in about 300 years, are less radioactive than natural uranium. What's more, the liquid state of the fuel material allows separation of the fission products not only from the fuel, but from each other as well, which enables them to be sorted by the length of each fission product's half-life, so that the ones with shorter half-lives can be brought out of storage sooner than those with longer half-lives.|$|E
