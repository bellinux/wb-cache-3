50|$|In the {{vicinity}} of each control was a compact, brick built shack called the <b>Radiac</b> Store, which housed approximately 20 nuclear radiation sources {{in the form of}} milled metal discs. These discs, with strengths of 0.5 röntgen, 1 röntgen, 5 röntgens and 10 röntgens, were securely stored in lead-lined containers. Discs had to be audited monthly which entailed an ROC officer physically counting the discs into the palm of their bare hands, with the results being recorded in a log book. (This task was usually achieved with a degree of haste). Discs were used to calibrate and check the stocks of <b>radiac</b> instruments and for simulated live-training using such instruments. In practice, Health and Safety at Work regulations introduced in the 1970s resulted in radioactive sources being rarely if ever used, and as a result they seldom left the <b>radiac</b> store. Discs were finally withdrawn from service and returned to Aldermaston during the mid-1980s, with the last exercise involving such live radiation sources taking place at RAF West Raynham in 1980, during the annual ROC summer training camp.|$|E

50|$|A {{reconnaissance}} detachment comprised four Land Rovers, {{each with}} a crew of four (driver, leader/navigator, <b>radiac</b> operator, wireless operator), which would be sent in on three parallel paths towards an area affected by a nuclear strike (with one vehicle spare). The radio operator would {{be in touch with}} area control at a base station, which could be a mobile station based in a Ford Thames signal office vehicle, or could be in a local town hall. The wireless equipment was Pye or BCC and operated at 155 or 168MHz. These mid-1950s radios (like the military equivalent) were 12 volt, using the vehicle supply or batteries. A second 5-channel radio operating at 96Mhz was fitted between the driver and navigator and could be used to communicate with personnel on foot. These vehicles were fitted with hard tops with side windows. The <b>Radiac</b> operator would gather radiation level measurements that would be analysed together with wind patterns by the intelligence section.|$|E

This meter suffered {{from a number of}} disadvantages: it required three different types of batteries, of which two were obsolete and had to be manufactured to special order, the circuit included a single electrometer valve or tube. These were favored as they had been tested on fallout in Australia after the Operation Buffalo nuclear tests, and remained in use until 1982 by commissioning a manufacturer to regularly produce special production runs of the obsolete batteries. Within the ROC the RSM was only used at post sites for three years when it was superseded in 1958 by the FSM and the RSM retained only for post attack mobile monitoring missions.|$|E
5000|$|The CD V-718 is a {{variation}} of the US military-issue AN/VDR-2 <b>RADIAC</b> made by Nuclear Research Corporation, located in the US State of New Jersey. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) purchased a quantity of CD V-718s in the 1990s as a supplement to and partial replacement for the older meters in the inventory. The CD V-718 differs from the military AN/VDR-2 primarily by being painted bright [...] "civil defense" [...] yellow instead of olive green and being graduated in Röntgens rather than Grays. A much more modern and sophisticated device than earlier CD meters and equipped with a probe containing two Geiger-Mueller tubes of differing sensitivities, the CD V-718 can cover a much wider range of radiation levels than the earlier Geiger counters and ion-chamber survey meters combined (from [...]001mR/h to 10,000 R/h). As a result of its military heritage, the CD-V-718 is far more rugged than earlier CD meters, and can easily be mounted in vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Tyrolit was co-founded on the 13th of February 1919 by Daniel Swarovski to {{manufacture}} grinding wheels {{for the production}} of Swarovski-Crystals. During World War I, the Swarovski Group was cut off from supplies of grinding wheels and was forced to develop and produce its own grinding wheels. After the war, it was decided to commercialize this activity and to start a separate company: Tyrolit was born.In 1950, the company relocated from the Swarovski Headquarters in Wattens to a new location in Schwaz. One of the largest drivers of growth of the company was the market launch of the glass fibre reinforced cut-off and grinding wheel SECUR in 1952. The glass fibre reinforcement greatly improved the security of the tools against centrifugal breakage.In 1991 Tyrolit acquired the US company Diamond Products and the Swiss company Hydrostress. These acquisitions added significant presence in the market for concrete drilling and sawing systems.Further major acquisitions took place in 2004 with the purchasing of the Czech company Carborundum Electrite, in 2009 with the purchasing of the US company <b>Radiac</b> and in 2014 with the purchasing of the South African company Grinding Techniques.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{evaluations}} of the DT- 236 /PD U. S. Army battlefield personnel dosimeter were performed at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) from the summer of 1984 to the spring of 1985. This personnel dosimetry system is being procured by the U. S. Army for use by combat forces in theaters of operation where tactical nuclear weapons could be used. In operation, the wristwatch-style dosimeter is worn by a soldier to record both instantaneous and residual gamma and neutron radiations that are released from the detonation of a nuclear weapon, plus gamma radiation from fallout. The dosimeter contains a block of radiophotoluminescent glass as the gamma detector and a silicon diode as the neutron detector. Properties of these detectors have been described in various review articles (1). The reader unit simultaneously evaluates both of the radiation detectors and presents a total dose reading on a panel meter. Earlier tests of this dosimetry system at the U. S. Army Pulsed Radiation Facility at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, were reported by Basso (2). Other calculational {{evaluations of}} this dosimetry system have also been done (3). The present report describes AFRRI results of the irradiation of DT- 236 /PD dosimeters with (a) reactor-produced neutron and gamma radiations to simulate a nuclear detonation and (b) cobalt- 60 gamma radiation to simulate nuclear fallout.

40|$|The {{detonation}} of a {{radiological dispersal device}} (RDD) {{may result}} in casualties receiving exposure of radioactive materials. Assessments of potentially contaminated personnel are necessary to determine the level of contamination received in order to prioritize and treat individuals. The use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) {{and the number of}} orphan sources in deployed and combat areas such as Iraq, present an opportunity for terrorists to use an RDD against deployed ground forces. There is limited capability in Iraq to assess radiological casualties, as the process of obtaining and analyzing bioassays is time consuming and not readily available in country. Military units are equipped with AN/VDR- 2 and AN/PDR- 77 <b>radiac</b> detectors which are capable of detecting gamma radiation. Therefore, a study of the use of these <b>radiac</b> sets in assessing internal contamination was conducted. A model of the detector probe was created using the Los Alamos National Laboratory Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code, MCNP Version 5. This model was experimentally validated and used in conjunction with both reference male and reference female computational Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) phantoms to compute internal dose. The instrument model was evaluated at the following locations, the posterior upper right torso, the anterior upper right torso, the lateral upper left thigh and the anterior of the neck. Nuclides were distributed throughout the phantoms using the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Dose and Risk Calculation (DCAL) software for inhalation pathways. Based on the likelihood for use in RDDs and the capabilities of the instrument, Co- 60, Cs- 137 and Ir- 192 were evaluated. M. S.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the effects of gamma-ray {{irradiation}} conditions on the stimuli-responsiveness of polypropylene (PP) films and silicone (SR) rubber substrates grafted with N-vinylcaprolactam (NVCL) and acrylic acid (AAc). PP films and SR rubber were modified by simultaneous polymerization and grafting of NVCL and AAc, using pre-irradiation oxidative method at a dose rate of 1223 kGy h(- 1) and doses ranging from 5 to 70 kGy. NVCL and AAc solutions (1 / 1, v/v) at 50 % monomer concentration (v/v) in toluene were added to the sample substrates, degassed, sealed and heated at 60 and 70 degrees C for 12 h. After grafting, the samples were soaked in ethanol and distilled water for 24 h successively, followed by drying under vacuum. Samples were characterized by FTIR-ATR, DSC and swelling measurements. Critical points (pH critical or LCST) of grafts were obtained in a pH-environment (pH ranges from 2. 2 to 9) and in a thermo-environment (temperature ranges from 22 to 50 C). Cytotoxicity evaluation was performed using fibroblast BALB/c 3 T 3 cells. the relationship between NVCL-co-AAc grafting and radiation dose was different for each substrate, PP and SR. At 50 % NVCL/AAc concentration in toluene, grafting values were higher for SR than for PP. Despite the fact that PP-g-(NVCL-co-AAc) membrane presented a cytotoxic profile at the highest experimental concentration assayed, cytotoxicity evaluation revealed noncytotoxic profiles for the membranes synthesized highlighting their applications for biomedical purposes.

40|$|Fire Rescue Service is {{the basic}} {{component}} of an integrated rescue system, with high working demands placed on their activity. The number of activities firefighter units perform is extensive; especially great {{attention is paid to}} interventions with eventual incidence of ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is not possible to detect by human senses, but is possible to detect with special instruments. Identification of ionizing radiation is not simple; it requires certain amount of time, professional knowledge, and facilities. To prevent irradiation of people who are present at an intervention place and also people who intervene, the units of Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic are equipped with the portable ionizing radiation detectors according to Conception of Chemical Service. These are namely DC- 3 E- 98, DC- 3 H- 08 and Ultra- <b>Radiac</b> (U-RAD 115). The instruments are constructed to detect radiation. The goal of the thesis is to compare instruments in terms of the accuracy and speed of measurement and to assess suitability of use of the instruments by fire protection units of the Czech Republic, economic comparison and the practicability of the instruments. DC- 3 E- 98 is hand contamination detector used for surface contamination and dose rate meter that dates with its design back to 1970 s of the series DC- 3 used for operative radiological survey. It was developed and manufactured in today's nonexistent plant Zavod mechanizace a automatizace Ostrov nad Ohri. This device has been used until recent days after had been modified at the end of 1990 s and because of needs to follow Act on Metrology. It is consisting of two parts, separate instrument and removable probe. Both parts create easily demountable unit allowing carrying out measuring by only one hand. Its great advantage is fast response and large-area probe with Geiger-Müller tube used as a detector. DC- 3 H- 08 is the latest type coming out of type series DC- 3 and was developed by the innovation of previous type DC- 3 E- 98. This device was developed by the company VF a. s. Cerna Hora using financial sources coming from European Union for the Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic. It is the instrument with satisfactorily large display and robust construction suitable for measuring outdoors. It is consisting of two independent parts - indicator and basic units. When mounted together, the device works as complex, when separated, each unit can work independently and the communication between them is wireless using Bluetooth. The device is possible operate using four buttons at the indicator unit. It is possible to use the device for measuring kerma dose in the air, areal dose equivalent dosage, surface activity, accumulated dose and for checking people's contamination. The disadvantage of the device is its heavy weight and impossibility of controlling audio output, operating time (only 4 hours), and its high purchase price when compared to others. Ultra-Radiac (U-RAD 115) is hand detector determined for indication of gama radiation sources, measuring dose rates, scheduling the time for people who intervene, setting-out safety zone for gama radiation and for direct data reading of accumulated dose. The device is company Canbera Dover Inc. ' product. It is device of smaller size; its operation is actually easy and intuitive with the help of six buttons. It is suitable to be used outdoors because of its robustness. This device is recently sufficient for basic units HZS CR and when Canberra Packard finishes prototype stage of beta probe of this device for our market, it can fully replace device DC- 3 E that is recently serving out...|$|E
