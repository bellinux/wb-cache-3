40|$|To {{quantify}} the structure-borne sound power injected by building machinery into heavyweight buildings the <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> method according to EN 15657 - 1 {{can be used}} to provide input data for the prediction model described in EN 12354 - 5. This paper concerns the assessment of different sampling strategies for vibration measurements that are needed to determine the <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> power. This is carried out using a validated finite element model for a heavyweight <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> with viscoelastic material around its boundaries. The lowest differences between the direct injected power and <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> power are obtained by using a regular grid of sampling positions over the whole <b>reception</b> <b>plate.</b> These investigations are based on harmonic force excitation of randomly distributed single-contact sources. A numerical approach to estimate the structural behaviour of harmonic point force excitations is compared with measurements on a laboratory heavyweight <b>reception</b> <b>plate.</b> Building machinery have usually more than one contact point to the structure, where they are connected. Therefore, multiple-contact sources such as white goods are also determined. The resulting effects of harmonic multiple-force excitations with different positions on the validated <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> model are discussed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIsolated {{reception}} plates {{provide an}} engineering approach {{to quantify the}} structure-borne sound power input from machinery through the measurement of the spatial-average velocity level and structural reverberation times. For applications in building acoustics there are practical and economic reasons to consider using coupled reception plates formed by solid heavyweight walls or floors that are structurally coupled to other building elements. This paper uses transient and steady-state statistical energy analysis to investigate how the errors depend upon the building structure to which the coupled <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> is connected. It is shown {{that the problem is}} twofold. Firstly, in the low- and mid-frequency ranges, the steady-state velocity level on the coupled <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> is increased by energy returning from other coupled plates. Secondly, the structural decays on the coupled <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> have significant curvature due to returning energy; hence short evaluation ranges are needed to minimise the error when determining the total loss factor. This leads to a problematic situation where the coupled <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> appears to give the correct answer due to the error in the energy cancelling out the error in the total loss factor. The latter error can be minimised using short evaluation ranges for the structural reverberation time...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Reception</b> <b>Plate</b> Method (RPM) as {{proposed}} by CEN/TC 126 /WG 7 in prEN 15657 - 1 estimates the structure borne sound power injected from a (high mobility) vibrating source into a (low mobility) building structure. In the near future, a round-robin test is planned to investigate repeatability and reproducibility issues of the RPM. As a preparation of this round-robin, uncertainties of the RPM are studied using two kinds of structure borne sound sources: the standard ISO tapping machine, placed on a 4 feet table on a <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> and an industrial washing machine placed on three different bases. The influence of the source position, accelerometer positions and airborne excitation are investigated, together with repeatability tests. Also, differences in injected power between two different brands of the ISO tapping machine are studied. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Reception</b> <b>Plate</b> Method (RPM) as {{proposed}} by CEN/TC 126 /WG 7 in EN 15657 - 1 estimates the structure-borne sound power injected from a (high mobility) vibrating source into a (low mobility) concrete <b>reception</b> <b>plate.</b> This power level {{can be used as}} an input to predict structureborne sound pressure levels in buildings according to the calculation model in EN 12354 - 5. To validate both the RPM and the prediction model, measurements are done using two sources: a standard ISO tapping machine and an industrial washing machine placed on three different bases. Both sources are successively placed on the RP and on a concrete floor of a standard impact sound test cell. The sound pressure level in the cell underneath is measured and compared with calculated values. Difficulties in both the test method and the prediction model are investigated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis focuses {{on the development of}} indirect methods for the experimental determination of important source parameters for structure-borne sound source characterization. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, matrix inversion methods for the determination of blocked forces are investigated. A simplified measurement procedure is proposed which offers a solution to the two major challenges to these methods, namely the acquisition of the FRF matrix and the problems associated with matrix inversion. The proposed procedure involves a free, low-mobility receiver plate which is modelled numerically. Calculated FRFs are used together with measured velocity responses to inversely determine the blocked forces. It is found that while the method has great potential in principle, in practice the accurate modelling of the receiver plate is of critical importance. In the second part of the thesis, three formulations are considered for the indirect determination of source mobility. Instead of performing measurements on the source in the free state, the source mobility is obtained from measurements made in-situ. This approach is beneficial if the source is difficult to suspend, or if it contains non-linear structural elements. The three formulations are validated numerically and experimentally. It is found that the methods can quantify source mobilities of single-contact and multi-contact sources from in-situ measurements. However, typical measurement errors, such as background noise or inaccuracies in sensor positioning, can significantly reduce the accuracy and reliability of the methods. In the final part of the thesis, the <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> method for the determination of the power injected by a high-mobility source into a low-mobility receiver is reviewed, and a source substitution method proposed as a development. The substitution method circumvents problems that may arise when the <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> method is applied to coupled walls and floors. A special focus of investigation is on the calibration of the receiver structure. It is found that the calibration can be performed with shaker or hammer, and that an average calibration factor may be used. The source substitution method thus offers a potential alternative to the <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> method, for application with coupled plates...|$|E
40|$|A laboratory-based {{experiment}} {{procedure of}} <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> method for structure-borne sound source characterisation is {{reported in this}} paper. The method uses {{the assumption that the}} input power from the source installed on the plate is equal to the power dissipated by the plate. In this experiment, rectangular plates having high and low mobility relative to that of the source were used as the reception plates and a small electric fan motor was acting as the structure-borne source. The data representing the source characteristics, namely, the free velocity and the source mobility, were obtained and compared with those from direct measurement. Assumptions and constraints employing this method are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Vibrating therapy {{appliances}} {{in medical}} institutions and fitness centers are gaining interest, {{because of their}} curative effect on the human body. As the demand of appliances rises, so does the problem of their noise production. A lot of the vibrational energy is passed to the supporting structure, after which it is radiated as audible sound in other rooms of the building (structure-borne sound). This paper describes how a vibrating plate will behave installed on a light-weight wooden structure, on a heavy-weight concrete structure and on a heavy-weight floating floor structure. All supporting structures {{are part of a}} floor between two vertically separated transmission rooms. Sound levels of both rooms, as well as acceleration levels of the floors, are measured. The total sound transmission consists of airborne sound transmission and structure-borne sound transmission. The measured sound pressure level is then compared with the predicted sound pressure level achieved by the draft standards prEN 12354 - 5 and prEN 15657 - 1 (the <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> method). It appears that the low-mobility nature of the source will only cause problems when the source’s operating frequency lies within a frequency band with a matching source-structure mobility. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the structure-borne noise from operational equipment in airplanes is a complex process that requires much source and receiver component information in the analysis. Different test setups and instrumentation usually are required to obtain these quantities separately; for example, free velocity, blocked force, source and receiver mobilities, isolator properties and transmitted power. A previously proposed approach, combining the inverse force method (IFM) and the <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> method (RPM), and enabling dual force-power measurement from a single test platform, was demonstrated in laboratory tests. This paper reports on the measurement variations of blocked force and transmitted power from the integrated test setup. To gauge the practicality and readiness of the test methods, an experimental round-robin evaluation was arranged and coordinated with four industrial participants. The same source {{was used in the}} round robin evaluation with controlled mounting details, in order to investigate the source installation sensitivity. In general, good agreements were observed between powers obtained by the two methods from data acquired at each test site; larger variations were observed in measurement across test sites. Work continues to determine the test method uncertainty; however, both test methods are considered acceptable and ready for wider industry applications. © 2016 Institute of Noise Control Engineering...|$|E
40|$|Vibrating {{sources in}} buildings, such as service equipment, {{elevators}} and electric devices, often {{cause a lot}} of noise because of the mechanical excitation of building elements (structure-borne sound). De draft standard prEN 12354 - 5 describes how the normalized sound pressure in a room can be calculated based on the injected structure-borne sound power of an installation in another room. Estimating this power is not simple, because both source properties (installation) as receiver properties (building element) play a role. The draft standard prEN 15657 - 1 delivers a method to do this for sources of which the mobility is much larger than the mobility of the receiving building element, therefore making a measurement of the source mobility unnecessary. In this method, the source is put into operation on a plate that is resiliently connected to the surroundings. The injected power in this so-called “reception plate” is then determined out of the structure-borne sound power in the diffuse velocity field of the plate. In this investigation, the injected structure-borne sound power by an operating fitness vibration plate into three different floors between two acoustical transmission rooms is determined via the <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> method. The power is also calculated according to the more exact “mobility method”, that takes the source mobility into account. Finally, the results of both methods are compared to each other. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Requirements are {{formulated}} on motion {{trajectory of}} {{the front edge of}} the arm of PNB type loader needed to provide the maximum shoveling of bulk mass under the condition of fitting that trajectory into the dimensions of <b>reception</b> <b>plate.</b> Kinematic schemes are analyzed of mechanisms of shoveling arms. Rational parameters are suggested for that mechanism, which provide a 1. 5 times increase of single-time shoveling of bulk load resulting in a 30 % increase of theoretical capacity of the machine. A technique is presented of defining the area embraced by the complex motion {{trajectory of the}} front edge of the arm. A mathematical model is designed of motion of the shoveling arm with curvilinear tail part using the techniques of vector algebra, second order central differences and triangulation. Geometric parameters of the mechanism of work tool of the loader are described by a linear equation yielding the functional dependence of coordinates of the position of front edge of the arm on the turning angle of the leading joint and the parameters of kinematic scheme. The effect is studied of the total mass of shoveling arm on the irregularity factor of mechanism motion. It is found that redistribution of mass between the work tool and the tail part of the arm within the given total mass of the tool suppresses the motion irregularity factor...|$|E
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis addresses the problem of structure-borne sound transmission from impacts on lightweight stairs. The primary aim {{was to provide a}} laboratory method for characterisation of lightweight stairs as structure-borne sound sources, which will give input data for prediction of the sound transmission in heavyweight building situations. By treating the stair system, combined with impact source(s), as an active component, available methods for active sources could be adapted. The component powers of a timber staircase attached to a solid wall in a staircase test facility have been determined in-situ by use of a reciprocal method. It was shown that the force perpendicular to the wall surface is dominant, moments can be neglected. The force induced power can be predicted from contact free velocity and mobility or by the blocked force as stairs constitute high mobility sources in heavyweight buildings. A practical characterisation is proposed that is based on the <b>reception</b> <b>plate</b> method. It is demonstrated that real walls and floors can be used as reception plates along with a power calibration that circumvents problems in estimating the plate mass, mean squared velocity and total loss factor for non-isolated reception plates. The sound transmission is predicted using EN 12354 and it is confirmed that the prediction gives values within acceptable engineering accuracy. A deterministic model that accounts for the modal coupling of structure and room is used to predict the sound transmission at low frequencies. For the case considered, a major difficulty was found in the modelling of the wall vibration field, mainly due to the boundary conditions that do not correspond to idealised conditions, such as pinned or free edges...|$|E
