High curing temperature (180  °C) too resulted fall in tensile strength.

30|$|Optimized {{finishing}} {{parameters and}} related physical properties of finished cotton with modified DMDHEU and citric acid {{are shown in}} Tables  12, 13 and 14 respectively. Modified DMDHEU and CA both produced good DP rating (≥ 3.5) at 60  gpl with respective concentration of catalyst at 20 % (MgCl 2) and 65 – 70 % (SHP) respectively; the latter resulted in more tendering of finished cotton. Citric acid itself developed a pH of around 2.7 – 3 in bath and further addition of SHP increased acidity causing severe tendering. The optimum curing temperature was 160 and 180  °C for modified DMDHEU and CA respectively to obtain DP rating of ≥ 3.5. Higher curing temperature caused high strength loss and yellowing of finished cotton. More concentration of SS and PE was required for modified DMDHEU because of stiffness developed compared to lesser concentrations of these two in CA based formulation. TCRA was better with modified DMDHEU while CA caused more loss in tensile and tear strength. Citric acid produced yellowing of fabric which was removed by conditioning it in open.

The largest applications are in electrical parts, with smaller usage in automotive and textiles. A polycyclic chlorohydrocarbon, DECHLORANE PLUS, is employed in low smoke formulations. Decabromodiphenyl ether has major use in polyamide 6. Alternative brominated additives include decabromodiphenylethane, polybrominated phenylindane, polymeric dibromophenylene oxide, polybrominated polystyrene and oligomeric glycidyl ethers of tetrabromobisphenol A, and polypentabromobenzyl acrylate. In non-reinforced polyamide 6, melamine cyanurate is effective. With glass reinforcements, some melamine pyro- or polyphosphates are useful. Polyamide 6 can be flame retarded with high loadings of magnesium hydroxide. Stabilized and coated red phosphorus is used in Europe and the Far East.

Materials and Method: The evaluated composite resins were: Filtek Ultimate (3 M ESPE), Amaris (Voco) and Esthet-X HD (Dentsply). A total of 120 specimens were fabricated in a plexiglass mold covered with a mylar strip. After polymerization, ten specimens per group received no polishing treatment and served as the control group. For each composite resin group (n= 30), the specimens were randomly divided into three polishing systems: Enhance (one-step; Dentsply), OptraPol (one-step; Ivoclar Vivadent) and Sof-Lex (multiple-steps; 3 M ESPE).

Moreover, automatic control of knitting & dyeing process are developing slowly due to the complexity of that manufacturing process. Process optimization and quality characteristics modeling {{is one of the most}} viable and efficient alternative technique to meet the customers requirement. Conventional trial-and-error approaches, full factorial experimental design as well as artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm for optimization did not succeed due to the large volume of works, longer experimental time and huge raw material availability.

Although much {{work has been}} done to determine the staining susceptibility of composite resins to various liquid beverages, effects of spices on colour stability of composite resins have not been fully researched. Objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the colour stability of nano-filled (Filtek Supreme™) and micro-hybrid (Gradia Direct™) composite <b>resins</b> <b>finished</b> with either Sof-Lex™ discs or mylar strips upon exposure to turmeric, paprika and tamarind. Materials and methods: Twenty cylindrical specimens were fabricated from two commercially available composite resins; Filtek Supreme XT™ (3 M ESPE, St Paul, MN) and Gradia Direct X™(GC AMERICA). The top surfaces of the specimen were polished with Sof–Lex™ aluminium oxide discs (3 M/ESPE, St Paul, MN USA) while the bottom surfaces were mylar strips finished. All samples were subjected to 500 thermocycling rounds between 5 and 55 ºC with 20 seconds dwell time prior to immersion in staining solution. Twenty specimens from each type of composite were then randomly divided into 4 groups (n= 5) and immersed in each staining solutions (0. 1 % turmeric, paprika and tamarind) and distilled water (control) at 37 ºC. Colour measurement at baseline, after thermocycling, 24 hours (1 day), 72 hours (3 days) and 168 hours (7 days) of immersion in staining solutions were recorded with a reflection spectrophotometer under the D 65 (daylight) illuminant using CIE L* a* b* parameters. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to determine the significance and possible interactions of each factor. Results: Among all the staining solutions tested, the highest colour deviation was obtained in the turmeric group, with mean colour change (ΔE) ranging between 17. 92 and 55. 25. Paprika recorded mean colour change (ΔE) ranging between 1. 28 and 3. 72, while tamarind produced mean colour change (ΔE) ranging between 1. 12 and 5. 42. The effect of finishing method on colour stability of composite resins appeared to be dependent on the type of composite resin. Filtek Supreme™ with mylar strips finished generally resulted in significantly more colour changes compared with specimens polished Sof-Lex™ discs, while Gradia Direct™ finished with mylar strips were found to be more resistant to colour changes. Colour change (ΔE) values were significantly influenced by the staining solutions, types of materials and finishing methods. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, all spices used (turmeric, paprika and tamarind) have a potential to stain composite resins; with turmeric causing the most severe discolouration regardless of the type of composite <b>resin</b> or <b>finishing</b> technique employed. The result of this study also suggests that different materials respond differently to staining by spices when either finished with mylar strips or polished with Sof-Lex™ discs. Also, contemporary composite resins available in the market e. g. nano-composite and micro-filled hybrid composite are still susceptible to discolouration by exogenous factors despite advancement in the development of resin based restorative material.
