40|$|By {{the end of}} 1993, {{the unified}} and freely {{convertible}} ruble on current account represented a major step in Russia’s foreign exchange management. The monetarist model of this paper (which gives a robust estimate of the real exchange rate) suggests {{that the impact of}} the gap between available cash supply and cash demand (in the next month) on the real ruble-dollar exchange rate (for the period beginning July 1992 and ending in December 1994) was small. Perhaps this parametric value reflects the restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, and the intervention of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) in the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX) which determines the exchange rate. In contrast to the unification and current account convertibility of the ruble, progress during 1992 - 94 in the foreign trading arrangements was halting. Export trading was hobbled by export quotas, licensing and passport surveillance. There were no quantitative <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>import</b> activity which nevertheless was subjected to steadily rising import tariffs (evidently calculated to counter the impact of the appreciating real ruble). The estimates of the trade equations suggest that the real exchange rate had no impact, ceteris paribus, on export performance but it influenced import flows. The changing pattern of Russia’s trade, in terms of (export-import) commodity composition and orientation, has to be judged {{in the context of the}} asymmetrical impact of the exchange rate on that pattern...|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} {{literature}} on openness and spending in developing countries arguing {{that the effect of}} increasing openness depends on both regime type and the level of openness. Democracies respond to increases in openness by increasing spending while dictatorships respond by decreasing spending. However, the degree to which countries pursue the strategy of choice depends on the level of openness. In autarkic countries, an increase in import competition has more severe consequences for perceptions of job insecurity and dislocation. In response, government management of openness will be more vigorous under these conditions regardless of whether the leader increases or decreases spending. Economic selection mechanisms at work will pro-duce an outcome wherein, at higher levels of openness, further import liberalization has smaller effects on perceptions of job insecurity and dislocation. Hence, both the demand and the supply of government management of openness will be lower. Over the past 30 years, the developing world has become much more integrated in the global economy, turning away from older policies associated with import-substitution industrialization and loosening <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>import</b> competition. Exposing one’s economy to the vicissitudes of the international market is a polit-ically risky decision however (Rodrik 1994), and policy reforms aimed at lower-ing barriers to foreign competition can face domestic political and social opposition stemming from the distributive consequences of trade (Rodrik 1997).
