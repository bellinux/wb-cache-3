Fallon called it [...] "one of the most uncomfortable father–son sex talks ever committed to television (and thus, <b>really,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most realistic)", and his colleague Brown said it became [...] "something lovely, open-hearted, and true". Gonzalez deemed it awkward to watch, yet wrote that the scene served to convince her she had [...] "never loved a father-son pair" [...] more.

Frankenheimer, directing his last feature film, described Affleck as having [...] "a very winning, likable quality about him.

[...] He starred opposite Charlize Theron as a hardened criminal, with Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times enjoying the unexpected casting choice: [...] "Affleck often suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of Reindeer Games." [...] He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama Boiler Room (2000). A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck had [...] "traced over" [...] Alec Baldwin's performance in Glengarry Glen Ross, while Peter Rainer of New York Magazine said he [...] "does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next". He then provided the voice of Joseph in the animated [...] In his last film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama Bounce. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "understated intensity and exquisite detail" [...] of his performance: [...] "His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined 'people person' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive." ...|$|E

[...] GameSpot's Ryan MacDonald scored both the Xbox and the GameCube versions 8 out of 10, calling it [...] "a traditional hack-and-slash action game that features great gameplay mechanics, stunning visuals, and lots of extras." [...] IGN's Hilary Goldstein scored it 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "while The Two Towers is fun, it's not <b>really</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> better action games around. It does nothing new {{and there are a}} lot of problems that detract from the experience." [...] He was critical of the targeting system, the camera, the rigid linearity of each level and the inability to issue commands to AI controlled allies. He also wrote [...] "the Xbox version is inferior to the sharp and stunning quality of what was found on PS2. There's a ton of texture problems, poor contrast, and less detail than what's found on the PS2. That's not acceptable for a game coming out two months later and on a system that is easier to program for and can churn out incredible graphics with little effort." [...] GameSpy's David Hodgson scored it 3 out of 5, writing [...] "with the PlayStation 2 being all [...] "inferior" [...] to the Xbox's presumed power, and the two months of extra development time, surely E.A. must have added an extra aiming reticule for the archery, increased the frame rate from 30, sculpted a few more polygons on the main heroes and adversaries, and added reflections to the underwater orcs and other badly realized reflections.

40|$|A work-efficient {{deterministic}} NC {{algorithm is}} presented for finding a maximum matching in a bipartite expander graph with any expansion factor fi ? 1. This improves upon a recently presented deterministic NC maximum matching algorithm which {{is restricted to}} those bipartite expanders with large expansion factors (fi Δ ffl; ffl ? 0), and is not work-efficient [1]. Keywords: Bipartite Matching, Expander Graphs, NC, Network Flow. 1. Introduction Finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite expander graphs has many applications such as routing networks, sorting networks, permutation networks, and path selection.
