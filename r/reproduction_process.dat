5|$|Shortened {{forms of}} this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. Hydrozoa {{have a variety of}} life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. hydra) have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain {{attached}} to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual <b>reproduction</b> <b>process,</b> was observed in both Hydrozoa (Turritopsis dohrnii and Laodicea undulata) and Scyphozoa (Aurelia sp.1). Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.|$|E

25|$|Przewalski {{females are}} able to give birth {{at the age of}} three and have a {{gestation}} period of about 11 to 12 months. Their <b>reproduction</b> <b>process</b> is seasonal and in Mongolia the season is towards the end of May, June or July. Mating stallions do not start looking for mating partners until the age of five. Instinctively, the stallion will look to create his own group of mares or else wander until he finds a group with its own leader. If the stallion finds a group of mares with its own leader, the stallion will usually fight the other leader stallion of the group. The mares will adjust and follow the victor. After birth, the foal can stand almost immediately (only taking about an hour or so) and can walk on its own. The foals drink milk from the mother mare.|$|E

25|$|During {{the winter}} months when {{temperatures}} are below 15°C (60°F) N. americanus adults bury themselves in the soil to overwinter. When temperatures are above 15°C (60°F) they emerge from the soil and begin the mating and <b>reproduction</b> <b>process.</b> Burying beetles are unusual in that both {{the male and female}} take part in raising the young. Male burying beetles often locate carcasses first and then attract a mate. Beetles often fight over the carcass, with usually the largest male and female individuals winning. The victors bury the carcass, the pair mates, and the female lays her eggs in an adjacent tunnel. Within a few days, the larvae develop and both parents feed and tend their young, an unusual activity among insects, but a characteristic shared with the earwig. Brood size usually ranges from one to 30 young, but 12 to 15 is the average size.|$|E

2500|$|Cell {{division}} {{is more complex}} in eukaryotes than in other organisms. Prokaryotic cells such as bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, a process that includes DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Eukaryotic cell division either involves mitosis or a more complex process called meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are sometimes called the two [...] "nuclear division" [...] processes. Binary fission is similar to eukaryote cell reproduction that involves mitosis. Both lead {{to the production of}} two daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell. Meiosis is used for a special cell <b>reproduction</b> <b>process</b> of diploid organisms. It produces four special daughter cells (gametes) which have half the normal cellular amount of DNA. A male and a female gamete can then combine to produce a zygote, a cell which again has the normal amount of chromosomes.|$|E
2500|$|Byrne {{spent about}} two years on the Superman titles before leaving. His dissatisfaction stemmed from his {{perception}} {{that there was a}} lack of [...] "conscious support" [...] for him at DC. Furthering the rift between the company and the artist was the fact that the version of Superman which DC licensed for merchandising was contrary to Byrne's representation in the comic books. Today, much of Byrne's vision for the character has been retained in the DC Comics universe, and has carried over into subsequent television and film adaptations. Byrne's influence can be seen in , the DC Animated Universe and Smallville, and in Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (the scene in which Lois is trapped in a crashing plane during its inaugural flight and is rescued by Superman is reminiscent of a scene created by Byrne in which Lois is embedded with the crew of an experimental spaceplane). During interviews promoting the film Man of Steel, David Goyer acknowledged Byrne's Man of Steel miniseries as an influence, especially Byrne's treatment of the Kryptonian <b>reproduction</b> <b>process.</b> Byrne's influence is also shown in the inaugural episode of Supergirl, when Kara is forced to reveal her existence to the public by saving a crashing airliner.|$|E
