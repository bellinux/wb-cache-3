5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category labels for IQ score ranges {{are specific to}} each brand of test. The test publishers {{do not have a}} uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor do they have a consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into categories of the same size or with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when <b>reporting</b> <b>a</b> test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E

The passage of the hurricane resulted in moderate rainfall of up to 6.02inches (153mm) in Havelock.

Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source <b>reporting</b> <b>a</b> range of six months to two full years. The prolonged healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.|$|E

News reports of the rumored launch included mention of targeting {{the dark side of the}} terminator—Project A119 would also consider this boundary as the target for an explosion.

5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of <b>reporting</b> <b>a</b> lack of sexual attraction.

5|$|Mark's early storylines often {{revolved}} around {{his relationship with}} Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). He was initially wary of getting involved with Kate because of her ex-boyfriend, Declan Napier (Erin Mullally), and the age gap between them. Mark's focus on his work eventually forced him to choose between Kate and Paul's case. Following {{the end of his}} relationship with Kate, Mark had a one-night stand with her best friend Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita). He also faced problems at work after <b>reporting</b> <b>a</b> fellow officer for corruption, which led to his life being threatened. Mark left for witness protection during a special real-time episode. Mark later returned during an eclipse and tried to win Kate back. Following her death, he embarked on a relationship with Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) and three members of his family were introduced. The character has been mostly well received by critics and viewers during his time on the show.|$|E

Although almost two-thirds of those eligible to vote in Edgefield were African Americans, the Democrats were able to suppress the (Republican) African-American vote, <b>reporting</b> <b>a</b> win for Hampton in Edgefield County with over 60 percent of the vote.

5|$|On October2, a {{tropical}} wave spawned {{a tropical}} depression about 815mi (1310km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.

As the ship crossed through the center, it reported winds of 80mph (130km/h), indicating Gail attained hurricane status.

5|$|Shortly after 1700UTC on September22, {{the eye of}} Janet {{passed over}} Barbados.

The flight also reported a minimum barometric pressure of 979mbar (hPa; 28.91inHg). After passing between the islands of Grenada and Carriacou in the morning hours of September23, Janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in the eastern Caribbean Sea. As a result, the hurricane became disorganized, with winds weakening to 90mph (145km/h) by 1200UTC on September23. A U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane entered the hurricane early on September24, <b>reporting</b> <b>a</b> lack of organization, and noting an indiscernible center of circulation with weak rainbands.

The 1999 made-for-TV Canadian film Restless Spirits, a children's film with the alternate title Dead Aviators, uses {{the mystery of}} Nungesser and Coli's disappearance as the key plot device. A young girl, who struggles with her pilot father's death in an aircraft crash years before, visits her grandmother in Newfoundland. While there, she encounters the ghosts of Nungesser and Coli, whose restless spirits constantly relive their own unheralded 1927 crash in a nearby pond. The girl decides to help the pair {{move on to the}} afterlife by assisting them in rebuilding their aircraft and completing their flight so they may be released and, by doing so, works through her own emotional distress over her father's test flight death.
