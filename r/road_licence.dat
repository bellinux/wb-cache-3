A Manurewa, South Auckland resident and a student from James Cook High School he began racing karts as a seven-year-old, and {{caught the attention of}} the New Zealand public when granted a special dispensation to obtain a competition licence to race a saloon car as a 13-year-old. At the time of this dispensation, New Zealanders could not obtain a <b>road</b> <b>licence</b> until turning 15 years old. Dixon was competing at Pukekohe Park Raceway in a one-make series featuring the Nissan Sentra when he rolled the car onto its roof. He caught national attention when TV showed him struggling from the upturned car with a cushion strapped to his back to enable him to reach the pedals, and wiping a tear from his eye.

50|$|Despite showing little {{aptitude}} {{behind the}} wheel while training for his <b>road</b> <b>licence,</b> Hartmann {{went on to become}} one of Hungary's leading competition drivers of the pre-World War II period. He began his racing career in the late 1920s, driving his own privately entered Hupmobile in local circuit and hillclimb events. He soon graduated to a true racing car, buying a Bugatti Type 35B from compatriot Count Tivadar Zichy in 1929. With this and another of his own Bugattis - a Type 37A sports car bought in 1930 - he began to enter more prestigious and challenging European events in addition to those in his home country. Hartmann regularly featured in the top five finishers at most European hillclimb events in the following few years, and in 1930 he took second place overall in the European Mountain Championship series. His performances caught the Bugatti factory's eye and they occasionally lent him a more powerful Type 51, with which he won the hillclimb events at Guggenberg in 1932 and 1933. In addition to racing against the clock Hartmann also participated in a number of Grand Prix circuit races during this period, never failing to finish in the top 10 when mechanical maladies or accidents didn't prevent him from finishing at all.|$|E
50|$|The 1960s was a {{significant}} period of expansion for the sanctuary. In 1963 Griffiths was given a licence to enclose the road between the sanctuary and the creek, and a lease on the Scenic Reserve {{on the banks of}} Flat Rock Creek contiguous with the road. Around this time he installed a neon sign within the <b>road</b> <b>licence</b> area facing onto Flat Rock Creek, which was visible to travellers along the main road. In June 1964, a miniature railway was introduced. Built in Brisbane by James Jackson, the train hauled six passenger cars and operated on an eleven-inch gauge rail loop for 300 metres around the Tomewin Street site. Other elements of this expansion scheme included the construction of an octagonal-shaped Rock Shop (now known as the Spirit of the Outback shop), for which planning approval was given by the Gold Coast City Council in April 1964; and a butterfly display which is no longer extant. Both projects cost £1500. The Rock Shop showcased Griffiths' passion for rock collecting and included the production of jewellery on site. He claimed {{it was the first of}} its type in Australia. The octagonal form of the Rock Shop was replicated in most of the buildings constructed at the sanctuary during the 1960s and into the 1970s, although the Rock Shop Annex constructed in 1965 did not adhere to this precept. Griffiths formed a number of companies during this time and began acquiring additional lands around his sanctuary under company title, including parcels in Tomewin Street opposite the sanctuary for car parking.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the transport sector {{is part of the}} overall development strategies of the ACP States. For most, if not all, the rapid expansion of access routes depends on the right institutional and financial facilities being in place, so that the operation of transport systems can be gradually privatised, and users can become involved in managing their maintenance. Massive reforms Airports, roads and ports are all up for privatisation in many countries. Their return to the private sector is taking the form of operational concessions, co-management and leasing. So far, the three different approaches have been used in 32 ACP countries, mainly in Africa, over the last seven years. The principle of user participation in such reforms, and in improving the management of road networks, is now generally accepted. Some African countries, including Benin, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia, have set up (or re-activated) Roads Committees and Roads Funds. Road users thus finance road maintenance through taxes on petrol, road tolls and <b>road</b> <b>licence</b> fees, and can participate in developing strategies ensuring that road development meets their needs. One of the first toll roads in sub-Saharan Africa to be managed by a private company is between Hillacondji and Cotonou, part of the road that links the Togo border to the old Nigerian capital, Lagos, crossing the entirety of Benin. Such institutional reforms are bearing fruit in some countries. In Zambia, for example, virtually the entire road network has been tarmacked. Similar trends are on track with railroads, with the concessionary approach being used as far as Southern Africa. The operation of some railway lines has been handed to private companies, without ownership changing hands: Malawi was the first to adopt this strategy, and published its call for tenders on the Internet! In West Africa, the operation of the railway between Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) {{is in the hands of}} a private company, Sitarail. On average each month, it runs 108 goods trains, on a daily basis, on this two-way route. In 1996, it moved 480 000 tonnes of merchandise. Abdel Aziz Thiam, director of Sitarail: 'We are seeing an upward trend in volume of cotton, fruit, dry vegetables and, in particular, poultry and livestock, for all of which Côte d'Ivoire is still heavily dependent on Sahelian countries. ' The gradual transfer to the private sector of management tasks for the running and maintenance of transport networks has many advantages, according to the World Bank. They include improved productivity and quality in service, lower costs for users, and reduced deficits for public bodies. These are the first benefits of many which ? according to current thinking - privatisation holds in store for the African transport sector.

5000|$|One of {{the unusual}} {{aspects of the}} Aldenham {{overhaul}} concept was the [...] "Works Float" [...] system. As chassis generally took less time to overhaul than did the bodies, this {{would have resulted in}} chassis cluttering up the works awaiting completed bodies. This required the number of bodies in the overhaul system to be greater than the number of chassis in the works. To provide this, a number of vehicle identifications became part of the works float and disappeared off the road, sometimes for years. Effectively, these buses ceased to exist except on paper, to provide the necessary spare components to allow the works float system to operate. This system permitted the number of <b>road</b> <b>licences</b> held to be less than the number of buses in existence, the unlicensed vehicles effectively being the vehicles under overhaul - a considerable financial saving. A system of separate chassis and body numbers was utilised to keep track of these major components. The works float system ceased in the mid-1980s when the practice of body separation was abandoned.|$|R

John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics is intended to provide a service for those working on the history of modern Wales. It arises from a belief that the quantitative element is a necessary and important part of the historical record; from an awareness that it was an aspect that was particularly inaccessible for scholars of Welsh history; and from a conviction that some encouragement in the use of quantitative material was necessary. It is modelled on the two volumes dedicated to British historical statistics: Mitchell, B. R. and Deane, P. (1962) Abstract of British historical statistics and Mitchell, B. R. and Jones, H. G.

40|$|The study {{contributes}} {{to an international}} survey carried out in 16 countries: Australia, Brazil, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sweden(Shaw & Watson, 2010). The international survey was initiated by the Political Study Institute of London as an extended geographical replication of the original study of Hillman & al (1990). The general objective {{of this study is}} to investigate how children's independent mobility develops between age 7 - 15. The degree of independent mobility is assessed through the examination of children's statements about six licences related to outside trips without adult supervision. The objective is to provide a detailed picture of the current state of independent mobility in primary and secondary school children of French Brittany (North-West of France). In this respect, the study {{contributes to}} an international survey carried out in 16 countries (Shaw & Watson, 2010). The international survey was initiated by the Political Study Institute of London as an extended geographical replication of the original study of Hillman & al (1990). Method A total of 947 children participated in the French survey. Specifically, in primary school 484 children [...] 48, 8 % girls, 51, 2 % boys [...] filled up the questionnaire, age ranging from 6 to 12, mean = 8, 79 (sd = 1, 27). In secondary school 463 young people [...] 49, 7 % girls, 50, 3 % boys [...] responded to the questionnaire, age ranging from 10 to 16, mean = 12, 9 (sd = 1, 29). The survey was conducted in different types of living environment varying in relation to the size and density of the dwelling area. Five types of areas were considered: (1) inner district of a major city, (2) suburban area of a major city, (3) small town, (4) rural market town and (5) rural area. In the French survey, the five types of areas were selected in the same region, namely the district (département) of Ille-et-Vilaine in French Brittany. Therefore, the survey design, which gathered data from different types of areas, was likely to provide a comprehensive picture of the independent mobility of the children living in that particular region. Children's independent mobility was assessed through the examination of six licences: (1) <b>Licence</b> to cross <b>roads</b> alone, (2) <b>Licence</b> to travel to and from school alone, (3) Licence to go on their own to places other than school, (4) Licence to cycle on main <b>roads,</b> (5) <b>Licence</b> to use buses, (6) Licence to go out after dark. Results The comparison of the licences granted by parents to Psc and to Ssc reveals marked difference for all the six licences. This denotes important changes in the parental attitude towards these children's independent mobility within the considered age range. Interestingly the hierarchy of the six licences is almost the same for the two groups. For both groups the licence to cross main roads is the most frequently granted, whereas licence to go out after dark is the least granted. Even in the secondary school, only a few French children are allowed to go out after dark. The analysis of the children's responses also puts forward that independent mobility develop markedly after 11 years when children are in secondary school. Specifically, four of the six licences are held by a large majority of the secondary school children: to go to other places than school on their own, to cross main roads, to use public transport, and to cycle on main roads. However, only one third of these older children declared to go to and from school on their own. This result is probably due to the size of the secondary school catchment areas which were particularly large in four of the five survey areas. Therefore, the distances from the children's homes to secondary school constrained the older children to use the school bus or to be driven by their parents. The primary school children's independent mobility is particularly restricted; four of the six licences examined were hold by less than one third of these children. The licence to go to other places than school is the most frequently mentioned by the 7 -to- 11 -year olds. But only half of primary school children can benefit from such a basic and critical licence that can be seen as a prerequisite to the development of activities independently from adults in the dwelling area. For the other half of the primary school children, this result supports the idea that most out-of-school activities are likely to take place in adult-controlled settings, where children must be accompanied by their parents. Both primary and secondary school children claim to have a particular licence more often than parents declare to grant their children that licence. The differences between children's and parents' responses are particularly obvious as regard to the licence to ride on main roads and, to a lesser degree, the licence to go out after dark. A cluster analysis permitted to isolate five contrasted types of independent mobility defined by various combinations of licences ranging from a quasi-total dependent mobility to the largest independent mobility. Age is the principal factor significantly associated with each of the five clusters, whereas gender is only associated to one cluster. The type of area and the children's perception of safety in their local area also seem to account for the nature and degree of independent mobility. Overall, these results support the view that a complex array of factors intervenes in the development of children independent mobility, including environmental attributes of the living context such as city size, density and outdoor urban facilities...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Concern {{and action}} for rural road safety is {{relatively}} new in Australia {{in comparison to the}} field of traffic safety as a whole. In 2003, a program of research was begun by the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety - Queensland (CARRS-Q) and the Rural Health Research Unit (RHRU) at James Cook University to investigate factors contributing to serious rural road crashes in the North Queensland region. This project was funded by the Premier’s Department, Main Roads Department, Queensland Transport, QFleet, Queensland Rail, Queensland Ambulance Service, Department of Natural Resources and Queensland Police Service. Additional funding was provided by NRMA Insurance for a PhD scholarship. In-kind support was provided through the four hospitals used for data collection, namely Cairns Base Hospital, The Townsville Hospital, Mount Isa Hospital and Atherton Hospital. [...] - The primary aim of the project was to: Identify human factors related to the occurrence of serious traffic incidents in rural and remote areas of Australia, and to the trauma suffered by persons {{as a result of these}} incidents, using a sample drawn from a rural and remote area in North Queensland. [...] - The data and analyses presented in this report are the core findings from two broad studies: a general examination of fatalities and casualties from rural and remote crashes for the period 1 March 2004 until 30 June 2007, and a further linked case-comparison study of hospitalised patients compared with a sample of non-crash-involved drivers. [...] - • Method: The study was undertaken in rural North Queensland, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) statistical divisions of North Queensland, Far North Queensland and North-West Queensland. Urban areas surrounding Townsville, Thuringowa and Cairns were not included. The study methodology was centred on serious crashes, as defined by a resulting hospitalisation for 24 hours or more and/or a fatality. Crashes meeting this criteria within the North Queensland region between 1 March 2004 and 30 June 2007 were identified through hospital records and interviewed where possible. Additional data was sourced from coroner’s reports, the Queensland Transport road crash database, the Queensland Ambulance Service and the study hospitals in the region. [...] - This report is divided into chapters corresponding to analyses conducted on the collected crash and casualty data. [...] - Chapter 3 presents an overview of all crashes and casualties identified during the study period. Details are presented in regard to the demographics and road user types of casualties; the locations, times, types, and circumstances of crashes; along with the contributing circumstances of crashes. [...] - Chapter 4 presents the results of summary statistics for all casualties for which an interview was able to be conducted. Statistics are presented separately for drivers and riders, passengers, pedestrians and cyclists. Details are also presented separately for drivers and riders crashing in off-road and on-road settings. Results from questionnaire data are presented in relation to demographics; the experience of the crash in narrative form; vehicle characteristics and maintenance; trip characteristics (e. g. purpose and length of journey; periods of fatigue and monotony; distractions from driving task); driving history; alcohol and drug use; medical history; driving attitudes, intentions and behaviour; attitudes to enforcement; and experience of road safety advertising. [...] - Chapter 5 compares the above-listed questionnaire results between on-road crash-involved casualties and interviews conducted in the region with non-crash-involved persons. Direct comparisons as well as age and sex adjusted comparisons are presented. [...] - Chapter 6 presents information on those casualties who were admitted to one of the study hospitals during the study period. Brief information is given regarding the demographic characteristics of these casualties. Emergency services’ data is used to highlight the characteristics of patient retrieval and transport to and between hospitals. The major injuries resulting from the crashes are presented for each region of the body and analysed by vehicle type, occupant type, seatbelt status, helmet status, alcohol involvement and nature of crash. Estimates are provided of the costs associated with in-hospital treatment and retrieval. [...] - Chapter 7 describes the characteristics of the fatal casualties and the nature and circumstances of the crashes. Demographics, <b>road</b> user types, <b>licence</b> status, crash type and contributing factors for crashes are presented. Coronial data is provided in regard to contributing circumstances (including alcohol, drugs and medical conditions), cause of death, resulting injuries, and restraint and helmet use. [...] - Chapter 8 presents the results of a comparison between casualties’ crash descriptions and police-attributed crash circumstances. The relative frequency of contributing circumstances are compared both broadly within the categories of behavioural, environmental, vehicle related, medical and other groupings and specifically for circumstances within these groups. [...] - Chapter 9 reports on the associated research projects which have been undertaken on specific topics related to rural road safety. [...] - Finally, Chapter 10 reports on the conclusions and recommendations made from the program of research. [...] • Major Recommendations : From the findings of these analyses, a number of major recommendations were made: + Male drivers and riders - Male drivers and riders should continue to be the focus of interventions, given their very high representation among rural and remote road crash fatalities and serious injuries. [...] - - The group of males aged between 30 and 50 years comprised the largest number of casualties and must also be targeted for change if there is to be a meaningful improvement in rural and remote road safety. [...] - + Motorcyclists - Single vehicle motorcycle crashes constitute over 80...|$|R
