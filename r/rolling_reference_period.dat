When comparing simulations {{with each other}} and with observations it is standard practice to compare temperature anomalies with respect to a <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> It is not always appreciated that the choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> can affect conclusions, both about the skill of simulations of past climate, and about the magnitude of expected future changes in climate. For example, observed global temperatures over the past decade are towards the lower end of the range of CMIP 5 simulations irrespective of what <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> is used, but exactly where they lie in the model distribution varies with the choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> Additionally, we demonstrate that projections of when particular temperature levels are reached, for example 2 K above ‘pre-industrial’, change by up to a decade depending on the choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> In this article we discuss some of the key issues that arise when using anomalies relative to a <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> to generate climate projections. We highlight that there is no perfect choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> When evaluating models against observations, a long <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> should generally be used, but how long depends on the quality of the observations available. The IPCC AR 5 choice to use a 1986 - 2005 <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> for future global temperature projections was reasonable, but a case-by-case approach is needed for different purposes and when assessing projections of different climate variables.

Our revised <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> (1961 – 90) mass balance of 5448 Gt a– 1 is substantially greater than the 021 Gt a– 1 assessed by PARCA, but consistent with a recent, fully independent, input–output estimate of high-elevation mass balance (41 61 Gt a– 1).

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} how different <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> (i. e., calibration periods) of climate data used to estimate drought indices influence regional drought assessments. Specifically, we investigate the influences of different <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> on historical drought characteristics, such as the trend, frequency, intensity and spatial extent, using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) with a 12 -month lag (SPEI- 12), which was estimated from the datasets of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) and the University of Delaware (UDEL). For the 1901 – 1957 (P 1) and 1958 – 2014 (P 2) estimation periods, three different types of <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> are used to compute the SPEI: P 1 and P 2 together, P 1 and P 2 separately and P 1 only. Focusing on East Asia, Europe, the United States and West Africa, {{we find that the}} influence of the <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> is significant in East Asia and West Africa, with dominant drying trends from P 1 to P 2. The <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> influenced the assessment of drought characteristics, particularly the severity and spatial extent, whereas the influence on the frequency was relatively small. Finally, self-calibration, which is the most common practice for indices such as the SPEI, tends to underestimate the drought severity and spatial extent relative to the other approaches used in this study. Although the conclusions drawn in this study are limited by the use of two global datasets, they highlight the need for clarification of the <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> in drought assessments to better understand regional drought characteristics and the associated temporal changes, particularly under climate change scenarios...|$|R

We aimed to evaluate {{the effect of a}} 1 -month (RP- 1) vs. a 12 -month (RP- 12) <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> in the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP- 14) questionnaire. Using a randomized cross-over design, RP- 1 and RP- 12 OHIP- 14 questionnaires were administered, 1 month apart, to two samples of Finnish adults, namely people awaiting orthognathic surgery (n = 104) and non-patient workers (n = 111). The effect of the <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> was computed by subtracting RP- 1 OHIP- 14 severity scores from RP- 12 OHIP- 14 severity scores (ΔRP). Potential order effects were assessed by comparing ΔRP between groups completing the RP- 1 vs. the RP- 12 questionnaire first. Mean OHIP- 14 severity scores were slightly higher when the RP- 12 questionnaire was administered first, but mean ΔRP values were below the value of 2. 5 considered clinically meaningful, and all 95 % confidence intervals for ΔRP included zero. No order effects in the OHIP- 14 severity scores were observed. Therefore, although a standardized <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> of 12 months is recommended, in population surveys the use of a shorter <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> does not appear to influence responses.
