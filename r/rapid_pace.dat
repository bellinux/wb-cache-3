40|$|Objectives. The {{present study}} {{examined}} left ventricular (LV) and myocyte contractile performance and electrophysiologic variables after long-term digoxin treatment {{in a model}} of LV failure. Background. A fundamental therapeutic agent for patients with chronic LV dysfunction is the cardiac glycoside digoxin. However, whether digoxin has direct effects on myocyte contractile function and electrophysiologic properties {{in the setting of}} chronic LV dysfunction remains unexplored. Methods. Left ventricular and isolated myocyte function and electrophysiologic variables were examined in five control dogs, five dogs after the development of long-term <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> (<b>rapid</b> <b>pacing,</b> 220 beats/min, 4 weeks) and five dogs with <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> given digoxin (0. 25 mg/day) during the <b>pacing</b> period (<b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> and digoxin). Results. Left ventricular ejection fraction decreased in the dogs with <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> compared with that in control dogs (30 ± 2 % vs. 68 ± 3 %, p < 0. 05) and was higher with digoxin than that in the <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> group (38 ± 3 %, p = 0. 038). Left ventricular end-diastolic volume increased in the <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> group compared with the control group (84 ± 6 ml vs. 59 ± 7 ml, p < 0. 05) and remained increased with digoxin (79 ± 6 ml). Isolated myocyte shortening velocity decreased in the <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> group compared with the control group (37 ± 1 μm/s vs. 59 ± 1 μm/s, p < 0. 05) and increased with digoxin compared with <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> (46 ± 1 μm/s, p < 0. 05). Action potential maximal upstroke velocity was diminished in the <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> group compared with the control group (135 ± 6 V/s vs. 163 ± 9 V/s, p < 0. 05) and increased with digoxin compared with <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> (155 ± 12 V/s, p < 0. 05). Action potential duration increased in the <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> group compared with the control group (247 ± 10 vs. 216 ± 6 ms, p < 0. 05) and decreased with digoxin compared with <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> (219 ± 12 ms, p < 0. 05). Conclusions. In this model of rapid pacing-induced LV failure, digoxin treatment improved LV pump function, enhanced isolated myocyte contractile performance and normalized myocyte action potential characteristics. This study provides unique evidence to suggest that the cellular basis for improved LV pump function with digoxin treatment in the setting of LV failure has a direct and beneficial effect on myocyte contractile function and electrophysiologic measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{progression}} {{of congestive heart}} failure (CHF) is left ventricular (LV) myocardial remodeling. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to tissue remodeling and therefore MMP inhibition may serve as a useful therapeutic target in CHF. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition favorably affects LV myocardial remodeling in CHF. This study examined the effects of specific MMP inhibition, ACE inhibition, and combined treatment on LV systolic and diastolic function in a model of CHF. Pigs were randomly assigned to five groups: 1) <b>rapid</b> atrial <b>pacing</b> (240 beats/min) for 3 weeks (n = 8); 2) ACE inhibition (fosinopril, 2. 5 mg/kg b. i. d. orally) and <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> (n = 8); 3) MMP inhibition (PD 166793 2 mg/kg/day p. o.) and <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> (n = 8); 4) combined ACE and MMP inhibition (2. 5 mg/kg b. i. d. and 2 mg/kg/day, respectively) and <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> (n = 8); and 5) controls (n = 9). LV peak wall stress increased by 2 -fold with <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> and was reduced in all treatment groups.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{demonstrate}} {{mechanisms by which}} <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> can cause conduction block without terminating reentry. Background. <b>Rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> can fail to terminate or can accelerate tachycardias in patients. Mechanisms for these responses are poorly understood. Methods. We studied reentry in the canine atrial tricuspid ring and a left ventricular ring in vitro in 12 preparations. Activations were recorded from 10 sites around the ring, and monophasic action potentials were recorded from critical sites of block. <b>Rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> at cycle lengths that intermittently caused conduction block was performed at multiple sites. Results. Action potential alternans contributed to block of an orthodromic impulse during <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing.</b> When pacing continued for two stimuli after orthodromic block, a second episode of block could reverse the direction of tachycardia. Continued pacing at this site was likely to produce block of an antidromic impulse, which may initiate double-wave reentry. Double-wave reentry could be sustained or nonsustained. Its cycle length was 56 % to 77 % of the single-wave cycle length. The ratio of double-wave cycle length to single-wave cycle length was inversely correlated with the relative excitable gap (p < 0. 01). Double-wave reentry can be a mechanism for persistent cycle length alteration during tachycardia. Conclusions. Successful termination of reentry by <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> required block of an orthodromic impulse and stopping pacing within one stimulus after orthodromic block. Reversal of reentry makes the circuit resistant to termination from this site of pacing. Antidromic block can cause acceleration due to double-wave re...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Heart {{failure is}} the final common pathway for most forms of heart disease, and is {{characterized}} by a reduced energy status. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MV 02) is closely related to the main determinants of systolic function (heart rate, pressure and contractility). The aim {{of the study was to}} compare myocardial blood flow, metabolism and mechanical efficiency in <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> induced heart failure in dogs. Methods: 5 dogs were paced for 3 weeks at 240 bpm, with regular follow up of hemodynamic characteristics.

40|$|AIMS: While {{successful}} termination by pacing {{of organized}} atrial tachycardias {{has been observed}} in patients, single site <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> has not yet led to conclusive results for the termination of atrial fibrillation (AF). The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate a novel atrial septal pacing algorithm for the termination of AF in a biophysical model of the human atria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sustained AF was generated in a model based on human magnetic resonance images and membrane kinetics. <b>Rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> was applied from the septal area following a dual-stage scheme: (i) <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> for 10 - 30 s at pacing intervals 62 - 70 % of AF cycle length (AFCL), (ii) slow pacing for 1. 5 s at 180 % AFCL, initiated by a single stimulus at 130 % AFCL. Atrial fibrillation termination success rates were computed. A mean success rate for AF termination of 10. 2 % was obtained for <b>rapid</b> septal <b>pacing</b> only. The addition of the slow pacing phase increased this rate to 20. 2 %. At an optimal pacing cycle length (64 % AFCL) up to 29 % of AF termination was observed.

40|$|Background Prolonged {{periods of}} atrial {{fibrillation}} or <b>rapid</b> atrial <b>pacing</b> induce shortening of the atrial {{effective refractory period}} (AERP), which {{is thought to be}} related to the lower success rates of various antifibrillatory treatments when the arrhythmia has lasted for a longer period of time.

40|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} of resetting has been studied in several experimental and clinical rhythms, {{it has not been}} systematically analyzed in ventricular tachycardia. To define the incidence and determinants of resetting as well as its relation to ventricular tachycardia termination, the response to programmed stimulation was prospectively studied during 78 electrically induced episodes of sustained, uniform ventricular tachycardia (mean cycle length 365 ± 59 ms) in 53 patients. Single and double ventricular extrastimuli were introduced during 78 and 39 episodes of ventricular tachycardia, respectively. <b>Rapid</b> ventricular <b>pacing</b> was performed during 27 episodes. Resetting occurred in response to single ventricular extrastimuli in 43 (55 %) of 78 ventricular tachycardias, to double extrastimuli in 31 (79 %) of 39 ventricular tachycardias and to <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> in 23 (85 %) of 27 ventricular tachycardias. No ventricular tachycardia characteristic distinguished those tachycardias that were reset from those not reset. Termination of ventricular tachycardia occurred in 7 (9 %) of 78 episodes with single ventricular extra- Stimuli, 14 (36 %) of 39 episodes with double ventricular extrastimuli and 13 (48 %) of 27 episodes with <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing.</b> Termination was less frequent than resetting with both single (9 versus 55 %) and double (36 versus 79 %) extrastimuli, as well as <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> (48 versus 85 %).

The tachycardia had a right bundle branch block and superior axis configuration with the earliest site of endocardial activation in the posterolateral left ventricle. At this site, the left ventricular electrogram during the tachycardia displayed two deflections with distinctly different responses to <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing.</b> During <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> from the right ventricular apex, one deflection was transiently entrained, representing activation of the ventricle distal to a region of slow conduction in the reentrant circuit. However, the other deflection was not entrained and arose from activation proximal to this region, At a critically <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> rate, interruption of the tachycardia was associated with conduction block {{in the region of}} slow conduction, as demonstrated by dissociation of the two deflections on the posterolateral left ventricular electrogram. At pacing rates that transiently entrained but did not terminate the tachycardia, decremental properties of conduction were demonstrated in the region of slow conduction, but not {{in the rest of the}} reentrant circuit. These responses of the posterolateral left ventricular electrogram to pacing during ventricular tachycardia strongly suggest that the recordings bracketed a discrete region of slow conduction in the left ventricle that was critical for the maintenance of ventricular tachycardia.

That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol ④. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number–name designation, ④ Vesta, as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, (4) Vesta, which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as 4) Vesta and 4, Vesta, was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949. Today, either Vesta, or, more commonly, 4 Vesta, is used.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of November 7, the eye began to {{reappear}} and the storm turned towards the northwest and the foreword motion began to rapidly increase. Later that morning, Florence had developed a large, 35 to 40mi (55 to 65km/h) wide eye and the foreword motion continued to increase. The intensification continued and by the afternoon hours, Florence was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h). A strong extratropical cyclone located {{to the north of}} Florence was causing the storm to move towards the northwest at a <b>rapid</b> <b>pace</b> of 30mph (48km/h). Operationally, Florence was reported to have peaked at that intensity, but post season analysis determined that the storm reached its peak intensity just short of major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higherstatus late on November 7. By {{the morning of}} November 8, Florence weakened slightly to Category 1 status. The large system to the north continued to cause Florence to move at 58mph (93km/h). Since the storm was very close to a cold front, Florence was expected to rapidly transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later that morning, Florence was absorbed into the extratropical cyclone while still maintaining hurricane-force winds.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: <b>Rapid</b> {{ventricular}} <b>pacing</b> {{produces a}} reliable model of heart failure. Cessation after 4 weeks of <b>rapid</b> ventricular <b>pacing</b> results in <b>rapid</b> normalization of left ventricular function, but the left ventricle remains persistently dilated. We present novel data {{that show that}} prolonged <b>rapid</b> ventricular <b>pacing</b> (10 weeks) creates a model of chronic left ventricular dysfunction. Methods: In 9 dogs undergoing 10 weeks of <b>rapid</b> ventricular <b>pacing,</b> left ventricular function and volumes were serially assessed by using 2 -dimensional echocardiography and pressure-volume analysis for 12 weeks after cessation of pacing. Results: Increased end-diastolic volume and decreased systolic and diastolic function were seen {{at the end of}} pacing. By 2 weeks of recovery from <b>rapid</b> ventricular <b>pacing,</b> end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction were partially recovered but did not improve further thereafter. Load-independent and load-sensitive indices of function obtained by pressure-volume analysis at 8 and 12 weeks of recovery confirmed a persistence of both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. In addition, left ventricular mass increased with pacing and remained elevated at 8 and 12 weeks of recovery. Four of these dogs studied at 6 months of recovery showed similar left ventricular abnormalities. Conclusion: Ten weeks of <b>rapid</b> ventricular <b>pacing</b> creates a long-term model of left ventricular dysfunction. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2000; 119 : 834 - 41...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Bepridil is a multi-ion channel blocker {{similar to}} amiodarone. Recent {{clinical}} {{studies have indicated}} that bepridil shows a favorable efficacy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the effectiveness of bepridil for electrical remodeling induced by rapid atrial stimulation particularly in the acute-phase. Methods and Results: We studied 18 pigs subjected to right atrial appendage <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> at 500 beats/min for 3 hours that were randomly assigned to the absence or presence of bepridil administration for 14 days. They were divided into 2 groups, an atrial pacing only group (PG; n = 10) and an atrial pacing plus bepridil group (PBG; n = 8). We measured the effective refractory period (ERP) at the right atrial free wall (RAFW), the right atrial appendage (RAA) and the left atrial free wall (LAFW), as well as the monophasic action potential duration at 90 % (MAPD 90) in RAA during the <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing</b> phase and recovery phase. In the PG, the ERP decreased gradually at all atrial sites during the 3 hour phase of <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing.</b> In contrast, the shortening of the ERP was suppressed significantly at the RAFW and LAFW in the PBG. The MAPD 90 was also shortened by <b>rapid</b> atrial <b>pacing</b> in the PG. This shortening was suppressed significantly in the PBG. We evaluated the effect of bepridil on the inducibility of AF during all time spans. The mean number of AF occurrences in the PBG was significantly fewer than in the PG. (2 : 1 ± 2 : 4 vs. 8 : 5 ± 7 : 0, p < 0 : 05) Conclusions: Bepridil prevented the shortening of the ERP and MAPD 90 induced by <b>rapid</b> atrial <b>pacing</b> in the acute phase. The results of this study might explain the efficacy of bepridil for preventing the recurrence of paroxysmal AF...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{investigated}} {{the changes in}} coronary vascular resistance caused by angiotensin II, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 or 2 receptor (AT 1 R and AT 2 R, respectively) antagonists in chronic heart failure (CHF). BACKGROUNDAngiotensin II is an intense vasoconstrictor, and increased angiotensin II in CHF might exert significant vasoconstriction. METHODSEleven dogs were studied. Before and after three and five weeks of <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing,</b> coronary flow dynamics were evaluated by the coronary pressure–flow relationship (PFR) in long diastole, before and after intracoronary injection of angiotensin II, the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat, the AT 1 R antagonist L 158, 809 or the AT 2 R antagonist PD 123319. RESULTSBefore <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing,</b> angiotensin II reduced the slope of PFR (1. 16 ± 0. 08 to 0. 81 ± 0. 07 ml/min/ 100 g left ventricular mass per mm Hg; p < 0. 01) and increased the perfusion pressure at which coronary flow ceased (zero-flow pressure [Pf= 0]), whereas enalaprilat did not change either of them. After <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing,</b> angiotensin II did not change the slope or Pf= 0. In contrast, enalaprilat increased the slope (three weeks: 1. 20 ± 0. 05 to 1. 50 ± 0. 03; five weeks: 1. 25 ± 0. 19 to 1. 37 ± 0. 08; both p < 0. 05) and decreased Pf= 0 after three weeks of pacing, but not after five weeks. Pretreatment with the bradykinin antagonist HOE- 140 attenuated the enalaprilat-induced increase in coronary blood flow. L 158, 809 and PD 123319 had no effect {{both before and after}} <b>rapid</b> <b>pacing.</b> CONCLUSIONSThis suggests that the coronary vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin II would disappear and the vasodilatory effect of the ACE inhibitor, partly through bradykinin, would be enhanced in the early stage of CHF...|$|R
