40|$|In America, {{directness}} {{and simplicity}} are recommended for efficient information exchange, in <b>routine</b> letters. <b>Correspondence</b> typically emphasizes the first, and often only, paragraph. Rarely would "quality" business letters begin with irrelevant information or ideas having {{little to do}} with main points developed at the end. As the previous sample points out, however, this ideology does not apply in Japan. Peculiarities such as seasonal references, formalities and humble remarks, just to mention a few, indicate significant differences with U. S. standards. My thesis focuses on these differences, pointing to the role Japanese culture plays in Japanese communicative styles. Additionally, with an increasing number of Japan-U. S. joint ventures and business deals, there follows an increase in correspondence between the two countries...|$|R

40|$|Spelling {{skills of}} 439 college {{business}} students were assessed using a conventional spelling test comprised of 25 business-related words and 25 other commonly used words. As a group, business students {{scored higher than}} previously established high school norms, although {{a substantial number of}} business students demonstrated spell-ing skills below the ninth grade level. Students with high college grade-point averages, who ranked high in their high school graduating class, who are female, and who cur-rently work only a few hours outside the home tended to be better spellers. Recommen-dations are offered to business educators concerned about their students’spelling skills. t is not uncommon for dissatisfied consumers to complain to busi-Inesses and for businesses to respond to those complaints with per-sonalized letters (Martin & Smart, 1988). Yet many business students lack the fundamental spelling skills needed to respond to <b>routine</b> busi-ness <b>correspondence</b> without aids such as dictionaries and spelling software.

40|$|A {{model of}} the viscoelastic/damage {{response}} of a filament-wound spherical vessel used for long-term pressure containment is developed. The matrix material of the composite system {{is assumed to be}} linearly viscoelastic. Internal accumulated damage based upon a quadratic relationship between transverse modulus and maximum circumferential strain is postulated. The resulting nonlinear problem is solved by an iterative <b>routine.</b> The elastic-viscoelastic <b>correspondence</b> is employed to produce, in the Laplace domain, the associated elastic solution for the maximum circumferential strain which is inverted by the method of collocation to yield the time-dependent solution. Results obtained with the model are compared to experimental observations...|$|R
5|$|Bute's father, John, Lord Mount Stuart, died a {{few months}} after he was born and as a young child he was brought up first by his mother, the former Lady Elizabeth McDougall-Crichton, and later by his {{paternal}} grandfather, John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute. He travelled widely across Europe before attending Cambridge University. He contracted an eye condition and remained partially sighted {{for the rest of his}} life. Having inherited large estates across Britain, he married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818, and together they lived a relatively secluded life in Mount Stuart House in Scotland, one of Bute's four seats. Bute was dour but industrious, with a flair for land management. He focused his daily <b>routine</b> around extensive <b>correspondence</b> with his estate managers, making biennial tours of his lands around the country. The couple did not conceive any children, and Maria died in 1841. Bute remarried four years later, to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, and she gave birth to Bute's only child, John, in 1847.|$|R

40|$|Email and e-communications The project {{commenced}} as {{a review}} of the use of email with my student groups following an experience of a student who had sent over 100 emails during 6 months of an online course, sometimes up to four emails in a day. In one of the exchanges I noted a comment embedded in the text which said, “It was good to talk with you on the phone today …”. This made me realise that perhaps there is merit in considering breaking out of a <b>routine</b> method of <b>correspondence,</b> and to vary the teaching and support methods. The project therefore evolved into an examination of e-communications in general, and then the use of so called Web 2. 0 technologies (O’Reilly, 2004) as a tool to support my students. Making the technology fit the pedagogy This led me to question whether technology was influencing, perhaps even determining my teaching style, or whether in fact the underlying pedagogy was the same but maybe I was adapting the technology to suit the circumstances I encountered. This led to a number of joint exercises with other COLMSCT Fellows on this theme where we explored and promoted different views on the subject. I will report on this later in this document...|$|R

40|$|Digitized {{microfilm}} {{of correspondence}} and papers from the Andrew Dickson White collection. Among the <b>routine</b> <b>correspondence</b> reflecting White's ministerial duties in Berlin are reports from Cornell that administrative affairs {{had reached a}} crisis in his absence. White announced his intention to resign the university presidency rather than leave his Berlin post, and a letter to Gilman on July 8 and one from Tyler on September 21 indicated his search for a man for the presidency that he could happily endorse. Letters from the trustees urged him to return, and he eventually agreed to return to Ithaca {{before the beginning of}} fall term in 1881. In a letter on August 6 Fuertes sketched a handsome stone arch bridge that he proposed to erect across Cascadilla Gorge; on September 8 Julius Chambers reported the successful chartering of a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa at Cornell; and on October 30 Russel explained the sources of newspaper allegations of irreligion at the university. Many correspondents discussed the fall elections, and a former student predicted that Garfield would win and appoint White his Secretary of State. A Boston woman expressed concern for the Indians in a letter of November 17, and suggested that Carl Schurz was not the man to deal with problems of personal liberty and American citizenship...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a 'one-stop' cholesterol clinic implementing a regime {{based on the}} Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4 S) in patients with established coronary heart disease in a district general hospital. The clinic {{has been established in}} collaboration with the cardiac rehabilitation centre. It was commissioned as an audit project by the purchasing authority, Walsall Health, a need having been shown in a previous audit. In the new clinic, audit is inbuilt, rather than being carried out as a separate retrospective exercise, and undertaken prospectively for all patients. Central to this is a database, used for <b>routine</b> <b>correspondence</b> and administration, as well as monitoring outcome. This application of information technology has improved clinical practice. Attendance at the clinic has been excellent. Half the consultations have resulted in therapeutic interventions, many of which may otherwise have been missed. Over 50 % of patients were eligible for lipid-lowering medication under the protocol. Cholesterol targets based on 4 S were achieved but with much lower drug doses, which may have major cost implications. Cholesterol levels measured within 24 hours of admission for myocardial infarction were poor predictors of results obtained after convalescence. After the clinic visit, most patients were taking aspirin plus one or two other secondary prevention treatments. Guidelines have been issued to primary care. Future plans for audit links with general practitioners, integration of the metabolic and cardiological assessment of survivors of myocardial infarction, and for long-term monitoring of clinical events in treated patients are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Technologists {{predict that}} {{electronic}} information dissemination {{will create a}} paperless work environment. In spite of such predictions, paper-based internal communication will remain the primary medium for disseminating information in organizations for decades to come. However, electronic technology {{will have an impact}} on paper information production that may be more profound than changes following word processing's introduction. Previously unavailable for everyday production to enhance word meaning, certain graphic techniques now can be used to access readers' preconditioned symbol meanings to increase comprehension of <b>routine</b> <b>correspondence</b> and information internalization. This quasi-experimental field study examines interactions among laser-printer graphic treatment and communication variables as contributors to explaining variance in comprehension. Set Multiple Regression/Correlation analysis identifies significant variance explained by conditional relationships between near-typeset quality text and readers' self-interest and between near-typeset quality text and text's readability. The conditional relationship of near-typeset quality and self-interest shows increase in reader comprehension at a greater rate than the comprehension increase rate attributed to the reader's self-interest increase alone. This suggests that conditional relationships may be accessing an internal judgment process interpreting greater self-interest in near-typeset printed text. The conditional relationship between near-typeset quality and readability reveals that at more difficult reading levels comprehension is greater for near-typeset text. The significance of this relationship indicates that an internal judgment process is involved rather than the difference being attributed to legibility treatment. The strength of these conditional relationships suggests that planning for communication policies and practices should be a part of organizational strategic planning in the same ways as are financial analysis, operations planning, or human resource management...|$|E
