5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E

Syro was released on the Warp label on 23 September 2014 and the cover artwork, which <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> a tax receipt, is by the Designers Republic brand. A limited-edition box set version of the album was released through the Bleep label, limited to 200 copies. Interested buyers were required to enter a lottery to become eligible.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of the twelve books of La Fontaine's Fables extended from 1668 to 1694. The stories {{in the first six}} of these derive for the most part from Aesop and Horace and are pithily told in free verse. Those in the later editions are often taken from more recent sources or from translations of Eastern stories and are told at greater length. The deceptively simple verses are easily memorised, yet display deep insights into human nature. Many of the lines have entered the French language as standard phrases, often proverbial. The fables are also distinguished by their occasionally ironical ambivalence. The fable of “The Sculptor and the Statue of Jupiter” (IX.6), for example, <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> a satire on superstition, but its moralising conclusion that “All men, as far as in them lies,/Create realities of dreams” might equally be applied to religion as a whole.|$|E

500|$|Having a Rave Up was {{released}} in the US on 15 November 1965 by the Yardbirds' American label, Epic Records. The album cover photo shows the group posing in matching black suits in a mock performance; Yardbirds' biographer Adam Clayson compares it to [...] "more of a tea dance than a rave-up". [...] Clapton, who left the band eight months earlier, is not pictured on the album cover. The liner note <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> ad copy, with {{no mention of the}} band members or recording information. [...] The album entered Billboard magazine's Top LPs chart in December 1965 at number 137 and reached number 53 in February 1966. [...] In total, it spent 33 weeks in the chart. Having a Rave Up remained in print until 1972, longer than any other Yardbirds album on Epic.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{approaches}} allegory {{in many of}} its details, such as {{the green}} plums of the title. Mothers warn their children not to eat green, unripe plums, claiming that they are poisonous. Yet the novel regularly depicts police officers gorging themselves on the fruit: [...] "The officers' lack of constraint in engulfing the fruit parallels the remorseless persecution of the human race" [...] under Nicolae Ceauşescu. The green plums also suggest childhood, or regression into childhood: [...] "The narrator watches the Romanian police guards {{in the streets of}} the city as they greedily pocket green plums... 'They reverted to childhood, stealing plums from village trees.' Ms. Muller's vision of a police state manned by plum thieves <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony, stupidity and brutality." ...|$|E

500|$|The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five {{differs from}} the other books in the Canopus in Argos series in that it <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> a fable and {{is set in a}} metaphysical, or [...] "psychic" [...] space, outside the rest of the series' [...] "normal" [...] space/time universe. The story {{concerns}} two ordained marriages that link the patriarchal and militaristic Zone Four with the matriarchal and egalitarian Zone Three, and the tribal and barbaric Zone Five. It focuses on, what Time magazine reviewer Paul Gray calls, the [...] "struggles between men and women and the dimensions of sex and love". Literary critic Diana Sheets says that the book is about overcoming gender differences and opening up new possibilities. She argues that the premise of the story is that [...] "cosmic order is ideally realized when men and women cross the gender divide and attempt genuine communication—sexually, emotionally... thereby setting the preconditions for the attainment of enlightened consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|The Everglades: River of Grass {{galvanized}} {{people to}} protect the Everglades and is compared to Rachel Carson's 1962 exposé of {{the harmful effects of}} DDT, Silent Spring, as both books are [...] "groundbreaking calls to action that made citizens and politicians take notice". Its impact is still relevant as it is claimed to be a major reason Florida receives so many tourists, and [...] "remains the definitive reference on the plight of the Florida Everglades". It has gone through numerous editions, selling 500,000copies since its original publication. The Christian Science Monitor wrote of it in 1997, [...] "Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature, it also <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> a blueprint for what conservationists are hailing as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world". The downside to the book's impact, according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades, is that her metaphor is so prevailingly dominant that it is inaccurate in describing the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades: [...] "River of Grass" [...] describes one. David McCally wrote that despite Douglas' [...] "appreciation of the complexity of the environmental system" [...] she described, popular conception of the Everglades shared by people who have not read the book overshadows her detailed explanations.|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the {{best thing that ever happened}} to me in my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers like Christopher Tayler and David Flusfeder, both {{writing for}} The Daily Telegraph, praised {{the book as}} [...] "enjoyable [...] intelligent" [...] with [...] "Atwood at her finest". Robert Wiersema echoed that sentiment, adding that the book shows Atwood as [...] "fierce and ambitious, clever and thoughtful". The review in the National Post called the book [...] "a {{brilliant}} tour de force". Specifically singled out as being good are the book's wit, rhythm, structure, and story. Mary Beard found the book to be [...] "brilliant" [...] except for the chapter entitled [...] "An Anthropology Lecture" [...] which she called [...] "complete rubbish". Others criticised the book as being [...] "merely a riff on a better story that comes dangerously close to being a spoof" [...] and saying it [...] "does not fare well [...] colloquial feminist retelling". Specifically, the scenes with the chorus of maidservants {{are said to be}} [...] "mere outlines of characters" [...] with Elizabeth Hand writing in The Washington Post that they have [...] "the air of a failed Monty Python sketch". In the journal English Studies, Odin Dekkers and L. R. Leavis described the book as [...] "a piece of deliberate self-indulgence" [...] that <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> [...] "over-the-top W. S. Gilbert", comparing it to Wendy Cope's limericks reducing T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land to five lines.|$|E
500|$|Chief among Burroughs' {{complaints}} was Long's {{questioning of}} the role of instinct in animal learning, something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was [...] "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." [...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!" [...] Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his [...] "book <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> that {{of a man who has}} really never been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in Forest and Stream, or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".|$|E

500|$|Moreno González {{required}} his men {{to carry}} a [...] "spiritual manual" [...] that he wrote himself, [...] " [...] pseudo-Christian aphorisms for self-improvement." [...] In his [...] "bible," [...] Moreno González prohibited his men from consuming alcoholic beverages or other drugs, and stated that he would severely punish those who mistreated women. His writings encouraged the corporal punishment of thieves by beating them and making them walk naked with billboards in the city streets. He prohibited members of his cartel from consuming or selling methamphetamines in Michoacán, arguing that the drug was only to be smuggled into the U.S. for American consumers. Moreno González justified drug trafficking by stating that La Familia Michoacana allegedly regulated the drug trade to prevent exploitation of the people. The book, sometimes known as [...] "The Sayings of the Craziest One", also talks about humility, service, wisdom, brotherhood, courage, and God. His second book, titled [...] "They Call Me The Craziest One", is 13 chapters long and talks about his life, idealism, the origins of La Familia Michoacana, their battle against Los Zetas, and his rationale behind joining organized crime. The text <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> a diary and justifies his criminal activities under the rationale that just like others in Michoacán, the limited opportunities and his poor financial situation pushed him {{to get involved in}} the drug trade. In addition to that, Moreno González blamed the government for the existence of criminals.|$|E
500|$|Some critics, used to more {{prescriptive}} cookery writers, {{thought her}} approach assumed too much knowledge {{on the part}} of the reader. In her view, [...] "The ideal cookery writer is one who makes his readers want to cook as well as telling them how it is done; he should leave something, not too much perhaps, but a little, unsaid: people must make their own discoveries, use their own intelligence, otherwise they will be deprived of part of the fun." [...] In The New York Times Craig Claiborne wrote admiringly of David, but remarked that because she assumed her readers already knew the basics of cooking she would be [...] "valued more by those with a serious regard for food than by those with a casual interest". [...] The writer Julian Barnes commented that as an amateur cook he found David's terse instructions intimidating: of a recipe in Italian Food [...] he wrote, [...] "E.D.'s first sentence <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> this: 'Melt 1½ lbs (675 g) chopped and skinned tomatoes in olive oil'... Melt? Melt a tomato?... Could it be that Elizabeth David was too good a writer to be a food writer?". A later cook, Tom Parker Bowles, observes, [...] "You don't turn to Elizabeth David for nannying, step-by-step instruction, or precise amounts and timing. She assumes you know the basics, and is a writer who offers inspiration, and wonderful, opinionated prose. Her recipes are timeless, and all her books wonderful works of reference (and tirelessly researched) as well as beautiful reads." ...|$|E
500|$|Theophrastus's major botanical {{works were}} the Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum) and Causes of Plants (Causae Plantarum) which were his lecture notes for the Lyceum. The opening {{sentence}} of the Enquiry <b>reads</b> <b>like</b> a botanical manifesto: [...] "We {{must consider the}} distinctive characters and the general nature of plants {{from the point of}} view of their morphology, their behaviour under external conditions, their mode of generation and the whole course of their life". The Enquiry is 9 books of [...] "applied" [...] botany dealing with the forms and classification of plants and economic botany, examining the techniques of agriculture (relationship of crops to soil, climate, water and habitat) and horticulture. He described some 500 plants in detail, often including descriptions of habitat and geographic distribution, and he recognised some plant groups that can be recognised as modern-day plant families. Some names he used, like Crataegus, Daucus and Asparagus have persisted until today. His second book Causes of Plants covers plant growth and reproduction (akin to modern physiology). Like Aristotle he grouped plants into [...] "trees", [...] "undershrubs", [...] "shrubs" [...] and [...] "herbs" [...] but he also made several other important botanical distinctions and observations. He noted that plants could be annuals, perennials and biennials, they were also either monocotyledons or dicotyledons and he also noticed the difference between determinate and indeterminate growth and details of floral structure including the degree of fusion of the petals, position of the ovary and more. These lecture notes of Theophrastus comprise the first clear exposition of the rudiments of plant anatomy, physiology, morphology and ecology — presented in a way that would not be matched for another eighteen centuries.|$|E
5000|$|His {{translations}} {{are highly}} regarded. Fellow translator Raymond Stock {{said of his}} work, [...] "There's none better. His translations are clear and poetic and <b>read</b> <b>like</b> they’re written in English." ...|$|R
