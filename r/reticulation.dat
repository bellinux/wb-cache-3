5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem <b>reticulation.</b> B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks <b>reticulation</b> on the stem. B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the upper half of the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent <b>reticulation</b> extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks an olive tinge on the tubes.|$|E

5|$|Boletus edulis occurs {{later in}} the season during lower temperatures, mostly under Picea. It has a paler viscid cap, and a paler stipe with an acute white <b>reticulation.</b> Microscopically, it has gelatinised hyphal ends in the pileipellis.|$|E
40|$|A tree-based network N on X is {{universal}} if every rooted binary phylogenetic X-tree is a base tree for N. Hayamizu and, independently, Zhang constructively showed that, for all positive integers n, there exists an universal tree-based network on n leaves. For all n, Hayamizu's construction contains Θ(n!) <b>reticulations,</b> while Zhang's construction contains Θ(n^ 2) <b>reticulations.</b> A simple counting argument shows that an universal tree-based network has Ω(n n) <b>reticulations.</b> With this in mind, Hayamizu {{as well as}} Steel posed the problem of determining whether or not such networks exists with O(n n) <b>reticulations.</b> In this paper, we show that, for all n, there exists an universal tree-based network on n leaves with O(n n) <b>reticulations.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 10 mm. The forewings are deep olive buff with black <b>reticulations</b> forming oblique lines from the costa and apex towards the lower termen. The hindwings are citrine drab with faded blackish <b>reticulations</b> (a net-like pattern) forming oblique lines from the inner margin towards the tornus.|$|R

5|$|Boletus reticulatus is {{very similar}} to B.aereus, also {{occurring}} during the summer months under broad-leaved trees. It has a paler, often cracked cap and a usually paler stipe covered in a more elaborate and pronounced whitish <b>reticulation,</b> often extending to the stipe base.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is R.haematinus, which may be distinguished by its yellower stem and cap colors that are various shades of brown. Its darker cap and lack of <b>reticulation</b> on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E
5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include the yellowish brown to chestnut-brown cap surface that becomes paler with age, yellow flesh {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to bright yellow or yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem <b>reticulation,</b> and a more limited range covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown cap with a texture like velvet.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 11.5 - 12.9 mm for males and 12.2 - 14.1 mm for females. The ground colour of the forewings is ferruginous, with light silvery-grey <b>reticulations.</b> The basal portion is suffused with blackish brown between the <b>reticulations.</b> The hindwings are uniform dark brown. Adults have been recorded on wing from January to March and from June to November.|$|R
50|$|The {{color pattern}} {{consists}} of a brownish-red ground color overlaid with blackish rings or netlike <b>reticulations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana is {{the type}} species of {{subgenus}} Caroliniana of genus Gyromitra. This grouping comprises species that have, in maturity, coarsely reticulate ascospores (i.e., with a network of ridges on the surface) with multiple blunt spines that originate from the reticulum on the spores. Other species in this subgenus include G.fastigiata and the central European species G.parma. In 1969, Erich Heinz Benedix believed that the spore <b>reticulation</b> was sufficiently unique to be worthy of designation as a separate genus, and he described Fastigiella to contain G.caroliniana. Harri Harmaja disagreed, later placing Fastigiella in synonymy with Gyromitra.|$|E
5|$|St Peter's {{is made up}} {{of three}} parts, {{including}} a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859–60 after it fell down. The perpendicular clerestory is decorated with shields in quatrefoils and is lit with closely set three-light windows. The tall decorated chancel has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east window was partly rebuilt in 1875–76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes nodding to each other, as well as a very large <b>reticulation</b> unit.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Sclerodermatineae have {{fruit body}} shapes ranging from boletoid (with a cap, stipe, and tubes on the {{underside}} of the cap) to gasteroid. Boletoid fruit bodies sometimes have hollow stipes with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous (covered with flaky particles), and lack the <b>reticulation</b> (a net-like pattern of interlacing lines) characteristic of some members of the Boletaceae. The pores are merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), boletinoid, and either fine or coarse. The flesh is usually whitish to yellowish, and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury. In mass, spores are yellow; microscopically, the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a smooth surface.|$|E
40|$|A phylogenetic {{network is}} a {{directed}} acyclic graph that visualises an evolutionary history containing so-called <b>reticulations</b> such as recombinations, hybridisations or lateral gene transfers. Here we consider {{the construction of a}} simplest possible phylogenetic network consistent with an input set T, where T contains at least one phylogenetic tree on three leaves (a triplet) for each combination of three taxa. To quantify the complexity of a network we consider both the total number of <b>reticulations</b> and the number of <b>reticulations</b> per biconnected component, called the level of the network. We give polynomial-time algorithms for constructing a level- 1 respectively a level- 2 network that contains a minimum number of <b>reticulations</b> and is consistent with T (if such a network exists). In addition, we show that if T is precisely equal to the set of triplets consistent with some network, then we can construct such a network with smallest possible level in time O(|T| k+ 1), if k is a fixed upper bound on the level of the network...|$|R
5|$|Lactifluus volemus {{is closely}} related to L.corrugis, and {{generally}} similar in appearance. L.corrugis usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: L.corrugis has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8µm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species Lactifluus austrovolemus {{is closely related}}, but has more crowded gills, while L.lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from L.volemus by microscopic characteristics: the <b>reticulations</b> on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the <b>reticulations</b> are smaller. Both L.austrovolemus and L.lamprocystidiatus are known only from Papua New Guinea. Lactifluus hygrophoroides also resembles L.volemus, but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface <b>reticulations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Moroccan {{collections}} {{under the}} cork oak (Quercus suber) that were initially regarded as B.aereus {{were described as}} a separate species—Boletus mamorensis—in 1978, {{on the basis of}} a rufous chestnut cap and a rooting stipe, or stem, with a <b>reticulation</b> often limited to the top (apex). In 2010 however, molecular phylogenetic studies by Bryn Dentinger and colleagues placed these collections close to B.aereus, likely suggesting an ecological variant or subspecies rather than a distinct species. American mycologist Harry Thiers reported Boletus aereus from California in 1975; however, a taxonomic revision of western North American porcini boletes in 2008 formally established them as a separate species, Boletus regineus. These differ from B.aereus by nature of their more gelatinous cap skin (pileipellis), and belong in a different porcini lineage.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo Wind Farm is a 111 MW {{wind farm}} which was {{completed}} in 2010 at an estimated cost of $300 million. Thirty-seven Vestas V90 3 MW turbines stretch over the 18km wind farm site and are connected through a 33 kilovolt (kV) internal <b>reticulation</b> network to the wind farm substation. The wind farm is approximately 30 kilometres south-east of the township of Clare and 100km north of Adelaide. A Stage 2 expansion was approved to add up to an additional 6 turbines to the existing farm and increase its total generating capacity to over 130 MW. Expansion is expected to commence in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{colouration}} of Caloboletus calopus, {{with its}} pale cap, yellow pores and red stipe, is not shared {{with any other}} bolete. Large pale specimens resemble Suillellus luridus, and the cap of Rubroboletus satanas is a similar colour but this species has red pores. Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with Xerocomellus chrysenteron but the stipes of this species are not reticulated. Edible species such as B.edulis lack a red stipe. It closely resembles the similarly inedible C.radicans, which lacks the redness on the stipe. Like C.calopus, the western North American species C.rubripes also has a bitter taste, similarly coloured cap, and yellowish pores that bruise blue, but it lacks <b>reticulation</b> on its reddish stipe. Found in northwestern North America, B.coniferarum lacks reddish or pinkish colouration in its yellow reticulate stipe, and has a darker, olive-grey to deep brown cap.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} rare {{case of a}} non-calcified pilomatricoma in a 67 -year-old man. This tumor was {{extremely}} large in size, and its location, in the lower extremity, was very unusual. The clinical, radiographic, and histopathological features are described in detail. The role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of this entity is discussed. Definite internal <b>reticulations</b> and septations were observed. A possible explanation for this observation is that the high signal intensity <b>reticulations</b> may represent edematous stroma surrounding basaloid cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of the {{simplest}} evolutionary models has molecular sequences evolving from a common ancestor down a bifurcating phylogenetic tree, experiencing point-mutations along the way. However, empirical analyses of different genes indicate that the evolution of genomes is often more complex than can be represented by such a model. Thus, the following problem is of significant interest in molecular evolution: Given a set of molecular sequences, compute a reticulate network that explains the data using a minimal number of <b>reticulations.</b> This paper makes four contributions toward solving this problem. First, it shows that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the tangles in a reticulate network, the connected components of the associated incompatibility graph and the netted components of the associated splits graph. Second, it provides an algorithm that computes a most parsimonious reticulate network in polynomial time, if the <b>reticulations</b> contained in any tangle have a certain overlapping property, and {{if the number of}} <b>reticulations</b> contained in any given tangle is bounded by a constant. Third, an algorithm for drawing reticulate networks is described and a robust and flexible implementation of the algorithms is provided. Fourth, the paper presents a statistical test for distinguishing between <b>reticulations</b> due to hybridization, and ones due to other events such as lineage sorting or tree-estimation error. ...|$|R
5|$|Two eastern North American species, C.inedulis and C.roseipes, {{also have}} an {{appearance}} similar to C.calopus. C.inedulis produces smaller fruit bodies with a white to greyish-white cap, while C.roseipes associates solely with hemlock. C.firmus, found in the eastern United States, eastern Canada, and Costa Rica, has a pallid cap colour, reddish stipe, and bitter taste, but unlike C.calopus, has red pores and lacks stipe <b>reticulation.</b> C.panniformis, a Japanese species described as new to science in 2013, bears a resemblance to C.calopus, but can be distinguished by its rough cap surface, or microscopically by the amyloid-staining cells in {{the flesh of the}} cap, and morphologically distinct cystidia on the stipe.|$|E
5|$|Also {{found on}} {{calcareous}} (chalky) soils, Rubroboletus satanas is larger {{and has a}} pale cap, and its upper stem lacks the reticulations characteristic of S.luridus. Its flesh does not turn blue so markedly on bruising or cutting. It has a more globular overall shape, and young mushrooms carry a smell of decay. The edible Neoboletus luridiformis can be distinguished from S.luridus by its dark brown cap; it also grows on sandy soils associated with conifers. In North America, it can {{be confused with the}} poisonous Rubroboletus pulcherrimus, which has a fatter stalk and deeper red pores. Initially collected in Michigan under oak, Boletus vinaceobasis resembles S.luridus but has shorter spores and its cystidia are dark brown in Melzer's reagent. Boletus species that share a similar appearance with S.luridus but lack <b>reticulation</b> in their stems include B.subvelutipes (found in North America and Asia) and B.hypocarycinus (United States).|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1898. Peck collected the type specimen in Port Jefferson, New York. In 1945, Rolf Singer proposed the variety Boletus auripes var. aureissimus {{as a new}} combination of the name Ceriomyces aureissimus described by William Alphonso Murrill in 1938; this taxon is now regarded as a distinct species under the name Boletus aureissimus. In 1936, Wally Snell reported finding a specimen of Boletus crassipes, another species described by Peck from Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. Snell suggested that although B.crassipes might be a valid species distinguished from B.auripes by a deeper brown cap color, yellow flesh that does not fade to white, and a stem with a more orange-yellow color and more extensive <b>reticulation,</b> he conceded {{that it was not}} clear that the morphological characteristics between the two did not overlap, and that further collections would be needed to clarify any differences between them. A couple of years later, he was more convinced of his stance and considered the two conspecific. The taxonomic authorities Index Fungorum and MycoBank, however, do not recognize this putative synonymy.|$|E
