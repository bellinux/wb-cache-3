5|$|Death Valley National Park is {{a popular}} {{location}} for stargazing as it {{has one of the}} darkest night skies in the United States. Despite its <b>remote</b> <b>location,</b> air quality and night visibility are threatened by civilization. In particular, light pollution is introduced by nearby Las Vegas. The darkest skies are, in general, located in the northwest of the park.|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> of the Itcha Range, future eruptions {{are not a}} major hazard. Future {{volcanism}} is {{most likely}} {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
5|$|Costa {{was born}} in Lagarto, Sergipe, Brazil, to parents José de Jesus and Josileide. His father named him in honour of Argentine footballer Diego Maradona despite the rivalry between the two nations, and he has an elder brother named Jair after Brazilian player Jairzinho. Despite {{regularly}} playing street football, Costa did not believe as a child that he would turn professional, {{in part due to}} the <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> of his hometown. He has since set up a football academy in his hometown, where he pays all the costs. Costa is a fan of Palmeiras.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the park {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} vandalism, littering, and wildfires caused by off-roading, and Roxy Ann Road became nearly impassable {{because of lack of}} maintenance. Medford police officers had to devote much of their time to patrolling the mountain, made difficult by the park's <b>remote</b> <b>location.</b> To alleviate these problems, the city regraded Roxy Ann Road in 1998, and installed two gates near the park entrance two years later. By 2006, vandalism had decreased by 70 percent.|$|E
5|$|Largely {{bypassed}} by {{the early}} non-native explorers, fur traders, and settlers because of its <b>remote</b> <b>location,</b> the region attracted newcomers in quantity when prospectors found gold near Jacksonville in the Rogue River valley in 1851. This {{led to the creation}} of Jackson County in 1852 and, after gold discoveries near Waldo in the Illinois River valley, the creation of Josephine County, named for the daughter of a gold miner. Even with an influx of miners and of settlers who farmed donation land claims, Josephine County's population was only 1,204 in 1870.|$|E

The two couples later shared {{a house in a}} <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> near Lerici, where they were visited in early 1822 by Edward John Trelawny. Though they enjoyed each other's company, the house was small and the arrangements led to numerous conflicts between the servants of each family.|$|E

5|$|The National Trust for Scotland {{purchased}} {{the island in}} 2000 from a local crofters' syndicate called the Barra Head Isles Sheepstock Company who had owned the island since 1955. The NTS were able to acquire it through a bequest by Miss J. M. Fawcitt “to provide an area of natural beauty in memory of her parents and the courage of her late brother, Bernard.” In 2009 the NTS removed all the sheep from the island, citing the difficulties of maintaining the flock in such a <b>remote</b> <b>location.</b>|$|E

Administratively, St Kilda was part of the parish of Harris in the traditional county of Inverness-shire. Today it is incorporated in the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles) unitary authority.|$|E
5|$|The early {{attempts}} to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued {{the practice of}} conducting so-called high-altitude precision bombing, aimed at key industries and transportation networks, even after these tactics had not produced acceptable results. These efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the <b>remote</b> <b>location,</b> technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable weather conditions, and enemy action.|$|E

5|$|The wing {{converted}} from Sabres to Mirages between 1964 and 1966, commencing with No.2 OCU and concluding with No.76 Squadron; the last-mentioned disbanded in 1973. No.81 Wing itself disbanded at Williamtown in December 1966. No.75 Squadron was based at RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, from 1967 until 1983, when it relocated to Darwin. Following conversion to the F/A-18 Hornet in 1988, it transferred to Tindal. Owing to its <b>remote</b> <b>location,</b> {{it became the}} largest Hornet squadron, employing an extensive maintenance section to ensure readiness.|$|E
5|$|Travel to {{the area}} before it was a {{national}} park was rare due to its <b>remote</b> <b>location,</b> lack of accommodations, {{and the absence of}} real roads in southern Utah. Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910, and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917 leading to the Grotto, short of the present road that now ends at the Temple of Sinawava.|$|E

5|$|Situated {{along the}} lower Little Tennessee, lower Tellico, and lower Hiwassee rivers, the Overhill towns rose to {{prominence}} within the Cherokee Nation {{in the early}} 18th century, when they began to standardize trade with the British colonists. In {{the early part of}} the century, the Overhill towns' <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> at the far end of the Trading Path meant they were reached only by those traders and explorers adventurous enough to make the difficult journey to the interior over the mountain range. By the middle of the century, the Overhill towns were consistently courted by both British and French emissaries, as the two powers struggled for the control of the continent and the lucrative fur trade.|$|E
5|$|The adverse {{conditions}} {{faced by the}} keepers resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, but the <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> suited some veterans. Archibald McEachern was assistant keeper for 14 years from 1870–84 and John Nicol was principal from 1890–1903. The latter {{was involved in a}} dramatic rescue when the liner Labrador en route from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool ran aground on the nearby Mackenzie's Rock in 1899. The lifeboats were manned and two made it to Mull, but one with eighteen passengers reached the lighthouse where they were looked after {{for two and a half}} days before they could be taken to the mainland. No lives were lost and Nicol and his two assistants were commended by the NLB for their efforts.|$|E

Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness - in actuality, it is meant to instill terror and distrust in all of Japan's citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion, by showcasing the government's power and ability to target citizen's families and preying on the fear of being killed by a friend.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y {{with the}} Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, {{or at the}} Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was considered, {{but in the end}} it was decided that a <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> would be best. A site in the vicinity of Los Angeles was rejected on security grounds, and one near Reno, Nevada as being too inaccessible. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The climate was mild, there were air and rail connections to Albuquerque, it was sufficiently distant from the West Coast of the United States for a Japanese attack not to be an issue, and the population density was low.|$|E
5|$|The three Scottish soldiers' killings was an {{incident}} {{that took place in}} Northern Ireland during the Troubles. It happened on 10 March 1971, when the Provisional Irish Republican Army shot dead three unarmed British Army soldiers of the 1st Battalion, Royal Highland Fusiliers. Two of the three were teenage brothers; all three were from Scotland. They were killed off-duty and in civilian clothes, having been lured from a city-centre bar in Belfast, driven to a <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> and shot whilst relieving themselves by the roadside. Three British soldiers had been killed prior to this event; all had been on duty and killed during rioting.|$|E
5|$|Tourism in Nunavut {{focuses on}} outdoor {{activities}} {{and culture of}} the local Inuit, the indigenous people of Nunavut. Wildlife watching is a popular tourist attraction, as the territory is home to a number of wildlife and bird sanctuaries. It is possible to spot walrus, polar bears, a large variety of birds and belugas throughout Nunavut. Outdoor adventure activities are also popular. Nunavut has a wide and lengthy river system, meaning that there are a large number of canoeing and kayaking opportunities to suit experienced travellers. Nunavut's vast expanse of uninhabited territory offers many opportunities for hiking and camping. However, the region's often extreme conditions and <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> often necessitates a guide, even for experienced campers.|$|E
