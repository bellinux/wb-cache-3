Early intervention for disorganized attachment, or other problematic styles, is directed toward changing the trajectory of development to provide a better outcome later in the person's life.|$|E
5|$|One of North America's major {{radio and}} {{television}} broadcasters from the 1950s through the late 1980s, RKO General traces its roots to the 1943 purchase of the Yankee Network by General Tire. In 1952, the company united its newly expanded broadcasting interests into a division dubbed General Teleradio. With the tire manufacturer's acquisition of the RKO film studio in 1955, its media businesses were brought together under the <b>rubric</b> <b>of</b> RKO Teleradio Pictures. In 1959, following {{the breakup of the}} movie studio, the media division was given the name it would operate under for the next three decades, RKO General. In addition to its broadcasting activities, RKO General was also the holding company for many of General Tire's (and, after its parent company's reorganization, GenCorp's) other noncore businesses, including soft-drink bottling, Muzak (dept. store and elevator piped-in) music, Video Independent Theatre (135 theatres strong) Circuit, hotel enterprises, and, for seventeen years, the original Frontier Airlines.|$|E
5|$|Suharto {{relied on}} the {{military}} to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organized by the Kopkamtib (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to village-level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the <b>rubric</b> <b>of</b> the Dwifungsi ("Dual Function") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors {{and more than half}} of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorized Operasi Trisula which destroyed PKI-remnants trying to organize a guerilla base in Blitar area in 1968, and ordered several military operations which ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in West Kalimantan (1967–1972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of Free Aceh Movement separatists under Hasan di Tiro in 1977 led to dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad. Notably, in March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight by Islamic extremists at Don Muang Airport in Bangkok.|$|E

5|$|The {{addition}} of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another {{restructuring of the}} major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in particular—had surged that year, {{and again in the}} abbreviated 1994 season. After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. The next year, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa both surpassed Maris's decades-old single-season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the <b>rubric</b> <b>of</b> Major League Baseball (MLB).|$|E

30|$|Rubrics {{have been}} widely {{recognized}} by writing teachers for its efficiency in facilitating grading and its potential to be instructive. However, its use and value in oral production assessments still remain to be proven. Thus, this qualitative {{study was designed to}} explore the students’ perceived uses <b>of</b> <b>rubrics</b> and their actual use <b>of</b> <b>rubrics</b> in their oral production assessments. Using focus group discussion as a main method of data collection, ten (10) students from an exclusive - girl school in Metro Manila participated in the discussion. Results showed that students recognized the ability <b>of</b> <b>rubrics</b> to make them understand teacher’s expectations, reflect on their oral production performances, and justify the grades being given to them by the teacher. Despite these students’ reported uses <b>of</b> <b>rubrics,</b> majority <b>of</b> the students still did not use the <b>rubrics</b> for all <b>of</b> these purposes as evidenced in their actual use <b>of</b> <b>rubrics.</b> This research strongly recommends the institution in study to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>rubric</b> as a grading method for oral production assessments.|$|R

Similar {{with the results of}} Schafer et al. (2001), it was found that teachers’ knowledge <b>of</b> <b>rubrics</b> (especially in English) does not have any instructional value. Both findings were attributed to the lack of knowledge <b>of</b> apt <b>rubric</b> use and lack of a more sustained exposure to instructional <b>rubrics</b> <b>of</b> both teachers and students.|$|R

25|$|We have {{examined}} the two forms of landholding and tenancy in the Haya system of land tenure. Although they co-exist, they have different bases, the one as {{an aspect of the}} traditional structure and the other as an aspect of the structure developing {{at the time of the}} study. The significance of each derives from the particular characteristics of Haya land which is valuable but limited in quantity. In the traditional structure, the land formed the base or medium through which the institution of clientship was expressed and some land is still held under this form of tenure. In the developing structure, the pressure on the land makes for heterogeneous arrangements, here considered under the <b>rubric</b> <b>of</b> the relatively new form of tenure.|$|E

Shields first came to Jamaica at the request of Allan Brown of London's Metropolitan Police Service to aid in the investigation of Reneto Adams and four other policemen charged with 7 May 2003 murder of four civilians at Kraal, Clarendon Parish. Shields was successful in breaking a wall of silence from the Jamaican police, persuading four officers to testify against their colleagues; however, the prosecutor was unable to secure a conviction, in an acquittal widely viewed as corrupt by the Jamaican public.|$|E
25|$|In the {{international}} arena, Western concern over communism waned with {{end of the}} Cold War, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. The November 1991 Santa Cruz Massacre in Dili, East Timor, resulted in the Congress of the United States passing limitations on IMET assistance to the Indonesian Military. Suharto retaliated by cancelling purchase orders for American F-16 fighter jets in 1997. When Netherlands condemned the Santa Cruz Massacre, Suharto retaliated by expelling the Dutch from IGGI in March 1992 and renaming this aid organisation into Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) which continued increasing aid to Indonesia. Realizing this trend, Suharto sought wider alliances under the <b>rubric</b> <b>of</b> economic development, away from over-reliance to United States support. Suharto was elected {{as head of the}} Non-Aligned Movement in 1992, while Indonesia is a founding member of APEC in 1989 and host to the Bogor APEC Summit in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{theory of}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} elaborates how scriptures {{should be interpreted}} {{from the standpoint of}} linguistics and rhetoric. It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is abrogated by a passage revealed at a later date. In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (ijmaʿ) and analogical reasoning (qiyas). It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools. This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the <b>rubric</b> <b>of</b> ijtihad, which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question. The theory of Twelver Shia jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (ʿaql) as a source of law in place of qiyas and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the imams.|$|E
