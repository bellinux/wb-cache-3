5|$|Natalizumab and {{mitoxantrone}} {{are considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of relapse rate <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E

The CCC built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the current system of park roads.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} {{the notion of}} {{completeness}} under random <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> explore how {{that depends on the}} type and success probability of the reduction. We obtain absolute separations between completeness notions under various random <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> between random <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> deterministic <b>reductions.</b> These separations are obtained in appropriately high complexity classes where these questions do not have contradictory relativizations. Our results show that the notion of completeness under random reductions is sensitive tovery smallchanges in success probability, since we can separate completeness under reductions with very small differ- ences in success probability. We also obtain optimal separations between completeness under various deterministic <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> random <b>reductions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh (1909–13) {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} investigate possible advantages (e.g., reduced cost, increased production speed) to issuing smaller sized United States banknotes. Due {{in part to the}} outbreak of World War I and the end of his appointed term, any recommendations may have stalled. On 20 August 1925, Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon {{appointed a}} similar committee and in May 1927 accepted their recommendations for the size <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> redesign of U.S. banknotes. On 10 July 1929 the new small-size currency was issued.|$|E

5|$|A {{study with}} an intent-to-treat {{prospective}} design {{was published in}} 1998 by a team from the Johns Hopkins Hospital and followed-up by a report published in 2001. As with most studies of the ketogenic diet, there was no control group (patients who did not receive the treatment). The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them {{were still on the}} diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> 3% were seizure-free. At twelve months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three and four years was 39%, 20% and 12% respectively. During this period the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free but had had an excellent response.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the storm and associated flooding, the Department of Agriculture readied for the distribution of 3million bangus fry, 250,000tilapia fry, and 315bags of rice seeds to affected regions. Furthermore, the National Food Authority allocated 200sacks of rice to Pangasinan. The National Disaster Risk <b>Reduction</b> <b>and</b> Management Council assisted in relief operations by allocating ₱10million (US$200,000) and 800bags of rice for such efforts. In addition, one of eight regional Filipino health offices distributed roughly ₱600,000 (US$10,000) worth of various medicines to Dagupan and Urdaneta, Pangasinan. According to the National Disaster Coordinating Council, ₱15.7million (US$300,000) worth in relief operations was allocated.|$|E
5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} a molecule to undergo repeated <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E

5|$|On August 14, 1862, Cox {{began moving}} his Kanawha Division toward Washington as {{reinforcement}} for Major General John Pope's Army of Virginia. Exceptions to Cox's orders were the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry and two regiments of Ohio infantry, which {{remained in the}} area for defensive purposes. The three regiments moved to Kanawha Falls in what is now south central West Virginia, {{at the beginning of the}} Kanawha River—which flows to the Ohio River. They were put under the command of Colonel Joseph Andrew Jackson Lightburn. Thus, the two battalions of 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry were reunited, with Colonel John C. Paxton commanding the cavalry regiment. Confederate leaders soon learned of the force <b>reduction,</b> <b>and</b> made plans to drive the Union army out of the Kanawha Valley.|$|E
5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> the nominee is confirmed, legal experts {{conclude}} that in practice {{it is unlikely}} that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.|$|E
5|$|The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is an {{international}} financial institution that offers investment, advisory, and asset-management services to encourage private-sector development in developing countries.

5|$|The {{electron}} {{transport chain}} carries both protons and electrons, passing electrons from donors to acceptors, and transporting protons across a membrane. These processes use both soluble and protein-bound transfer molecules. In mitochondria, electrons are transferred within the intermembrane space by the water-soluble electron transfer protein cytochrome c. This carries only electrons, {{and these are}} transferred by the <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> oxidation of an iron atom that the protein holds within a heme group in its structure. Cytochrome c {{is also found in}} some bacteria, where it is located within the periplasmic space.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{worldwide}} plant reduction {{resulting from}} the difficulties plants encountered in adjusting to the new climate caused a progressive fragmentation and collapse of rainforest ecosystems. This reinforced and so further accelerated the collapse by sharply {{reducing the amount of}} animal life which could be supported by the shrinking ecosystems at that time. The outcome of this animal reduction was a crash in global carbon dioxide levels, which impacted the plants even more. The aridity and temperature drop which resulted from this runaway plant <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> decrease in a primary greenhouse gas caused the Earth to rapidly enter a series of intense Ice Ages.|$|E
5|$|The term men's bikini is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} swim briefs. Men's bikinis can have high or low side panels, and string sides or tie sides. Most lack a button or flap front.

Suits less than 1.5inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, fashion, and sun tanning.
