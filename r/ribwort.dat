50|$|This yellow-footed {{tortoise}} eats {{many kinds}} of foliage. They are too slow to capture any fast animals. In the wild, their diets consist of grasses, fallen fruit, carrion, plants, bones, mushrooms, excrement, and slow-moving invertebrates such as snails, worms, and others {{they are able to}} capture. In captivity, they are fed oranges, apples, melons, endive, collard greens, dandelions, plantain, <b>ribwort,</b> clover, shredded carrots, insects, worms, cuttlebone, tortoise vitamins, edible flowers, and alfalfa pellets. Each yellow-footed tortoise in the wild reaches the age of maturity at about 8-10 years. The fecundity of a female generally depends on her size; the bigger they are, the more eggs they can produce. On average, a female will create about six to 16 eggs per year, although some female individuals may not reproduce each year. The eggs have brittle shells and are elongated to spherical, about 3-6 cm in diameter. The egg size will increase with the body size of the tortoise. The young are self-sufficient from birth. The yellow-footed tortoise can live around 50-60 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the cliffs}} exhibits {{a complex of}} maritime and sub-maritime communities. The cliff slopes and tops are characterised by maritime grassland, heath and scrub communities with frequent species rich flushes, particularly on the north coast. The cliff faces support a maritime rock-crevice community with thrift Armeria maritima, rock samphire Crithmum maritimum, sea aster Aster tripolium and sea spleenwort Asplenium marinum as common components. On the shallow soils of rock ledges and outcrops, a maritime therophyte community occurs where typical species include:English stonecrop Sedum anglicum, thrift, buck's-horn plantain Plantago coronopus and kidney vetch Anthyllis vulneraria. The grassland communities of the cliff slopes are dominated by red fescue Festuca rubra which often forms a matressy sward, and Yorkshire-fog Holcus lanatus. Thrift, wild carrot Daucus carota, sea campion Silene maritima, sea plantain Plantago maritima and ox-eye daisy Leucanthemum vulgare are common. Where trampling occurs, or on thin soils, the grassland is characterised by buck's-horn plantain, <b>ribwort</b> plantain Plantago lanceolata, kidney vetch and spring squill Scilla verna. bluebell Hyacinthoides non-scripta is found in more sheltered areas and on upper slopes where it is typically associated with coarse grasses, mainly cock's-foot Dactylis glomerata and scrub communities.|$|E
40|$|In highly {{productive}} temporary grasslands in Europe, plant {{diversity is}} usually low.

In an experiment, the competitiveness and productivity of three forb species: chicory (Cichorium intybus), <b>ribwort</b> plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and caraway (Carum carvi), grown in different proportions in mixtures including traditional sown grassland species, perennial ryegrass and red clover, were examined with slurry application as an additional factor. Dry matter (DM) yield and botanical composition were measured during one complete growing season. Annual DM yields were mostly similar when forbs {{were included in the}} grassland mixture. A three-species mixture (perennial ryegrass, red clover and <b>ribwort</b> plantain) had the highest yield potential, especially for the slurry application treatment.

40|$|Fresh forages are an {{important}} natural source of vitamins and fatty acids in ruminant diets, and their concentrations in forage species are important {{for the quality of}} animal-derived foods such as dairy and meat products. The aims of this study were to obtain novel information on vitamins and fatty acids (FA) in a variety of forage legumes and non-legume forb species compared to a grass−clover mixture and to explore implications for animal-derived products. Seven dicotyledons [four forbs (salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), caraway (Carum carvi), chicory (Cichorium intybus), and <b>ribwort</b> plantain (Plantago lanceolata)) and three legume species (yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis), lucerne (Medicago sativa), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus)) ] and a perennial ryegrass−white clover mixture were investigated in a cutting trial with four harvests (May−October) during 2009 and 2010. The experimental design was a randomized complete block, and analyses of variance were performed. In addition, three other forbs were grown: borage (Borago officinalis), viper’s bugloss (Echium vulgare), and chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium). Lucerne and yellow sweet clover had the lowest α-tocopherol concentrations (21 − 23 mg kg− 1 DM) and salad burnet and <b>ribwort</b> plantain the highest (77 − 85 mg kg− 1 DM); β-carotene concentrations were lowest in lucerne, salad burnet, and yellow sweet clover (26 − 33 mg kg− 1 DM) and highest in caraway, birdsfoot trefoil, and <b>ribwort</b> plantain (56 − 61 mg kg− 1 DM). Total FA concentrations were lowest in lucerne, <b>ribwort</b> plantain, chicory, and yellow sweet clover (15. 9 − 19. 3 g kg− 1 DM) and highest in caraway and birdsfoot trefoil (15. 9 − 19. 3 g kg− 1 DM). Birdsfoot trefoil had the highest (53. 6 g 100 g− 1 FA) and caraway and lucerne the lowest (33. 7 − 35. 7 g 100 g− 1 FA) proportions of n- 3 FA. This study demonstrated higher vitamin concentrations in some forbs compared with major forages such as lucerne and grass−clover, more total FA in salad burnet, caraway, and birdsfoot trefoil than in lucerne, and higher n- 3 FA concentrations in all forbs than in lucerne.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} improving seedling emergence, stand establishment and yield of late sown <b>ribwort</b> plantain (Plantago lanceolata) by seed priming pot and field experiments were conducted at the Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran during 2013. The <b>ribwort</b> plantain seeds were differently treated by ultrasonication, laser, magnetic field, gamma and beta irradiations all for 3. 5 and 5 min. and were sown on 5 th and 20 th of May. All of the seed priming treatments reduced seedling emergence time, 50 % of seedling emergence and mean emergence time as compared with control. Highest seedling dry weight (0. 49 g. plant- 1) resulted from magnetic field treatment for 5 min. followed by magnetic field for 3. 5 min. and ultrasonic treatments (0. 40 g. plant- 1). A further reduction in exposure time of magnetic field from 5 to 3. 5 min. decreased seedling vigor index. When seeds were sown in 5 th and 20 th May, maturity period of plots treated with magnetic field and ultrasonic happened to range between 112. 2 and 99. 7 days after sowing, respectively. Leaf area index remained statistically unaffected due to a delay of 15 days in sowing date. Under field conditions, there was not significant difference between seed yields from sowing dates, and the yield ranged from 176 kg. ha- 1 in control, gamma and beta irradiations up to 211 kg. ha- 1 in magnetic field and ultrasonic treatments. It can be concluded that priming <b>ribwort</b> plantain seeds by magnetic field and ultrasonic waves would effectively {{be used to improve}} the crop performance and yield especially in late sown plants...|$|E
