40|$|BackgroundThis {{retrospective}} {{study was designed}} to determine the efficacy of broad-spectrum antibacterials combined with percutaneous <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> in the treatment of emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN). MethodsFrom July 1992 to September 2002, 10 patients (nine females and one male) with EPN were managed at our institution. All patients had diabetes and presented with fever and chills, flank pain or tenderness, vomiting, and altered consciousness. The diagnosis of EPN was confirmed by the presence of intraparenchymal and/or perinephric gas in imaging studies (kidney-ureter-bladder film, sonogram, and/or computed tomography scan). Broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, combined with percutaneous <b>renal</b> <b>drainage,</b> was started in all patients. Follow-up studies consisted of computed tomography scan and technetium-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) radioisotope renography. ResultsThe outcome was good in all patients. Three patients underwent delayed nephrectomy due to non-functioning of the involved kidney. The DTPA radioisotope renography results (glomerular filtration rate of the diseased kidney/contralateral healthy kidney) were 0 / 57 mL/min, 2. 7 / 68. 1 mL/min and 3. 7 / 63. 9 mL/min.

40|$|Objective. Ureteropelvic {{junction}} obstruction (UPJO) is {{a common}} cause of symptomatic ureteral obstruction. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the outcome of laparoscopic pyeloplasty in patients with UPJO. Patients and Methods. Medical reports of 47 UPJO patients treated with laparoscopic pyeloplasty were retrospectively analysed. All patients were recruited from our center in the period 2004 – 2011. Results. We evaluated 47 patients. Mean age was 36 years and mean hospital stay 3. 6 days. 42 (79 %) of the patients had pain and 46 (98 %) were diagnosed with hydronephrosis. 19 patients (40 %) had a renal function below 40 % of the affected kidney and 49 % had impaired <b>renal</b> scan <b>drainage.</b> Postoperative significant improvement in pain score and <b>renal</b> scan <b>drainage</b> was found in 92 % and 47 % of the patients, respectively.

40|$|Introduction Candida bezoar (CB) {{is a rare}} {{finding in}} {{neonates}} and infants with candiduria, presenting as necrotic debris with proliferating mycelia in the collecting system of the kidney. If initial antifungal medical treatment does not result in clearance of candiduria and disappearance of CB on ultrasound in dilated kidneys, invasive interventions like insertion of nephrostomy tubes (NT) or surgical interventions to drain the kidney are sometimes advocated [...] However, NT placement can be a technical challenge, especially in pre- and dysmature neonates, and NT displacement or obstruction by the CB can lead to suboptimal treatment. Identification of those children who will benefit from invasive <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> is important. Objective This study evaluates the management of patients with CB in three tertiary referral hospitals to determine criteria for intervention. Materials and methods A retrospective multicenter chart analysis was conducted of children with candiduria and ultrasonographic demonstration of CB (diagnosed between March 1995 and August 2012). The indication for invasive <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> (if performed) and subsequent clinical outcome, serum creatinine levels and ultrasound findings were assessed. Results A total of 12 children were included, two of which were premature neonates. Eight children had congenital urogenital anomalies. One older child with acute myeloid leukemia had CB during chemotherapy and one ex-premature developed CB following cerebral candidiasis. All children received systemic antifungal medication; in seven children invasive treatment was added. Indications for invasive treatment were clinical deterioration, progressive renal dilation, pyonephrosis, rising creatinine levels and persistence of CB. Two underwent a Ycutaneous ureterostomy and nephrostomy tubes were inserted in five children. Percutaneous <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> by nephrostomy led to complications in 3 of 6 procedures. In all patients, irrespective of therapeutic modality, follow-up ultrasound demonstrated no de novo changes. No additional parenchymal defects or deterioration of split renal function were seen on DMSA or MAG- 3 scan. Discussion In the literature <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> is suggested in case of complete obstruction. However dilatation is a frequent finding in children {{as part of the}} congenital renal anomaly and {{does not necessarily mean that}} there is obstruction of the urinary tract. Even in children without candida infections the diagnosis of obstruction is not straightforward, while the results of a MAG 3 scan can be obscured by compromised kidney function, parenchymal bacterial infiltration and neonatal immaturity of the kidney. If candiduria and CB persist despite intensive medical treatment, intensive consultation is required before <b>renal</b> <b>drainage,</b> because NT insertion might be a surgical challenge. Complications such as displacement of the NT, urinoma development, or NT obstruction can occur and was seen in three of six procedures. Premature neonates seem to be more prone to complications due to their small anatomical proportions, requiring medical equipment with small diameters prone to displacement and obstruction. Some studies describe successful pharmaceutical management in the majority of patients with CB. Other studies describe unilateral surgical intervention in children with bilateral CB where unilateral drainage did not influence overall renal outcome. This is in line with our results. A limitation of the present study is its retrospective design. In this population, the motivation for invasive <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> or conservative management was not well documented in all cases, and was mainly based on clinical and diagnostic parameters like creatinine levels and radiographic findings.

40|$|The main {{criteria}} used for deciding on surgery {{in children with}} presumed antenatally detected pelviureteric junction obstruction (PPUJO) are the level of hydronephrosis (ultrasonography), the level of differential renal function (DRF) {{and the quality of}} <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> after a furosemide challenge (renography), the importance of each factor being far from generally agreed. Can we predict, on the basis of ultrasound parameters, the patient in whom radionuclide renography can be avoided? We retrospectively analysed the medical charts of 81 consecutive children with presumed unilateral PPUJO detected antenatally. Ultrasound and renographic studies performed at the same time were compared. Anteroposterior pelvic diameter (APD) and calyceal size were both divided into three levels of dilatation. Parenchymal thickness was considered either normal or significantly decreased. Acquisition of renograms under furosemide stimulation provided quantification of DRF, quality of <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> and cortical transit. The percentages of patients with low DRF and poor drainage were significantly higher among those with major hydronephrosis, severe calyceal dilatation or parenchymal thinning.

However, none of the structural parameters obtained by ultrasound examination was able to predict whether the level of renal function or the quality of drainage was normal or abnormal.

40|$|Objective: The study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the variation of biological parameters recorded at the patients with obstructive renal failure treated with percutaneous nephrostomy. Material and method: The retrospective study investigated the data of 244 patients admitted in our department and treated with percutaneous nephrostomy for obstructive renal failure during January 2005 – December 2007. Demographical data, investigation, operation notes, indication, biological parameters trends (creatinine, haematocrit, haemoglobin, kaliemia, alkaline reserve), complications and hospital stay were recorded. The biological parameter trends (creatinine, haematocrit, haemoglobin, kaliemia, alkaline reserve) was analysed. The median preoperative and postoperative values of those parameters was compared. Statistical analysis was performed. Results: The median preoperative/discharge values of creatinine were 8. 29 mg%(1. 6 - 26. 3 mg%) comparing to 3. 63 mg% (0. 64 - 13 mg%). A return to normal renal function at the discharge time was noted in 23 patients (9. 7 %). Hyperpotasemia (K> 5. 1 mEq/l) on admission was found in 134 patients (54. 9 %). The median preoperative/discharge values of potassium were 5. 71 mEq/l comparing to 4. 8 mEq/l. The median hospitalization time was 8. 7 days with a median ICU stay of 3. 3 days.

40|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{features of}} the venous drainage of the reproductive system of the male ostrich were studied in six pre-pubertal and three sexually mature and active birds. Each testis was drained by one to four testicular veins. The right testicular veins drained the right testis and epididymis and its appendix to the caudal vena cava {{and to the right}} common iliac vein, whereas the left testicular veins drained the left testis and epididymis and its appendix exclusively to the left common iliac vein. A number of variations in the drainage pattern based on the point of entry and number of testicular veins were observed. The cranial aspect of the testis was also linked to the caudal vena cava or common iliac vein via the adrenal veins. The cranial, middle and caudal segments of the ductus deferens (and ureter) were drained by the cranial, middle and caudal ureterodeferential veins respectively, to the caudal testicular veins, the caudal renal veins and pudendal / caudal part of the internal iliac veins. In some specimens, the caudal ureterodeferential veins also drained into the caudal mesenteric vein. The surface of the phallus was drained by tributaries of the pudendal vein. The basic pattern of venous drainage of the reproductive organs of the male ostrich was generally similar to that described for the domestic fowl. However, important differences, including the partial fusion of the caudal <b>renal</b> veins, <b>drainage</b> of the cranial aspect of the testes via the adrenal veins, drainage of the caudal ureterodeferential veins into the caudal mesenteric vein and the presence of veins draining the surface of the phallus, were observed.

40|$|Objective: To determine, in {{children}} with antenatally detected pelviureteric junction (PUJ) stenosis, what factors may be predictive for deterioration of differential renal function (DRF) in case of conservative treatment or improvement of DRF in case of pyeloplasty. Methods: This study analyzed and compared the initial level of hydronephrosis, DRF, quality of <b>renal</b> <b>drainage,</b> and cortical transit with the late DRF outcome. We reviewed the medical charts of 161 consecutive children with antenatally diagnosed PUJ stenosis during a 10 -year period (between 1997 and 2007). From this cohort, we retained 81 children with unilateral PUJ and strictly normal contralateral kidney, with a median follow-up of 67 months. Repeated ultrasounds, voiding cystourethrography, and radionuclide renograms were performed in all children. Results: Fifty patients never underwent a surgical intervention (62 %), whereas surgical repair (Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty) was performed in 31 (38 %). During conservative follow-up, DRF deterioration was observed in 11 % of patients. After pyeloplasty, DRF improvement was observed in 25 % of patients. Abnormal cortical transit was the only predictive factor of DRF deterioration in case of conservative approach, whereas the initial degree of hydronephrosis, or <b>renal</b> <b>drainage,</b> and the initial DRF level were not predictive. In children who were operated on, only impaired cortical transit was predictive of DRF improvement postoperatively. Conclusion: Conservative management of children with unilateral PUJ stenosis is a safe procedure. Impaired cortical transit although imperfect, seems the best criterion for identifying children for whom pyeloplasty is warranted. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All Rights Reserved.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Output {{efficiency}} (OE) and normalized {{residual activity}} (NORA) are two parameters that allow quantifying the <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> {{at any moment}} of renographic acquisition. Although OE is theoretically more accurate than NORA {{in case of a}} decreased overall renal function, both parameters present some weaknesses. OBJECTIVES: To compare both parameters and to evaluate whether the clinical information provided by both parameters is identical. METHODS: From a large database of Tc- 99 m mercaptoacetyltriglycine 3 renographic studies, 450 kidneys were selected covering a large range of ages, overall function, split function, and quality of drainage. NORA and OE were calculated {{at the end of the}} 20 -min renogram, as well as on the late post erect postmicturition (PM) views. RESULTS: An inverse correlation was observed between NORA 20 and OE 20 (r=- 0. 926), as well as between NORA PM and OE PM (r=- 0. 936). Discrepancies were noted in approximately 10 % of the kidneys, but main discrepancies, which would result in a different estimation of the quality of drainage, were only observed in 2 % of the kidneys. There was no bias in the discordances; OE could reveal a better as well as a worse quality of drainage than NORA. It is likely therefore that imperfections of both parameters might be the cause of the divergences. The stratification of the kidneys according to age, overall renal function, split function, or quality of drainage did not modify the results. CONCLUSION: NORA, being much easier to program, can replace the output efficiency in the evaluation of <b>renal</b> <b>drainage.</b> © 2011 Wolters Kluwer HealthSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Medical records of patients of horseshoe kidney with PUJO operated in our institute between June 1998 and June 2012 were reviewed. Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty with isthmotomy and lateropexy was performed in all patients. The surgical outcome was evaluated with emphasis on the changes in degree of hydronephrosis by ultrasonography, <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> and function assessed by diuretic renal scans. Results: We studied the records of eight children of horseshoe kidney having unilateral PUJO. Obstruction was caused by a crossing lower-pole vessel in two cases, a high ureteral insertion in three and narrowing of the PUJ in three cases. Post-operative follow-up (median 4. 4 years, range 18 months to 10 years) revealed improved renal function and good drainage in all cases. Hydronephrosis disappeared in 3, 4 showed Grade 1 and one showed Grade 2 hydronephrosis. All children are doing well and have no symptoms. Conclusion: Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty with isthmotomy and lateropexy is a highly effective and safe procedure for treating PUJO in horseshoe kidney in children...|$|E
40|$|The Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor {{family of}} {{proteins}} are key regulators of physiological systems. Originally linked with endothelial function, {{they have since}} become understood to be principal regulators of multiple tissues, both through their actions on vascular cells, but also through direct actions on other tissue types, including epithelial cells, neurons, and the immune system.

We investigated the role of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) in PHSML drainage in alleviating acute kidney injury (AKI) by administering D,L-propargylglycine (PPG) and sodium hydrosulfide hydrate (NaHS) to 12 specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats with PHSML drainage. A hemorrhagic shock model was established in 4 experimental groups: shock, shock+drainage, shock+drainage+PPG (45 mg/kg, 0. 5 h prehemorrhage), and shock+drainage+NaHS (28 µmol/kg, 0. 5 h prehemorrhage). Fluid resuscitation was performed after 1 h of hypotension, and PHMSL was drained in the last three groups for 3 h after resuscitation. Renal function and histomorphology were assessed along with levels of H 2 S, cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), interleukin (IL) - 10, IL- 12, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α in renal tissue. Hemorrhagic shock induced AKI with increased urea and creatinine levels in plasma and higher H 2 S, CSE, TLR 4, IL- 10, IL- 12, and TNF-α levels in <b>renal</b> tissue. PHSML <b>drainage</b> significantly reduced urea, creatinine, H 2 S, CSE, and TNF-α but not TLR 4, IL- 10, or IL- 12.

Nowadays, ultrasound is definitively {{one of the most}} useful imaging modalities for the upper tract in children with hydronephrosis. It is non-invasive, radiation free and can be repeated. In addition, ultrasound also offers excellent images of the lower urinary tract in the diagnosis of posterior urethral valves or ureteroceles for example. An additional tool is isotope renal scintigraphy which is method to analyse differential <b>renal</b> function and <b>drainage</b> of the kidney as well as functioning cortical mass with an accurate image of renal parenchyma. Today MRI studies {{are becoming more and more}} popular. This technique is particularly suited to urological imaging, because of its excellent delineation of water/urine-containing structures. The micturating cystourethrogram is still the gold standard in imaging the bladder and the urethra. It also serves as a functional investigation while the patient is voiding. The technique consists of catheterizing the person in order to fill the bladder with a radiocontrast agent and is, therefore, an invasive method. Since there is a risk of an increase in severity and functional deterioration with time on the one hand but also improvement and stable function on the other hand, suitable diagnosis is mandatory in order to rule out the children at risk...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Radionuclide techniques, {{as direct}} {{radionuclide}} cystography and 99 mTc-DMSA scintigraphy, {{have been used}} in evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and reflux nephropathy (RN) in children. Dynamic 99 mTc-DTPA scintigraphy is reserved for evaluation of differential renal function and obstruction in children, where hydronephrosis is detected by ultrasonography (US) pre- or postnatally. CASE REPORT: Six year old boy was prenatally diagnosed with bilateral hydronephrosis. Postnatal, severe bilateral VUR was detected by voiding urethrocytography. US and 99 mTc-DTPA scintigraphy performed in the first month of life showed small left kidney that participated with 2 % in the global renal function. Bilateral cutaneous ureterostomy has been performed in order to obtain good <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> and promote optimal renal growth. Twelve months later, classic antireflux procedure was done. Control 99 mTc-DTPA scintigraphy, 5 ys after antireflux surgery, revealed persisting radioactivity during the diuretic phase, in the left kidney that indicated antireflux procedure failure with VUR reappearance. CONCLUSION: 99 mTc-DTPA scintigraphy is the first method of choice for long-term monitoring of individual kidney function in children with VUR and other congenital urinary tract anomalies. Additionally, it can be used as indirect radionuclide cystography when rising of radioactivity in the kidney region, during the diuretic phase can indicate presence of VUR...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the inter-observer reproducibility in reporting on <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> obtained during Tc- 99 m MAG 3 renography in children, when already processed data are offered to the observers. Methods Because web site facilities were used for communication, 57 observers from five continents participated in the study. Twenty-three renograms, including furosemide stimulation and posterect postmicturition views, covering various patterns of drainage, were submitted to the observers. Images, curves and quantitative parameters were provided. Good or almost good drainage, partial drainage and poor or no drainage were the three possible responses for each kidney. Results An important bias was observed among the observers, some of them more systematically reporting the drainage as being good, while others had a general tendency to consider the drainage as poor. This resulted in rather poor inter-observer reproducibility, as for more than half of the kidneys, less than 80 % of the observers agreed on one of the three responses. Analysis of the individual cases identified some obvious causes of discrepancy: the absence of a clear limit between partial and good or almost good drainage, the fact of including or neglecting the effect of micturition and change of patient's position, the underestimation of drainage in the case of a flat renographic curve, and the difficulties of interpretation in the case of a small, not well functioning kidney. Conclusion There is an urgent need for better standardisation in estimating the quality of drainage...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Values for output {{efficiency}} (OE) and normalized residual activity (NORA) in paediatric patients {{have been published}} previously. However, {{it is now a}} usual practice to inject furosemide {{at the beginning of a}} renogram acquisition (F 0 procedure). The aim was to evaluate OE and NORA obtained on F 0 renograms, in normal and abnormal paediatric kidneys. Methods: Three groups of kidneys were selected: group 1, normal kidneys (n= 155); group 2, dilated but unobstructed kidneys (n= 20); and group 3, hydronephrotic kidneys (n= 84). A 20 -min Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine renogram was obtained under early furosemide injection (F 0) and was completed by late postmicturition (PM) images. OE and NORA were calculated at the end of the renogram and on the PM images. Results: Group 1 : NORA and OE calculated at the end of the F 0 renogram revealed better drainage than without F 0 stimulation. The PM parameters were comparable with those previously obtained after late furosemide injection (F+ 20). Group 2 : the drainage, despite the early injection of furosemide, was often unsatisfactory at the end of the F 0 renogram, but improved dramatically upon the PM acquisition. Group 3 : almost normal values up to very abnormal ones were observed. In 35 % of kidneys, the values of drainage were out of the range of group 2. Conclusion: Under early furosemide injection, <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> in the normal kidneys was better than in basic conditions. In dilated unobstructed kidneys, NORA and OE obtained on late images after micturition were, respectively, below 1. 5 and above 80 %. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

40|$|Context: Although lymphadenectomy (lymph node {{dissection}} [LND]) {{is currently}} accepted {{as the most}} accurate and reliable staging procedure {{for the detection of}} lymph node invasion (LNI), its therapeutic benefit in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) still remains controversial. Objective: Review the available literature concerning the role of LND in RCC staging and outcome. Evidence acquisition: A Medline search was conducted to identify original articles,review articles, and editorials addressing the role of LND in RCC. Keywords included kidney neoplasms, renal cell cancer, renal cell carcinoma, kidney cancer, lymphadenectomy,lymph node excision, lymphatic metastases, nephrectomy, imaging, and complications. The articles with the highest level of evidence were identified with the consensus of all of the collaborative authors and were critically reviewed. This review is the result of an interactive peer-reviewing process by an expert panel of co-authors. Evidence synthesis: <b>Renal</b> lymphatic <b>drainage</b> is unpredictable. The newer available imaging techniques are still immature in detecting small lymph node metastases. Results from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial 30881 showed no benefit in performing LND during surgery for clinically node-negative RCC, but the results are limited to patients with the lowest risk of developing LNI. Numerous retrospective series support the hypothesis that LND may be beneficial in high-risk patients (clinical T 3 –T 4, high Fuhrman grade, presence of sarcomatoid features, or coagulative tumor necrosis). If enlarged nodes are evident at imaging or palpable during surgery, LND seems justified at any stage. However, the extent of the LND remains a matter of controversy. Conclusions: To date, the available evidence suggests that an extended LND may be beneficial when technically feasible in patients with locally advanced disease (T 3 –T 4) and/or unfavorable clinical and pathologic characteristics (high Fuhrman grade, larger tumors, presence of sarcomatoid features, and/or coagulative tumor necrosis). Although node-positive patients often harbor distant metastases as well, the majority of retrospective nonrandomized trials seem to suggest a possible benefit of regional LND even for this group of patients. In patients with T 1 –T 2, clinically negative lymph nodes and absence of unfavorable clinical and pathologic characteristics, regional LND offers limited staging information and no benefit in terms of decreasing disease recurrence or improving survival. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{rejection}} of renal homografts {{has been studied}} in sheep by transplanting kidneys into the neck and preserving the <b>renal</b> lymphatic <b>drainage</b> intact. Chronic fistulae were established in the transplanted renal lymphatics and lymph collected throughout {{the life of the}} graft. The changes that occurred in homografts during the process of rejection were reflected in changes in the lymph. Large numbers of basophilic, blast, lymphoid cells appeared in the lymph, and lymph production in the grafted kidney increased 20 – 50 fold. Over a period of about 10 days, up to 60 g wet weight of lymphoid cells and up to 10 liters of lymph were collected from the graft. Within 24 hr of grafting, the host cells present in the renal lymph had become sensitized to the graft and transformed into blast cells when cultivated in Millipore chambers in vitro. When the cells leaving the graft during the first 18 – 48 hr were injected into distant nonstimulated lymph nodes of the host sheep, they evoked significant cellular and antibody responses in the nodes. Within the graft, the main pathological changes were found in the vascular endothelium and many of the peritubular capillaries become plugged with emboli comprised of blast cells. There was extensive infiltration of the renal parenchyma with lymphoid cells and evidence of their transformation and proliferation within the renal blood capillaries. When all the lymph and cells leaving the homograft were diverted from the body, there was a greatly decreased reaction in the regional prescapular lymph node, and no reaction in lymph nodes distant from the graft. In these circumstances, the survival of the graft was not prolonged, and it was rejected without involvement of the lymph nodes of the host. Humoral antibody was produced in the lymph node regional to the homograft within 48 – 60 hr of grafting. Antibody was not detected in the blood or in the renal lymph until near to the time the graft was rejected. It was thought that this was due to the binding of antibody by the kidney graft tissue. We conclude that all the events which lead to the recognition and {{rejection of}} renal homografts can occur centrally within the graft itself...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether cortical scars can be detected using the summed images of 99 mTechnetium-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99 mTc-MAG 3) renal dynamic scans, and to compare the results with 99 mTechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99 mTc-DMSA) scans. Material and Methods: We evaluated a total of 135 renal units from 68 patients (12 boys and 56 girls, with a mean age of 9 years old; range 3 - 16 years old) who had 99 mTc-MAG- 3 and 99 mTc-DMSA scintigraphy within a period of two weeks. Differential renal function (DRF) values and parenchymal function parameters obtained from the two studies were compared with semiquantitative scoring and grading systems. Results: The correlation between 99 mTc-MAG- 3 and 99 mTc-DMSA cortical scintigraphy, according to the semiquantitative scoring and grading systems, was perfect (rk tau-b= 0. 833). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 99 mTc-MAG- 3 scintigraphy were 92. 6 %, 96. 8 %, and 95. 5 %, respectively. There was no significant difference between two methods in detecting renal scars (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: Most parenchymal lesions detected on 99 mTc-DMSA scans were also identified on 99 mTc-MAG- 3 parenchymal scans. By lowering the radiation exposure, 99 m-Tc MAG- 3 scintigraphy can provide simultaneous information on <b>renal</b> perfusion, concentration, <b>drainage,</b> parencymal functions, and DRF without the need for additional imaging methods. The reliability of renal parenchyma evaluation was increased by using scoring and grading systems to compare the two methods...|$|R
40|$|Objective: When {{taking into}} account the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) and European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) {{guidelines}} on diuretic renography in children, we see important divergences in the preparation, acquisition, processing, and interpretation of the results. In this study, we estimated the quality of <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> according to these two guidelines. Patients and methods: Ninety kidneys with hydronephrosis or severe vesicorenal reflux were processed and analyzed according to the SNM (estimation of the T 1 / 2 of the washout curve and conclusions about the possible existence of obstruction) and EANM guidelines (estimation of normalized residual activity or NORA, and output efficiency or OE on the late postmicturition images, without any conclusion about the possible existence of obstruction). Among the 90 kidneys, 39, 20, and 31 were considered to have normal, equivocal, or poor drainage (obstruction), respectively, when the SNM guidelines were used. Results: All 39 kidneys with good drainage according to SNM were also considered as normal using the EANM guidelines. Among the 20 equivocal cases based on T 1 / 2, concordance between the two guidelines was obtained in only 35 and 0 % when using NORA and OE (OE was considered normal in all 20 cases), respectively. Among the 31 cases defined as obstructed by SNM, only five were classified as 'poor drainage' using NORA and no single case was classified thus using OE. Conclusion: This limited study demonstrates that the use of different guidelines can lead to different interpretations of the results. This is unacceptable, and an agreement between both pediatric task groups of the SNM and EANM is urgently required. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc. Objective To {{determine}} if routine follow-up diuresis renography is indicated in all adult patients after pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). Methods A multicenter retrospective {{analysis was conducted}} in adults who underwent pyeloplasty for symptomatic UPJO between January 2002 and August 2012. Patients with unilateral UPJO demonstrated on diuresis renography, treated with pyeloplasty, and aged > 18 years at time of surgery {{were included in the}} study. Patients with contralateral renal abnormalities, genitourinary anomalies, and those who declined renography during follow-up were excluded. All eligible patients underwent diuresis renography approximately 3 months postoperatively. Minimal follow-up was 12 months. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with persistent pain at 3 months after pyeloplasty and patients who became asymptomatic. Treatment failures in each cohort were identified. Comparisons were performed using the Fisher exact test. Results A total of 100 pyeloplasties were performed. Of them, 90 were eligible for the study. Mean age was 40 years. Mean follow-up was 21 months. Seventy-three patients (81. 1 %) became pain free after pyeloplasty. One patient (1. 4 %) had worsening of differential renal function despite unobstructed drainage on diuresis renogram. None of the patients in the asymptomatic cohort was identified to have unequivocal drainage obstruction on postoperative renogram. Seventeen patients (18. 9 %) remained symptomatic with pain at 3 months after pyeloplasty; 3 (17. 6 %) of those patients with loin pain after pyeloplasty were confirmed to have persistent obstructed drainage postoperatively on diuresis renogram (P <. 001). All 3 patients required insertion of ureteric stents and/or revision surgery (P <. 007). Conclusion In our series, adult patients who became pain free after unilateral pyeloplasty for UPJO did not have persistent obstruction of <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> on renography. Routine diuresis renogram to assess drainage and differential renal function in patients who become pain free after pyeloplasty for UPJO may not be necessary. If objective evidence of postoperative outcome is required, then a single renogram at 3 months is recommended. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Purpose After a {{successful}} pyeloplasty at 3 to 6 months, {{the question remains}} whether children need a long follow-up. Methods The medical charts of patients with long-term follow-up (> 5 years), who underwent dismembered pyeloplasty for uretero-pelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) from May 1998 to May 2007, excluding those with bilateral UPJO, solitary kidney, associated vesicoureteral reflux or other abnormalities, and inconclusive renogram due to poor renal function, were retrospectively reviewed. Ultrasonography, differential renal function (DRF, DMSA), and <b>renal</b> <b>drainage</b> on diuretic renography (diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate technetium- 99 or DTPA-Tc 99) were performed at 3 and 6 months every year. Results Complete data were available for 28 consecutive patients (28 renal unities) with 2 months to 12 years (mean age, 2. 4 years) at surgery, of whom 21 (75 %) were boys, 17 diagnosed prenatally (61 %) and 18 unities (64. 3 %) were left, with median follow-up of 10. 7 years. Images were graded according to the Society for Fetal Urology grading system: Grade III in 11 (49 %) and grade IV in 17 (61 %). All cases presented[*]>[*] 10 % DRF (DMSA) and obstructed DTPA-Tc 99. The T 1 / 2 (the half-time of drainage) less than 20 minutes at 3 months was found in 21 cases (75 %) and less than 25 minutes in 7 cases (25 %). Renal function and patency were maintained during follow-up for all units with 8 % maximum fluctuation of DRF. One index case (3. 6 %) of renal function deterioration presented DRF fluctuation[*]>[*] 8 % at 3 months (from 23 to 32 %) and progressive hydronephrosis and indeterminate DTPA at 6 months. Conclusions Satisfactory diuretic renogram at 3 to 6 months after pyeloplasty with maintained renal function and stable hydronephrosis suggests no need for further follow-up and indicates no functional loss with time. More than 8 % DRF fluctuation might be a significant cutoff for further intervention aiming nephron preservation...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{a method of}} diuresis renography where the radiopharmaceutical and frusemide (diuretic) are given simultaneously, in contrast to conventional renography which involves an intravenous injection with frusemide 20 min after administering the radiopharmaceutical (F+ 20) or 15 min before (F- 15), with particular interest in {{the effect of this}} change on assessing split renal function and interpreting upper tract drainage dynamics. Patients and methods In a prospective study, 29 patients (18 women and 11 men, mean age 47 years, range 21 - 86) were assessed. Each patient had two renograms taken over a 48 -h period, either by the F+ 20 or F- 15, and the F+ 0 method. Data for split <b>renal</b> function and <b>drainage</b> curves were obtained in the usual way. Two independent assessments of the drainage curves were obtained and the results compared. Results The split function assessments were identical (< 5 % variation) in all but two patients; 26 of 29 (90 %) gave identical conclusions about the drainage curves. The three patients with discrepancies between the studies had either hugely dilated upper tracts or otherwise had multiple complicating factors, e. g. impaired renal function, neuropathic bladder. Conclusions F+ 0 renography has been used in paediatric urological practice before, but there are no comparative studies and no data on its use in adults. This prospective study confirmed that in investigating dilated upper tracts, the F+ 0 technique gives similar results to the conventional techniques. The F+ 0 method has the potential to reduce the time required to undertake standard F+ 20 renography {{but it may not be}} useful in evaluating the grossly dilated upper tract, where the F- 15 technique has the best record in terms of reducing equivocal results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{spontaneous}} rupture of {{an infected}} renal cyst {{is a rare}} event. Spontaneous rupture with drainage to the exterior through a surgical scar has not been reported previously. Case presentation A 49 -year-old male with tetraplegia had undergone extended right pyelolithotomy in 1999. Deroofing and marsupialisation of a cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney was performed in 2003. Subsequently there was recurrence of a thick-walled cystic space-occupying lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney. Thick pus was aspirated from the renal cyst on six occasions between September 2003 and November 2004. In March 2006, ultrasound examination revealed a cyst measuring 6. 2 cm in diameter in the upper pole of the right kidney. Aspiration was planned when the renal cyst reached 7. 5 cm in diameter. However, 11 months later, the cyst ruptured spontaneously and drained through the previous surgical scar in the flank, while the patient was recovering from a severe chest infection in the spinal unit. Ultrasound examination showed a fistulous tract running between the renal cyst and the abdominal wall. Repeated minor trauma sustained during turning, hoisting and chest physiotherapy all {{may have contributed to}} the rupture of the infected <b>renal</b> cyst and <b>drainage</b> through a weak spot in the abdominal wall. Conclusion In hindsight, we might have prevented rupture of the renal cyst had we considered aspiration of the renal cyst before it reached 7. 5 cm in diameter, although this 7. 5 cm diameter, as the threshold for percutaneous aspiration, is an arbitrary setting. This patient could have been advised to wear an abdominal corset to protect the right flank from pressure applied unintentionally during turning, hoisting or assisted coughing. </p...|$|R
40|$|This review {{should be}} {{regarded}} as an opinion based on personal experience, clinical and experimental studies, and many discussions with colleagues. It covers the main radionuclide procedures for nephro-urological diseases in children. Glomerular filtration rate can be accurately determined using simplified 2 - or 1 -blood sample plasma clearance methods. Minor controversies related to the technical aspects of these methods concern principally some correction factors, the quality control, and the normal values in children. However, the main problem is the reluctance of the clinician to apply these methods, despite the accuracy and precision that are higher than with the traditional chemical methods. Interesting indications are early detection of renal impairment, hyperfiltration status, and monitoring of nephrotoxic drugs. Cortical scintigraphy is accepted as a highly sensitive technique for the detection of regional lesions. It accurately reflects the histological changes, and the interobserver reproducibility in reporting is high. Potential technical pitfalls should be recognized, such as the normal variants and the difficulty in differentiating acute lesions from permanent ones or acquired lesions from congenital ones. Although dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy seems to play a minor role in the traditional approach to urinary tract infection, recent studies suggest that this examination might influence the treatment of the acute phase, the indication for chemoprophylaxis and micturating cystography, and the duration of follow-up. New technical developments have been applied recently to the renogram: tracers more appropriate to the young child, early injection of furosemide, late postmicturition and gravity-assisted images and, finally, more objective parameters of <b>renal</b> <b>drainage.</b> Pitfalls mainly are related to the interpretation of drainage on images and curves. Dilated uropathies represent the main indication of the renogram, but the impact of this technique on the management of the child is, in a great number of cases, still a matter of intense controversy. Direct and indirect radionuclide cystography are interesting alternatives to the radiograph technique and should be integrated into the process of diagnosis and follow-up of vesicoureteral reflux. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.
