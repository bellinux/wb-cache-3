500|$|Millennium Force made {{an impact}} on the <b>way</b> <b>roller</b> {{coasters}} were built. Following its debut, the use of cable lift hills, which require less maintenance and support more weight than a traditional chain lift, became a prevalent feature in the industry. Millennium Force also paved the way for additional coasters breaking the [...] barrier. Top Thrill Dragster, also built by Intamin, opened three years later as the first complete-circuit roller coaster to exceed [...] in height. The company didn't build another [...] "Giga Coaster" [...] until 2010, when it built Intimidator 305 at Kings Dominion. Intimidator 305 is similar to Millennium Force; it has a cable lift and similar layout but varies on the restraints, choosing to utilize shoulder harnesses instead of lap bars. Leviathan opened at Canada's Wonderland in May 2012 breaking [...] as well. Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, it opted for a chain lift instead of a cable lift.|$|R
50|$|Silverman also {{developed}} successful comedies such as Diff'rent Strokes, The Facts of Life and Gimme a Break!, {{and made the}} series commitments that led to Cheers and St. Elsewhere. Silverman also pioneered entertainment reality programming with the 1979 launch of Real People. His contributions to the network's game show output included Goodson-Todman's Card Sharks and a revival of Password, both of which enjoyed great success in the morning schedule, although he also canceled several other relatively popular series, including The Hollywood Squares and High <b>Rollers,</b> to make <b>way</b> for The David Letterman Show (those cancellations also threatened Wheel of Fortune, whose host, Chuck Woolery, departed the show in a payment dispute during Silverman's tenure, although the show survived). Silverman also oversaw the hiring of Pat Sajak as the new host of Wheel of Fortune, a position Sajak holds to this day, although Silverman himself objected to Sajak's hiring. On Saturday mornings, {{in a time when}} most of the cartoon output of the three networks were similar, Silverman oversaw the development of an animated series based on The Smurfs; the animated series The Smurfs ran from 1981 to 1989, well after Silverman's departure, making it one of his longest-lasting contributions to the network. He also oversaw a revival of The Flintstones.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Musculoskeletal health {{benefits}} from flexibility training {{and maintaining a}} functional, or sport specific, range of motion is important to one’s overall fitness. Commercial foam rollers are commonly used in gyms, therapy clinics and homes, yet data are lacking on the optimal rolling duration and effect on range of motion. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of varied durations of a commercial foam roller treatment on hamstring range of motion. Methods: The knee extension range of motion of 33 college aged men and women (age = 20 ± 1. 5 y, mass = 72. 2 ± 10. 8 kg) was assessed after a short (2 sets of 10 s) and long (4 sets of 30 s) duration of hamstring self-administered myofascial release using a commercial foam <b>roller.</b> A one <b>way</b> ANOVA was performed to compare the mean knee extension angle for each condition to baseline measures. Results: Results indicated that neither the short duration (67. 30 ± 10. 60 deg) nor long duration (67. 41 ± 10. 81 deg) rolling condition produced significant increases in knee extension compared to baseline (67. 70 ± 9. 90 deg). Conclusion: Self-administered foam rolling for a total duration of up to 2 minutes is not adequate to induce improvements in knee joint flexibility. Contributing factors may include the amount of pressure imparted by the commercial roller as well as duration of treatment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: "Die-less forming " {{is a new}} concept, {{intended}} to manufacture long compo-nents of continuous-fiber thermoplastic-matrix composites. The concepts behind die-less forming have been tested in experiments on a two-roller demonstration machine. The experiments focused on finding the effects of important forming parameters on the shape. Laminates with special lay-up were also made and formed to study the effect of lay-up on shape. Quasi-isotropic laminates showed an unexpected "excess bending. " An elastic/visco-plastic model has been developed to explain and predict this excess bending during die-less forming. The model is rate dependent and captures the shape dependency on strain rate, transverse feed magnitude and the lay-up. The model {{is based on the}} application of the principle of virtual displacements. The model predicts the net bend angle well for quasi-isotropic laminates. 1. EXCESS BENDING DUE TO INCREMENTAL FORMING I N THE DIE-LESS forming process, we control the position of the <b>rollers</b> andhence the <b>way</b> the component exits the forming zone. The material does not allow in-plane changes in area. Hence, we consider only developable shapes to be formed out of continuous fiber laminates. Although the shapes before and after the bend is propagated are developable (inextensible) surfaces, the interme-diate shapes are not. Referring to Figure 1, the constraints on the component are as follows: o The left of the component is fixed to an XZ table. This article was invited by the edito...|$|R
30|$|Whip roller {{settings}} in a weaving machine {{is one of}} the vital factor to adjust warp yarn tension properly as well as delivering fault free fabric. The present study was undertaken with an aim to explore the influence of whip roller settings on various physical and mechanical properties of both grey and finished 100 % cotton denim fabric in order to select suitable position of whip roller for producing particular (3 / 1 twill) denim fabric. For this purpose total eight positions of whip roller were selected keeping constant depth with variable height in five cases and constant height with variable depth in three cases. The samples were produced in an air jet loom and some prominence like EPcm, PPcm, areal density, tensile strength, dimensional stability, air permeability, crimp% and skewness were checked. Data analysis of all the results showed that with the ascendance of whip roller, crimp% of warp yarn was decreased whereas crimp% of weft yarn was increased both in grey and finished state. Decreasing the depth of whip roller caused increment of both warp and weft crimp% in both state. Tensile strength in warp way direction was found to increase gradually up to a certain roller height and then decreased whereas air permeability showed reverse trend in both state. Warp density, Weft density as well as areal density was also affected by the alteration in settings of whip roller. Due to reduction of <b>roller</b> depth, warp <b>way</b> tensile strength and lengthwise shrinkage were reduced but air permeability had improved.|$|R
40|$|Transportation was a prime {{consideration}} in the business policies of the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company from its inception. Although the company legally enjoyed the position of monopoly {{by virtue of the}} Royal Charter of 1670, which granted to the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company the Canadian territory called Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land, this privilege had to be defended from commercial intruders. From the earliest days the company developed its own transportation network in order to maintain a competitive edge over its opponents. During its first century, when business ventured hardly beyond the shores of the Hudson Bay, the company perfected its transatlantic shipping. Later, when competitors from Montreal moved into the western interior, the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company countered by opening several inland rivers, developing a unique wooden craft, the Yorkboat, and constructing <b>rollered</b> passage <b>ways</b> around several rapids. The efficiency of its transportation system enabled the company to defeat all challengers, including the Montreal traders, who were absorbed in 1821. Starving the competition by slashing prices, trading liquor, and deploying its best servants to critical areas were other tactics the company employed to preserve its fur empire. The principal means by which the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company defended its trade monopoly, nevertheless, was to maintain an efficient transportation system into Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land. By the 1850 s the company 2 ̆ 7 s policy of controlling access to its fur preserve faced an entirely new and potentially fatal challenge. Settlement, with technology based on an expanding agricultural-industrial economy, was rapidly approaching the undeveloped plains. The economic activities of this encroaching civilization foretold death for the fur trade. Several fur empires in other parts of North America had already yielded to the relentless advance of settlement; company officials knew that theirs would also eventually succumb. As early as 1849 Peter Skene Ogden, the chief factor in Oregon, wrote George Simpson, the resident governor of the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company, 2 ̆ 2 You are I presume fully aware that the fur trade and civilization can never blend together and experience teaches us that the former invariably gives way to the latter. 2 ̆ 2 Understanding that the fall of the fertile portion of Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land to agricultural settlement was inevitable, the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company developed a strategy to retain its hold over the fur trade wherever possible and to dominate the commercial potential of the new economic order. Accessibility was the key to the survival plan; realizing that transportation was the vanguard of the new civilization, the company once again decided to control this technology within its domain and to develop it to the company 2 ̆ 7 s own advantage. The most obvious legal threat to the company 2 ̆ 7 s charter came from the province of Canada. This British colony could claim historical, imperial, and juridical ties with Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land. During the 1850 s, however, the provincial government did not press claims to the territories. The editor of the Toronto Globe, George Brown, tried to rally his readers to the cause of western annexation-for years his strident editorials praised the Northwest as a panacea for the stagnating economy of Upper Canada-but his proposal remained a minor issue even in his own Clear Grit party and was dismissed as unimportant by the Montreal press. In 1857 a legislative committee, established to investigate the worrisome emigration of young Canadians to the United States, completely ignored the prairies as a haven for prospective farmers and urged instead that they be retained in Canada by means of a vigorous industrialization policy. That same year Canada 2 ̆ 7 s position at the British parliamentary inquiry into the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company license was timid and noncommittal. Canada simply could not afford to buyout the company 2 ̆ 7 s charter and trading rights nor could it finance the administration of such a vast domain...|$|R
30|$|Based on this {{experimental}} study, it can {{be concluded}} that warp density and weft density of denim fabric were changed due to change in position of whip roller both in horizontal and vertical way. That’s why areal density was also affected by backrest <b>roller</b> position. Warp <b>way</b> crimp% gradually decreased with increasing height at fixed depth of whip roller both in grey and finished state while it showed vice versa result with increasing depth at fixed height in both state of fabric. The sample made at height position of + 12 and depth 5 showed maximum warp crimp% value of 13.33 and 16.36 in grey and finished state respectively. Weft way crimp% also showed a significant result in finished state. The maximum finished weft crimp% value found at the position of + 16 height and depth 4 was 7.8. The position of whip roller affects grey fabric’s weft way crimp% slightly. Warp way tensile strength tremendously increased with ascending of whip roller position. But after a certain position again it gradually decreased in both state. Warp strength had a similar relation with decreasing depth position of whip roller in fixed height. The maximum warp strength value for grey and finished fabric were 761.77 N and 688.06 N respectively found at height position of + 14 and depth position of 4. No significant effect was found on weft strength, width wise shrinkage and skewness of denim fabric both in grey and finished state due to change in settings of whip roller. Air permeability of denim fabric simultaneously decreased with increasing height of whip roller but after a certain position it started to increase. This trend was found for both (grey and finished) fabric at fixed depth position of whip roller. But air permeability changed in inversely proportional way with variable depth at constant height position of whip roller. The highest value of air permeability (in cm 3 /s/cm 2) for grey and finished denim was found 160.42 and 156.94 respectively at the position of height + 8 and depth 4. Width wise fabric shrinkage gradually increased with increasing height position of whip roller at fixed depth and similarly decreased with decreasing depth of whip roller at fixed height setting but only in case of grey state. The maximum value of shrinkage% was 12.6 at height + 12 and depth 3. In finishing state of fabric, shrinkage% had so negligible value due to different finishing treatment. Generally whip roller setting is kept unchanged in different woven fabric production. But it directly affects EPcm and PPcm which change the cover factor of fabric. Moreover, the research result shows that it also deviates different physical properties of fabric. So if this position is optimized, fabric properties can be enriched as well as faults can be minimized.|$|R
