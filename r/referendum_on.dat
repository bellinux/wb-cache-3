5|$|Brown and the Labour {{party had}} pledged {{to allow a}} <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> the EU Treaty of Lisbon.

Brown's opponents {{on both sides of}} the House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public a <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> the original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E

Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations; consequently, it dismissed the Falkland Islands' sovereignty referendum.|$|E
