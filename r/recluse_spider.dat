5000|$|The <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> {{or brown}} spiders, genus Loxosceles (...) , {{also known as}} fiddle-backs, violin spiders, or reapers, are a genus of venomous spiders known for their bite, which {{sometimes}} produces a characteristic set of symptoms known as loxoscelism. <b>Recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> are now identified {{as members of the}} family Sicariidae, having formerly been placed in their own family, the Loxoscelidae. Although <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> have a bad reputation, they are usually not aggressive.|$|R

25|$|The American Association of Poison Control Centers {{reported}} that they received calls regarding nearly 10,000 spider bites in 1994. The spiders of most concern in North America are brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders,</b> with nearly 1,500 bites in 2013 and black widow spiders with 1,800 bites. The native habitat of brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> is in the southern and central United States, {{as far north as}} Iowa. Encounters with brown recluse outside this native region is very rare and bites are thought to be suspect. A dozen major complications were reported in 2013.|$|R
25|$|Some spider bites {{may lead}} to necrosis. In the United States, only spider bites from the brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> (genus Loxosceles) {{reliably}} progress to necrosis. In other countries, spiders of the same genus, such as the Chilean recluse in South America, are also known to cause necrosis. Claims that yellow sac spiders and hobo spiders possess necrotic venom have not been substantiated.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bites are minor {{with little}} or no necrosis. However, a small number of bites produce {{necrotic}} skin lesions. First pain and tenderness at the site begin. The redness changes over two to three days to a bluish sinking patch of dead skin—the hallmark of necrosis. The wound heals slowly over months but usually completely. Rarely, bites may cause widespread symptoms, with occasional fatalities.|$|E
25|$|Adult brown recluse spiders often live {{about one}} to two years. Each female {{produces}} several egg sacs {{over a period of}} two to three months, from May to July, with approximately fifty eggs in each sac. The eggs hatch in about one month. The spiderlings take about one year to grow to adulthood. The brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> is resilient and can tolerate up to six months of extreme drought and scarcity or absence of food. On one occasion, a brown recluse survived in controlled captivity for over five seasons without any food at all.|$|E
25|$|Antivenom is {{available}} in South America for the venom of related species of <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders.</b> However, the bites, often being painless, usually do not present symptoms until 24 or more hours after the event, possibly limiting {{the effect of this}} intervention.|$|R

5000|$|The spiders of Thomisidae are {{not known}} to be harmful to humans. However, spiders of an {{unrelated}} genus, Sicarius, which are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "crab spiders", or [...] "six-eyed crab spiders", are close cousins to the <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders,</b> and are highly venomous, though human bites are rare.|$|R
25|$|While the {{majority}} of brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bites do not result in any symptoms, cutaneous symptoms occur more frequently than systemic symptoms. In such instances, the bite forms a necrotizing ulcer {{as the result of}} soft tissue destruction and may take months to heal, leaving deep scars. These bites usually become painful and itchy within 2 to 8 hours. Pain and other local effects worsen 12 to 36 hours after the bite, and the necrosis develops over the next few days. Over time, the wound may grow to as large as 25cm (10inches). The damaged tissue becomes gangrenous and eventually sloughs away.|$|E
25|$|Hobo spider bites are {{not known}} to be fatal to healthy humans. The {{necrosis}} in purported cases is similar to, but milder than, that caused by the brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider,</b> and in severe cases can take months to heal. Other reported symptoms include intense headaches, vision abnormalities, and/or general feelings of malaise. These symptoms are not confirmed for the hobo spider bite, specifically {{due to lack of}} positive identification of the spider by an expert, and the Oregon Poison Center (affiliated with the Oregon Health & Science University) is attempting to gather definitive evidence regarding the validity of these reports as of September 2007.|$|E
25|$|As {{suggested}} by its specific epithet reclusa (recluse), the brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> is rarely aggressive, and bites from the species are uncommon. In 2001, more than 2,000 brown recluse spiders {{were removed from}} a heavily infested home in Kansas, yet the four residents who had lived there for years were never harmed by the spiders, despite many encounters with them. The spider usually bites only when pressed against the skin, such as when tangled within clothes, towels, bedding, inside work gloves, etc. Many human victims report having been bitten after putting on clothes {{that had not been}} worn recently, or had been left for many days undisturbed on the floor. The fangs of the brown recluse are so tiny they are unable to penetrate most fabric.|$|E

2500|$|The Chilean recluse {{is one of}} {{the larger}} species of <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders,</b> {{generally}} ranging from 8–40mm in size (including legs). Like most recluses, it is brown and usually has markings on the dorsal side of its thorax, with a black line coming from it that looks like a violin with the neck of the violin pointing {{to the rear of the}} spider resulting in the nickname [...] "fiddleback spider" [...] or [...] "violin spider" [...] in English-speaking areas. Coloring varies from light tan to brown and the violin marking may not be visible. Since the [...] "violin pattern" [...] is not diagnostic, it is far more important, for purposes of identification, to examine the eyes. Most spiders have eight eyes, but <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> have six eyes arranged in pairs (dyads) with one median pair and two lateral pairs.|$|R
50|$|These spiders are venomous {{and capable}} of biting humans. A bite begins with {{moderate}} pain, (in contrast to a brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider's</b> painless bite) followed by itching. Symptoms usually resolve within 7-10 days. However, the spider rarely bites (with females biting more often than wandering males), and the venom rarely produces more than local symptoms.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, the {{hobo spider}} was {{considered}} to be a dangerous species based on a toxicology study on rabbits where lesions appeared after spiders were induced to bite the rabbits. This laboratory study has led to the proposal that {{in some parts of the}} U.S. nearly all bites attributed to the brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> are in reality the hobo spider's bite. The CDC and other U.S. government agencies have also used this same study as the basis for a report claiming that the hobo spider bite causes necrosis in humans, despite the absence of any confirmed cases. Subsequent attempts to replicate the study by injecting sufficient venom to ensure envenomation have failed to produce necrotic lesions, and there is even question as to whether the lesions observed in the original study were necrotic. The CDC no longer considers it a dangerously venomous species.|$|E
25|$|Despite rumors to the contrary, {{the brown}} <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> has not {{established}} itself in California or anywhere outside its native range. This directly contradicts numerous sensationalized media reports of bites occurring where these spiders are absent (and no specimens were found), {{such as a}} 2014 report from Thailand, where a man was claimed to have died from a brown recluse bite. Over the last century, occasional spiders have been intercepted in various locations where they have no known established populations; these spiders may be transported fairly easily, though the lack of established populations well outside the natural range also indicates that such movement has not led to colonization of new areas, after decades of opportunities. Note that the occurrence of brown recluses in a single building (such as a warehouse) outside of the native range is not considered a successful colonization; such single-building populations can occur (e.g., in several such cases in Florida), but do not spread, and can be easily eradicated.|$|E

2500|$|Sicariidae is {{a family}} of six-eyed venomous spiders known for their {{allegedly}} necrotic bites. The members of this family are haplogyne, possessing unsclerotised genitals in females. The family consists of two genera, Loxosceles and Sicarius, and contains about 132 species. [...] Well known spiders in this family include the brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> and the assassin spider.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{increased}} fear of these spiders prompted by greater {{public awareness of}} their presence in recent years, extermination of domestic brown recluses is performed frequently in the lower midwestern United States. Brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> possess a variety of adaptive abilities, including the ability to maintain homeostasis for several seasons with no food or water. Additionally, these spiders survive significantly longer in a relatively cool, thermally stable environment.|$|R
25|$|Common fauna in the APA include spiders such as tarantulas, Brazilian {{wandering}} <b>spiders,</b> <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> and Sibynomorphus mikanii; snakes such {{as water}} snakes, Coral snakes, false corals, Bothrops jararaca, boa constrictors, anacondas, Corallus hortulanus, Oxybelis fulgidus, Chironius and Sibynomorphus mikanii; amphibians such as Hylomantis granulosa, Rhinella, Leptodactylus labyrinthicus and Tropidurus semitaeniatus, reptiles such as iguana and spectacled caiman; primates such as robust capuchin monkeys, common squirrel monkey, pale-throated sloth; and other mammals such as coatis, paca, common agouti and capybara.|$|R
5000|$|Loxoscelism (...) is a {{condition}} occasionally produced by the bite of the <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> (genus Loxosceles). The area becomes dusky and becomes a deep open sore as the skin around the bite dies (necrosis). It is the only proven type of necrotic arachnidism in humans. While there is no known therapy effective for loxoscelism, there has been research on antibiotics, surgical timing, hyperbaric oxygen, potential antivenoms and vaccines. Because {{of the number of}} diseases that may mimic loxoscelism, it is frequently misdiagnosed by physicians.|$|R
2500|$|The {{issue of}} {{necrosis}} in some bite cases in published studies {{begins with a}} {{paper presented at the}} International Society on Toxinology World Congress held in Brisbane in 1982.

5000|$|There is {{a legend}} that daddy long-legs spiders {{have the most}} potent venom of any spider, but that their fangs are either too small or too weak to {{puncture}} human skin; the same legend is also repeated of the harvestman and crane fly, also known as [...] "daddy long-legs" [...] in some regions. Indeed, pholcid spiders do have a short fang structure (called uncate due to its [...] "hooked" [...] shape). Brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> also have uncate fang structure, but are able to deliver medically significant bites. Possible explanations include: pholcid venom is not toxic to humans; pholcid uncate are smaller than those of brown recluse; or there is a musculature {{difference between the two}} arachnids, with <b>recluses,</b> being hunting <b>spiders,</b> possessing stronger muscles for fang penetration.|$|R
25|$|Brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> {{are usually}} between , but may grow larger. While {{typically}} light to medium brown, they range in color from whitish to dark brown or blackish gray.

25|$|Many {{of these}} {{conditions}} are far more common {{and more likely to}} be the source of necrotic wounds, even in areas where brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> actually occur. The most important of these is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacterium whose necrotic lesions are very similar to those induced by recluse bites, and which can be lethal if left untreated. Misdiagnosis of MRSA as spider bites is extremely common (nearly 30% of patients with MRSA reported that they initially suspected a spider bite), and can have fatal consequences.|$|R
