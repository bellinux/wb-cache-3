50|$|In older tatting and {{crocheting}} patterns, picots {{were sometimes}} specified as purls, purl stitches, or pearl stitches. These specifications {{are not to}} be confused with the <b>reverse</b> <b>stitch</b> known as a purl in knitting.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Reverse</b> {{stockinette}} <b>stitch</b> {{is produced}} {{in the same way}} as stockinette, except that the purl stitches are done on the right side and the knit stitches on the wrong side. [...] In the round, <b>reverse</b> stockinette <b>stitch</b> is produced by purling every stitch.|$|R

50|$|Two {{knitted fabrics}} can {{be joined by}} embroidery-based {{grafting}} methods, most commonly the Kitchener <b>stitch.</b> New <b>wales</b> can be begun {{from any of the}} edges of a knitted fabric; this is known as picking up stitches and is the basis for entrelac, in which the wales run perpendicular to one another in a checkerboard pattern.|$|R
50|$|Basic {{knitted fabrics}} are so {{fundamental}} that some types {{have been adopted}} {{as part of the}} language of knitting, similar to techniques such as yarn over or decrease. Examples include stockinette <b>stitch,</b> <b>reverse</b> stockinette <b>stitch,</b> garter stitch, seed stitch, faggoting, and tricot. In some cases, these fabrics appear differently on the right side (as seen when making the stitch) than on the wrong side (as seen from the other side, when the work is turned).|$|R
50|$|Slip {{stitches}} may {{be added}} to increase {{the depth of the}} ribbing, and to accentuate the <b>stitches</b> of certain <b>wales.</b> For example, the knit stitches can be slipped every other row to double their height and make them come forward.|$|R
2500|$|In some cases, {{a stitch}} may be {{deliberately}} left unsecured {{by a new}} <b>stitch</b> and its <b>wale</b> allowed to disassemble. [...] This is known as drop-stitch knitting, and produces a vertical ladder of see-through holes in the fabric, corresponding to where the wale had been.|$|R

50|$|In knitting, ribbing is {{a pattern}} in which {{vertical}} stripes of stockinette stitch alternate with vertical s of <b>reverse</b> stockinette <b>stitch.</b> These two types of stripes may be separated by other stripes in which knit and purl stitches alternate vertically; such plissé stripes add width and depth to ribbing but not more elasticity.|$|R
50|$|Mosaic stitch is the {{simplest}} diagonal stitch used in needlepoint. It is built up of cells of three stitches two short stitches flanking one long one. It {{is similar to}} Cushion stitch (or Scotch stitch) but has only 3 diagonals per group rather than five. In <b>Reversed</b> Mosaic <b>stitch</b> alternate cells run in opposite diagonals to form a chequerboard effect.|$|R
2500|$|In {{securing}} the previous <b>stitch</b> in a <b>wale,</b> the next <b>stitch</b> can {{pass through the}} previous loop from either below or above. [...] If the former, the stitch is denoted as a 'knit stitch' or a 'plain stitch;' if the latter, as a 'purl stitch'. The two stitches are related in that a knit stitch seen {{from one side of}} the fabric appears as a purl stitch on the other side.|$|R
5000|$|The local terms used to {{describe}} the embroidery work are 'kuty' or 'awtty' meaning [...] "stitching" [...] and 'kutyvoy' meaning the embroidered piece. The materials used in this work are roughly woven white cloth, woolen black and red threads with use occasionally of blue threads and manufactured needles. The designs developed relate to nature and the daily cycle of life. The fabric used is coarse bleached half white cotton cloth with bands; the woven bands on the fabric consist of two bands, one in red and one band in black, spaced at six inches. Embroidery is limited to the space within the bands and is done by using a single stitch darning needle. It is not done within an embroidery frame but is done by counting the warp and welf on the fabric which has uniform structure by the <b>reverse</b> <b>stitch</b> method. To bring out a rich texture in the embroidered fabric, during the process of needle stitching, a small amount of tuft is deliberately allowed to bulge. Geometric pattern is achieved by counting the warp and welf in the cloth used for embroidery.|$|R
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, basketweave {{is composed}} of a checkerboard pattern of identical rectangles that alternate between stockinette <b>stitch</b> and <b>reverse</b> stockinette <b>stitch.</b> In this form of basketweave, the only variables are {{the dimensions of the}} rectangles, i.e., the number of stitches across and number of rows long. If the rectangles are much longer vertically than horizontally, a basketweave may also be called a broken rib pattern. Similarly, if the rectangles are much longer horizontally than vertically, a basketweave may also be called a broken welt pattern. More complicated types of basketweave can be made with allowing the rib and welt widths to vary (i.e., by using rectangles of different sizes), and by allowing some rows or welts to continue uninterrupted.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{varieties}} of knitting: weft knitting and warp knitting. In the more common weft knitting, the wales are perpendicular to {{the course of the}} yarn. In warp knitting, the wales and courses run roughly parallel. In weft knitting, the entire fabric may be produced from a single yarn, by adding <b>stitches</b> to each <b>wale</b> in turn, moving across the fabric as in a raster scan. By contrast, in warp knitting, one yarn is required for every wale. Since a typical piece of knitted fabric may have hundreds of wales, warp knitting is typically done by machine, whereas weft knitting is done by both hand and machine. [...] Warp-knitted fabrics such as tricot and milanese are resistant to runs, and are commonly used in lingerie.|$|R
2500|$|If {{they are}} not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; {{this is known as}} ripping out, {{unravelling}} knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured ("active" [...] or [...] "live"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a wale. To secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final <b>stitches</b> in a <b>wale,</b> one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.|$|R
5000|$|Reverse coil zippers are a {{variation}} of the coil zipper. In a reverse coil zipper, the coil is on the reverse (back) side of the zipper and the slider works on the flat side of the zipper (normally the back, now the front). Unlike an invisible zipper where the coil is also on the back, the <b>reverse</b> coil shows <b>stitching</b> on the front side and the slider accommodates a variety of pulls (the invisible zipper requires a small, tear-drop pull due to the small slider attachment). Water resistant zippers are generally configured as reverse coil so that the pvc coating can cover the stitching. A rubber or PVC coated reverse zipper is called a waterproof zipper.|$|R
40|$|STITCH is a {{computer}} program that processes raw nucleotide-sequence data to automatically remove unwanted vector information, perform reverse-complement comparison, stitch shorter sequences together to make longer ones to which the shorter ones presumably belong, and search against the user s choice of private and Internet-accessible public 16 S rRNA databases. [" 16 S rRNA" denotes a ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequence that is common to all organisms. ] In STITCH, a template 16 S rRNA sequence is used to position forward and <b>reverse</b> reads. <b>STITCH</b> then automatically searches known 16 S rRNA sequences in the user s chosen database(s) to find the sequence most similar to (the sequence {{that lies at the}} smallest edit distance from) each spliced sequence. The result of processing by STITCH is the identification of the most similar well-described bacterium. Whereas previously commercially available software for analyzing genetic sequences operates on one sequence at a time, STITCH can manipulate multiple sequences simultaneously to perform the aforementioned operations. A typical analysis of several dozen sequences (length of the order of 103 base pairs) by use of STITCH is completed in a few minutes, whereas such an analysis performed by use of prior software takes hours or days...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{retrospective}} {{chart analysis}} reports and assesses the long-term (beyond 10  years) safety {{and efficiency of}} a single institution’s experience in 1326 laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repairs (LIVHR), defending {{the principle of the}} suturing defect (augmentation repair concept) prior to laparoscopic reinforcement with a composite mesh (IPOM Plus). This study aims to prove the feasibility and validity of IPOM Plus repair, among other concepts, as a well-justified treatment of incisional or ventral hernias, rendering a good long-term outcome result. Methods: A single institution’s systematic retrospective review of 1326 LIVHR was conducted between the years 2000 and 2014. A standardized technique of routine closure of the defect prior to the intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) reinforcement was performed in all patients. The standardized technique of “defect closure” by laparoscopy approximating the linea alba under physiological tension was assigned by either the transparietal U <b>reverse</b> interrupted <b>stitches</b> or the extracorporeal closure in larger defects. All patients benefited from the implant Parietex composite® mesh through an Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh placement with transfacial suturing. Results: LIVHR was performed on 1326 patients, 52. 57  % female and 47. 43  % male. The majority of our patients were young (mean age 52. 19  years) and obese (average BMI 32. 57  kg/m 2). The mean operating time was 70  min and hospital stay 2  days, with a mean follow-up of 78  months. On the overall early complications of 5. 78  %, we achieved over time the elimination of the dead space by routine closure of the defect, thus reducing seroma formation to 2. 56  %, with a low risk of infection < 1  %. Post-op sepsis occurred in only nine cases. Three secondary serosal breakdowns and two late perforations were re-operated, and three diabetic patients had infected hematomas, necessitating mesh removal. Through technical improvement in the suturing concept and our growing experience, we managed to reduce the incidence of transient pain to a low acceptable rate of 3. 24  % (VAS 5 – 7) that decreased to 2. 56  % on a chronic pain stage, which is comparable to the literature. On the overall rate of late complications of 10. 74  %, we noticed also that by reducing the dead space, the chronic pain, skin bulging, and rate of recurrence were reduced to, respectively, 2. 56, 1. 50, and 4. 72  %. One case of mortality was due to a tracheal stenosis, responsible for an acute respiratory syndrome. On a second-look follow-up of 126 patients (9. 5  %), 45. 23  % were adhesion free, 42. 06  % had minor adhesions classified as Müller I, and 12. 69  % had serosal adhesions classified as Müller II. Conclusion: Our long series confirms the unexpected high rate of feasibility in the suturing concept or augmentation technique, and confers additional benefits to the conventional advantages of LIVHR in terms of reducing the overall morbidity, with a low rate of recurrences. Based on our experience and study, the current best indications for a successful LIVHR procedure should be tailored upon the limitations of the defect’s width and proper patient selection, to restore adequately the optimal functionality of the abdominal muscles and provide better functional and cosmetic outcomes.
