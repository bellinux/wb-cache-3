At the same time, on the other side of the Bothnian Gulf, the Finnish main railway to Oulu had almost been completed, and would soon be of great use for the Russians to transport military personnel and supplies towards the Swedish border in case of war. Combined with the planned Luleå–Boden–Gällivare–Kiruna–Narvik <b>railway</b> <b>stretch</b> (the Iron Ore and Ofoten Lines), this would pose a great opportunity for the Russians to fulfill their latent wish to seize control of northern Scandinavia and the Atlantic ports on the Norwegian coast.

This was also noticed by the Riksdag member Johan Erik Nyström from Norrbotten's electoral district whoworried about the railway to Ouluput forward a motion about strengthening the Upper Norrland defence in 1885. The length of the railway lines started to affect strategic planning, and in some cases military decisions influenced the planning of new railway lines.|$|E

Official {{suspicion}} centered on neo-Fascist terrorists, since the attack took place on the same <b>railway</b> <b>stretch</b> at which right-wing extremists bombed the Italicus train in 1974, killing twelve and wounding 48. The Public Prosecutor Office promptly began an inquiry. A chemical and ballistic survey was commissioned in order to find the kind of explosive used and the disaster dynamics. A witness was found: he saw two people placing two bags in the 9th car luggage rack in Florence station, so the inquiry was assigned to Florence prosecutors.|$|E
50|$|Obozyorsky was {{established}} as a railway station on November 29, 1987, when the <b>railway</b> <b>stretch</b> between Vologda and Arkhangelsk was built. Previously, the village of Alexandrovskaya existed at the same location. Alexandrovskaya was known from the mid-19th century. Obozyorskaya {{was one of the}} biggest cargo stations of the railway. From 1922, the station was included into Yakovlevskaya Volost of Arkhangelsky Uyezd, Arkhangelsk Governorate. In 1926, it was transferred to Plesetskaya Volost. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, the governorates merged into Northern Krai, and Plesetsky District {{was established}}. In 1937, the settlement at Obozyorskaya railway station became the administrative center of Yakovlevsky Selsoviet.|$|E
50|$|The further {{development}} of Kotlas {{was due to the}} construction of the Pechora Railway. Already from 1899 Kotlas was connected by a railway line with Vyatka (currently Kirov), which was heavily used for the cargo transport of goods to and from the Northern Dvina River. In 1940, the construction of the railroad connecting Konosha (on the <b>railway</b> <b>stretch</b> between Moscow and Arkhangelsk) to Vorkuta started. The railroad was needed to transport coal, timber, and later oil from the Komi Republic. The headquarters of this railroad were opened in Kotlas. In the same year, Kotlas became a separate administrative unit. In December 1941, the road was completed, and from 1942, the regular service started. Kotlas thus became an important transport hub. The headquarters of the Pechora Railway were located in Kotlas until 1959, when the railway was merged into the Northern Railway.|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1900 when the railway {{connecting}} Moscow and Pavelets {{was built to}} connect Moscow to Ryazan-Ural Railway. Initially, the station was named Zagorye according to {{the name of the}} closest village. Until September 1900, Paveletsky railway station in Moscow was not yet completed, and the trains from the station of Zagorye followed to the Kursky railway station. Subsequently, the station was renamed Biryulyovo according to another village, located further away, and the name was transferred to the settlement which was built to serve the station. In the 1910s, the station of Biryulyovo was separated into a cargo station (Biryulyovo-Tovarnaya) and a passenger station (Biryulyovo-Passazhirskaya). Eventually, in 1936 a passenger platform was built on Biryulyovo-Tovarnaya as well, while the cargo station continued to operate. In 1953, the <b>railway</b> <b>stretch</b> between Moscow and Domodedovo, including Biryulyovo Tovarnaya, was electrified. In 1960, the station, together with the urban-type settlement of Biryulyovo, was included into Moscow.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project considers a quantitative model for analysing {{the accessibility of}} open- air stretches of a railway line in emergency conditions using the road system (Borghetti, 2014). The project derives from a previous study (Borghetti and Malavasi, 2016) which illustrated the problems regarding the vulnerability of a <b>railway</b> <b>stretch</b> with particular reference to accessibility in emergency conditions; a method for evaluating accessibility was proposed, with reference to a specific territorial situation. This work will examine in detail the analytic structure of the individual indicators {{that make up the}} model. An Accessibility Index was determined for each railway link i of homogeneous length, starting from an evaluation of the territorial and contextual characteristics in which the line is positioned. The analysis procedure consists firstly of identifying those parameters that compete in implementation of the Accessibility Index, and secondly in aggregating the Indicator parameters which, through the use of relatively important weights, are part of Index determination. The model is based on a comparative approach that places the Accessibility Index in relation to the links that make up a <b>railway</b> <b>stretch,</b> therefore identifying the priorities and a hierarchy of the management and/or infrastructural interventions carried out to improve accessibility should important events occur...|$|E
