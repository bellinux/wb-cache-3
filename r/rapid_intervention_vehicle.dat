50|$|Aircraft Handlers use {{various types}} of {{vehicles}} and equipment to complete their fire fighting tasks, most {{of which is the}} same as the equipment used by most civil fire services, with the exception of the vehicles. At Royal Naval Air Stations, Aircraft Handlers are employed mainly at fire stations where they will use two types of fire vehicle, these being the <b>Rapid</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (RIV) and the Major Foam Vehicle (MFV). They also use other types of equipment such as Drager breathing apparatus, Clan Lucas cutting equipment, various sized extending ladders and airbag lifting equipment.|$|E
5000|$|ESUs {{also exist}} as a non-law {{enforcement}} agency based municipal, county or non-government entity and may exist as both career and volunteer groups which are located in urban, rural and remote areas. Non-law enforcement ESUs provide temporary emergency response to incidents during major public events to support the jurisdictions primary 911 EMS, fire and rescue service. ESUs also provide tactical emergency medical support, rescue of confined space victims, wildland/urban interface initial fire suppression, underwater rescue/recovery, high angle rope rescue, wildland search & rescue (SAR), auto accidents victim rescue, building collapses. In rural areas, ESUs perform suppression of wildland forest, brush and grass fires that occur, cliff and mountain search and rescue, underwater search and rescue, swift water and flood rescue operations. The key rationale for {{the integration of the}} functions is that many rural and remote communities do not have dedicated staffing, resources and infrastructure to sustain immediate 24/7 emergency response. A local ESU may exist to mainly provide emergency training such as CPR/AED, first aid, 1st responder, etc. to citizens, communities, OSHA worksite and to marine/ boating. This mobile training capability uses a light-duty emergency vehicle that is fully equipped with a basic life support (BLS) responder medical, wildland/urban interface firefighting system, powered hydraulic and air bag rescue systems, self-contained breathing apparatus and protective fire gear and other equipment and, when requested, can support the local emergency response system as a <b>rapid</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>vehicle.</b> A state or local public health Emergency Services Unit manages the Department’s emergency supplies, supporting technologies used during disasters, and helps fulfill the National and state Emergency Support Function (ESF) #8 Health & Medical Services and ESF #6 Mass Care & Sheltering needs of community citizens during a major emergency or disaster. Local chapters of the American Red Cross often maintain an Emergency Services Unit to provide disaster relief assistance to individuals and families affected by local disasters at fires and local disaster shelters as well as mobile emergency response vehicles (ERV)/ mobile canteens. Scores of our Nation's hospitals and medical centers use Emergency Services Unit to denote their specific organizational section that encompasses their emergency department (ED), Hospital Emergency Incident Management System (HEICS)-Emergency Coordination Center (ECC) and/or their [...] "First Receiver" [...] outside patient decontamination system, and sometimes includes a hospital operated emergency medical service (EMS) paramedic ambulance program. An Emergency Services Unit can also often denote a government or non-government entity emergency mental health or family crisis intervention team.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} of these tankers (a tanker {{is a type}} of fire appliance) is the dual cab Category 1 Tanker, which is mainly used in a {{combination}} of rural and urban/interface roles ('interface' meaning where built-up areas meet bushland). The next most common fire appliances are Category 7 tankers which are used to support heavier appliances in fire fighting operations as well as being a primary appliance themselves. They are also used where rugged terrain prevents heavy tankers access or where it is far too dangerous to take a heavier appliance. Single and dual cab and Category 9 appliances are most often used as <b>rapid</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>vehicles</b> (thus the name 'Striker') to attack small and spot fires quickly before they are able to spread as Strikers are much faster than heavy, medium and light tankers. Strikers are disadvantaged as they carry limited water. Category 9 appliances are also used to patrol an almost extinguished fire for flare-ups and can 'mop-up' small hot spots.|$|R

This study set out to determine the effectiveness of a 2 person RIT team compared with a 4 person team.

Despite antituberculosis therapy, her pulmonary function deteriorated. The chest tomography showed a different lung pattern which is suggestive of LCH. The biopsy findings and immunohistochemistry staining supported the diagnosis. She experienced recurrent pneumothorax incidences which were managed by drainage. She responded well to chemotherapy.
