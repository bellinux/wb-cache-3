Housing adaptations entail alterations of permanent physical features in the home and the immediate outdoor environment, whereas home modifications typically are more complex interventions that often include the provision of assistive technology and related training, etc. Most clients are older people, and measures such as <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> thresholds, <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> shower stalls instead <b>of</b> bathtubs, and <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> handrails and grab bars are among the most common.

40|$|Continued {{advances}} in PV and battery energy storage technologies have made hybrid PV-battery systems an attractive prospect for residential energy consumers. However {{the process to}} select an appropriate system {{is complicated by the}} relatively high cost of batteries, a multitude of available retail electricity plans and the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> PV <b>installation</b> incentive schemes. In this paper, an optimization strategy based on an individual customer's temporal load profile is established to maximize electricity cost savings through optimal selection of PV-battery system size, orientation and retail electricity plan. Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization is applied as the underlying algorithm given its well-suited application to problems involving hybrid energy system specification. The optimization strategy is tested using real-world residential consumption data, current system pricing and available retail electricity plans to establish the efficacy of a hybrid PV-battery solution.

The Virginia government started to pass laws restoring ex-Confederates to their lost privileges, to the displeasure of most former Union Republicans. As the South became increasingly resistant to Reconstruction after the war, the United States Congress passed the Military Reconstruction Act of 1867. Through this Act, Virginia was designated the [...] "First Military District" [...] in 1868, and military commander John Schofield replaced Pierpont with Henry H.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 As our cities' {{foremost}} form {{of public}} space, streets play an integral role in social interaction. However, {{since the age}} of the automobile, streets have become more about providing conduits for transportation rather than public spaces for people. Trends such as pedestrian streets and complete streets have focused on multi-modal mobility in an effort to deemphasize the dominance of automobiles on streets. Similarly, shared space strives to accommodate all modes of transportation by deemphasizing the automobile and converting streets back into spaces for people. Shared space promotes design and behavior modification strategies to reinvigorate street life for all users, not just automobiles. Ultimately, the concept of shared space strives to repurpose streets into spaces for people to safely gather, socialize, and play, thus contributing to overall neighborhood well-being. Originally a European concept, and still nascent in the United States, this study examines shared space in an American context. Three recent examples of shared space in the United States are studied: Bell Street Park in Seattle, WA; Davis Street in Portland, OR; and Santana Row Promenade in San Jose, CA. Combined with a review of shared space and public space best practices, this case study examination reveals how shared space functions in an American context, {{and what can be done}} to improve future shared space endeavors. Results of the study indicate that many basic shared space principles - <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> traffic signage and markings, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> curbs, <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> consistent paving - help to reduce traffic speeds and accommodate other modes of transportation such as walking and biking. However, these design prescriptions must also be packaged with appropriate land uses, building design strategies, and space programming to ensure an active street life. Vibrant shared spaces are just as reliant on an active off-street environment as they are on on-street design strategies...|$|R

40|$|Many {{fields on}} the Norwegian {{continental}} shelf (NCS) are maturing, {{and there are}} consequently a great number <b>of</b> petroleum <b>installations</b> that will be decommissioned in the near future. Decommissioning entails the full or fractional <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> an <b>installation,</b> and the process normally involves high costs. Having many of the largest extraction facilities in the world, the NCS represents the greatest share <b>of</b> <b>removal</b> costs globally. This thesis models project value and optimal timing of abandonment for a mature field on the NCS. The field produces both crude {{oil and natural gas}} and has an exponentially declining production. The analyses are conducted using a net present value and a real options approach. The real options approach is based on a contingent claims analysis, and includes the modeling of an abandonment option through a binominal lattice. Prices of crude oil and natural gas are modeled stochastically. Both models incorporate scenarios reflecting recent decommissioning market trends. Project data has been received from Statoil. The data is fictive, but based on a real case. The ultimate purpose is to evaluate the potential value of implementing a real options model for decommissioning analyses at Statoil. For our project, we find that the Net Present Value Model and the Real Option Model generally yield the same optimal timing of abandonment, but differ in project valuation. We conclude that the potential value of implementing a real options analysis depends on field characteristics and the purpose of the analysis. In general, the abandonment option is worth more for a field with a low decline in production compared to a rapid decline in production...|$|R
