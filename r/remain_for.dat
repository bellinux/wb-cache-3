5|$|According to polls {{conducted}} by mainstream media, most Japanese people had perceived {{the flag of}} Japan as the national flag even before {{the passage of the}} Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem in 1999. Despite this, controversies surrounding the use of the flag in school events or media still <b>remain.</b> <b>For</b> example, liberal newspapers such as Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun often feature articles critical of the flag of Japan, reflecting their readerships' political spectrum. To other Japanese, the flag represents the time where democracy was suppressed when Japan was an empire.|$|E

The Kerrs spent the next several years living in Europe, and when he died in Australia in 1991, his death was not announced until after he was buried.|$|E
5|$|Although Connecticut {{is divided}} into counties, there is no county {{government}} in Connecticut and local government consists of cities and towns.

Connecticut's court jurisdictions still adhere to the county boundaries, except for Fairfield, Hartford and New Haven, which have been further subdivided into several jurisdictions.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} in the mission, a new {{temporary}} squad member, Liara T'Soni, with a different set of powers joins the squad, and the player must choose who of the previous two members will <b>remain</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the mission. The relationship between Shepard and Liara can vary depending on whether they were romantically involved in the original Mass Effect. The mission includes two bosses and a chase scene in which the player must control a high-speed vehicle through the skies of a city. The player may also find numerous in-game upgrades that enhance aspects of the game's weapons and armor.|$|E

5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers slid off the track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would <b>remain</b> <b>for</b> half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E
5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} {{on the end}} of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman.

In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked why}} she did not {{immediately}} inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said {{she had not seen}} any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her of the importance of his visit.

On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|With the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Istanbul Province having {{equivalent}} jurisdictions, few responsibilities <b>remain</b> <b>for</b> {{the provincial}} government.

Mirroring {{the executive committee}} at the municipal level, the Provincial Executive Committee includes a secretary-general and leaders of departments that advise the Provincial Parliament. The Provincial Administration's duties are largely limited to the building and maintenance of schools, residences, government buildings, and roads, {{and the promotion of}} arts, culture, and nature conservation. Hüseyin Avni Mutlu has been Governor of Istanbul Province since May 2010.|$|E
