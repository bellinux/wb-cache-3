25|$|In Persian mythology, the Gaokerena world tree is a large, sacred Haoma tree which bears all seeds. Ahriman (Ahreman, Angremainyu) {{created a}} frog {{to invade the}} tree and destroy it, aiming to prevent all trees from growing on the earth. As a reaction, God (Ahura Mazda) created two kar fish staring at the frog to guard the tree. The two fish are always staring at the frog and stay ready to <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Because Ahriman is {{responsible}} for all evil including death, while Ahura Mazda is responsible for all good (including life) the concept of world tree in Persian mythology is very {{closely related to the}} concept of Tree of Life.|$|E

500|$|The {{museum is}} the subject of The Final Member, a film by Canadian documentarians Zach Math and Jonah Bekhor. It {{profiles}} Sigurður and his quest to obtain a human penis for the museum, telling the story of the American and Icelandic donors and examining the quasi-taboo nature of the museum's collection. Bekhor says: [...] "I wouldn't say it's a Rorschach test, but depending on how you <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> really says a lot about what your relationship is with that element of the human anatomy. It's a really interesting phenomenon and we're really curious to see how audiences respond." [...] The film premiered on 1 May 2012 at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.|$|E
500|$|Façades {{of churches}} often came to {{resemble}} wedding cakes rather than {{places of worship}} as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles {{of a wide variety}} of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as [...] "either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island. Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque style more evident than in Ragusa and Catania.|$|E
500|$|Chandler's {{strategy}} in the campaign was to launch an attack upon the Wetherby administration and, before the Clements-Wetherby-Combs faction could <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> to launch a new one. He claimed Wetherby had used the state's money frivolously by installing air conditioning in the state capitol and installing a $20,000 rug in his office. (An invoice showing that carpeting for the entire {{first floor of the}} capitol had cost one-tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim, which he said [...] "didn't hurt anybody, and people liked to hear it".) After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of African mahogany paneling for the governor's office, Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone [...] "clear to Africa" [...] to find paneling for his office and promised that, if elected, he would use good, honest Kentucky wood for decoration. He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting Elizabethtown and Louisville, the state fairgrounds, and Freedom Hall as unnecessary.|$|E

500|$|At Harvard, Lin {{was uncomfortable}} with the {{attention}} on his ethnicity as opposed to his performance. He regularly heard bigoted jeers at games such as [...] "Wonton soup", [...] "Sweet and sour pork", [...] "Open your eyes!", [...] "Go back to China", [...] "Orchestra {{is on the other}} side of campus," [...] or pseudo-Chinese gibberish. Lin said this occurred at most if not all Ivy League gyms, but he did not <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "I expect it, I'm used to it, it is what it is," [...] said Lin. The heckling came mostly from opposing fans and not as much from players. According to Harvard teammate Oliver McNally, a fellow Ivy League player once called Lin the ethnic slur chink. In January 2010, Harvard played against Santa Clara University at the Leavey Center, just 15 miles from his hometown of Palo Alto, California. Playing to a capacity crowd that included droves of Asian Americans wanting to see his homecoming, his teammates told him, [...] "It was like Hong Kong." ...|$|E

But, when their thinking changes, reality seems different and their reactions change. Thus, according to HR, people are constantly creating their own experience of reality via their thinking.|$|E

2500|$|In a MSR test, animals may not {{recognise}} {{the mark}} as abnormal, or, {{may not be}} sufficiently motivated to <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> [...] However, {{this does not mean}} they are unable to recognise themselves. For example, in a MSR test conducted on three elephants, only one elephant passed the test but the two elephants that failed still demonstrated behaviours that can be interpreted as self-recognition. The researchers commented that the elephants might not have touched the mark because it was not important enough to them. [...] Similarly, lesser apes infrequently engage in self-grooming, which may explain their failure to touch a mark on their head in the mirror test.|$|E

In the song, the Fresh Prince explains how Jeff has brought in a tape that contains a very cool song that he cannot help but rap over, and how fans <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> The song was well received by many hip hop fans due to its funk sound, lyrical spins, {{and the fact that}} it showed off more of the skills of Jazzy Jeff.

In January 2013, he signed with Vanguard Records, feeling that the label [...] "genuinely believed" [...] in his music. He said, [...] "that was a huge stepping-stone for me, because to have my music representing me in the proper way, the way I want it to, and have people understand it and <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> and connect to it like {{that has been the}} goal all along for me." [...] Vanguard gave him a great amount of creative freedom and while DeWyze affirmed that he will always stand by Live It Up, calling it [...] "a part of [...] musical journey," [...] he has stated that Frames feels like his real debut.|$|E

When you begin working on a film, you of course know about the story and your character. However, no one knows how audiences would eventually <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> 'Geet' did strike a chord with the audiences and became a household name." [...] Kareena Kapoor, for her performance, was ranked number 66 in Filmfare magazine's 80 Iconic Bollywood Performances list. According to Hindi Film News, she was number 5 in the critic's top ten and number 4 in the popular top ten for the finest performance by a Bollywood actress for the decade. She was also named by Rediff as one of Bollywood's most beloved characters.|$|E
