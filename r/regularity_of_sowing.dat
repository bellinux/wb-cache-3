5000|$|The {{benefits}} {{derived from}} turnip husbandry are of great magnitude; light soils are cultivated with profit and facility; abundance of food is provided for man and beast; {{the earth is}} turned to the uses {{for which it is}} physically calculated, and by being suitably cleaned with this preparatory crop, a bed is provided for grass seeds, wherein they flourish and prosper with greater vigor than after any other preparation.The first ploughing is given immediately after harvest, or as soon as the wheat seed is finished, either in length or across the field, as circumstances may seem to require. In this state the ground remains till the oat seed is finished, when a second ploughing is given to it, usually in a contrary direction to the first. It is then repeatedly harrowed, often rolled between the harrowings and every particle of root-weeds carefully picked off with the hand; a third ploughing is then bestowed, and the other operations are repeated. In this stage, if the ground has not been very foul, the seed process.The next part of the process is the sowing of the seed; this may be performed by drilling machines of different sizes and constructions, through all acting on the same principle. A machine drawn by a horse in a pair of shafts, sows two drills at a time and answers extremely well, where the ground is flat, and the drills properly made up. The weight of the machine ensures a <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> hardly to be gained by those of a different size and construction. From two to three pounds of seed are sown upon the acre (2 to 3 kg/hectare), though the smallest of these quantities will give many more plants in ordinary seasons than are necessary; but as the seed is not an expensive article the greater part of farmers incline to sow thick, which both provides against the danger of part of the seed perishing, and gives the young plants an advantage at the outset.Turnips are sown from the beginning to the end of June, but the second and third weeks of the month are, by judicious farmers, accounted the most proper time. Some people have sown as early as May, and with advantage, but these early fields are apt to run to seed before winter, especially if the autumn be favorable to vegetation. As a general rule it may be laid down that the earliest sowings should be on the latest soils; plants on such soils are often long before they make any great progress, and, in the end, may be far behind those in other situations, which were much later sown. The hot turnip plant, indeed, does not thrive rapidly till its roots reach the dung, and the previous nourishment afforded them is often so scanty as to stunt them altogether before they get so far.The first thing to be done in this process is to run a horse-hoe, called a scraper, along the intervals, keeping at such a distance from the young plants that they shall not be injured; this operation destroys all the annual weeds which have sprung up, and leaves the plants standing in regular stripes or rows. The hand hoeing then commences, by which the turnips are all singled out at a distance of from 8-12 inches, and the redundant ones drawn into the spaces between the rows. The singling out of the young plants is an operation of great importance, for an error committed in this process can hardly be afterward rectified. Boys and girls are always employed as hoers; but a steady and trusty man-servant is usually set over them to see that the work is properly executed.In eight or ten days, or such a length of time as circumstances may require, a horse-hoe of a different construction from the scraper is used. This, in fact, is generally a small plough, of the same kind with that commonly wrought, but of smaller dimensions. By this implement, the earth is pared away from the sides of the drills, and a sort of new ridge formed {{in the middle of the}} former interval. The hand-hoers are again set to work, and every weed and superfluous turnip is cut up; afterward the horse-hoe is employed to separate the earth, which it formerly threw into the furrows, and lay it back to the sides of the drills. On dry lands this is done by the scraper, but where the least tendency to moisture prevails, the small plough is used, in order that the furrows may be perfectly cleaned out. This latter mode, indeed, is very generally practiced.|$|E

40|$|Sowing is {{affected}} by numerous factors, and thus high‑quality sowing {{is a very important}} task for agricultural engineers and managers of profitable agricultural production. The primary purpose <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> is placing seeds at proper depths and in‑row spacings in well‑prepared soil. Plant population particularly gives prominence to sowing as it directly affects the uniformity of plant growth and development. Soybean planting is especially dependent on the quality of planting for yield formation due to the significant vicinity of seeds. Provided all external factors <b>of</b> high‑quality <b>sowing</b> are met, i. e. sowing conditions, the quality <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> depends upon the planting mechanism. The following features of the planting mechanism are the most important: RPM of the seed disc, the travel speed of a seeder, and the values of gauge and vacuum pressure. This paper presents the results <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> three different fractions of soybean seeds under laboratory conditions. The quality measurement <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> was performed at different values of vacuum pressure and RPM of the seed disc. On balance, an increase in vacuum pressure results in improved sowing quality due to a stronger adherence of seeds to the seed disc. Lower values of vacuum pressure do not exert significant effects on the quality <b>of</b> <b>sowing,</b> regardless <b>of</b> the seed fraction. However, higher RPM of the seed disc entail an increase in the coefficient of variation.

40|$|International audienceThe metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> multifunctions plays {{a crucial}} role in modern variational {{analysis}} and optimization. This property is a key to study the stability of solutions of generalized equations. Many practical problems lead to generalized equations associated to the sum of multifunctions. This paper is devoted to study the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> the sum of multifunctions. As the sum of closed multifunctions is not necessarily closed, almost all known results in the literature on the metric regularity for one multifunction (which is assumed usually to be closed) fail to imply <b>regularity</b> properties <b>of</b> the sum of multifunctions. To avoid this difficulty, we use an approach based on the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> so-called epigraphical multifunctions and the theory of error bounds to study the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> the sum of two multifunctions, as well as some related important properties of variational systems.
