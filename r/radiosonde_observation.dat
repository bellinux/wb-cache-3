40|$|The {{performance}} of twenty GCMs {{that participated in}} the Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 5 (CMIP 5) is evaluated at Sterling, Virginia, by comparing model outputs with radiosonde observational dataset and reanalysis dataset. We evaluated CMIP 5 models {{in their ability to}} simulate wind climatology, seasonal cycle, interannual variability, and trends at the pressure levels from 850 [*]hPa to 30 [*]hPa. We also addressed the question of the number of years required to detect statistically significant wind trends using radiosonde wind measurements. Our results show that CMIP 5 models and reanalysis successfully reproduced the observed climatological annual mean zonal wind and wind speed vertical distribution. They also capture the observed seasonal zonal, meridional, and wind speed vertical distribution with stronger (weaker) wind during the winter (summer) season. However, there is some disagreement in the magnitude of vertical profiles among CMIP 5 models, reanalysis, and <b>radiosonde</b> <b>observation.</b> Overall, the number of years to obtain statistically significant trend decreases with increasing pressure level except for upper troposphere. Although the vertical profile of interannual variability of CMIP 5 models and reanalysis agree with the <b>radiosonde</b> <b>observation,</b> the wind trend is not statistically significant. This indicates that detection of trends on local scale is challenging because of small signal-to-noise ratio problems...|$|E

In order to improve the algorithm, the exact linear, quadratic and logarithmic relationships between brightness temperatures and range corrections were determined.

The IWV maps are constructed using a twodimensional variational technique with a persistence background that is 15 min old. The background error covariances are determined using a novel two-step method, {{which is based on}} the HollingsworthÂ¿Lonnberg method. The quality of these maps is assessed by comparison with <b>radiosonde</b> <b>observations</b> and IWV maps from a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. The analyzed GPS IWV maps have no bias against <b>radiosonde</b> <b>observations</b> and a small bias against NWP analysis and forecasts up to 9 h.

To illustrate the additional value of these real-time products for nowcasting, three thunderstorm cases are discussed. The constructed GPS IWV maps are combined with data from the weather radar, a lightning detection network, and surface wind observations. All cases show that the location of developing thunderstorms can be identified 2 h prior to initiation in the convergence of moist air...|$|R

This study compares {{the structure and}} characteristics of tropical synoptic timescale wave disturbances over the western Pacific, particularly around the Caroline Islands where six upper air stations are present, as contained in <b>radiosonde</b> <b>observations</b> and the initial analysis (tau 00) and 48 -h forecast (tau 48) of the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) during northern winter of 1991 - 1992. The observed, analyzed and forecast disturbance climatologies are all determined from power spectral and cross-spectral analyses focusing on the synoptic frequency band encompassing three adjacent period points: 4. 6 -, 5. 3 - and 6. 4 -day. The meridional wind at 850 hPa is used as the principal parameter for defining the disturbances. The power spectra of the NOGAPS rau 00 analysis agree reasonably closely with the <b>radiosonde</b> <b>observations,</b> but the tau 48 forecast shows larger differences. Nevertheless, the observed horizontal structure of the disturbances are all well represented in both the analysis and the forecast at all levels. These include the westward propagation, a 850 hPa wavelength near 33 deg along 10 deg N and near 38 deg along the equator, a 200 hPa wavelength near 50 - 60 deg, and a northeast-southwest meridional tilt.

An atmospheric ensemble reanalysis (ALERA 2) {{was used as}} the control experiment (CTL) to reproduce the development of the Arctic cyclone and surrounding large-scale atmospheric fields. The OSE applies the same reanalysis as the CTL except for the exclusion of <b>radiosonde</b> <b>observations</b> from the German icebreaker Polarstern, which cruised near Svalbard during mid-July to early August 2012. Comparison of the two reanalyses revealed a difference in the upper tropospheric circulation over northern mid-Eurasia, just before the Arctic cyclone developed, {{in the form of a}} stronger tropopause polar vortex in the CTL. This indicated that the upper tropospheric field in the CTL had greater potential for baroclinic instability over mid-Eurasia. Ensemble predictions were then conducted using the two reanalyses as initial values at which the tropopause polar vortex approached northern mid-Eurasia. The CTL prediction reproduced the formation of the Arctic cyclone, but the OSE shows a significantly weaker one. These results indicate that the improved reproduction of upper tropospheric circulation in the Arctic region due to additional <b>radiosonde</b> <b>observations</b> from a mobile platform was indispensable for the prediction of AC 12. In particular, observations being acquired far from the Arctic cyclone affect the prediction of the cyclone via the upper tropospheric circulation in the atmospheric west wind drift...|$|R
