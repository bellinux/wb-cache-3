5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden as {{the greatest of all}} the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and his son. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others. In the most <b>recent</b> <b>book,</b> Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E

5|$|The 1990 New York Giants {{season was}} one of the most {{successful}} seasons in the professional football franchise's history. The Giants, who play in the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL), won their sixth championship and second Super Bowl. Led by linebacker Lawrence Taylor and quarterbacks Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, the Giants posted a 13–3 record before defeating the Chicago Bears and the two-time defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC playoffs. In Super Bowl XXV, they defeated the Buffalo Bills 20–19 in Tampa Stadium against a patriotic backdrop inspired by the recently started Gulf War.

25|$|Diamond's most <b>recent</b> <b>book,</b> The World Until Yesterday, {{published}} in 2012, asks what {{the western world}} can learn from traditional societies. It surveys 39 traditional small-scale societies of farmers and hunter-gatherers with respect to how they deal with universal human problems. The problems discussed include dividing space, resolving disputes, bringing up children, treatment of elders, dealing with dangers, formulating religions, learning multiple languages, and remaining healthy. The book suggests that some practices of traditional societies could be usefully adopted in the modern industrial world today, either by individuals or else by society as a whole.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} resurrection {{is found in}} the {{writings}} of some ancient non-Abrahamic religions in the Middle East. A few extant Egyptian and Canaanite writings allude to dying and rising gods such as Osiris and Baal. Sir James Frazer in his book The Golden Bough relates to these dying and rising gods, but many of his examples, according to various scholars, distort the sources. Taking a more positive position, Tryggve Mettinger argues in his <b>recent</b> <b>book</b> that the category of rise and return to life is significant for the following deities: Ugaritic Baal, Melqart, Adonis, Eshmun, Osiris and Dumuzi.|$|E

25|$|On 15 June 1520, the Pope warned Luther {{with the}} papal bull (edict) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 {{sentences}} drawn from his writings, including the Ninety-five Theses, within 60 days. That autumn, Johann Eck proclaimed the bull in Meissen and other towns. Karl von Miltitz, a papal nuncio, attempted {{to broker a}} solution, but Luther, who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October, publicly {{set fire to the}} bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520, an act he defended in Why the Pope and his <b>Recent</b> <b>Book</b> are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles. As a consequence, Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X on 3 January 1521, in the bull Decet Romanum Pontificem.|$|E

25|$|In 1860, Boston {{businessman}} and historian Charles Deane {{was the first}} scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest-surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating Queen Anne to treat Pocahontas with dignity. The time gap in publishing his story {{raises the possibility that}} Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, in a <b>recent</b> <b>book,</b> professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, {{there was no reason for}} him to write down the story until this point.|$|E
25|$|A {{similarly}} sympathetic view {{prevails in}} more recent literature. The novel The Stone Angel by Margaret Laurence has a protagonist named Hagar {{married to a man}} named Bram, whose life story loosely imitates that of the biblical Hagar. A character named Hagar is prominently featured in Toni Morrison's novel Song of Solomon, which features numerous Biblical themes and allusions. Hagar is mentioned briefly in Salman Rushdie's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, where Mecca is replaced with 'Jahilia', a desert village built on sand and served by Hagar's spring. Hagar is mentioned, along with Bilhah and Zilpah, in Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, a controversial dystopian novel which centres around the women whose duty it is to produce children for their masters, assuming the place of their wives. In the <b>recent</b> <b>book</b> of nonfiction, , by Charlotte Gordon provides an account of Hagar's life from the perspectives of the three monotheistic religions, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Overseas Indians file more patents {{in their}} country of {{residence}} than in India. Thomas Friedman, in his <b>recent</b> <b>book,</b> The World is Flat, explains this trend in terms of brain drain, whereby {{the best and brightest}} elements in India emigrate to the U.S. in order to seek better financial opportunities. A joint study by Duke University and UC Berkeley revealed that Indian immigrants to the US have founded more engineering and technology companies from 1995 to 2005 than immigrants from the UK, China, Taiwan and Japan combined. A 1999 study by AnnaLee Saxenian reported that a third of Silicon Valley scientists and engineers were immigrants and that Indians are the second largest group of Asian-born engineers (23%) following the Chinese (51%). Her research showed that in 1998, seven percent of high-technology firms in Silicon Valley were led by Indian CEOs. A recent study shows that 23% of Indian business school graduates take a job in United States.|$|E
