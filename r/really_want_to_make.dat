500|$|According to Caballero, SpongeBob was {{the most}} {{challenging}} character to translate to stop motion. It was so [...] "...just because of {{the sheer number of}} parts that needed to be made. We wanted to retain as much of that squashy-stretchy goofiness as possible, so he had dozens of replacement parts, like arms, noses, even various sizes of cheeks and freckles. Of course, as the main character, you <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure he will charm the audience, which brings a special kind of pressure." [...] Walsh said, [...] "The {{most important thing is to}} capture the spirit of the character, not necessarily a literal copy of the 2D. Puppets have their own kind of energy and you have to be careful about what to include and what to leave out." [...] On the other hand, Patchy the Pirate became the easiest character to make [...] "because he has the most humanoid proportions." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2011 Q, {{producer}} Jim Lemley {{said that}} [...] "Wanted 2 {{sounds like it}} will not happen any time soon if at all". That same year, James McAvoy said, regarding the sequel, [...] "I think the studio is keen to make it, and we <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it, {{but we want to}} make it if it's right and when it's right, and that might not be ever." [...] McAvoy also expressed interest in a sequel focusing on a character other than Wesley. Universal later brought Wanted screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas to write the sequel, which Haas described as happening [...] "right after the events that just happened; it'll pick up Wesley a few years later and go back in for another round", while also being [...] "Fox-less and loom-less." [...] Haas would later detail that the script featured a new female protagonist, who Wesley would recruit [...] "sort of in the Fox role." [...] Bekmambetov declared during the interviews for [...] that after many years of indecision as the Wanted sequel stalled in development, he proposed an idea to the screenwriters wherein the plot followed Wesley while featuring [...] "a great twist." ...|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale next reprised {{her role}} as Selene in the fourth {{installment}} of the vampire franchise [...] The franchise was initially conceived of as a trilogy and Beckinsale was not [...] "intending to do another one" [...] but was convinced {{by the quality of}} the script. The Hollywood Reporter noted that [...] "when she’s not actually fighting, her performance consists of little more than striding purposefully toward or away from the camera." [...] The Los Angeles Times remarked that she [...] "finally manages to perfect the monotone delivery she'd been honing for the series' first two entries." [...] The film had a production budget of $70 million and has grossed over $160 million worldwide. Also in 2012, Beckinsale appeared as the villainess in the sci-fi action remake Total Recall, directed by her husband Len Wiseman. She has said Wiseman joined the project because he was unable to receive studio financing for an original sci-fi idea: [...] "You’re constantly finding yourself having to defend doing a remake when you didn’t <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> one in the first place." [...] The film received mainly negative reviews. Variety found her performance [...] "one-note" [...] while The Hollywood Reporter described her as [...] "one-dimensional." [...] USA Today remarked she [...] "spends much of the movie strutting down hallways and looking relentlessly, though blandly, nasty." [...] The New York Post asserted Beckinsale [...] "vastly overstays her welcome." [...] The film has grossed $198 million from a production budget of over $200million.|$|E

500|$|Misfortune awaited Bolt at {{the next}} major event, the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. Bolt felt that both his work ethic and athleticism had much {{improved}} since the 2004 Olympics, {{and he saw the}} World Championships as a way to live up to expectations, stating, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for what happened in Athens. Hopefully, everything will fall into place". Bolt qualified with runs under 21 s, but he suffered an injury in the final, finishing in last place with a time of 26.27 s. Injuries were preventing him from completing a full professional athletics season, and the eighteen-year-old Bolt still had not proven his mettle in the major world-athletics competitions. However, his appearance made him the youngest ever person to appear in a 200 m world final. Bolt was involved in a car accident in November, and although he suffered only minor facial lacerations, his training schedule was further upset. His manager, Norman Peart, made Bolt's training less intensive, and he had fully recuperated the following week. Bolt had continued to improve his performances, and he reached the world top-5 rankings in 2005 and 2006. Peart and Mills stated their intentions to push Bolt to do longer sprinting distances with the aim of making the 400 m event his primary event by 2007 or 2008. Bolt was less enthusiastic, and demanded that he feel comfortable in his sprinting. He suffered another hamstring injury in March 2006, forcing him to withdraw from the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and he did not return to track events until May. After his recovery, Bolt was given new training exercises to improve flexibility, and the plans to move him up to the 400 m event were put on hold.|$|E

The problem is I {{have a bunch of}} ideas and stuff that I want to make. I'm relatively new to this – I'm about to make my third film, and now the pattern that I'm starting to realise is very true is that you lock yourself into a film beyond the film you're currently working on. But it just doesn't work for me." [...] Referring to a potential sequel, Blomkamp said [...] " [...] want to make District 10 at some point".|$|E

[...] In September 2017, he announced that a new studio album would be set for release on March 2, 2018 via Sony Music.|$|E
2500|$|Harry also {{released}} her fifth solo album in 2007. During this time, she delineated the different personae (Blondie the band, {{her role in}} the band, and Deborah Harry the singer) to an interviewer who asked why she played only solo music on the 2007 True Colors Tour: [...] "I've put together a new trio with no Blondie members in it. I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a clear definition between Debbie's solo projects and Blondie, and I hope that the audience can appreciate that and also appreciate this other material." [...] This was a longstanding issue with Harry, as the band name was often misconstrued as her own name. This led the band to feature a promotional slogan, [...] "Blondie is a group." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{provided}} a favorable review, opining {{that the great}} thing about the album are the producers and songwriters who are willing to play with the group's [...] "hyper-sexual image, creating a sleek, sexy sound ideal for both nightclubs and strip joints." [...] However he did go on to criticize the albums's ballad's. Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani felt that if [...] "the Pussycat Dolls <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their mark in the giant litter box that is popular music today, they need more of the big band burlesque of 'Right Now' and less of Diane Warren." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "one-star honorable mention", commenting that the group is [...] "sexier than your average prefab sexpots, but no fabber." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote that despite their superficiality and [...] "insipid lyrics" [...] acknowledged that [...] "lead singer Nicole Scherzinger and {{at least a couple of}} her fellow Dolls have supple voices." ...|$|E
5000|$|Michael Tait said, [...] "I {{was totally}} into {{rock and roll}} at the time ... I <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a rock record."

However, Osbourne has commented [...] "we loved… all kinds of experimental rock; but we always <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> pop music, experimental pop music."

Although Douglas' former coach, Walker, stated in 2012 that she was convinced Douglas could {{have made it to}} the Olympics if she had remained in Virginia Beach, Douglas said, [...] "Something clicked in my head that said, if I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this happen I need to get better coaching." [...] The impetus for Douglas's move to Iowa was when Walker had invited Chow to teach a clinic at her gym, Excalibur. Douglas was impressed when Chow was able to teach her how to perform the Amanar vault in a single afternoon. Douglas considered a move to Texas to train with a renowned coach there, but after that coach declined to train her out of loyalty to Walker, Douglas selected Chow. Chow was initially skeptical, since Douglas had been just one of hundreds of kids at the clinic in Virginia Beach. However, Chow subsequently informed Douglas's Excalibur coaches that he had agreed to train her, but pointed out that he did not recruit her, saying, [...] "I would never recruit anybody to my program." [...] Later on, Gabby suffered from a hamstring strain and a hip flexor injury in July. She couldn't do much during this time, but this allowed her to improve her bar skills.|$|E

[...] He had that timidity of the elder {{in the presence of the}} younger man which the younger, preoccupied with his own timidity in the presence of the elder, cannot imagine. Besides, March was aware of the gulf that divided him as a literary man from Beaton as an artist, and he only ventured to feel his way toward sympathy with him.
