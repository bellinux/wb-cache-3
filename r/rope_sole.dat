5000|$|Espadrilles or espardenyes are casual, flat, but {{sometimes}} high-heeled shoes. They {{usually have a}} canvas or cotton fabric upper and a flexible sole made of esparto rope. The esparto <b>rope</b> <b>sole</b> is the defining characteristic of an espadrille; the uppers vary widely in style.|$|E
5000|$|Espadrilles {{have been}} made in Occitania region (France), in the Pyrennean regions of Basque country (France - Spain) and Catalonia (Spain), since the 14th century at least, and there are shops in the Basque country (France - Spain) still in {{existence}} that have been making espadrilles for over a century. The oldest, most primitive form of espadrilles dates as far back as 4000 years ago [...] Traditional espadrilles have a canvas upper with the toe and vamp cut in one piece and seamed to the <b>rope</b> <b>sole</b> at the sides. Often they have laces at the throat that are wrapped around the ankle to hold the shoes securely in place. Traditional espadrilles are worn by both men and women.|$|E
40|$|Beach {{shoes of}} tan rope and red, white, and blue knitted cotton(?). Designed as thick-soled espadrilles with coiled <b>rope</b> <b>soles</b> and rounded toes, the toe-box and heel section are of knitted cotton(?) in red, white, and blue {{patterns}} of squares and zig-zags on bands of color. From instep to sides of heel are tied red silk(?) cords...|$|R
50|$|During Ultimate X-06, Chris Sabin and Petey Williams {{detached}} {{the belt}} {{at the same}} time when A.J. Styles jumped from the top rope to snatch the belt from them while they were still hanging from the <b>ropes,</b> taking <b>sole</b> possession and landing on the mat, winning the title.|$|R
5000|$|It’s {{not easy}} for the reader to suspend disbelief. Harold Fry leaves without his mobile phone or any {{suitable}} clothing or equipment (his ‘yachting shoes’ are not canvas, nor do they have <b>rope</b> <b>soles,</b> but appear {{to be made of}} leather, which very soon chafes painfully. The book’s front matter shows a pair of laced moccasins). If he wants to see Queenie before she dies, why not choose a faster means of transport? If he wants a meditative hike, he might walk instead on the return journey. In Exeter after about a week on the road he dawdles, [...] "lost a full day, simply wandering" [...] (82). Common sense reasoning finally breaks through much later, when he is in Bath and during a chance encounter with a celebrity actor, who is there for a book-signing. [...] "If I were you, I’d get myself in a car.... Bollocks to the walk". It’s a novel with a highly eccentric protagonist, who is just possibly a holy fool.|$|R
50|$|Blake Mycoskie visited Argentina in 2002 while {{competing}} in the second season of The Amazing Race with his sister. He returned on vacation in January 2006, and noticed that the local polo players were wearing alpargatas, a simple canvas slip-on shoe {{that he began to}} wear himself and which are the model for the original line of Toms Shoes. They are made from canvas or cotton fabric with <b>rope</b> <b>soles,</b> but Toms makes theirs with rubber soles. Mycoskie said that when he was doing volunteer work in the outskirts of Buenos Aires, he noticed that many of the children were running through the streets with no shoes on. He decided to develop a type of alpargata for the North American market, with the goal to provide a new pair of shoes free of charge to youth of Argentina and other developing nations for every pair sold. According to Mycoskie, Bill Gates encouraged him by saying that the lack of shoes was a major contributor to diseases in children.|$|R
25|$|Bearded seal Erignathus {{barbatus}} (maklak sg makliik dual makliit pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, maklag in Cup'ig) is {{the best-known}} {{species of the}} seals living in the all Eskimo (Yupik and Inuit) regions. For Yup'ik hunters, bearded seals were the seal of choice. Bearded seals were widely considered the best seal for meat. The blubber was rendered into oil and the hide used {{for a variety of}} items, including boot <b>soles,</b> <b>rope,</b> mats, and rifle cases.|$|R
5000|$|The {{punishment}} required {{placing a}} wooden peg (for the sort used for tents {{or for a}} line for cavalry horses — [...] "picket" [...] etc. were originally alternative names for such pegs) in {{the ground with the}} exposed end facing upward. The malefactor was typically a private soldier who had disobeyed orders. One wrist was suspended from a tree by a <b>rope,</b> while the <b>sole</b> or heel of the opposite bare foot was balanced atop the peg, a piece of wood about four inches long by two inches wide and rounded at the top to about half an inch to meet the legal requirements. The top of the peg was narrow enough to cause considerable discomfort, but not sharp enough to draw blood. To relieve pressure upon a foot, the prisoner relegated all his weight to the wrist, which could only be relieved by shifting weight back onto the other foot.|$|R
