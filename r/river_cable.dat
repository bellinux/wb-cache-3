5|$|The first ferries {{crossing}} the Dordogne were flat-bottomed boats driven by oars or keelboats {{driven by a}} sail. The passage was very risky and accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide <b>river.</b> The <b>cable</b> lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by a}} two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large paddle wheel. In good weather, the crossing time was improved to 30–45minutes, but in bad weather the trip remained uncertain.|$|R
50|$|Technically, {{the ferry}} is a {{reaction}} ferry, which is propelled {{by the current}} of the water.

The laying of the Pacific Cable was a major engineering feat for the time, costing about two million pounds.|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} {{is made of}} four 61 metre towers which are the pillars and stand on the river banks. The towers are braced by iron cables to the crossbeam and are parallel to the <b>river</b> and by <b>cables</b> following {{the line of the}} bridge into the hill behind (on the Portugalete side) and the ground (on the Las Arenas side). The upper crossbeam which lies horizontally, rests between two towers by 70 suspension cables. They also help support a great amount of weight and are supported in the corbels which helps balance the weight. The gondola transports vehicles and they hang from a 36 wheeled caty and is 25m. long. It moves along the rails through the horizontal crossbeam.|$|R
50|$|The ferry is {{literally}} driven, or {{one could say}} guided, by a steel cable that stretches across the <b>river.</b> The <b>cable</b> is secured {{on each side of}} the river by steel posts. As the ferry crosses the river, the force of the boat, with the help of rollers on the side of the boat, pulls the normally submerged cable out of the water. The cable is permanently secured to the ferry and prevents the boat from straying off course in normal river currents. The ferry carries a maximum of two cars and does not operate in high water conditions or storms, as there is too much risk of the cable snapping in such treacherous conditions. Persons wanting to ride the ferry that happen to be on the opposite side of the river than the ferry must blow their vehicle horn to summon the ferry. The trip by ferry across the river takes roughly 5 minutes and saves a drive of about 20 miles. The ferry is free of charge. The ferry operates almost every day except for days of high water and bad weather.|$|R
