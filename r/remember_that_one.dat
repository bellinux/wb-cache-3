[...] When his friend said [...] "yes," [...] he remarked, [...] "Why then did you make him turn back? [...] We have lost more than ten lines through your interruption." [...] So jealous was he of every moment lost.|$|E
2500|$|They have a {{different}} face for different occasions. In conversations with each other, they often undergo a subtle change. I have seen men {{who appeared to be}} normal suddenly smile roguishly, soften their voices, and simper as they greeted homosexual friends... Many times I saw these changes occur after I had gained a homosexual's confidence and he could safely risk my disapproval. Once as I watched a luncheon companion become an effeminate caricature of himself, he apologised, [...] "It is hard to always <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> is a man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carl Gustav Jung, like Flournoy {{based in}} Switzerland, also {{emulated}} {{him in his}} thesis based on a study of cryptomnesia in psychism. Later Jung would emphasise {{the importance of the}} persistence of memory and ego in psychological study of reincarnation: [...] "This concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personality... (that) one is able, at least potentially, to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> has lived through previous existences, and that these existences were one's own...." [...] Hypnosis, used in psychoanalysis for retrieving [...] forgotten memories, was eventually tried as a means of studying the phenomenon of past life recall.|$|E

2500|$|Early in the 2000 season, Maddux {{was asked}} by sportswriter Bob Nightengale {{what had been the}} most memorable at-bat of his {{pitching}} career. Maddux said it was striking out Dave Martinez to end a regular season game. Nightengale was surprised Maddux hadn't picked a postseason game, or a more famous player. Maddux explained: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> because he got a hit off me in the same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven years earlier. I told myself if I ever got in the same situation again, I'll pitch him differently. It took me seven years, but I got him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the Stonewall riots, {{inconsistent}} {{gender role}} performance had been noticed among gay men: [...] "They {{have a different}} face for different occasions.

2500|$|Until 1944, {{there were}} only 23 Halifax bombers {{committed}} to supplying Resistance groups for all of Europe, and many in the SOE preferred that resistance groups in Yugoslavia, Italy and Greece be armed rather than in France. On 16 April 1943, the SOE agent Odette Sansom was arrested together with her fellow SOE agent and lover Peter Churchill by the Abwehr Captain Hugo Bleicher. After her arrest, Sansom was tortured for several months, which she recounted in the 1949 book Odette: The Story of a British Agent, and most notably she was not [...] "broken", refusing to talk. Sansom later recalled about her captivity in the Fresnes prison in Paris:"In those places the only thing one could try to keep was a certain dignity. There was nothing else. And one could have a little dignity and try to prove that one had a little spirit and, I suppose, that kept one going. When everything else was too difficult, too bad, then one was inspired by so many things-people; perhaps a phrase one would <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> had heard a long time before, or even a piece of poetry {{or a piece of}} music." [...] On 26 May 1943, Moulin chaired in Paris a secret meeting attended by representatives of all the main resistance groups to form the CNR (Conseil National de la RÃ©sistence-National Council of the Resistance). With the National Council of the Resistance, resistance activities started to become more co-ordinated across France. In June 1943, a sabotage campaign was started against the French rail system. Between June 1943-May 1944, the Resistance damaged 1, 822 trains, destroyed 200 passenger cars, damaged about 1, 500 passenger cars, destroyed about 2, 500 freight cars and damaged about 8,000 freight cars.|$|E

60|$|Mabel now <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of the {{soldiers}} was this woman's husband, and she trembled at {{what might be the}} immediate effect of her sorrow, should his death become suddenly known to her.

60|$|On {{the seventeenth}} {{we set out}} with the {{determination}} of examining more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in the first search.

25|$|Older {{cases had}} held {{that if a}} {{contract}} had already been performed, or a misrepresentation had become a term of the contract, this would preclude rescission. This inflexible position was amended by the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 1, which simply says such bars no longer exist. However, it must still be <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> cannot ask both for rescission and for recovery of expectation damages for breach of contract.|$|R
60|$|It is {{illustrative of}} {{the customs of}} this people that, when the Dulbahantas had their hands engaged, and left their rear unprotected, under the {{impression}} that no enemies were behind, the Warsingali instantly <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of their number had been murdered by the other race many years ago.

After outfitting her with electrodes and injecting her with more drugs, Walter starts the process by clanging a bell; to everyone's surprise, this causes Olivia to pass out.|$|R
