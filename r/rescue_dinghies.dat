During World War II {{he worked at}} the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE); here he studied composite materials, wooden aircraft, plastics and new materials of many types. He designed the <b>rescue</b> <b>dinghies</b> for most bomber aircraft used in the war, and studied the strength and behaviour of reinforcement fibres made of glass, carbon, boron and other materials.|$|E

50|$|During a tense {{battle in}} and around an {{abandoned}} underground train, Michelle is found suspended over the water as bait, but Stone is able to pull the monster's heart from its chest and kill it. However, as the policemen leave the scene with Michelle in a <b>rescue</b> <b>dinghy,</b> bubbles of air are seen breaking {{the surface of the}} water, suggesting that there may be more than one monster.|$|R
50|$|On the 2 October 1944 six Beaufighters of Coastal Command {{took off}} from Langham {{to carry out a}} night patrol along the Frisian Islands of the coast of the Netherlands. Their task was to {{randomly}} attack any enemy shipping encountered there. One of the aircraft (NT 909) was piloted by New Zealander Warrant Officer Douglas Mann. His navigator was English and he was Flight Sergeant Donald Kennedy. Close to the island of Borkum the plane went into an attack on a convoy, but in poor visibility the plane struck an unknown obstacle causing Mann to lose control. The Convoy’s flak ships opened fire on the stricken plane shooting it down and, after some difficulty, Mann and Kennedy took to their <b>rescue</b> <b>dinghy.</b> After several abortive rescue attempts the airmen were finally rescued by High Speed Launch 2679, stationed at Gorleston-on-Sea, on the 10 October after being in the sea for eight days. When the Skipper of the Launch, Flying Officer David Ross located them and pulled them aboard the men were both suffering from acute hypothermia and immersion foot. They were taken to Great Yarmouth naval Hospital were both men made a full recovery. Douglas Mann was eventually returned to 489 Squadron and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|R
5000|$|... "Conclusionsa) Liberator AL 523, total all up weight 54,608 lbs, {{took off}} from Gibraltar at 23.07 hours on the 4th July 1943 bound for U.K. The weather was fine, wind light, no cloud, {{visibility}} 10 miles.The aircraft was airborne after a run of approximately 1100 yards, climbed to about 150 feet in a perfectly normal manner and then gradually lost height, striking the sea {{on an even keel}} approximately 1200 yards after leaving the ground.The evidence suggests that the pilot had throttled back a moment before impact and that his engines had been running normally up to that time.The pilot was recovered by the Station <b>rescue</b> <b>dinghy</b> within six minutes of the crashand was the sole survivor.b) The cause of the accident was, in the opinion of the Court, due to the aircraft becoming uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established. The pilot, having eased the control column forward to build up speed after take-off, found that he was unable to move it back at all, the elevator controls being virtually jammed somewhere in the system. It is impossible, from the evidence available and examination of the wreckage, to offer any concrete reason as to why the elevator system should have become jammed.""... The findings of the Court and the observations of the officers whose duty it is to review and comment on those findings have been considered and it is apparent that the accident was due to the jamming of the elevator controls shortly after take-off with the result that the aircraft became uncontrollable.After most careful examination of all the available evidence, including that of the pilot, it has not been possible to determine how the jamming occurred but it has been established that there was no sabotage.It is also clear that the captain of the aircraft who is a pilot of great experience and exceptional ability was in no way to blame.An officer of the Polish Air Force attended throughout the proceedings." ...|$|R
5000|$|Four regular squadrons {{equipped}} with Lysanders accompanied the British Expeditionary Force to France in October 1939, and {{were joined by}} a further squadron early in 1940. Following the German invasion of France and the low countries on 10 May 1940, Lysanders were put into action as spotters and light bombers. In spite of occasional victories against German aircraft, they made very easy targets for the Luftwaffe even when escorted by Hurricanes. Withdrawn from France during the Dunkirk evacuation, they continued to fly supply-dropping missions to Allied forces from bases in England; on one mission to drop supplies to troops trapped at Calais, 14 of 16 Lysanders and Hawker Hectors that set out were lost. 118 Lysanders were lost in or over France and Belgium in May and June 1940, {{of a total of}} 175 deployed. With the fall of France, {{it was clear that the}} type was unsuitable for the coastal patrol and army co-operation role, being described by Air Marshal Arthur Barratt, commander-in-chief of the British Air Forces in France as [...] "quite unsuited to the task; a faster, less vulnerable aircraft was required." [...] Nevertheless, throughout the remainder of 1940, Lysanders flew dawn and dusk patrols off the coast and in the event of an invasion of Britain, they were tasked with attacking the landing beaches with light bombs and machine guns. They were replaced in the home-based army co-operation role from 1941 by camera-equipped fighters such as the Curtiss Tomahawk and North American Mustang carrying out reconnaissance operations, while light aircraft such as the Taylorcraft Auster were used to direct artillery. [...] Some UK-based Lysanders went to work operating air-sea <b>rescue,</b> dropping <b>dinghies</b> to downed RAF aircrew in the English Channel. Fourteen squadrons and flights were formed for this role in 1940 and 1941.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 May 1942, Checketts {{was shot}} down and bailed out over the channel and was <b>rescued</b> from his <b>dinghy</b> by the Royal Navy. In June 1942 he was posted to [...] "Sailor" [...] Malan's gunnery school before {{continuing}} to No. 611 Squadron based at Biggin Hill in January 1943. Checketts was promoted to flight lieutenant and given command of A Flight in April. On 30 May 1943 he shot down a Fw 190 5 to 8 mi south-east of Trouville, Seine-Maritime. [...] In July, Checketts was promoted to squadron leader and returned to No. 485 Squadron at Biggin Hill as commander. On 15 July he shot down a Fw 190, on the 27th he destroyed two more, and on the 31st a Bf 109G. Guiding the unit over Saint-Pol on 9 August 1943, Checketts led a section against eight Bf 109s and destroyed three of them. The other three New Zealand pilots in the section each destroyed one and Checketts damaged {{one of the two}} remaining 109s as it escaped. For this action he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. [...] While acting as high cover for bombers attacking an airfield near Amiens on 19 August the squadron was jumped by a force of Fw 190s and Bf 109s. In a running battle Checketts probably destroyed an Fw 190 and damaged another.|$|R
