5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Plymouth, Lord Clyde was paid off {{and a new}} engine was built for her at Devonport Dockyard. In addition, her {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced by a}} lighter, two-bladed propeller with less drag and the ship was rearmed. She remained in reserve until 1871 when she recommissioned under the command of Captain John Bythesea, an officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War of 1854–55. Lord Clyde rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet; six months after her arrival, she ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British steamship that had gone aground off the island of Pantellaria. Attempts to lighten the ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and wrenched off her sternpost, <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> and rudder. Lord Warden was able to pull her off and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would take six months. Bythesea and his navigator were convicted during their court-martial and neither ever served at sea again.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b> Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
25|$|The {{empennage}} of the Hydro-triplane {{was supported}} {{on a pair}} of lattice girders, parallel in plan and each constructed from a horizontal member fixed to the upper wing {{at the top of the}} innermost interplane struts and a member below it which sloped upward from the lower wing to meet the upper one at the tail. Three sloping cross braces completed each girder. The rectangular tailplane, fitted with elevators, was placed over the ends of the girders, its leading edge braced by a central, vertical strut to the hull which also supported the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> out beyond the hull on upper and lower sloping struts. The trapezoidal rudder extended a little above the horizontal tail, which had a deep V-shaped cut-out to accommodate its movement.|$|E
2500|$|The wreck site lies at a {{depth of}} [...] to [...] of water {{approximately}} [...] off North Head. The wreck site is on sand away from any reef structure and completely intact but significantly buried under the sand to a level approximately the same as what would have been the deck level. It is a small site with just the two boilers (about 800 – 1000mm dia by 2.5m long approx) a broken engine and paddle wheel shaft (shifted by about 1 meter to the starboard) visible above the sand line. The sharp cutting shape of the bow and stern can just be made out with the twin (bow and stern) <b>rudder</b> <b>posts</b> just above the sand level.|$|R
5000|$|All Bristols {{included}} an interior overhead fiberglass headliner that hid rough, irregular fiberglass {{on the inside}} of the cabin. The cabinetry was fiberglassed to the hull, rather than using an interior liner with molded cabinetry, which significantly added to the structural integrity of the hull. The cabinetry was built from 3/4" [...] mahogany plywood, attached with bronze wood screws and glued. The hulls of early Bristols were all solid, hand-laid fiberglass. The decks and cabin tops were cored with end-grain balsa. The cored structure extended to the cockpit seat tops and the cockpit sole. <b>Rudder</b> <b>posts</b> and propeller shafts were solid bronze. Bronze Wilcox Crittenden tapered-plug seacocks were used on all underwater thru-hulls. A distinguishing feature of virtually all Bristol models included at least two moulded dorade boxes on the cabin top abaft the mast step that allowed ventilation in rough seas or rainy weather.|$|R
25|$|By 1905, the Roanoke {{was serving}} ports in California and Oregon. On November 27, 1905, the ship lost its <b>rudder</b> and stern <b>post</b> while {{crossing}} the harbor bar at Eureka, California in heavy seas during an ebb tide.|$|R
25|$|During the {{development}} of the design, a six-inch stretch was made by moving the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> aft. Many versions had a fixed landing gear, but later versions could have retractable gear, mounted in a widened wing center section (which could have either integral fuel tanks or not). Most had a straight trailing edge on the outer wing while again, some had the wing trailing edge swept forward slightly in an attempt to fix a problem with stalls and spins. Several different rudders were used, with early examples having a round outline, intermediate examples having a square bottom on the rudder (Harvard I) and late examples using the triangular rudder of the AT-6 series, due to a loss of control at high angles of attack with the early types. Horizontal and vertical tails were initially covered in corrugated aluminum, but later examples were smooth-skinned, and the horizontal stabilizer was increased in chord near its tips on later versions.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Rudder</b> <b>post</b> and mast {{placement}} {{defines the}} difference between a ketch and a yawl, as these two-masted vessels are similar.

2500|$|Wheel {{steering}} {{is standard}} (though a tiller was an option on the 37R). The [...] rudder is an internally-mounted spade-type with a [...] "spitfire wing" [...] planform. The rudder is constructed of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the rudder. The <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> passes through the hull with a water-tight, close tolerance fit between the shaft and the nylon bearing. The <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> is brought up through the cockpit sole, with the steering quadrant mounted on top. The pedestal system is cable-linked with the radial driver being connected to the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> by a keyway and lock nuts. Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole. This design provides excellent support for the rudder stock. The rudder may be removed by loosening the bolt, rollers and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure.|$|E
50|$|The two mahogany-planked floats were short, {{so that at}} {{rest the}} Fremantle sat on the water like a tailwheel-type landplane with the {{assistance}} of a tail float fixed to the fuselage underside. The tailplane was mounted {{at the top of the}} fuselage with bracing underneath and the <b>rudder</b> hinge <b>post</b> carried a water-rudder for directional control at low speeds on the surface. Since the main floats were not widely spaced, there were two more floats attached to the underside of the lower wing immediately below the outer pairs of interplane struts to provide lateral stability. Fuel was stored in tanks in the floats but there was another large and very conspicuous tank mounted centrally above the upper wing. This gravity-fed the engine and was replenished by pumping (hand- or wind-powered) fuel from the float tanks.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 May 1862, off Fort Pillow, General Price under First Officer J. E. Henthorne (or Harthorne), {{in company}} with seven other vessels under Captain Montgomery {{attacked}} the ironclad gunboats of the Union Mississippi River Squadron. In {{the action of}} Plum Point Bend, which followed, the Confederate ram CSS General Bragg struck [...] halting her retreat. This allowed General Price to violently ram the Federal gunboat, taking away her <b>rudder,</b> stern <b>post,</b> and {{a large piece of}} her stern, decisively disabling her. At the same time General Prices well directed fire silenced Federal Mortar boat No. 16, which was being guarded by Cincinnati. General Price was heavily hit in this action. Her upper works were severely damaged, and she was struck by a 128-pound shell which cut off her supply pipes and caused a dangerous leak.|$|R
40|$|Pointe du Hoc {{overlooking}} the English Channel in Normandy, France was host {{to one of}} the most important military engagements of World War II. While the site is a valuable historic cultural resource, it is vulnerable to cliff collapses that already have endangered the observation <b>post</b> and <b>Rudder?s</b> command <b>post.</b> The observation post has been closed to visitors for some time due to safety concerns. Geophysical techniques have been used increasingly in recent years for slope stability investigation purposes. The objective of this study is to apply advanced 3 ?D resistivity tomography toward a detailed site stability assessment with special attention to the two at-risk buildings. 3 ?D resistivity tomography datasets at Pointe du Hoc in the presence of extreme topography and dense cultural clutter have been successfully acquired, inverted, and interpreted. The cliff stability in the areas around the two at?risk buildings has been analyzed. A hazard assessment scheme has been designed in which regions of high resistivity are interpreted as zones of open, dry fractures with a moderate mass movement potential. Regions of low resistivity are zones of wet, clay?filled fractures with a high mass movement potential. The observation post tomography results indicate that the highest mass movement hazard appears to be associated with the marine caverns at the base of the cliff that are positioned at the point of strongest wave attack. These caverns likely occupy the future site of development of a sea arch which will definitely threaten the observation post building. A high probability of a soil wedge failure is on the east?facing cliff edge close to the observation post that could damage or destroy the building. The mass movement potential at the <b>Rudder?s</b> command <b>post</b> area is low to moderate. The greatest risk is associated with soil wedge failures at the top of the cliffs. The resistivity geophysical data add great value to the natural geohazard assessment at Pointe du Hoc and constitute an integral component of an interdisciplinary approach to the problem of cultural resource preservation at the site. Geophysics is a non?invasive and relatively inexpensive technology that provides unique constraints which are unobtainable using traditional engineering geology methods for site characterization. However, the technology is difficult to master and the inherent limitations must be carefully understood to ensure a reliable geotechnical interpretation...|$|R
2500|$|Ketches {{are similar}} to a sloop, {{but there is a}} second shorter mast astern of the mainmast, but forward of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b> The second mast is called the mizzen mast and the sail is called the mizzen sail. A ketch can also be [...] with two head sails.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 10 August 1916, {{and demonstrated}} good performance and manoeuvrability, being easy to fly. It was wrecked during a crash landing during a test flight at Cranwell on 20 September 1916 after the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> failed. [...] No further development was carried out, as by this time, effective synchronising gear {{was available to}} the British, and the Sopwith 1½ Strutter was already in service.|$|E
2500|$|Boat rudders may {{be either}} {{outboard}} or inboard. Outboard rudders are {{hung on the}} stern or transom. Inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully submerged beneath the hull, connected to the steering mechanism by a <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> which comes up through the hull to deck level, often into a cockpit. [...] Inboard keel hung rudders (which are {{a continuation of the}} aft trailing edge of the full keel) are traditionally deemed the most damage resistant rudders for off shore sailing. [...] Better performance with faster handling characteristics can be provided by skeg hung rudders on boats with smaller fin keels.|$|E
5000|$|HAMBLE hydrobiplane HL.l (Hamble River, Luke & Co., Hamble, Hampshire)Constructed by an {{established}} boat building company, {{to the design}} of Frank Murphy, late of Bristol, the machine was shown incomplete at Olympia in March 1914. Changes were made later and the machine was tested by Gordon England, but costs were excessive, and the machine and the premises were put up for sale by July 1914.The aircraft was a large two-seater pusher seaplane with twin wooden main floats and twin metal tail floats, moving with the rudders. There were four pairs of interplane struts each side, with radiators mounted on the innermost pairs. Ailerons were fitted to both top and bottom wings, the latter having pronounced dihedral.The spruce tail booms, to be replaced by steel tubes later, extended aft from the second interplane struts. The tailplane and elevator were carried on the top booms, the pair of <b>rudders</b> pivoting on <b>posts</b> below.

500|$|... d. [...] Lucas {{described}} {{the scene on}} Redoutable: In less {{than half an hour}} our ship had been so fearfully mauled that she looked like little more than a heap of debris. Judging by appearances, no doubt, the Temeraire, now hailed us to surrender and not prolong a useless resistance. My reply was instantly to order some soldiers who were near me to fire back; which they did with great alacrity. At the same moment almost, the main mast of the Redoutable fell on board the English ship. The two topmasts of the Temeraire then came down, falling on board of us. Our whole poop was stove in, helm <b>rudder</b> and stern <b>post</b> all shattered to splinters, all the stern frame, and the decks shot through. All our own guns were either smashed or dismounted by the broadsides of the Victory and the Temeraire...The hull itself was riddled, shot through from side to side; deck beams were shattered, port lids torn away or knocked to pieces. Four of our six pumps were so damaged as to be useless. The quarter-deck ladders were broken, which rendered communication {{with the rest of the}} ship very difficult. Everywhere the decks were strewn with dead men, lying beneath the debris. Out of a crew of 634 men we had 522 hors de combat; of whom 300 were killed and 222 wounded nearly all the officers among them... The batteries and upper decks were practically abandoned – bare of men and were unable longer to offer any resistance. No one who had not seen the state of Redoutable could ever form an idea of her awful condition. Really I know of nothing on board that had not been hit by shot.|$|R
2500|$|The Type E was {{powered by}} a 50hp (37kW) Gnome rotary engine. [...] These engines were well {{regarded}} but produced a lot of hot oil, so a half cowling was installed to shield the pilot. [...] The mainwheels were mounted {{at the ends of}} a pair of sprung telescopic legs and joined by a centrally hinged axle with a further pair of fixed struts forming an inverted W arrangement. [...] This structure was stiffened and the aircraft protected against nose-over by a long central skid which curved upwards well forward of the propeller, mounted to the fuselage by a fore and aft pair of inverted-V struts and also joined to the axle hinge. [...] There was a long tailskid which met the ground {{at the bottom of the}} <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{wings of}} the Hippie are high set with {{noticeable}} positive dihedral. They are unswept, with constant chord and have small end-plate fairings at the tips. [...] They are built from glass and carbon reinforced plastics, with plastic skins and braced to the lower fuselage with a single strut on each side. [...] Glass and carbon reinforced plastics are used throughout the Hippie: the forward fuselage is a glass-fibre ring, mounted under the wing, which incorporates a windscreen, the pilot's seat and a small keel underneath which acts as the main undercarriage. Aft, there is an open, tapering Warren girder which carries the fabric-covered tail unit. [...] The {{leading edge of the}} fin is formed from an extended diagonal fuselage member, with a vertical piece behind to support the rudder. The Hippie has a T-tail with a wire braced tailplane on top of the fin. [...] There is a small loop tailskid {{at the bottom of the}} <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Sport was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{staggered}} wings of equal span and rectangular plan. [...] There were outboard ailerons on the upper planes only. [...] The interplane struts were of N-shape and the centre section was supported by two pairs of vertical struts from the fuselage. [...] The fuselage was a rectangular structure with four longerons interconnected by vertical and diagonal braces skinned in 3-ply wood. An open cockpit began just aft of the first pair of centre section struts, with two low seats in tandem, spaced so closely together that the passenger's feet surrounded the pilot. [...] At the rear, the tailplane {{was attached to the}} top of the fuselage and wire braced to the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b> [...] This latter carried a tall rudder with a curved top which extended to the bottom of the fuselage, moving in a gap between the elevators; there was no fixed fin. [...] It had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with its main wheels on a single axle mounted on V struts to the lower longerons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around four ash longerons, equally spaced {{at the front}} but tapering to a vertical edge at the tail. [...] Underneath the fuselage was a deep central keel, so the lower fuselage cross-section was triangular; on top there was a rounded decking. [...] The tailplane was of steeply swept delta plan {{like that of the}} Type D, but carried twin elevators of roughly half-heart shape. [...] In contrast to the Type D, the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> was firmly fixed to the fuselage and did not move with the elevators; the rudder was similar in shape to the elevators, moving between them and behind a long rectangular fin. [...] The pilot's open cockpit was a little behind {{the leading edge of the}} wing, just aft of the spar and bigger than the passenger's, placed behind the rear spar near the trailing edge. [...] The pilot warped the wings by turning a wheel mounted on a lever which could also be moved fore and aft, operating the elevators. [...] There was a [...] "foot tiller" [...] for rudder control.|$|E
2500|$|The nacelle was, most unusually for the time, an {{all-metal}} structure – being {{framed in}} steel tube {{and covered with}} duralumin. The prototypes were fitted with large streamlined spinners on the propellers, although these were removed, and the production F.E.8s were built without them. The wings had a narrow chord, giving them a high aspect ratio. They featured dihedral outboard of the wide centre section, and the ailerons were of unusually long span - occupying the entire wing trailing edge outboard of the tail booms. The booms themselves were attached to the main spar of the tailplane, rather than the <b>rudder</b> <b>post,</b> giving them taper in side elevation rather than in plan, as more usual in a [...] "Farman" [...] style pusher. This allowed the fitting of a variable incidence tailplane, although this was not adjustable in flight, but only on the ground. A single 100hp (75kW) Gnome 9 [...] "Type B2" [...] Monosoupape rotary engine driving a four-bladed propeller powered the aircraft, with the capability of taking the lower-powered Le Rhône 9C 80hp, nine-cylinder rotary.|$|E
2500|$|The visual unpopularity of Seppings' {{circular}} stern {{was soon}} rectified by Sir William Symonds. In this revised stern, {{a set of}} straight post timbers (also called [...] "whiskers", [...] "horn timbers", or [...] "fan tail timbers") stretches from the keel diagonally aft and upward. It rests {{on the top of}} the sternpost and runs on either side of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> (thus creating the [...] "helm port" [...] through which the rudder passes) to a point well above the vessel's waterline. Whereas the timbers of the transom stern all heeled on the wing transom, the timbers of the elliptical stern all heel on the whiskers, to which they are affixed at a 45̊ angle (i.e., [...] "canted") when viewed from overhead and decrease in length as they are installed aft until the curvature is complete. [...] The finished stern has a continuous curved edge around the outside and is raked aft. Other names for the elliptical stern include a [...] "counter stern," [...] in reference to its very long counter, and a [...] "cutaway stern." [...] The elliptical stern began use during the age of sail, but remained very popular for both merchant and warships well into the nautical age of steam and through the first eight decades of steamship construction (roughly 1840–1920), despite the fact that the design left the rudder exposed and vulnerable in combat situations.|$|E
2500|$|The Type D was {{the third}} and last of Handley Page's early single-seat monoplanes (the Type B being a biplane). [...] It was a close {{relative}} of the Type A, which crashed on its first turn, and the [...] Type C which did not fly at all. [...] Like them the Type D used the wing patented by José Weiss that promised, but failed to deliver, automatic lateral stability. [...] Its structure {{was based on a}} rigid inner section, built with four spars and standard ribs with a flexible outer section carried on ribs attached fanwise {{from the end of the}} spars in a bird-like fashion. The wing was braced by wires from a tall, narrow inverted V kingpost, lifting loads being carried by symmetrical bracing to a matching V post under the fuselage. [...] This latter structure also carried the two-wheel single axle undercarriage and a long central skid to prevent nosing over and to hold the tail clear of the ground. After the Type A crash, Handley Page had added wing warping for lateral control to the Type C. [...] The Type D also used this system, with a steering wheel pulling on wires to the mid-wing via the kingpost. [...] The horizontal tail was an approximately 60° delta with rounded tips; most of the surface moved to form the single-piece elevator and carried the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> and split (above and below the elevator) rudder, so that all the control surfaces moved together as a cruciform piece. The elevator was operated by pushing or pulling the lever-mounted steering wheel and the rudder by a [...] "foot tiller". There was no fixed fin.|$|E
60|$|The castaways {{continued}} {{to call out}} {{and in the meantime}} brought their rude raft close {{to the side of the}} steam yacht. As the vessel slipped past them slowly, they threw a bit of rope to the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> and made fast.|$|E

50|$|The CCA and the {{following}} rules used the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> definitions of ketch and yawl so they had a cut and dried definition for measuring sail so boats could be handicapped with boats fulfilling their new and arbitrary definition of Yawl and Ketch receiving slightly different handicaps.|$|E
50|$|Ketches {{are similar}} to a sloop, {{but there is a}} second shorter mast astern of the mainmast, but forward of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b> The second mast is called the mizzen mast and the sail is called the mizzen sail. A ketch can also be Cutter-rigged with two head sails.|$|E
50|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} was conventional {{with a pair}} of mainwheels on an axle {{mounted on}} pairs of V-struts, the forward, vertical members were fixed to the wings and the rearward drag struts to the wing roots. A tailskid shock absorber was attached to an extension of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E
50|$|Monongahela and Kineo were {{next in the}} column, and, also {{blinded by}} smoke, ran aground on the western shore. The impact {{separated}} the two ships.

5000|$|Rudder & Steering: The 5.5 ft rudder is an internally-mounted spade-type with a [...] "spitfire wing" [...] planform. The rudder is {{constructed}} of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the rudder.|$|E
50|$|Both the ketch and the yawl {{have two}} masts, {{with the main}} mast foremost; the {{distinction}} usually being that a ketch has the mizzen mast forward of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post,</b> whereas on a yawl, it is aft of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b> But the balance of sail area can be an overriding characteristic. If 20% {{or more of the}} sail area is in the mizzen sail the rig would be termed a ketch. This is particularly true on center cockpit yachts. Compared to a ketch, a similar size yawl's mizzen sail is much smaller than the main, because of the limitations of the mizzen sheet. So on a ketch, the dual purpose of the mizzen sail is to both propel and balance the vessel, while on a yawl, the smaller mizzen mainly serves the purpose of trim or balance. Yawls tend to have mainsails almost as large as those of comparable sloops.|$|E
50|$|On 3 January 1957, the {{ice pack}} had loosened; and enabled Northwind {{to lead the}} {{battered}} Arneb into port.
