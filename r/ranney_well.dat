50|$|A special type {{of water}} well may be {{constructed}} adjacent to freshwater lakes or streams. Commonly called a collector well but sometimes referred to by the trade name <b>Ranney</b> <b>well</b> or Ranney collector, this type of well involves sinking a caisson vertically below {{the top of the}} aquifer and then advancing lateral collectors out of the caisson and beneath the surface water body. Pumping from within the caisson induces infiltration of water from the surface water body into the aquifer, where it is collected by the collector well laterals and conveyed into the caisson where it can be pumped to the ground surface.|$|E

Ground water sampling campaigns were carried out during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods covering 21 bore-wells and 5 <b>Ranney</b> <b>wells.</b> Major 17 organochlorine pesticides (OCP's) along with other water quality parameters were monitored during this period. Pesticide concentrations were determined using GC- ECD, while GC-MS was used for confirmatory purposes. OCP's groups like &sum;HCH, &sum;DDT, endosulfan and aldrin were observed in this well-field. Concentration of OCPs from <b>Ranney</b> <b>wells</b> exceeded the limit (1 μg l− 1 ) prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in pre-monsoon season, though OCP levels in bore wells were within BIS limits. However, these levels were {{very close to the}} World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Union (EU) limit of for pesticides (0. 5 μg l− 1 ) in many samples. Bore well produced better quality water compared to the water from <b>Ranney</b> <b>wells.</b> Although, the level of OCP's was slightly lower than prescribed limit of national regulatory agency but such low doses may cause long-term damage to human populations if such water is consumed for longer durations. At low doses OCP's acts as endocrine disrupting agent and cause metabolic disorders in local population...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems, Environmental Resources Engineering, 2006 This study {{investigated}} optimal groundwater {{management in the}} Blue Lake Aquifer system of Humboldt County, California. A linked-simulation-optimization model was developed {{to aid in the}} creation of an optimal pumping schedule. The objective was to minimize the discounted operational cost of four <b>Ranney</b> <b>wells</b> over a 5 -year planning horizon. Several other past studies have also focused on optimal groundwater management in this aquifer. The goal of this project was to develop a more-accurate groundwater simulation model. New information on geomorphic features was incorporated into the model. This information was previously unavailable to past investigators. This study also utilized geographic information systems to compile and analyze the data, and properly-georeference it in the model. The {{study investigated}} four scenarios. Scenario 1 used constant water demands for the 5 -year period. This was the base case to which the other scenarios were compared. In Scenario 2, the demands were increased by 5...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Surface {{runoff from}} upland areas in {{northern}} Scotland can be excessively coloured and turbid, making water treatment costs high. In contrast, groundwater has little colour or suspended solids, {{and has a}} more stable water quality, therefore treatment eeds can be minimal. A number of public water supply schemes based {{on the development of}} groundwater in alluvial and glacial deposits are reviewed. These supplies range from major projects such as the 27 M 1 /d Spey and 10 Ml/d Fort William schemes to the 0. 16 M 1 /d supply for Dalwhinnie. It has been demonstrated that yields of up to 2 M 1 /d can be achieved from dug wells or boreholes even where the aquifer thickness i limited. Larger yields have been obtained from infiltration galleries and <b>Ranney</b> <b>wells.</b> Future challenges include improved siting techniques to locate thicker and more productive sediments and the avoidance of groundwater containing high iron and/or manganese concentrations. A review of all of the water sources of the North of Scotland Water Authority (NoSWA) was undertaken in 1998 (Mott MacDonald 1999 a) and a more detailed follow up study o...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} {{research}} studies conducted recently reported {{a decline in}} student engagement with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and subsequent choices to pursue STEM-related careers (Calabrese Barton et al. 2008; Bottiaa et al. 2015; American Institute of Physics 2014; Roberts 2002; Stagg et al. 2003). Many countries over the world face the task of recruiting more individuals into STEM industries (Hill et al. 2010). Students’ interests, attitudes, self-efficacy beliefs, and images of science and scientists interact (Dimopoulos and Smyrnaiou 2005; Schreiner and Sjøberg 2004) and consequently affect their achievement (Jones et al. 2000; Britner and Pajares 2006; Siegel and <b>Ranney</b> 2003) as <b>well</b> as their study and career choices and personal and social lives (Cleaves 2005; Britner 2008; Schibeci and Lee 2003).|$|R
40|$|<b>Ranney</b> radial {{collector}} <b>wells</b> {{consist of}} {{an array of}} horizontal lateral wells arranged radially around and connected {{to the base of}} a vertical well. They offer numerous advantages over traditional vertical wells with application in both the petroleum industry and hydrologic sciences. This study improved the understanding of the interaction of collector wells and the aquifers/reservoirs they tap by numerically modeling flux exchanges between a collector well and a river in an unconfined aquifer with regional background flow. Modeling demonstrated that flux along each horizontal lateral increased with distance from the vertical well stem following a third order polynomial function. Ultimately these models demonstrated that in the collector well/aquifer/river system, the pumping rate of the collector well was the dominant factor in controlling flux between the river and aquifer under various conditions. This study can be used to project the maximum allowable pumping rate without causing an initially gaining river to become a losing river...|$|R
