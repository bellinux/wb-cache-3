Consequent to the death of Chanda Shahib, the then Nawab of Arcot, British's installed Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah as Nawab of Arcot serving as vassal of the British.

50|$|On April 26, 1910, Arthur Hammerstein, {{with his}} father’s power of attorney, sold the Philadelphia Opera House to the New York Metropolitan Opera. The theater was then renamed the Metropolitan Opera House. The Met, which had {{annually}} toured to Philadelphia with performances at the Academy of Music, {{had been the}} POC's biggest competition for opera audiences. In spite of two sold-out seasons of grand opera for the POC, Hammerstein <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> and had <b>to</b> sell his highly popular opera house to his competitor. The Met's first production at the re-titled house was on December 13, 1910. They performed regularly at the MOH for the next decade, giving well over a hundred performances at the house.

50|$|John Frederick was a well-meaning, peace-loving ruler but he {{displayed}} {{a number of}} personal weaknesses and was often ill-equipped {{to deal with the}} challenges of the era. Despite this he restored the constitution (which had been suspended by his father, Frederick I, subject to changes that were never implemented). He also restored the power of the councils of Duke Louis (which had been abolished by Frederick I). Most importantly, he had Frederick’s powerful chancellor Matthäus Enzlin condemned to a fortress for life for embezzlement and extortion, subjecting him later to trial on a count of high treason for which he was executed on the market place in Urach in 1613. He achieved little improvement in the state of affairs within the ducal household, however. In fact the duchy <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> further <b>debt</b> leading <b>to</b> unruly debate within the family and even the ranks of servants and eventually problems with the mint.|$|R
60|$|He {{demanded of}} himself whether {{it were a}} fatal sign that he regretted the loss of Isabel, {{when she went to}} spend a few days with her old governess. Miss Longman had left the Conway family in order {{to take care of the}} motherless {{children}} of a good-for-nothing brother, who had <b>run</b> too deeply <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> be able to return to England. He was now dead, but she was teaching English, and obtaining advantages of education for her nieces, which detained her at Paris; and as she had a bed to offer her former pupil, Isabel set her heart on spending her last three days in the unrestrained intercourse afforded by a visit to her. Louis found that though their party had lost the most agreeable member, yet it was not the loss of the sun; and that he was quite as ready to tease his aunt and make Virginia laugh, as if Isabel had been looking on with a smile of wonder and commiseration for their nonsense.|$|R
50|$|In 1567 Mateos {{suddenly}} {{changed his}} way of life by converting his large house in the Upper Town, {{on the slopes of}} The Rock, into a 20-bed , and putting all his fortune towards running the hospital. It was the result of seeing the difficult situation of the poor sick people in the town, and also of the miserable sight of the many ill sailors that arrived in Gibraltar after returning from the New World (many of whom suffered from a virulent form of syphilis, a disease that had had its European outbreak just a century before with ineffective treatment). Mateos' spent almost nothing on himself wearing only sackcloth and eating frugally. He just retained a small room in his former house for himself. For twenty four years, Mateos devoted his time and personal services in support of the charitable institution he had founded. When his fortune was over and he <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt,</b> he began <b>to</b> beg asking for alms to keep the hospital running. He became well known in the surrounding countryside, with patients coming to him from far and wide. Mateos eventually earned himself a saintly reputation.|$|R
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} {{undertaken}} in the article to evaluate the communes’ income and to establish relation that exist between chosen elements of communal budgets {{and the level of}} communal investments. Against the background of information on the level and structure of the income of local self-governmental budgets in the scale of the whole country - the article presents the results of research work made upon the communes that presently do form the new voivodship of Great Poland. This analysis relates to the period 1991 - 1998. Statistical methods proper to structural analysis and to interdependence of such phenomena have been applied in research work. Clear duality is self-evident when examining the communes in question and evaluating them {{from the point of view}} of their budgets’ income. On one hand we have to do with quite big group of distinctly poor communes, and on the other - there is relatively small group of communes of an income level that is considerably superior to the average. The second group is mainly consisted with the communes situated in the vicinity of the town of Poznań and some communes in former voivodship of Konin. Richer communes do indeed confine more money for their communal investments (per capita) however they are not leading as far as a share of investments expenses in their budget incomes is concerned. A part of the communes researched <b>runs</b> quickly <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> for <b>to</b> acquire investment means. It is however done by communes of moderate means, semi-municipal and semi-rural in their character. The richest communes must not have recourse to such an indebtedness, and the poorest ones clearly fear the threat of insolvency. The development of particular equipment in the sphere of communal infrastructure proves to have however only a quite general relation with the wealth of a commune. The rhythm of developing chosen kinds of communal equipment in the communes of similar income scale differs often considerably. The text of the article is completed with numerous graphs and diagrams which make evident the differentiation scale of the phenomenons and processes occurring within the analyzed voivodship...|$|R
