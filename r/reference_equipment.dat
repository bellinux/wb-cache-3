BACKGROUND. Body weight (BW) {{is widely}} used to evaluate and manage clinical situations therefore assessment errors can influence the ichosen therapies. OBJECTIVE. To assess the variability in values of BW obtained by using different equipment (weight scales). METHODS. A cross sectional study was performed to assess BW of 360 adult patients in eight units including clinical and surgical specialties Three types of scales were used: a portable domestic model and a fixed platform model, both from the units and a portable digital model previously calibrated and used as standard <b>reference</b> <b>equipment.</b> Self-reported weight (SRW) was also compared to weight assessed with the <b>reference</b> <b>equipment.</b> The values were compared trough paired-samples t-test using SPSS software. RESULTS. The difference between weights assessed by the <b>reference</b> <b>equipment</b> and SRW was 445 } 3. 359 g (P= 0. 015), it was - 182 } 2. 323 g (P= 0. 140) for portable domestic scales and 137 } 2. 412 g (P= 0. 218) for platform fixed scales. Values obtained from SRW, portable domestic scales and fixed platform scales were strongly correlated to the mean value of weight assessed by the <b>reference</b> <b>equipment</b> (r= 0. 973, r= 0. 987 and r= 0. 986, respectively). Nevertheless, considering analyses of each patient, errors of magnitude greater than 500 g occurred in 78. 8 % of SRW, 80. 6 % of the portable domestic scales and 40 % of the fixed platform scales.

40|$|The Integrity GNSS Receiver (IGNSSRX) is a European Commission funded {{project with}} three main objectives: The {{development}} of two platforms {{to capture and}} store GNSS radio frequency signal samples and a reference trajectory from representative low-, medium- And high-end sensors in terrestrial applications. An extensive data collection campaign aiming to characterize error sources, magnitudes and probabilities for two important GNSS terrestrial application areas: Automotive and pedestrian users. The {{research and development of}} techniques and algorithms to mitigate the integrity threats in the two terrestrial environments studied using the collected data, thus allowing reliable terrestrial applications within these domains. This paper presents the results for the first two objectives of the IGNSSRX project, providing the GNSS measurement error characterization results obtained from the analysis of the real data collected using the developed platforms during the acquisition campaign, together with a preliminary report on the developed techniques and algorithms. Data Collection Platforms Two Data Acquisition and Storage Units (DASU) have been developed within the IGNSSRX project for the data collection campaign in the vehicular and pedestrian domains: Vehicular DASU: RF Front-Ends: A high resolution FE and a three- Antenna FE system working both in the GPS LI and Galileo El bands and the GLONASS LI band. The high-resolution FE allows the application of DSP techniques to detect the integrity threat and the three antenna array allows the use of the direction of arrival (DOA) information to identify non line-of-sight (NLOS) signals.

Pedestrian campaign: A number of different routes around city areas in three cities. Of these routes there are two "city centre" routes, where there is a mixture of closely spaced buildings, covered arcades and wider roads; two in "out of town" shopping centres with large car parks for initialisation and limited visibility in the remaining of the route; and a rural/suburban route around a park area. Interference campaign: The collected data is complemented by tests performed with a signal simulator to test the impact of interferences and spoofing. Offline Analysis Unit (OAU) Based on the SRX software receiver [1] for processing the collected RF samples and by taking advantage of the accurate reference system and a common reference atomic clock integrated in the DASU platforms, the measurement errors (code, carrier phase and Doppler) can be accurately determined, and by using precise orbit, clock and ionosphere data from reliable sources (such as the IGS) it is possible to distingu...|$|E

In this work, 09 segments of the BR- 101 /SE highway had taken as study case, all of them with different levels of profile quality.

This often leads to overuse {{of natural resources and}} consequent encroachment on fragile ecosystems such as wetlands. The deteriorating state of wetlands and consequent threats to sustainability of livelihoods remains a matter of concern to many governments, especially in developing countries. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of livelihood activities on wetlands. The study used a combination of cross-cultural and cross-sectional, longitudinal survey to elicit information and data. Purposive and non-purposive sampling strategies were applied.

For inertial sensors, trend-setting sensor technologies will be described. A vision of the inertial sensor instrument field and strapdown inertial systems for the future is given. Planned accuracy improvements for GPS are described. The trend towards deep integration of INS/GPS is described, and the synergistic benefits are explored. Some examples of the effects of interference are described, and expected technology trends to improve system robustness are presented.

40|$|AbstractThe oxygen {{requirements}} for oxycoal combustion in a {{coal-fired power station}} are unusual in several respects. The amount of oxygen required is large, for instance a 500   MWe power plant will require around 10, 000  tonnes per day of oxygen. The oxygen purity is low and the pressure required is essentially atmospheric pressure. There is no demand for any significant quantity of co-products, such as argon or nitrogen. The parasitic nature of the power means that high efficiency is important but the large scale means that capital cost should also be minimised. These factors open up new possibilities to optimise the process cycle and machinery configuration to minimise the power consumption of the air separation unit without compromising the requirement for low cost. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study to develop Air Products’ air separation unit (ASU) offerings for oxycoal CO 2 capture projects. A scalable “reference plant” concept is described to match particular sizes of power generation equipment, taking into account factors such as safety, reliability, operating flexibility, efficiency, and of course low capital cost. We describe the selection of a process cycle to exploit the low purity requirements as well as the options for compression machinery and drivers as the scale of the plant increases and the sizes of <b>referenced</b> <b>equipment</b> limit the possibilities. We also explore integration with other elements of the oxycoal system, such as preheating condensate or heating and expanding pressurised nitrogen. Finally, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different execution strategies for air separation unit projects are discussed, as well as alternative commercial models for the supply of oxygen...|$|R

One gas combo heating system consisted of a conventional water heater that provided domestic hot water directly and space heating through a heating coil in an air handler that {{was connected to the}} house's forced air distribution system. The second gas combo was connected in the same way, but featured condensing gas technology.

Half way through the monitoring period for each combo, an adjustment was made to the air handler velocities, and an additional set of performance characteristics was developed for each combo, based on the new air flow velocities. The combo system that was based on conventional water heating technology did not perform as well as the benchmark configuration in the colder portions of the heating season, but equaled the performance of the benchmark in the shoulder seasons. The gas combo that is based on condensing technology showed energy savings over a greater proportion of the heating season than the conventional efficiency gas combo unit.

The choice of the location for installing a wind turbine or wind farm, is also becoming a more complicated issue. The goal is to characterize with greater detail the mean and turbulent flow field over a certain area. This is achieved nowadays with point measurements of the wind characteristics with meteorological towers equipped at several heights. This standard technique is becoming increasingly expensive and technically more challenging, once the 30 – 50 m met towers used in the 90 ’s were replaced by 80 - 100 m met towers in the 2000 decade. The standard in the wind industry is assessing the resource where it’s going to be extracted (location and height). For such large turbines, where the hub is at 120 m a. g. l. it is quite expensive and technically complicated to measure with standard met towers.

40|$|International audience—For the {{development}} of driving assistance systems and autonomous vehicles, a <b>reference</b> perception <b>equipment</b> including navigable space determination and obstacles detection is a key issue. The Velodyne sensor which provides high definition and omnidirectional information {{can be used for}} this purpose. Nevertheless, when scanning around the vehicle, uncertainty necessarily arises due to unperceived areas and noisy measure-ments. This paper proposes an inverse evidential model for the Velodyne in order to exploit its measurements in a 2 D occupancy grid mapping framework. The evidential sensor model interprets the data acquired from the Velodyne and successively maps it to a Carthesian evidential grid using a fusion process based on the least commitment principle to guarantee information integrity. Experimental results prove that this approach can handle efficiently the uncertainties of the sensor and thus a highly reliable local reference map near the vehicle can be built for every timestamped perception system that needs evaluation or calibration...|$|R
