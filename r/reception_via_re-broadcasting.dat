50|$|Several factors {{influenced}} {{the sale of}} the station, including a declining audience via antenna for TBN's translator stations, and the signals of religious stations WTLJ and WLLA from Western Michigan being easily receivable during the summer months in the Sheboygan area. The launch by TBN of WWRS from Mayville did not affect W16BS as that station's signal was blocked by the Kettle Moraine range east of Fond du Lac, blocking any signal from entering Sheboygan and leaving TBN to continue to operate W16BS. However TBN and its other digital subchannels later launched on local cable provider Charter Communications in late August 2007, with <b>reception</b> <b>via</b> satellite. Time Warner Cable systems in the county also carry the network via WWRS via must-carry election. These carriage agreements, associated costs of the digital transition, and universal coverage by the major satellite broadcasters were likely the impetus for TBN's sale of the station to another party.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative multifaceted architecture, named energy-efficient framework for DTV broadcast over Wi-Fi networks (eWU-TV), that provides an energy efficient, user-centric, adaptive digital television (DTV) broadcast over Wi-Fi. To {{cater to the}} varied properties of the user equipments (UEs), the proposed framework broadcasts DTV content {{in the form of}} scalable video coded content that is adapted to suit the subscribers' requirements. The user-centricity is in terms of UE device display size, user preferences for video quality profile based on device energy saving, and UE transmission technology support (DVB-T/H or Wi-Fi). Mathematical models on device battery discharge, quality of experience, and user preference are devised that closely approximate the results of device battery discharge experiments on DTV reception by heterogeneous devices over Wi-Fi/DVB-T, subjective video quality assessment study, and statistical survey of user preference. The proposed eWU-TV performance optimization framework is based on the developed models. The framework ensures that the adaptive scalable broadcast <b>reception</b> <b>via</b> Wi-Fi serves more number of users with higher quality of user experience and with provisions for significant device energy saving...|$|R

40|$|Horror novels often {{celebrate}} gore, darkness, {{madness and}} emotional repression {{as the central}} themes to invoke terror and horror in readers. In the novel Dark Demon Rising (1997) the elements of grotesque and nature provide the impetus and the plot, thus invoking horror. Apart from the evident elements of grotesque, nature as a backdrop is also significant. Both elements are omnipresent and pivotal in developing the plot. Noting {{the relationship between the}} two elements, this paper explores the relationship between the grotesque and nature through the portrayal of human-nature interconnectedness in the selected novels. This paper utilises the concepts of ecocriticism and grotesque. Ecocriticism provides sufficient explanation on the relationship between humans and the natural world. The concept of grotesque by Wolfgang Kayser provides a solid framework in highlighting and exploring the texts. The application of these concepts will then demonstrate that apart from imagery, the role of nature is also evident in channelling the relationship between human and nature. The interrelationship between nature and the grotesque is portrayed under Kayser’s notion of the grotesque reception. Pertaining to this notion, the interconnectedness is unveiled through the comic/horror and attractive/repulsive dualities. The finding concludes that the element of nature depicts the grotesque <b>reception</b> <b>via</b> the characters’ demeanour, especially the protagonists’ emotions, perceptions and attitude...|$|R

30|$|The core idea of {{cooperative}} communication systems is {{to alleviate the}} negative effects of communication channels, such as fading and noise, and to increase the probability of successful message <b>reception</b> <b>via</b> cooperation. With {{a closer look at the}} rows of H 4, we note that any two rows of H 4 are linearly independent, while those of H 2 may not be. This means that as long as any two messages out of the four, {S 1 S 2 Z 1 Z 2 }, are received correctly, NBNC- 4 can correctly decode the correct transmit messages S 1 and S 2. This is not possible with the BNC scheme. For example, the last two rows of H 2 are dependent on each other. Thus, with the reception of only Z 1 and Z 2, the BNC scheme cannot decode the messages S 1 and S 2 accurately. For a network of two-user cooperation, this desirable behavior can be attained by increasing the field size to 4. This behavior was first observed in [17]. In this article, our focus again is to show how this favorable behavior can lead to power efficiency in terms of coverage expansion, and to study how the transmit power should be allocated differently between the two sensors given a fixed power budget.|$|R
40|$|Wireless car-to-X {{communication}} technology {{is about to}} enter the mass market within the next years. Thereby, security in created vehicular ad-hoc networks depends on digital signatures managed by a multi-level certificate hierarchy. Certificate distribution is critical in regard to channel usage and delay of data <b>reception</b> <b>via</b> security caused packet loss. These issues are even more significant in case not only pseudonym certificates, but also certificate authority certificates, have to be exchanged between nodes on demand. Prior work has not treated dissemination of higher level elements from a multi-level certificate chain in detail. Thus, this work provides a study on the recently standardized algorithms. Several drawbacks of the straight forward solution taken so far are identified, which include severe denial of service weaknesses. Solutions to the distribution problem are found to be similar to the ones of the packet forwarding problem encountered in position-based routing. Hence, we study several algorithms for efficient distribution of a certificate chain in regard to channel load, which are adapted from their counterparts in position-based routing. Thereby, a combination of pseudonym certificate buffering with requester based responder selection is found to be able to completely remove the requirement for certificate chain distribution in VANETs. The introduced design avoids the found denial of service weakness, while decreasing the worst case size of the security envelope of VANET messages by more than a third at the same time...|$|R

Despite cultural differences, differences in belief systems and language barriers, four Human biological needs {{we have in}} common are: Blood, Water, Seeds and Oxygen. This work has three movements—Blood, Seeds and Oxygen—which are connected by two Water interludes. It is an acousmatic music composition meaning that it exists in recorded form and is designed for <b>reception</b> <b>via</b> loudspeakers only. The score, therefore, acts as a graphic illustration of the sonic contents rather than a set of instructions for live performers. The score for Blood, the first movement, does not use traditional notation but instead provides a graphic display of sounds and composed textures. The first Water interlude consists of a rain shower and bird songs both of which are recorded in a forest. This first interlude waters Seeds, the second movement. Seeds has a traditional music score and uses recordings of a homemade seed shaker, a rainstick, a piano and two synthesized sounds as sound sources.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a wireless neural telemetry system that enables new experimental paradigms, such as neural recordings during rodent navigation in large outdoor environments. RoSco, short for Rodent Scope, is a small lightweight user-configurable module suitable for digital wireless recording from freely behaving small animals. Due to the digital transmission technology, RoSco has advantages over most other wireless modules of noise immunity and online user-configurable settings. RoSco digitally transmits entire neural waveforms for 14 of 16 channels at 20 kHz with 8 -bit encoding which are streamed to the PC as standard USB audio packets. Up to 31 RoSco wireless modules can coexist in the same environment on non-overlapping independent channels. The design has spatial diversity <b>reception</b> <b>via</b> two antennas, which makes wireless communication resilient to fading and obstacles. In comparison with most existing wireless systems, this system has online user-selectable independent gain control of each channel in 8 factors from 500 to 32, 000 times, two selectable ground references from a subset of channels, selectable channel grounding to disable noisy electrodes, and selectable bandwidth suitable for action potentials (300 Hz– 3 kHz) and low frequency field potentials (4 Hz– 3 kHz). Indoor and outdoor recordings taken from freely behaving rodents are shown to be comparable to a commercial wired system in sorting for neural populations.

40|$|The {{entertainment}} industry is lucrative and flourishing owing to advancements in modern technology. Television, in particular, penetrates homes {{in almost every}} corner of the world. The current trend of reality-based TV shows in the West {{has proven to be a}} phenomenal success and prompted Asian TV in 2005 to adapt and create its own version of the popular international series Big Brother – Big Brother Thailand. The show drew large audiences and was such a hit that its producers, the Kantana Group, immediately produced a second series in the following year. This paper explores the phenomenon of a ‘glocal’ television program in Thailand - the first and second Big Brother Thailand series - examining the ways in which audiences view and interpret the shows, both in terms of passive and active <b>reception,</b> <b>via</b> positive (identification) and negative (indignation). Responses from local and expatriate viewers vary, with some approving of the behaviour of housemates, including gestures, and others finding these inappropriate and insulting. Leading Thai commentators, however, have unanimously condemned the shows, questioning their propensity to promote ‘unThai’ behaviours that have the potential to corrupt the Thai social fabric. The influence of these critics caused the show’s producers to be called before the House Committee on Religion, Arts and Culture in 2005 – publicity about which caused the program’s ratings to peak. This paper examines the range of responses to Big Brother Thailand and raises the question of whether glocal television programs benefit local communities by increasing global understanding and communication or contribute to the watering down of local cultures in favour of global hegemony. 10 page(s...|$|R
