40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the shape of the ionization curve in nuclear emulsions at values of ϒ˃ 100, we have measured the blob density of <b>relativistic</b> electron <b>tracks.</b> The pv of the pair produced electrons used was determined by multiple scattering. A total of 84. 45 centimeters of electron track was blob taunted and scattered. From ϒ = 100 to ϒ = 5400 the data were combined into 14 points each with a statistical uncertainty on blob density of less than 1 %. These points indicate a level "plateau" and show no deviation from this plateau within our statistical accuracy. Pions were used to estimate the minimum of the ionization curve 5 and ratio of blob density plateau to blob density minimum is estimated to be 1. 140 ±. 020.

40|$|Stochastic {{radiation}} {{track structure}} codes are {{of great interest}} for space radiation studies and hadron therapy in medicine. These codes are used for a many purposes, notably for microdosimetry and DNA damage studies. In the last two decades, they were also used with the Independent Reaction Times (IRT) method in the simulation of chemical reactions, to calculate the yield of various radiolytic species produced during the radiolysis of water and in chemical dosimeters. Recently, we have developed a Green's function based code to simulate reversible chemical reactions with an intermediate state, which yielded results in excellent agreement with those obtained by using the IRT method. This code was also used to simulate and the interaction of particles with membrane receptors. We {{are in the process}} of including this program for use with the MonteCarlo <b>track</b> structure code <b>Relativistic</b> Ion <b>Tracks</b> (RITRACKS). This recent addition should greatly expand the capabilities of RITRACKS, notably to simulate DNA damage by both the direct and indirect effect...|$|R

The GNSS orbits and clocks are usually {{derived from the}} analysis of tracking data collected by a globally distributed GNSS receiver network. The estimation process adjusts parameters for the satellite orbits, transmitter and receiver clocks, station positions, tropospheric delays, Earth orientation, intersystem and interfrequency biases, and carrier-phase ambiguities. The estimation requires detailed modeling of geophysical processes, atmospheric and <b>relativistic</b> effects, receiver <b>tracking</b> modes, antenna phase centers, spacecraft properties, and attitude control algorithms.

40|$|The code RITRACKS (<b>Relativistic</b> Ion <b>Tracks)</b> was {{developed}} to simulate detailed stochastic radiation track structures of ions of different types and energies. Many new capabilities {{were added to the}} code during the recent years. Several options were added to specify the times at which the tracks appear in the irradiated volume, allowing the simulation of dose-rate effects. The code has been used to simulate energy deposition in several targets: spherical, ellipsoidal and cylindrical. More recently, density changes as well as a spherical shell were implemented for spherical targets, in order to simulate energy deposition in walled tissue equivalent proportional counters. RITRACKS is used {{as a part of the}} new program BDSTracks (Biological Damage by Stochastic Tracks) to simulate several types of chromosome aberrations in various irradiation conditions. The simulation of damage to various DNA structures (linear and chromatin fiber) by direct and indirect effects has been improved and is ongoing. Many improvements were also made to the graphic user interface (GUI), including the addition of several labels allowing changes of units. A new GUI has been added to display the electron ejection vectors. The parallel calculation capabilities, notably the pre- and post-simulation processing on Windows and Linux machines have been reviewed to make them more portable between different systems. The calculation part is currently maintained in an Atlassian Stash repository for code tracking and possibly future collaboration...|$|R
40|$|The code RITRACKS (<b>Relativistic</b> Ion <b>Tracks)</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} {{over the last few}} years at the NASA Johnson Space Center to simulate the effects of ionizing radiations at the microscopic scale, to understand the effects of space radiation at the biological level. The fundamental part of this code is the stochastic simulation of radiation track structure of heavy ions, an important component of space radiations. The code can calculate many relevant quantities such as the radial dose, voxel dose, and may also be used to calculate the dose in spherical and cylindrical targets of various sizes. Recently, we have incorporated DNA structure and damage simulations at the molecular scale in RITRACKS. The direct effect of radiations is simulated by introducing a slight modification of the existing particle transport algorithms, using the BinaryEncounterBethe model of ionization cross sections for each molecular orbitals of DNA. The simulation of radiation chemistry is done by a stepbystep diffusionreaction program based on the Green's functions of the diffusion equation]. This approach is also used to simulate the indirect effect of ionizing radiation on DNA. The software can be installed independently on PC and tablets using the Windows operating system and does not require any coding from the user. It includes a Graphic User Interface (GUI) and a 3 D OpenGL visualization interface. The calculations are executed simultaneously (in parallel) on multiple CPUs. The main features of the software will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) {{facility}} {{has been used}} successfully {{for many years to}} generate ion beams for radiation research experiments by NASA investigators. Recently, modifications were made to the beam lines to allow rapid switching between different types of ions and energies, with the aim to simulate the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) environment. As this will be a focus of space radiation research for upcoming years, the stochastic radiation track structure code RITRACKS (<b>Relativistic</b> Ion <b>Tracks)</b> was modified to simulate beams of various ion types and energies during time intervals specified by the user at the microscopic and nanoscopic scales. For example, particle distributions of a mixed 344. 1 -MeV protons (18. 04 cGy) and 950 -MeV/n iron (5. 64 cGy) beam behind a 20 g/cm(exp 2) aluminum followed by a 10 g/cm(exp 2) polyethylene shield as calculated by the code GEANT 4 were used as an input field in RITRACKS. Similarly, modifications were also made to simulate a realistic radiation environment in a spacecraft exposed to GCR by sampling the ion types and energies from particle spectra pre-calculated by the code HZETRN. The newly implemented features allows RITRACKS to generate time-dependent differential and cumulative 3 D dose voxel maps. These new capabilities of RITRACKS will be used to investigate dose-rate effects and synergistic interactions of various types of radiations for many end points at the microscopic and nanoscopic scales such as DNA damage and chromosome aberrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and chromosome aberrations {{is an important}} consequence of ionizing radiation. To simulate DNA double-strand breaks and the {{formation of}} chromosome aberrations, we have recently merged the codes RITRACKS (<b>Relativistic</b> Ion <b>Tracks)</b> and NASARTI (NASA Radiation Track Image). The program RITRACKS is a stochastic code developed to simulate detailed event-by-event radiation track structure: [1] This code is used to calculate the dose in voxels of 20 nm, in a volume containing simulated chromosomes, [2] The number of tracks in the volume is calculated for each simulation by sampling a Poisson distribution, with the distribution parameter obtained from the irradiation dose, ion type and energy. The program NASARTI generates the chromosomes present in a cell nucleus by random walks of 20 nm, corresponding {{to the size of the}} dose voxels, [3] The generated chromosomes are located within domains which may intertwine, and [4] Each segment of the random walks corresponds to approx. 2, 000 DNA base pairs. NASARTI uses pre-calculated dose at each voxel to calculate the probability of DNA damage at each random walk segment. Using the location of double-strand breaks, possible rejoining between damaged segments is evaluated. This yields various types of chromosomes aberrations, including deletions, inversions, exchanges, etc. By performing the calculations using various types of radiations, it will be possible to obtain relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for several types of chromosome aberrations...|$|R

40|$|We {{unify the}} feeding and {{feedback}} of supermassive black holes {{with the global}} properties of galaxies, groups, and clusters, by linking {{for the first time}} the physical mechanical efficiency at the horizon and Mpc scale. The macro hot halo is tightly constrained by the absence of overheating and overcooling as probed by X-ray data and hydrodynamic simulations (ε_ BH≃ 10 ^- 3 T_ x, 7. 4). The micro flow is shaped by general <b>relativistic</b> effects <b>tracked</b> by state-of-the-art GR-RMHD simulations (ε_∙≃ 0. 03). The SMBH properties are tied to the X-ray halo temperature T_ x, or related cosmic scaling relation (as L_ x). The model is minimally based on first principles, as conservation of energy and mass recycling. The inflow occurs via chaotic cold accretion (CCA), the rain of cold clouds condensing out of the quenched cooling flow and recurrently funneled via inelastic collisions. Within 100 s gravitational radii, the accretion energy is transformed into ultrafast 10 ^ 4 km s^- 1 outflows (UFOs) ejecting most of the inflowing mass. At larger radii the energy-driven outflow entrains progressively more mass: at roughly kpc scale, the velocities of the hot/warm/cold outflows are a few 10 ^ 3, 1000, 500 km s^- 1, with median mass rates 10, 100, several 100 M_ yr^- 1, respectively. The unified CCA model is consistent with the observations of nuclear UFOs, and ionized, neutral, and molecular macro outflows. We provide step-by-step implementation for subgrid simulations, (semi) analytic works, or observational interpretations which require self-regulated AGN feedback at coarse scales, avoiding the a-posteriori fine-tuning of efficiencies.

40|$|The {{formation}} of doublestrand breaks (DSBs) and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) {{is of great}} importance in radiation research and, specifically, in space applications. We are presenting a new particle track and DNA damage model, in which the particle stochastic track structure is combined with the random walk (RW) structure of chromosomes in a cell nucleus. The motivation for this effort {{stems from the fact}} that the model with the RW chromosomes, NASARTI (NASA radiation track image) previously relied on amorphous track structure, while the stochastic track structure model RITRACKS (<b>Relativistic</b> Ion <b>Tracks)</b> was focused on more microscopic targets than the entire genome. We have combined chromosomes simulated by RWs with stochastic track structure, which uses nanoscopic dose calculations performed with the MonteCarlo simulation by RITRACKS in a voxelized space. The new simulations produce the number of DSBs as function of dose and particle fluence for highenergy particles, including iron, carbon and protons, using voxels of 20 nm dimension. The combined model also calculates yields of radiationinduced CAs and unrejoined chromosome breaks in normal and repair deficient cells. The joined computational model is calibrated using the relative frequencies and distributions of chromosomal aberrations reported in the literature. The model considers fractionated deposition of energy to approximate dose rates of the space flight environment. The joined model also predicts of the yields and sizes of translocations, dicentrics, rings, and more complextype aberrations formed in the G 0 /G 1 cell cycle phase during the first cell division after irradiation. We found that the main advantage of the joined model is our ability to simulate small doses: 0. 050. 5 Gy. At such low doses, the stochastic track structure proved to be indispensable, as the action of individual deltarays becomes more important...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{detection}} in applications {{ranging from}} high energy physics to medical imaging rely on solid state detectors, often hybrid pixel detectors with (1) reverse biased p-n junction pixel sensors and (2) readout ASICs, attached by flip-chip-bonding. Transient signals characteristics are important in, e. g., matching ASIC and sensor design, modeling and optimizing detector parameters and describing timing and charge sharing properties. Currently analytical forms of transient signals {{are available for}} only a few limited cases (e. g., drift or diffusion) or for the steady state (which is not relevant for high energy radiation detection). Tools are available for (relatively slow) numerical evaluation of the transient charge transport. We present here the first analytical solutions of partial differential equations describing drift-diffusion-recombination charge transport in planar p-n junction sensors in a variety of conditions: (1) undepleted, (2) fully depleted, (3) taking into account the gradual velocity saturation, and (4) overdepleted. We deduce the Green's functions which can be applied to any detection problem through simple convolution with the initial conditions. We compare the analytical solutions with Monte Carlo simulations and industry standard simulations (Synopsys Sentaurus), demonstrating good agreement. Using the analytical equations enables fast modeling of the influence of various detector parameters on tracking, imaging and timing performance, describing performance and enabling optimizations for different applications. Finally, we illustrate this model with applications in 3 D+T (x,y,z,time) photon tracking and 4 D+T (x,y,theta,phi,time) <b>relativistic</b> charged particle <b>tracking.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures, 3 table...|$|R
40|$|ITER is {{the first}} reactor-scale {{scientific}} experiment that aims to demonstrate the scientific and the technological feasibility of fusion energy. It {{is based on the}} tokamak concept of magnetic confinement, in which the fuel, a mixture of deuterium and tritium heated to temperatures in excess of 150 million degrees Celsius, is contained in a toroidal vacuum chamber. Among the systems used to reach such high temperature range, a fundamental role is played by the injection of intense beams of neutral particles into the plasma, which is consequently heated by collisions. This process is realized by means of two Neutral Beam Injectors (NBIs), capable of delivering to the plasma a power of 16. 7 MW each. These devices are mainly composed of a negative deuterium ion source, an electrostatic accelerator where a 40 A beam of negative deuterons will be accelerated to 1 MV and a neutralizer which converts part of the beam into high energy neutrals able to penetrate the high magnetic field confining the ITER plasma. The ITER requirements for these devices have never been simultaneously achieved so far in a full scale, full performance device and therefore a neutral beam test facility is being constructed at Consorzio RFX in Padova. The research activity presented in this thesis work is in the framework of the development of the negative ion source (SPIDER) and full injector (MITICA) prototypes for the ITER neutral beam. In particular, it is focused on two main topics: particle transport studies inside the MITICA accelerator {{and the development of a}} tomographic beam diagnostic. A proper modeling of the particle transport inside the MITICA accelerator, considering the main processes that generate secondary particles relevant for the evaluation of the heat loads on the accelerator grids is essential for the thermo-mechanical analysis and the mechanical design of the accelerator. For this reason an upgrade of the <b>relativistic</b> particle <b>tracking</b> code called EAMCC has been undertaken and the simulations performed for evaluating the thermal power deposited on the MITICA accelerator grids are presented in the first part of the present thesis work. For the first time, an entire source called NIO 1 installed at RFX and made of nine beamlets has been simulated in EAMCC considering multi-beamlet effects which were neglected earlier and discarding the axis-symmetry hypothesis of the electric fields imposed by the original version of the code. Results obtained, also presented in the first part, will be used for benchmarking the modifications introduced in the code. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to beam tomography, an important diagnostic for the assessment of the density profile of the beam. A tomography code based on algebraic reconstruction techniques has been developed and numerically tested. Beam emissivity profiles considered for testing the code are calculated by the upgraded version of EAMCC. The tomography code has been developed with the aim of realizing a versatile instrument, applicable to linear accelerators as well as to a tokamak and without adding any hypotheses about the beam characteristics or the emissivity in a particular region of the tomography plane, not to limit the capability of the code of detecting irregularities in the beam profiles. The effects of the instrumental noise on tomography reconstructions have also been studied and, in order to reduce its impact, different filtering techniques have been considered both in the frequency and in the spatial domain, demonstrating the feasibility to filter out the effect of the noise by post-processing the reconstructed image of the bea...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic monopoles are {{particles}} which act as {{a source}} for divergent magnetic fields, equivalent to a proton's electric field. Beyond simply adding the final symmetry to Maxwell's equations, their existence would solve numerous outstanding problems in the particle physics community. However, no conclusive evidence for their existence has been found. Magnetic monopoles possess many unique characteristics that allow for detection from a variety of experimental methods. One property is the large scaling of the Cherenkov radiation (&# 8764; 8300) compared to electrically charged particles. Magnetic monopoles are postulated to be extremely heavy (&# 8764; 10 4 &# 8722; 10 17 GeV). However, they would be topologically stable and accelerated via magnetic field lines throughout the universe, potentially reaching energies &# 8764; 10 15 GeV. Therefore, searches for relativistic magnetic monopoles incident on Earth are an important piece to the overall experimental search. The IceCube neutrino observatory, located at the South Pole, offers a novel environment to search for these particles. IceCube is a km 3 </super grid of light sensors buried deep within the Antarctic Ice Shelf and represents the most colossal neutrino telescope in the world. The large instrumented volume and relatively clear glacial ice allows for a significant improvement in sensitivity to the bright <b>tracks</b> <b>relativistic</b> magnetic monopoles would exhibit. The main background comes from large muon bundles produced in air showers generated by the highest energy cosmic rays. The depth of the detector allows for a limited rejection of these events from the Southern Hemisphere, while the Earth acts as an opaque shield to these events traveling from the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, a large range of potential magnetic monopole masses and energies considered (M & 10 7 GeV, E & 10 11 GeV) can travel completely through the Earth while remaining relativistic. This dissertation details the first search performed for these relativistic magnetic monopoles with IceCube data. The data is from 2007, when IceCube operated as a partially completed detector with an instrumented volume of &# 8764; 0. 2 km 3. It considers monopoles at four discrete speeds: &# 946; = 0. 76, 0. 8, 0. 9, 0. 995, ranging from just above the Cherenkov threshold in ice to a boost factor of 10. Discrimination between a potential magnetic monopole signal and background is achieved by considering the brightness and direction of the event. After an initial search revealed deficiencies in the simulated background model, a more conservative analysis produces limits that are &# 8764; 10 x better than previous searches. The final limits are then transformed to be a limit on an isotropic flux at the Earth's surface, due to the dependence on direction to the overall sensitivity of the analysis...|$|R
