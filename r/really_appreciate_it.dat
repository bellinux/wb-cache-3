50|$|Rosto the Piper: Rosto is a {{young man}} of Scanran ancestry and {{questionable}} loyalties. He has very pale skin, white blond hair and black eyes. He also has a large number of scars and blade wounds on his arms and face. He is vain and extremely sensitive about his age, getting angry when Beka calls him old and says he has white hair. He scorns the current Rogue of Corus as having lost his grip, and later usurps the 'throne' (gaining him yet another scar) and becomes King of the Rogue. Rosto has two female friends who came with him from Scanra: Aniki, a swordswoman, and Kora, a mage. Beka first meets the three in a bar, when Rosto stops the barman from harassing Beka. Later, they meet in the Court of the Rogue, where, presumably, the threesome were scouting out the competition. Rosto, Aniki, and Kora become very good friends with Beka throughout into the story, even moving into her boarding house and sharing breakfast with her. Rosto often flirts with Beka, who doesn't <b>really</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>it.</b> This flirtation comes to a head when Rosto defeats the Rogue and when telling his friends of his victory, kisses Beka in celebration.|$|E
50|$|Actress Susan Sarandon portrayed Sarfatti in the 1999 movie Cradle Will Rock {{which was}} written and {{directed}} by Sarandon's then longtime companion, Tim Robbins. Sarandon discussed her role, saying:Margherita is someone who is a legitimate historical figure. She really existed. She really was Mussolini's mistress and was very involved in the cultural shaping of Italy's art movements. She was a patron of new painters in Italy. She came over to the United States to sell Mussolini to the American people, and she did that by using Hearst's column. She wrote a column, and that was how they prepared the United States people for the concept of entering the war on the side of Mussolini, I suppose. And also she was trying to fund the war.And the complication of this was {{the fact that she was}} Jewish, and she in fact was facilitating her own crisis, which eventually would make her flee the country and live in Argentina, I believe, for a number of years before it was safe for her to go back. Whether or not she was just in complete denial or she really truly believed that there was a way to sleep with Mussolini and not be held accountable, I don't know. But she ended up in an awkward position. She was hobnobbing with all these rich American people. I think in the context of the film, she's somebody who has a job to do and because she loved art, she sometimes finds herself to be giving all this art away to people she feels don't <b>really</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
