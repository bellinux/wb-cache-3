5|$|Beep is a <b>reloadable</b> {{contactless}} {{smart card}} aimed to be a replacement for the magnetic card-based system in paying rail based rapid transit transportation fares in and around Metro Manila. Beep is also aimed {{to be used in}} lieu of cash in some convenience stores and other businesses. The Beep system is implemented and operated by AF Payments Incorporated, which is primarily owned by Ayala Corporation and Metro Pacific Investments Corporation.|$|E
5|$|The entire Kiev Metro {{system uses}} the same methods of payment for transit via each station; plastic tokens, {{temporary}} paper contactless cards, and <b>reloadable</b> plastic contactless cards. In June 2015, the station was outfitted with Paypass functionality, a contactless payment service from MasterCard. It is one of seventeen strategic stations of the metro system to use this technology, making Kiev the fifth rapid transit {{system in the world}} to incorporate this technology.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit {{announced}} that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the Easy Card system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail fare gates from a <b>reloadable</b> card. The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009. Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers using Metrorail must use either an Easy Card or Easy Ticket to enter stations. For almost the full first year of use, the Easy Card ticket vending machines allowed anyone to purchase thousands of dollars worth of Easy Cards by credit card without entering a PIN or billing zip code, which led to credit card thieves putting high dollar values on Easy Cards and selling them at a discounted rate for cash. Miami-Dade Transit initially mitigated this issue by limiting credit card transactions to three per day and a value limit of $112, and later by requiring zip code verification for all cards.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} two dozen public transit {{agencies}} in the Bay Area with overlapping service areas that utilize different modes, with designated connection points between the various operators. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), a heavy rail/metro system, operates in four counties and connects San Francisco and Oakland via an underwater tube. Other commuter rail systems link San Francisco with the Peninsula and San Jose (Caltrain), San Jose with the Tri-Valley Area and San Joaquin county (ACE), and Sonoma with Marin county (SMART). In addition, Amtrak provides frequent commuter service between and San Jose and the East Bay with Sacramento, and long distance service {{to other parts of}} the United States. Muni Metro operates a hybrid streetcar/subway system within the city of San Francisco, and VTA operates a light rail system in Santa Clara county. These rail systems are supplemented by numerous bus agencies and transbay ferries such as Golden Gate Ferry and the San Francisco Bay Water Transit Authority. Most of these agencies accept the Clipper Card, a <b>reloadable</b> contactless smart card, as a universal electronic payment system.|$|E

The number of torpedoes was initially three in unreloadable tubes; but this was quickly changed to two in <b>reloadable</b> tubes in operational service.|$|E

25|$|A rocket-propelled grenade (often {{abbreviated}} RPG) is a shoulder-fired, {{anti-tank weapon}} system which fires rockets {{equipped with an}} explosive warhead. These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor and stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are <b>reloadable</b> while others are single-use. RPGs, {{with the exception of}} self-contained versions, are loaded from the muzzle. RPGs are very effective against armored vehicles such as armoured personnel carriers (APCs). The German Panzerfaust were the originals RPG's while a Soviet-development, the RPG-7, is the most widely distributed and used RPG in the world. The basic design of this RPG was developed by the Soviets shortly after World War II {{in the form of the}} RPG-2, which is similar in function to the Bazooka and the Panzerfaust.|$|E
500|$|SmarTrip is a contact-less stored-value {{smart card}} payment system {{managed by the}} Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) uses a {{compatible}} payment system called CharmCard. A reciprocity agreement between the MTA and WMATA allows either card {{to be used for}} travel on any of the participating transit systems in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Unlike traditional paper farecards or bus passes, SmarTrip/CharmCard is designed to be permanent and <b>reloadable.</b> For the rest of this article, [...] "SmarTrip" [...] will refer to both unless there is a specific difference between the two.|$|E
500|$|The Presto {{system allows}} {{passengers}} to load a <b>reloadable</b> card with any amount starting at $10, up to $1,000. Passengers pay their fare by [...] "tapping" [...] {{on and off}} on busses and trains. With each tap, the system calculates the fare for the ride, and it is deducted from {{the balance of the}} card. The card can also be linked to a credit card and set on autoload, so that it automatically adds {{a certain amount of money}} as soon as the balance decreases past a certain level (e.g., setting it to add $100 every time the balance decreases to less than $25).|$|E
500|$|Stored value {{tickets are}} usable {{on either the}} LRT-1 or LRT-2 lines {{although}} a new fare will be charged when transferring from one line to the other. [...] To reduce ticket queues, the LRTA is promoting the use of stored value tickets. [...] Aside from benefitting from a lower fare structure on the LRT-1, stored value ticket users can avail of a scheme called the Last Ride Bonus that grants {{the use of any}} residual amount in a stored value ticket less than the usual minimum ₱12 fare, or the appropriate fare for the station of arrival from the station of departure, as a full fare. [...] Stored value tickets are not <b>reloadable</b> and are captured by the fare gate after the last use. [...] They expire six months after the date of first use.|$|E

2500|$|Initially {{known as}} the LPG-44, named after the program's start date, the weapon was {{intended}} to be smaller and lighter than the Panzerfaust, but easily <b>reloadable</b> like the bazooka. Its PG-70 warhead was a HEAT round, named for its size, [...] wide at its widest point. Development was largely completed by the end of 1944 and the system was renamed the RPG-1 and the round became the PG-1.|$|E
2500|$|The first Colt Single Action Army prototypes were {{manufactured}} in [...]44 American caliber for the 1872 government trials, as the [...]44 American was the cartridge {{used in the}} 1,000 Smith & Wesson Model 3 revolvers issued to the troops. After the tests, the Colt was declared the superior revolver and the government specified that a [...]45 caliber cartridge would be required. With {{the adoption of the}} Colt Single Action Army revolver in 1873, the service cartridges were Copper-cased [...]45 centerfire Benét inside primed [...] "Colt's Revolver Cartridges" [...] loaded with 30 grains of black powder and an inside lubricated bullet of 250 grain. They were manufactured at Frankford Arsenal, Philadelphia, PA, through 1874. In 1875, the cartridge was shortened so that it would also function in the newly adopted S & W Schofield revolver. It was designated “Revolver Cartridge” and loaded with 28 grains of black powder and a bullet of 230 grain. The Bénet-primed cartridges were manufactured until 1882 and then replaced by <b>reloadable</b> cartridges with brass cases and external primers.|$|E

5000|$|While the {{scarcity}} of <b>reloadable</b> cartridge cases previously made the 7.5 mm Swiss problematic for US shooters, <b>reloadable</b> cases can be easily produced by reforming [...]284 Winchester brass. Case rims will be slightly undersized, but this presents no problems {{so long as the}} rifle's extractor is in good condition. This allows the handloader to produce a GP90 load that is safe for the Schmidt-Rubin Model 1889 rifle. Privi Partizan has been producing new made brass for reloaders as well as loaded ammunition so supplies of <b>reloadable</b> brass are less difficult to obtain.|$|E

50|$|The North Coasters motor line {{consisted}} of the E28 (24mm), F41 (24mm) and G60 (29mm) motors. They were phased out late in 1987 due to supply issues. North Coast planned to make <b>reloadable</b> motors, and a few prototype cases were made, but the propellant shipping issues of the early 1990s stopped their development. NCR <b>reloadable</b> motor design {{was said to be}} so simple, using color-coded parts, that assembly could be done by someone who knew nothing about rockets and who hadn't read one word of the instructions. The <b>reloadable</b> motor technology was never actually put into production.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reloadable</b> composite-propellant motors {{are also}} available. These are commercially {{produced}} motors requiring {{the user to}} assemble propellant grains, o-rings and washers (to contain the expanding gases), delay grains and ejection charges into special non-shattering aluminum motor casings with screw-on or snap-in ends (closures). The advantage of a <b>reloadable</b> motor is the cost: firstly, because the main casing is reusable, reloads cost significantly less than single-use motors of the same impulse. Secondly, assembly of larger composite engines is labor-intensive and difficult to automate; off-loading this task on the consumer results in a cost savings. <b>Reloadable</b> motors are available from D through O class.|$|E
