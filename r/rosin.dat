They were promptly arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council paid their fines.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. <b>Rosin</b> argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E
5|$|Many calcium {{compounds}} {{are used}} in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate, calcium diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. The last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids. Calcium lactobionate is a white powder that {{is used as a}} suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming <b>rosin</b> and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} lignocellulose, wood {{consists}} {{of a variety of}} low molecular weight organic compounds, called extractives.

The extraction of these organic materials from wood provides tall oil, turpentine, and <b>rosin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Rosin,</b> {{made from}} conifer resin, {{is applied to}} the bow hairs to {{increase}} the effectiveness of the friction, grip or bite, and allow proper sound production. <b>Rosin</b> may have additives to modify the friction such as beeswax, gold, silver or tin.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to using traditional bars or coiled wires of all-metal solder and manually applying flux {{to the parts}} being joined, much hand soldering since the mid-20th century has used flux-core solder.

As the solder melts onto the joint, it frees the flux and releases that on it as well.|$|E

5000|$|The Chinese yazheng and yaqin, and Korean ajaeng zithers are {{generally}} played by [...] "bowing" [...] with a <b>rosined</b> stick, which creates friction against the strings without any horsehair.

40|$|Pekalongan {{is one of}} regencies in Central Java {{which have}} wide of public forest area. This public forest has been {{cultivated}} {{for a number of}} years by pine trees, even the population reach out for about 400. 000 trees. This big populations was not optimalised well by the society surroundings, until once emerged an idea to tap the rubber of pine trees became raw material of gum <b>rosins</b> based on partnership system. Nowadays,the rubber of pines and the gum <b>rosins</b> were produced by Perum Perhutani. By looking at the demand of gum <b>rosins</b> increases year by year, so this development idea could be a solution, its also could be an social empowering program by means of managing this forest products, especially non wood products. In the possibility analysis of development public pine forest potencies are conducted some analysis methods. There are internal environment analysis, external environment analysis, SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) analysis to look the existing potencies and possibility of strategies, and decision making the time of development using BOCR (Benefit, Opportunity, Cost, Risk) analysis by ANP (Analytical Network Process). In that SWOT Analysis and decision making uses some consideration factors, such as economic, social, politic and law, environmental, and technological, where each factors consist of some sub factors. This decision making is used to determine the start of development which there are 3 alternatives, to begin the development at year 2009, after year 2009 and infeasible to develop this potencies. Based on data processing representing the result of consideration given by 3 competent experts, obtained some results, that is the position of the public pine forest in Growth quadrant (Concentration in vertical integration) by I-E matrix and in quadrant I or healthy (aggressive, comparatives) using SPACE diagram for the SWOT analysis. The decision making result is the development of public pine forest possibility begin at 2009, with value BOCR equal to 1, 0434. From the results, could be identify the important factors in compilation of strategies, there are network and partnership, human resources and division of role, innovation and development, infrastructure and facilities, and also policies and regulations. The recommendations that given in the development of public pine forest beecome gum <b>rosins</b> based on partnership consisted of 3 key actions, that is 1) mobilize local resource potencies; 2) reform the trade climate; and 3) build/develop the pine rubber sustainable trade arrangement...|$|R
