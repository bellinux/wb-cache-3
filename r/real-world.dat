5|$|Although Macbeth's wife can {{be traced}} to a <b>real-world</b> counterpart, Queen Gruoch of Scotland, Shakespeare's fictional {{character}} is tied so weakly to her that the bonds are virtually non-existent.|$|E
5|$|The fictional quadrotriticale's <b>real-world</b> antecedent, {{the grain}} triticale, {{was a fairly}} new {{invention}} {{at the time of}} the episode.|$|E
5|$|Computers {{used in the}} {{development}} of the film were four times faster than those used in The Incredibles and 1,000 times faster than those used in Toy Story. To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms similar to those used in the design of <b>real-world</b> automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting <b>real-world</b> planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its <b>real-world</b> counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed indicator, a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E
5|$|Forman {{based his}} story on a <b>real-world</b> {{incident}} {{from his past}} and the filmmakers focused much of their attention on {{trying to create a}} real-life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own, utilizing a largely non-professional cast, relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation, and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{after several}} false starts, cleanup efforts {{began when the}} United States {{military}} took on the project. This cleanup exercise provides the military with a <b>real-world</b> training environment for their diving and recovery personnel, coupled {{with the benefit of}} helping the Florida coast without incurring significant costs to the state.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Navy {{unveiled}} a $4-million training facility, using simulators and virtual reality, at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport on Ford Island. The Fleet Integrated Synthetic Training/Testing Facility (FIST2FAC) {{was developed to}} save on training costs with a reusable facility which could emulate electronic, mine and anti-air warfare scenarios instead of <b>real-world</b> training requiring fuel, logistics and deployment costs for ships.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, NASA {{presented}} a new web tool to follow Watney's trek across Mars, and details of NASA's next steps, {{as well as}} a health hazards report, for a <b>real-world</b> human journey to Mars.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} create {{familiarity}} with a common-day setting and tone, Vaughan made this story arc include various references to current popular culture, including television series, films, and celebrities such as , the Matrix trilogy, and Dr. Phil. Vaughan even makes references to <b>real-world</b> events, such as the Menendez brothers' shootings, the Beltway sniper attacks, Saddam Hussein's hiding and the O. J. Simpson murder case.|$|E
5|$|My Transsexual Summer is a British documentary-style reality {{series about}} seven {{transgender}} people in {{different stages of}} transition. For five weekends {{in the summer of}} 2011, they stay together in a large holiday home in Bedfordshire, England, where they meet and help each other with some of the struggles that transgender people face. Between these weekend retreats, they go back to their lives and <b>real-world</b> challenges.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{students}} had become settled, Raymond sought <b>real-world</b> projects for them to work upon, to put his theories into practice. Projects included an assortment of houses and extensions in New Jersey, Connecticut and Long Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} of an appropriation {{depends upon the}} city council's preferences; <b>real-world</b> appropriations can list hundreds of line item amounts. An appropriation is the legal authority for spending given by the city council to the various agencies of the city government. In the example above, the city can {{spend as much as}} $34 million, but smaller appropriation limits have also been established for individual programs and departments.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} {{implants}} has {{to account for}} a lifetime of <b>real-world</b> use in a person's mouth. Regulators and the dental implant industry have created a series of tests to determine the long-term mechanical reliability of implants in a person's mouth where the implant is struck repeatedly with increasing forces (similar in magnitude to biting) until it fails.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} written for Balliett {{classroom}} intended to deal with <b>real-world</b> issues. Balliett values children's ideas and wrote the book specifically to highlight that. Chasing Vermeer has won several awards, including the Edgar and the Agatha. In 2006, the sequel entitled The Wright 3 was published, followed by The Calder Game in 2008,.|$|E
5|$|Through the series, {{the cities}} used within the Crazy Taxi games have been {{influenced}} by <b>real-world</b> cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, and Las Vegas. Certain versions of the Crazy Taxi game include in-game counterparts of <b>real-world</b> businesses, including Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, FILA, and Tower Records; these were often destination targets for the passengers. Although {{this is one of the}} most prominent examples of product placement in video gaming history, it is generally looked upon relatively favorably amongst gamers, perhaps because it gives a sense of realism to the fictional cities in the game. These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later games due to licensing difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Flick {{has been}} a {{frequent}} point of comparison in commentary on <b>real-world</b> political figures. Hillary Clinton has more than once been compared to the character. In a January 2008 video mashup produced by Slate, campaign footage of Clinton was combined with clips from Election to draw a comparison between Clinton's and Tracy's feelings about the inferiority of their opponents. The video was widely circulated and praised.|$|E
5|$|Although Hall's author's note disclaims any <b>real-world</b> {{basis for}} the {{ambulance}} unit that Stephen joins, she drew heavily on the wartime experiences of her friend Toupie Lowther, co-commander of the only women's unit {{to serve on the}} front in France. Lowther, like Stephen, came from an aristocratic family, adopted a masculine style of dress, and was an accomplished fencer, tennis player, motorist and jujitsu enthusiast. In later years she said the character of Stephen was based on her, which may have been partly true.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2013, the Geisel School of Medicine claims 4,891 living {{graduates}} {{active in}} medicine around the world. Geisel cites its required clerkships {{as a mechanism}} for allowing students to make connections and obtain <b>real-world</b> experience. Fourth-year students are prepared for residency with counseling classes; recent graduates have most commonly taken their residencies at Geisel itself, Harvard Medical School, Tufts University School of Medicine, and Brown Medical School.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited is a 1995 {{aerobatic}} flight simulator video game developed {{and published by}} Looking Glass Technologies. It allows players to pilot reproductions of <b>real-world</b> aircraft and to perform aerobatic maneuvers. They may fly freely, race through floating rings against a timer or take lessons from a virtual flight instructor. The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns to maneuvers such as the tailslide, Lomcevak and Immelmann turn.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the novels}} in Pratchett's Discworld series parody <b>real-world</b> {{subjects}} such as film making, newspaper publishing, rock and roll music, religion, philosophy, Ancient Greece, Egyptian history, the Gulf War, Australia, university politics, trade unions, and the financial world. Pratchett also included further parody as a feature within the stories, including such subjects as Ingmar Bergman films, numerous fiction, science fiction, and fantasy characters, and various bureaucratic and ruling systems.|$|E
5|$|The clique problem {{arises in}} the {{following}} <b>real-world</b> setting. Consider a social network, where the graph's vertices represent people, and the graph's edges represent mutual acquaintance. Then a clique represents a subset of people who all know each other, and algorithms for finding cliques {{can be used to}} discover these groups of mutual friends. Along with its applications in social networks, the clique problem also has many applications in bioinformatics and computational chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} designed {{as part of}} the Dizzy series, with a working title of Movieland Dizzy, but the creators of Dizzy disagreed with the <b>real-world</b> direction the game had taken, despite it being 90% complete. The developers, Big Red Software, were given 12 weeks to create a new game with a different character. Seymour was adapted from Dizzy, with a new shape and fingers to differentiate the two.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the brain}} and a person's {{intelligence}} are not strongly related. Studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations (averaging around 0.3 to 0.4) between brain volume and IQ. The most consistent associations are observed within the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the hippocampi, and the cerebellum, but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in IQ, which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and <b>real-world</b> performance.|$|E
5|$|While the game's cutscenes are {{animated}} with 3D graphics, {{the team}} recorded live-action videos {{to introduce the}} <b>real-world</b> skateboarding teams, so that players could better understand each team before selecting one to join. Neversoft interviewed professional skaters about their experiences of becoming known in the skateboarding world, then compiled elements of these stories into the game's script. Every skater who appears in the plot helped to craft their own scenes and voiced their own character.|$|E
25|$|Game {{publishers}} usually {{prohibit the}} exchange of <b>real-world</b> money for virtual goods, but others actively promote the idea of linking (and directly profiting from) an exchange. In Second Life and Entropia Universe, the virtual economy and the <b>real-world</b> economy are directly linked. This means that real money can be deposited for game money and vice versa. <b>Real-world</b> items have also been sold for game money in Entropia, and some players of Second Life have generated revenues in excess of $100,000.|$|E

25|$|Video {{games have}} similar requirements, with some crucial differences. While {{physical}} simulation needs to simulate <b>real-world</b> physics as precisely as possible, video games need to simulate <b>real-world</b> physics in an acceptable way, {{in real time}} and robustly. Compromises are allowed, {{so long as the}} resulting simulation is satisfying to the game players.|$|E

25|$|Commentators have {{attempted}} to estimate the value of Eve Online entities in <b>real-world</b> currency based on the current value of PLEX. One such conversion valued a fleet-ready titan (the most powerful ship in the game) at US$7,600, though estimates vary. Generally, no player expends such amounts of <b>real-world</b> currency to acquire such sums of in-game wealth, opting instead to do activities in-game that net high amounts of profit.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the tracks, the main {{emphasis}} is on <b>real-world</b> permanent circuits which make up the majority of the courses in the game. These range from classics, such as Spa-Francorchamps, Brands Hatch, Mount Panorama and Indianapolis, to more modern facilities, like the Circuit of the Americas, Sepang, the Red Bull Ring and the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi. City locations with fictionally lined, but mostly <b>real-world</b> streets of San Francisco, Paris, Dubai etc., and - as DLCs - fictional point-to-point tracks in authentic settings complete the picture. In all, players are able to race on 15 <b>real-world</b> permanent circuits, 2 fictional permanent circuits, 7 street circuits, and 4 point-to-point tracks, including additional content, for a total of 28 locations with over 130 configurations.|$|E
