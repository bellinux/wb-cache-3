25|$|Although most {{cars were}} bought {{from the usual}} {{engineering}} companies, the larger depots carried out significant rebuilding work and Milehouse is even credited with building new cars. The first was car 91 in 1920, which had a completely new body built on the truck from Devonport car 22. Similar work was carried out on car 24 which emerged as a new number 93 in 1922. A third new car emerged the same year and was given the number 112. Some engineering cars were also built, or rebuilt, at the various depots. Most notable being a <b>rail</b> <b>grinder</b> built at Crompton depot in 1915, and car 42 which was converted to a welding car in 1924.|$|E

2500|$|Entering operation, the {{problems}} continued. The braking system {{had been designed}} to be fully automated, but was now being operated by manual control, and the brakes were being over-applied. This led to problems with the wheels being rubbed flat in spots when the brakes were applied too strongly, producing buzzing noises when running at speed. Since the vehicles were brand-new, the TTC {{did not have a}} machine capable of grinding the small-diameter wheels, and one had to be purchased for $1.5 million. Another $250,000 was needed for a <b>rail</b> <b>grinder</b> to remove [...] "totally unexpected rail corrugations". Additionally, the cars were found to be incapable of turning the short radius 18m turning loop {{at one end of the}} line, in spite of UTDC's claims it could, which was going to have to be re-built at a cost of about $6 million. Instead, this portion of the track was simply abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Rail {{grinding}} {{is used by}} {{rail infrastructure}} owners to remove rail corrugations, rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks and for re-profiling the rail. In North America, the standard practice is Preventive and Preventive-Gradual grinding strategy which uses high production <b>rail</b> <b>grinders</b> to complete a single pass on most track locations at high grinding speed. These practices have been proven in field tests {{to be the most}} cost effective grinding strategies. To plan rail grinding on Queensland Rail a Rail Inspection Vehicle (RIV) is used to gather data of rail profiles and rail surface photos. This inspection technology generates a Grinding Quality Index. This paper proposes the standards utilised in accepted best practices [13] as a standard for Australian railways and their challenges and drawbacks to implementation as well as a better method of addressing RCF defects. Grinding Quality Index (GQI) is estimated by comparing the measured rail profile with the target rail profile template for the area of material to be removed for a particular grinding pass. Based on the rail surface photos taken by the RIV, the operator decides the additional depth of cut and number of passes based on experience with that track. GQI is currently estimated based on profiles and do not consider RCF. Current GQI does not show any relationship with the RCF cracks and can be very good from a profile perspective, but still can have RCF cracks on the surface. Close monitoring of pre and post grind rail profiles for compliance and inclusion of RCF factor has been proposed as an enhancement to the current GQI for effective assurance on the quality of grinding. This paper is on an appropriate index covering both the rail profiles and RCF control for rail grinding...|$|R

50|$|A railgrinder (or <b>rail</b> <b>grinder)</b> is a {{maintenance}} of way vehicle or train used {{to restore the}} profile and remove irregularities from worn rail track to extend its life and to improve the ride of trains using the track. Rail grinders were developed to increase the lifespan of the tracks being serviced for rail corrugation. Rail grinding {{is a process that}} is done to stop the deformation due to use and friction on railroad tracks by removing deformations and corrosion. Railroad tracks that experience continual use are more likely to experience corrugation and overall wear. Rail grinders are used to grind the tracks when rail corrugation is present, or before corrugation begins to form on the tracks. Major freight train tracks use <b>rail</b> <b>grinder</b> to maintenance based the interval of tonnage rather than time. Transit systems and subways in major cities continue to use scheduled rail grinding processes to combat the corrugation common to heavily used tracks. Rail-grinding equipment may be mounted on a single self-propelled vehicle or on a dedicated rail-grinding train which, when used on an extensive network, may include crew quarters. The grinding wheels, of which there may be more than 100, are set at controlled angles to restore the track to its correct profile.|$|E
50|$|The {{grinding}} {{quality index}} (GQI) is a software-based template {{used to measure}} the profile of a rail. This allows the desired rail profile to be compared to the actual rail profile. GQI software makes use of laser-based hardware mounted to the front and rear of the <b>rail</b> <b>grinder.</b> The use of laser-based hardware on maintenance of way vehicles such as rail grinders allow workers and contractors take precise measurements of the rail profile before and after grinding. The GQI is rated from 0 (low priority) to 100 (high priority). Grinding Quality Software is able to record and document measurements independently and provide a GQI rating for each rail on the track for before and after each pass on the grinder. The advantage of using GQI software is the ability to produce post-grinding reports for later usage by planners to help further prioritize and monitor grinding profiles in the future. GQI reports also provide analysis on the consistency of profiling to determine if grinding operations are consistently improving or deteriorating the rail profile. The usage of GQI software also provides the ability to produce accurate assessments of <b>rail</b> <b>grinder</b> effectiveness in real-time which allows for work to be prioritized more efficiently and be executed in a timely manner.|$|E

50|$|Instead of the {{mechanics}} of the first series, the second series used a direct current controller, which was operated via a set point transmitter. It enabled acceleration and deceleration to take place without jerking. In comparison to the first series, which had scissor pantographs, the second series used single-armed pantographs.Tram 205 is now used as an historic motor coach, tram 207 was scrapped in 2007 and trams 208 and 209 were sold to Ulm's tram network, where they were merged to form number 17 and used as a bi-directional <b>rail</b> <b>grinder.</b> From 2012, trams 206 and 210-214 were used full-time due to the refurbisment of the GT8Zs. Previously, they were only used during peak hours and for transporting spectators to SC Freiburg home matches. Tram 206, which had already been marketed for sale, was now reactivated. In addition, they were all equipped with LED indicators. They are the only trams, alongside the Combinos, to have fitted LED indicators. The remaining trams were still being used until the completion of the GT8Z refurbishment and the delivery of the new Urbos in 2017.|$|E
