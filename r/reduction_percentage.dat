A New York Times analysis concludes that the plan [...] "would reduce the effective income tax rate on filers making $10 million or more per year to approximately 21 percent, down from 26 percent in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available." [...] A Tax Foundation analysis determined that the greatest percent increases in after-tax income under Bush's tax plan would go to the top 1% of U.S. earners, those earning more than around $406,000; such filers [...] "would see their after-tax incomes increase on average by 11.6% ... the biggest change for any income group." [...] According to Citizens for Tax Justice, more than half of Bush's tax cuts (52.9%) would accrue to the wealthiest 1%, while the poorest 20% of wage earners would receive less than a 3% tax cut. The plan would eliminate federal income taxes for families making $38,600 or less annually and would reduce federal taxes by a third for an additional 42 million families.|$|E

In the pipeline system, surfactant solutions that caused drag reduction are capable in lowering the pumping power.

This study aimed to assess the mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP), mean diastolic blood pressure (MDBP), and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) <b>reduction</b> <b>percentages</b> in patients with irreversible pulpitis teeth treated by NSRCT. Materials and methods: We prospectively recruited 111 patients {{with a total of}} 138 irreversible pulpitis teeth. All patients underwent two NSRCT sessions. The first NSRCT session involved mainly the removal of vital pulp tissue with the direct stimulation of the dental branches of the trigeminal nerve, and the second NSRCT session included the root canal debridement and enlargement with minimal disturbance to the dental nerves. The blood pressure of each patient was recorded before and during both NSRCT sessions. Results: There were significantly higher <b>reduction</b> <b>percentages</b> of MSBP, MDBP, and MABP in the first NSRCT session than in the second NSRCT session for all treated patients (all the P-values <  0. 001).

All in all, this reduction in total runoff could prevent not only stream bank from getting eroded only but also contributes to restoring pre-development hydrology which has {{an important role in}} maintaining the aquatic life and restoring the ecological system. In addition, maintaining pre-development hydrology throughout the peak flow reduction encourages water storage and infiltration, which in turn reduces urban flooding {{and at the same time}} increases recharging local groundwater aquifers and streams.

For example, the Q max for reduction COD at 9 th day was 0.094  mg per growth rate (4236.1  cell min− 1), and increased to 0.56  mg per growth rate (1736.1  cell min− 1).
