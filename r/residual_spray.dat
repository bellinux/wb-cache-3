Two rounds of indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spray,</b> with synthetic pyrethroid, are given in highly malaria endemic areas. It aims to prevent transmission of malaria by adult vector mosquitoes. Aims : To {{assess the impact of}} indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spray</b> in the highly malaria-endemic villages of Kalol taluka in Gandhinagar district. Design : High risk population for malaria, based on last three-year malaria situation. Setting: Malaria endemic rural areas in Gandhinagar district where indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spray</b> was undertaken with synthetic pyrethroid in 2006 and 2007. Study Variables: Exploratory - Rural areas; Outcome - coverage, acceptance. Analysis: Percentage and proportions.

Continuation of this strategy in the same villages further brought down the annual parasitic incidence to 1. 5 in 2007.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAlthough many malaria control {{programmes}} in sub-Saharan Africa use indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spraying</b> with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), {{the two studies}} assessing {{the benefit of the}} combination of these two interventions gave conflicting results. We aimed to assess whether the addition of indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spraying</b> to LLINs provided a significantly different level of protection against clinical malaria in children or against house entry by vector mosquitoes. MethodsIn this two-arm cluster, randomised, controlled efficacy trial we randomly allocated clusters of Gambian villages using a computerised algorithm to LLINs alone (n= 35) or indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spraying</b> with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane plus LLINs (n= 35). In each cluster, 65 – 213 children, aged 6 months to 14 years, were surveyed {{at the start of the}} 2010 transmission season and followed in 2010 and 2011 by passive case detection for clinical malaria. Exposure to parasite transmission was assessed by collection of vector mosquitoes with both light and exit traps indoors. Primary endpoints were the incidence of clinical malaria assessed by passive case detection and number of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes collected per light trap per night. Intervention teams had no role in data collection and the data collection teams were not informed of the spray status of villages. The trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN 01738840. FindingsLLIN coverage in 2011 was 3510 (93 %) of 3777 children in the indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spraying</b> plus LLIN group and 3622 (95 · 5 %) of 3791 in the LLIN group. In 2010, 7845 children were enrolled, 7829 completed passive case detection, and 7697 (98 %) had complete clinical and covariate data. In 2011, 7009 children remained in the study, 648 more were enrolled, 7657 completed passive case detection, and 7545 (98 · 5 %) had complete data. Indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spraying</b> coverage per cluster was more than 80 % for both years in the indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spraying</b> plus LLIN group. Incidence of clinical malaria was 0 · 047 per child-month at risk in the LLIN group and 0 · 044 per child-month at risk in the indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spraying</b> plus LLIN group in 2010, and 0 · 032 per child-month at risk in the LLIN group and 0 · 034 per child-month at risk in the indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spraying</b> plus LLIN group in 2011. The incident rate ratio was 1 · 08 (95 % CI 0 · 80 – 1 · 46) controlling for confounders and cluster by mixed-effect negative binomial regression on all malaria attacks for both years. No significant difference was recorded in the density of vector mosquitoes caught in light traps in houses over the two transmission seasons; the mean number of A gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes per trap per night was 6 · 7 (4 · 0 – 10 · 1) in the LLIN group and 4 · 5 (2 · 4 – 7 · 4) in the indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spraying</b> plus LLIN group (p= 0 · 281 in the random-effects linear regression model).

Although bromophos appeared to be effective for at least five months after spraying in the Lagos area, the desired control was obtained for only one month in the Kaduna area; these differences appear to be due to differences in environmental conditions and to the ecology of Anopheles gambiae. Schering 34615 was also effective for up to five months in Lagos and was definitely superior to bromophos. Cheesecloth impregnated with Bayer 39007 gave good control of mosquitos for two and for three months in Kaduna and Lagos, respectively, but because the walls of the treated huts were only partly covered, some mosquitos avoided contact with the cloth. It is suggested that, because of the reduced toxic hazards, cheesecloth treatments may be feasible with potentially effective insecticides that are too toxic to spray...|$|E

METHODS: This community based cross-sectional study was undertaken from January 2010 to December 2012 in Baihar and Birsa Community Health Centres of district Balaghat for screening malaria cases. Entomological surveillance included indoor resting collections, pyrethrum spray catches and light trap catches. Anophelines were assayed by ELISA for detection of Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein. FINDINGS: Plasmodium falciparum infection accounted for > 80 % of all infections. P. vivax 16. 5 %, P. malariae 0. 75 % and remaining were mixed infections of P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae. More than, 30 % infections were found in infants under 6 months of age. Overall, an increasing trend in malaria positivity was observed from 2010 to 2012 (chi-square for trend  =  663. 55; P< 0. 0001). Twenty five Anopheles culicifacies (sibling species C, D and E) were positive for circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum (44 %) and P. vivax (56 %). Additionally, 2 An. fluviatilis, were found positive for P. falciparum and 1 for P. vivax (sibling species S and T). An. fluviatilis sibling species T was found as vector in forest villages {{for the first time in}} India. CONCLUSION: These results showed that the study villages are experiencing almost perennial malaria transmission inspite of indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spray</b> and insecticide treated nets. Therefore, there is a need for new indoor residual insecticides which has longer residual life or complete coverage of population with long lasting insecticide treated nets or both indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spray</b> and long lasting bed nets for effective vector control.

Nine villages in Mae Hong Son province were selected for the present study (three villages for control and three villages each for insecticide spray). The <b>residual</b> <b>spray</b> of Bifenthrin (25 mg/m 2) showed greater adulticiding effects on An. minimus s. l. population than Deltamethrin (20 mg/m 2). In Bifenthrin treated villages, a clear decrease in biting density of An. minimus s. l. was found in human bait collection as well as animal bait collection after the insecticide spray. In all of the three villages, the average density after insecticide spray was significantly lower than that observed before the spray. The effects of Deltamethrin on An. minimus s. l. density was found only in one village out of the three treated villages. A significant decrease in parous rate after insecticide spray was found in all the villages sprayed with Bifenthrin, whereas no significant changes were observed in control villages. The average parous rate in the villages treated with Deltamethrin became significantly higher after the insecticide spray.

Methods: Indoor <b>residual</b> <b>spray</b> using lambda-cyhalothrin insecticide was carried out during the last week of April 2005 in 1, 100 targeted houses, located in the valley bottom areas of Iguhu village, Kakamega district of western Kenya.
