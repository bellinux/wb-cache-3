50|$|Cobb {{appeared}} {{in only one}} major league game, an 8-4 loss to the Cleveland Indians on April 25, 1918. Cobb was a pinch hitter for pitcher Rudy Kallio {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning, and did not appear in the field. A discrepancy in baseball records exists; according to his career record, Cobb drew a base on balls in his only major league plate appearance to compile a 1.000 career on-base percentage. However, the contemporary published box score for the one major league game Cobb played shows him going 0-for-1, and the more recently compiled Baseball <b>Reference</b> <b>box</b> score shows Cobb striking out in his one at-bat.|$|E
40|$|Hitherto, {{methods for}} visual {{assessment}} of colour appearance {{have not been}} developed {{for use in the}} study of rooms. We seek a practical method that allows one or two observers to characterize a room by identifying the perceived colours. Verbal descriptions are necessary, but lack precision. A magnitude estimation method may enable a more precise location in colour space. However, the need of a group of well-trained observers makes it impractical for room studies. A method involving matches between reference colour samples and the perceived room colours would be ideal. But, reference colour samples require a standard illumination; otherwise, the sample changes colour due to different room light. Hence, a method involving a colour <b>reference</b> <b>box</b> was developed. The colour <b>reference</b> <b>box</b> with its standard source of illumination provides a reference situation, where colour samples can be visually compared with the colours of the room. The study presented is an evaluation of this colour <b>reference</b> <b>box.</b> The crucial problem is that the same color sample in the box is perceived differently, as the observer adapts to various lighting conditions. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate if these different perceptions of the samples could be described and controlled. In the study, 18 observers were asked to visually assess the hue of 15 – 66 samples, and mark its place in the NCS hue circle. The assessment of the samples was made in two different room lights: incandescent light and simulated daylight. The result of the study showed a clear tendency for the samples, perceived in the box, to shift colour in simulated daylight compared to incandescent light. It was concluded that the problem with the observer's adaptation to the room light can be described and controlled, although complementary studies are needed to quantify the adaptation effect with more accuracy, and to investigate differences in nuance. Thus, it seems that the colour <b>reference</b> <b>box</b> can be used to visually evaluate and describe the differences in colour appearance in different rooms. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|The main {{problems}} {{dealt with}} in this thesis are (1) how colours can appear in rooms due to various colour combinations and lighting conditions, and (2) how we can identify and compare colour appearance in rooms. One aim is to demonstrate and discuss the complex problem of how certain conditions in a room affect colour appearance, and to give examples and describe the co-operation between some of the affecting factors in experimental rooms. Another aim is to develop and evaluate methods for studying colours in rooms, methods that give us reliable visual identifications of perceived colour and allow comparisons between different rooms. Through an architectural perspective, tailored methods and specially developed concepts, the thesis presents a way to conceptualise and treat the complex subject of colour in enclosed spaces. The thesis work includes a literature survey and empirical studies. Most of the latter were made in experimental rooms in full and small scale, which were based on studies of actual interiors and preliminary model room studies. The literature survey mapped out the knowledge field, and the empirical studies worked out methods, tools and concepts {{for the study of}} colour appearance in rooms. Preliminary attempts are made to describe the elasticity in colour appearance of certain inherent colours under varying conditions in rooms. The phenomenon of reflections has been systematically studied, and discussed in relation to simultaneous contrast. The developed concepts of identity colour and colour variations have proved to be helpful tools for analysing colour appearance. The Visual Evaluation method of Liljefors and Ejhed was adjusted to involve visual assessments of the perceived colours. The colour <b>reference</b> <b>box</b> developed during the project is taken to solve a serious methodological problem, especially for comparisons between equally painted, but differently illuminated, rooms. The difficult problem of the adaptation effect was specially dealt with - that is, the colour sample in the colour <b>reference</b> <b>box</b> is perceived differently as the observer adapts to various lighting conditions. While complementary studies are needed, it was concluded that the adaptation effect for the hue is possible to map out and control...|$|E

For each image, to extract a reliable bounding box as this root filter estimate, we explore the generic objectness measurement to obtain a reference window based on the most salient region, and select a small set of candidate windows by adaptive thresholding and greedy Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). The initial root filter estimate is decided by optimizing the score of overlap between the <b>reference</b> <b>box</b> and candidate boxes, {{as well as their}} corresponding objectness score. Then the derived window is treated as a positive training window for DPM training. Finally, we design a flexible enlarging-and shrinking post-processing procedure to modify the output of DPM, which can effectively fit to the aspect ratio of the object and further improve the final accuracy.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{one and the same}} {{interior}} colouring will appear different in rooms with windows facing north or facing south, but it is not known how natural daylight from these two compass points affects perceived colour {{and the ways in which}} colour is experienced. The objective is to describe the perceived colours to be expected in rooms with sunlight and diffused light, and thus develop a tool for colour design. Two empirical investigations provide the basis for six attached papers. The model is exploratory with a qualitative character. One hundred and ninety-one studies were carried out with 79 observers in full-scale rooms, with double-glazed transparent room windows facing north or south. The NCS colour sample collection and colour terminology were used, with three yellow, red, blue and green hues in two nuances: whitish 1010 and more chromatic 1030. The walls were painted in a total of 23 selected inherent colours with each colour observed in up to 10 studies. Colour matching was achieved using a colour <b>reference</b> <b>box</b> and results were analysed with the aid of the terms inherent colour and identity colour. The colour <b>reference</b> <b>box</b> was tested in a separate study to investigate any methodological problems. Room character was described using semantic differentials, and data was processed using the SPSS statistics program. Verbal description using own words was applied in a descriptive and reflecting method to find sensory differences and precise, yet ordinary descriptions. Colour differences between rooms were assessed using verbal description of hue and nuance, and a supplementary method with specified colour samples. Emotional impressions of colour and rooms were assessed using a method describing primary emotions and the results were compared with results from another study using small colour samples. The colouring that enhanced or neutralised room light situation was compared as regards emotional impression and thereafter compared with results from another study. Daylight from the different compass points caused a clear shift in hue and nuance. The perceived colour was consistently more chromatic and more blackish than the inherent colour used. Nuance 1010 shifted more in chromaticness than nuance, while 1030 instead increased most in chromaticness. Even minor colour differences resulted in major differences in colour experience. The north-facing room in yellowish colours shifted towards reduced yellowishness in both hue and chromaticness. Indications were that north-facing rooms in reddish blue become more reddish than south-facing rooms. QC 2010071...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} {{potential}} flow calculation model which includes computation of flow around aircraft bodies (fuselage, engines) and a boundary layer method which calculates the viscous effects over the aircraft wings. The models developed will be merged with an already existing panel program developed by Saab, Linköping, Sweden. Different methods have been studied but the basis of this work has been to develop a model using a panel method which can provide results from a simple geometry description, with short calculation time and hence be used in early design phases. In this thesis Matlab has been used as programming language, ensure that future development and maintenance is possible. The body model uses a panel method where the flow domain is divided into an inner and an outer part where the outer problem uses a three dimensional panel description while the inner problem performs two dimensional calculations. The inner and outer problems are separated by an arbitrarily shaped <b>reference</b> <b>box.</b> The inner area is divided into a number of cross sections which are described by line segments. With the help of these the two dimensional cross flow is obtained. This result is connected to the outer part through boundary conditions and the entire three dimensional flow domain can be determined. The resulting body program is limited to aircraft bodies with a slenderness ratio less than 1 / 5. Higher values violate the model assumption. The number of cross sections needed to describe a body of one unit length is between 80 - 150 and the number of line segments needed for one cross sections is 20 for the inner boundary and 40 line segments for the outer. This configuration gives results with acceptable accuracy within a computation time less than 15 seconds/body. The viscous effects around the aircraft wings are modelled with a two dimensional boundary layer model where the boundary layer displacement thickness over the wing profile is calculated with two different methods depending on if the flow in the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent. The computed displacement thickness is then added to the wing profile geometry and new pressure distributions are computed on the modified geometry. The computed pressure distributions including the viscous effects show better agreement with results from experimental wind tunnel tests than the inviscid without boundary layer contribution. Separation is not modelled and neither are the large effects this has on the pressure distribution. The model gives usable results up to 15 - 20 degrees angle of attack; at higher angles the separated regions are so large that the model is not valid anyway.

40|$|Establishing proper {{drainage}} system {{has become a}} major challenge especially in the urban areas. Drainage systems consist of canal network and drainage structures such as culverts. Once the {{drainage system}} is established, it can be expanded to identify the discharge at the outlet of a watershed or in flood plains for a given precipitation. Therefore identification of drainage network is a primary requirement for drainage design. Drainage network identification through engineering survey is a time consuming and costly effort. Some of the engineering applications related to drainage network such as culvert design, flood plain analysis, do not need very high accuracy. The drainage network identification can be done using less time-consuming computer technology, if the generated accuracy is satisfactory for engineering applications. Therefore this research is concentrated on the aspects related streamline generation and accuracy assessment. The main objectives of this study are, - Generation of streamline network - Accuracy comparison of generated streamline - Identifying the parameters affecting the accuracy - Accuracy comparison of observed culvert location The study is carried out in three watersheds in the Greater Colombo region. The Torrington watershed is selected as the primary watershed for the study and the watershed area is around 450 ha. The Attidiya and Katubedda watersheds areas are found as 190 ha and 250 ha respectively. The study requires data in digital format. Digital data extraction is carried out in three processes. Part of digital data such as existing stream network is extracted from paper maps, through scanning and geo referencing. Also digital base map features of building, roads, contours and spot heights are extracted from the database of National Water Supply & Drainage Board (NWSDB). Rest of the digital data such as culvert locations are extracted using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Data processing and analysis component is carried out using the extracted digital source data. Streamlines are generated from DEM (Digital Elevation Model) by varying the resolution from 2 m, 5 m, 10 m, 20 m and 50 m. While generating streamlines on GIS, it is necessary to provide a threshold value. This threshold value is selected {{in a way that the}} level of branching off of generated and extracted streamlines at the outlet of watershed are similar. Accuracy assessment is carried out with the newly established raster based accuracy assessment method. Other than that a <b>reference</b> <b>box</b> analysis is carried out to obtain a general impression of the possible streamline pattern comes under a particular Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value range. Accuracy variation with the change of DEM resolution at particular location and the accuracy variation along the streamline with the watershed parameters such as stream order, stream slope, surface slope, building density and stream sinuosity are observed. It is found that stream order and surface slope has a relationship with streamline accuracy. In the same way culvert location accuracies are identified by varying the resolution. Result and discussion sections focus on the key results of data processing and analysis. It is discussed that raster based accuracy assessment is more representative when compared with vector based methods. Once the accuracies are assessed, the average accuracy variation (RMSE) with respect to different watersheds is discussed. Also accuracy variation with the resolution and the accuracy variation along the streamline with the affecting factors of stream order and surface slope are discussed. The possible reasons for unexceptional variation of streamline from the expected patters are analyzed. It is also discussed about establishing a representative per cell threshold value for urban watersheds. Once that is established it is possible to identify the threshold value should be given for newly selected watersheds. Finally accuracy variations of culvert locations with respect to the resolution are also discussed in depth. It was found that raster based accuracy assessment methodology is more realistic. Average Root Mean Square Error value (RMSE) of streamline is increased with the surface flatness of the watershed. Also in general RMSE value of generated streamline is reduced when cell size become finer. The per cell threshold value is determined as 0. 016. It can be utilized to generate streamline network having same stream order of actual streamline at the outlet. It is shown that accuracy of generated streamline improves with the increment of stream order and surface slope. The deviation of observed culvert locations from the actual culvert positions varies with the resolution of DEM. Also streamline generation while incorporating building did not significantly improve the accuracy showing that there is a need for better topographic information.

40|$|A {{specific}} {{disruption in}} the ability to automatically disengage attention from its previous focus has been hypothesized to account for the extinction phenomenon often observed in the unilateral spatial neglect syndrome. Recent literature, however, also brings out the role played in neglect by an imbalance in the attentional orienting systems, resulting in an early shift of attention towards the side of space ipsilateral to the brain lesion. In the present study we hypothesized that this attentional bias in orienting of attention might be demonstrated in a paradigm of simple reaction time to lateralized visual stimuli by contrasting the presence vs the absence on the computer screen of the square boxes used to facilitate position expectancy. A main prediction was made that patients with neglect would show a significant increase in reaction time to contralateral visual stimuli in the presence of bilateral <b>reference</b> <b>boxes</b> as compared to conditions in which no boxes were displayed.
