40|$|Introduction. A 306 mm thick premodule of {{the tile}} {{calorimeter}} should be appropriately rigid, what means, {{when it is}} transported or it changes the position after <b>rotating,</b> <b>lifting,</b> or laying it down any permanent deformation cannot occur. During such technological position changings the premodule can be supported or suspended from some points, lines, or surfaces. External loadings to which this premodule is subjected are those coming from its weight and, in addition, from accelerations when lifting or laying it down on a supporting structure. Let us assume that {{the weight of the}} 306 mm thick premodule is about W s = 9 000 N. Moreover, we assume that during lifting or laying it down absolute values of accelerations are not bigger than 1 = 3 g (g - the acceleration due to gravity). For this reason, the additional dynamic load should not reach a value of...|$|R

40|$|The {{aerodynamics}} {{analysis of}} rotor blade helicopter in forward flight {{by using a}} non uniform inflow models are presented. This work {{can be considered as}} a continuation from the previous work as described in the Ref. 1. Here the linear inflow model would be used as the basic idea in solving the aerodynamic problems oppose with the Ref. 1 which used a uniform inflow model. Physical flow phenomena around a rotor blade helicopter had been recognized very complicated. Rotor blade behaves like a finite wing. The presence of lift upon a finite wing would be followed by wake vortex sheet this vortex sheet promotes induced velocity along span wise non uniformly. Only certain wing plan form namely elliptic wing plan form could generate uniform induced velocity along span wise. For an arbitrary wing plan form the induced velocities were normally non uniform. The shape of wake vortex sheet released from a finite wing relatively simple, the vortex sheet can be considered as a plane of an infinitesimal thickness starting from the trailing edge line goes down in parallel to the free stream flow. In the case of the rotor helicopter, the rotor blade becomes a <b>rotating</b> <b>lifting</b> surface. As result the shape of wake vortex sheet becomes more complex than a fixed finite wing. Hence the non uniformity of the induce velocity become apparent. ...|$|R

5000|$|Small freezer-unit {{machines}} sit {{inside the}} freezer (or the freezer {{part of the}} refrigerator) and operate similar to a food processor in slow-motion. Every few seconds, the paddles stir the mixture to prevent formation of large ice crystals.

A disadvantage is that the freezer door has to be closed over the flat cord, which is plugged into the nearest power outlet. However, some modern refrigerators have a built-in ice-cream maker as an accessory or a specialized electrical outlet for freezer-unit machines. It is not necessary to pre-freeze this type of ice cream maker. However, some people feel that this type of machine produces a lower-quality ice cream because of its slow-motion method.

Two different conditions including stationary and rotating wheels in CRH 3 complex train were calculated, running 380 km/h in the open air. Furthermore, analyses on underbody velocity field, pressure coefficient on bogie sections, wake and leeward vortex structure affected by rotating wheels are performed. The comparison shows that drag coefficient decreases about 1 % when wheels rotating. In the <b>rotating</b> condition, the <b>lift</b> forces of train bodies are reduced, especially the bogie sections. The velocity around the tail car's bogies increases 13 - 20 m/s due to the wheel rotation effects, and the vortex cores of wake get closer...|$|R
