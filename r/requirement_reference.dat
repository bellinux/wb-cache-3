40|$|Introduction: Surgery to {{the upper}} {{gastrointestinal}} region of the gut results in symptoms greatly impacting on dietary intake, and a diet high in energy and protein is encouraged. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the food and nutrient intakes of people having had major upper gastrointestinal surgery, and compare them to current food and nutrient recommendations. Materials and Methods: People having had major upper gastrointestinal rouxeny surgery greater than 6 months ago were recruited. Each person completed a three day food diary and food intakes were compared to the Healthy Food Guide for Australians. Macro and micro-nutrient intakes were compared to the Estimated Average <b>Requirement</b> <b>reference</b> values for Australia and New Zealand. Results: Thirty people were recruited and analysis of dietary intakes indicated inadequate serves of cereals, vegetables, fruit and dairy products compared to recommendations, resulting in below Estimated Average Requirements for many vitamins and minerals. Severely malnourished people, and those having had total gastrectomy surgery, were at greatest risk of not meeting macro and micro-nutrient recommendations. Conclusions: People having had major upper gastrointestinal surgery are encouraged to have a diet high in energy and protein. However this advice seems to be followed at the expense of other food groups, leading to low intakes of many micronutrients. Careful monitoring of dietary intakes and signs of nutrient deficiencies should be included as part of routine follow-up for this group of people. Further research is required to determine whether poor dietary intakes result in clinical deficiencies...|$|E
40|$|In {{paediatric}} practice, mean {{reference energy}} requirements for groups {{are often used}} to predict individual infant energy requirements. References from the FAO/WHO/United Nations University are based on infants not fed according to the current infant feeding recommendations. The objective {{of the present study}} was to measure total energy expenditure (TEE) and determine energy requirements using criterion methods, and validate the use of TEE prediction equation and mean energy requirement references for predicting individual TEE and energy requirements, respectively, in infants who were exclusively breast-fed (EBF) to 6 months of age. EBF infants were included from Greater Glasgow for measurements at 3 · 5 (n 36) and 6 (n 33) months of age. TEE was measured using doubly labelled water and energy requirements were determined using the factorial approach. TEE and energy requirements were also predicted using equations based on body weight. Relationships between criterion methods and predictions were assessed using correlations. Paired t tests and Bland–Altman plots were used to assess agreement. At the population level, predicted and measured TEE were similar. The energy <b>requirement</b> <b>reference</b> significantly underestimated energy requirements by 7 · 2 % at 3 · 5 months at the population level, but there was no bias at 6 months. Errors at individual levels were large and energy requirements were underestimated to a larger extent for infants with higher energy requirements. This indicates that references presently used in clinical practice to estimate energy requirements may not fully account for the different growth pattern of EBF infants. More studies in infants EBF to 6 months of age are needed to understand how growth of EBF infants influences energy requirements...|$|E
40|$|Components {{of daily}} energy expenditureDefinitions of energy requirementThe basic {{principle}} behind the formulation of energy <b>requirement</b> <b>reference</b> values is energy balance, i. e. the physiological state in which daily energy intake equals energy expenditure and both body weight and energy content (defined by body composition) are constant. For some people, especially those who are over- or underweight, the recommended energy intake might be lower or higher than energy expenditure for a prescribed time period, but long-term energy balance is the ultimate goal even in treatment of undernourishment and obesity. Therefore, the NNR defines the energy requirement in adults as “the energy intake needed to cover energy expenditure in individuals with body weight, body composition and physical activity compatible with good health. In addition, energy requirement {{is affected by the}} energy needed for growth in children, for deposition of tissues during pregnancy and for milk production during lactation” (1). However, because body energy stores are very large (at least 30 times the daily energy energy expenditure, {{there is no need for}} energy intake and energy expenditure to be equal over short periods of around 1 to 4 days (2). The daily energy expenditure can be divided into the following components:•Basal (or resting) energy expenditure (BEE or REE) •Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) •Energy expenditure caused by physical activityEnergy expenditure is measured in kJ (1000 kJ = 1 MJ) per time unit (usually MJ/d). One kilojoule equals 0. 24 kcal (or 1 kcal = 4. 184 kJ), a unit that is still often used in the literature. On average, daily energy expenditure is higher in men than in women but the difference disappears after adjustment for the difference in body size and body composition between the sexes. Very cold or hot environments,genetic differences, hormonal status (e. g. serum concentrations ofthyroid and growth hormones), sympathetic nerve activity, psychologicalstate, pharmacological agents, and several disease states have been shownto increase or decrease energy expenditure, mainly by affecting REE (3, 4) ...|$|E

30|$|RTM {{is based}} on the exact wave {{equation}} rather than its approximation [2]; the time extrapolation is used instead of the depth extrapolation, so it has a good precision. It is not limited by the inclination of the underground structure and the change of the lateral velocity of the medium, and even can the image of the rotary wave [3 – 6]. When the finite difference method is performed for RTM imaging, the selection of the difference order directly affects the imaging precision and the amount of calculation [7 – 9], and the higher the differential order, the more the imaging is accurate, but the amount of RTM is multiplied by the forward and reverse recursion of the wave field [10, 11]. It makes the computer time-consuming, and the storage demand of the full wave field is large. It seriously restricts RTM in the field. In order to solve the above problems, the predecessors have researched related topics. Reference [12] proposes graphics processing unit (GPU) parallel strategy is used to improve the computing efficiency for RTM; this method starts with the hardware and solves the problem of low computing efficiency. Reference [13] proposes the pseudo spectral method which is used {{to solve the problem of}} calculating the spatial derivative, thus improving the computational efficiency of the algorithm. Reference [14] combines the high-order finite difference and boundary conditions to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Reference [15] used the combination of high calculation efficiency of Kirchhoff integral method of ray shift and reverse time migration to improve the efficiency and accuracy. Reference [16 – 18] proposes an efficient boundary storage strategy of optimizing the random boundary condition and absorbing boundary condition, which can reduce the memory <b>requirement.</b> <b>Reference</b> [19] proposes a reverse time migration method based on the cloud computing to improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm. Reference [20] improves the efficiency of the algorithm from the view of coding and low-order efficiency. The previous work has laid a solid foundation for the subsequent research. In this paper, the RTM algorithm is studied in order to achieve a balance between the improving computing efficiency and the imaging precision. In the discrete analysis of the underground medium, the grid of the same size for the whole model often causes oversampling in the high-speed layer area when the grid is suit for low velocity; if the large grid is used for the whole model, then it can make the low velocity layer and thin layer imaging not clear. So, the paper starts from this problem and designs to use a small-scale mesh in the low velocity layer to make fine imaging, and the large-scale grids are used in the high-velocity layer to avoid oversampling and the amount of computation and memory occupancy also can be reduced. The method can improve the comprehensive efficiency for RTM while the lateral resolution of the migration imaging results is not affected. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in the paper.|$|E
