40|$|Recent {{growth of}} the geo-spatial {{information}} on the web {{has made it possible}} to easily access various and high quality geo-spatial datasets, such as road networks and high resolution imagery. Although there exist efficient methods to locate <b>road</b> <b>intersections</b> from <b>road</b> networks for route planning, there are few research activities on detecting <b>road</b> <b>intersections</b> from orthoimagery. Detected <b>road</b> <b>intersections</b> on imagery can be utilized for conflation, cityplanning and other GIS-related applications. In this paper, we describe an approach to automatically and accurately identifying <b>road</b> <b>intersections</b> from high resolution color orthoimagery. We exploit image metadata as well as the color of imagery to classify the image pixels as on-road/off-road. Using these chromatically classified image pixels as input, we locate intersections on the images by utilizing the knowledge inferred from the road network...|$|R

5|$|Route31 {{crosses the}} Musconetcong River into Washington Township, Warren County, where it heads north into the {{agricultural}} Musconetcong Valley. It heads into Washington Borough, {{where the road}} becomes four lanes, passing under Norfolk Southern's Washington Secondary and crossing Route57 (Washington Avenue). Past the Route57 intersection, Route31 narrows to three lanes, and becomes a two-lane road again as it crosses back into Washington Township at the Essex <b>Road</b> <b>intersection.</b> It heads into farmland before turning northwest and heading across Oxford Mountain, entering Mansfield Township. While crossing Oxford Mountain, Route31 skirts along the border between Mansfield Township and Washington Township. The route enters Oxford Township, where it heads through the community of Oxford as a four-lane road. Route31 continues north through a mix of woods and agricultural areas past Oxford, crossing into White Township at the East Quarry <b>Road</b> <b>intersection</b> and coming to its terminus at US46.|$|E
5|$|As {{initially}} envisioned, the Hanlon Expressway will be {{upgraded to}} a controlled-access highway by removing all existing at-grade intersections {{and improving the}} highway to 400-series standards. Planning for this work initially {{began in the early}} 1990s with the EA for the section north of the Speed River, which resulted {{in the construction of the}} Wellington Street interchange. The EA for the section south of the Speed River began in early 2007. The Laird Road interchange and associated closing of the Clair <b>Road</b> <b>intersection</b> were the first projects completed as part of this work.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several miles, NY33 runs {{parallel}} to the Thruway and very close to it, with both roads visible from the other. Much of this section of Lancaster has remained rural in character; however, that began {{to change in the}} mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional supermarket chain headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a site near the Gunnville <b>Road</b> <b>intersection</b> for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of a traffic light and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E

PA563 makes a northeast turn at the Barndt Road–Moyer Road junction, continuing northeast on Ridge Road into Salford Township.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the exact}} extent of losses was unclear, the {{earthquake}} caused further damage to many structures in Christchurch; {{approximately half of}} the buildings in the centre of the city were already damaged or destroyed by previous strong earthquakes. Preliminary assessments indicate over 100 additional buildings were rendered beyond repair in the area. Despite its moderate magnitude, the preceding magnitude 5.6 ML tremor caused several two-story buildings at a <b>road</b> <b>intersection</b> in the city to collapse. Multiple hospitals and residential care facilities in Christchurch were left without essential services, and some reported considerable damage to infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|At Bristol Road, PA 263 enters Warwick Township {{and becomes}} a four-lane divided highway as it turns north and runs through wooded areas with some homes, {{crossing}} Little Neshaminy Creek. The route regains a center left-turn lane as it reaches an intersection with Almshouse Road {{in the community of}} Jamison. At this intersection, the route is briefly a divided highway. After Almshouse Road, PA 263 continues north through business areas before heading past residential development. The route turns back into a divided highway as it crosses over the Neshaminy Creek and passes through areas woodland and homes. The road leaves Warwick Township for Buckingham Township at the Sugar Bottom <b>Road</b> <b>intersection.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{intersection}} with County Line Road, PA 263 crosses the Bucks County line and enters Warminster Township as York Road.

The divided highway section ends at Roberts Road. PA 263 gains a center left-turn lane again as it continues north through more residential areas with a few businesses. Just before Bristol Road, Old York Road splits off from the route and PA 263 curves more to the northeast, retaining the name York Road.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Since {{maps are}} widely {{available}} for many areas around the globe, they provide a valuable resource to help understand other geospatial sources such as to identify roads or to annotate buildings in imagery. To utilize the maps for understanding other geospatial sources, {{one of the most}} valuable types of information we need from the map is the road network, because the roads are common features used across different geospatial data sets. Specifically, the set of <b>road</b> <b>intersections</b> of the map provides key information about the road network, which includes the location of the road junctions, the number of roads that meet at the intersections (i. e., connectivity), and the orientations of these roads. The set of <b>road</b> <b>intersections</b> helps to identify roads on imagery by serving as initial seed templates to locate road pixels. Moreover, a conflation system can use the <b>road</b> <b>intersections</b> as reference features (i. e., control point set) to align the map with other geospatial sources, such a...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Road</b> <b>intersections</b> {{have become}} the places of high road {{incidents}} and car collisions. Our hypothesis is that a system can {{be made aware of}} dangerous situations at <b>road</b> <b>intersections</b> and warn drivers accordingly. Moreover, over time, the system can learn (or re-learn) such “patterns ” of danger for specific intersections given a history of rich collision data collected via sensors (that exist today). Based on the assumption that such a history of sensory data about colliding vehicles can be obtained, we show useful patterns that can be extracted. This paper presents our framework for intersection understanding, presenting simulated results suggesting that a fragment of the world (i. e. intersections) can be more deeply understood by mining appropriate sensor data. The simulated environment of the <b>road</b> <b>intersections</b> forming the basis of a real-world implementation and testing of the framework are discussed here. The recent results of mining traffic and collision data generated by the simulation are also included in this paper. ...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the majority of NY37B, the route was realigned west of Massena to follow a new riverside roadway to the hamlet of Louisville Corner, where it came to an end at NY37. The remainder of NY37B along the Massena–Louisville town line road and in Massena was unchanged. By 1960, a connector between NY37 in Louisville and NY37B and Massena utilizing NY37's former routing west of the village was designated as NY131. The alignments of NY37B and NY131 west of the Maple Street/ Town Line <b>Road</b> <b>intersection</b> were flipped , placing NY131 on the riverside and town line roads and NY37B on NY37's former routing into Massena.|$|E
