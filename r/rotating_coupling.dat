40|$|International audienceUsing {{advanced}} continuation {{techniques for}} dynamical systems, we elucidate the bifurcations leading to asymptotically stable square-wave pulsing and polarization mode switching in semiconductor lasers with mutual time-delayed and polarization <b>rotating</b> <b>coupling.</b> We {{find that the}} increase of coupling strength leads to a cascade of Hopf bifurcations on a mixed-mode steady state up to a transcritical bifurcation on a so-called pure-mode steady state where both lasers emit with the injected polarization state. From these successive Hopf bifurcations emerge time-periodic solutions that have a period close to the laser relaxation oscillation for weak coupling but a period close to twice the time delay for large coupling strength. The wave form of the time-periodic solutions also evolves from harmonic pulsing up to square-wave pulsing as has been observed recently in experiments...|$|E

This mechanism is composed of three important parts: The crank which is the rotating disc, the slider which slides inside the tube and the connecting rod which joins the parts together. As the slider moves to the right the connecting rod pushes the wheel round for the first 180 degrees of wheel rotation. When the slider begins to move back into the tube, the connecting rod pulls the wheel round to complete the rotation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the flange {{coupling}} without clearance will be analyzed using CATIA Generative Structural Analysis workbench. The structural analysis procedure will be presented: creating the 3 D model, configuring the mesh, applying the restraints, applying the loads (torque), applying the interaction conditions (driving flange-bolts and nuts, bolts and nuts-driven flange), running {{the numerical analysis}} and results visualization. Two different systems will be analyzed: {{the first is a}} six bolts flange coupling working in nominal conditions, the second is a five bolts flange coupling working in some failure conditions with only five bolts distributed in a six holes flange coupling. In certain conditions the flange coupling design allows the same torque to be transmitted by six, but also by only five bolts. However, the non-uniformity of the five bolts distribution around the six holes flanges will generate some other unwanted phenomena. In this case all the stress and deformations will be non-symmetrically and for the flange coupling that is a <b>rotating</b> <b>coupling</b> this can be one reason for beats phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parameter-free theory of shear-generated turbulence at asymptotically high Reynolds numbers in incompressible fluids. It {{is based on}} a two-fluids concept. Both components are materially identical and inviscid. The first component is an ensemble of quasi-rigid dipole-vortex tubes as quasi-particles in chaotic motion. The second is a superfluid performing evasive motions between the tubes. The local dipole motions follow Helmholtz' law. The vortex radii scale with the energy-containing length scale. Collisions between quasi-particles lead either to annihilation (likewise rotation, turbulent dissipation) or to scattering (counterrotation, turbulent diffusion). There are analogies with birth and death processes of population dynamics and their master equations. For free homogeneous decay the theory predicts the TKE to follow 1 /t. With an adiabatic condition at the wall it predicts the logarithmic law with von Karman's constant as 1 /√(2 pi) = 0. 399. Likewise <b>rotating</b> <b>couples</b> form dissipative patches almost at rest (→ intermittency) wherein the spectrum evolves like an "Apollonian gear" as discussed first by Herrmann, 1990. On this basis the prefactor of the 3 D-wavenumber spectrum is predicted as (1 / 3) (4 pi) ^ 2 / 3 = 1. 8; in the Lagrangian frequency spectrum it is simply 2. The results are situated well within the scatter range of observational, experimental and DNS results.

5000|$|Many [...] "tuning" [...] firms {{producing}} [...] "billet" [...] cranks misunderstand {{the design}} criteria of counterbalance weights. They produce cranks that although made from better materials lack sufficient counter weights and deflect more than OEM standard at high rpm. Other [...] "tuning" [...] firms offer [...] "lightening" [...] and [...] "knife edging" [...] of OEM cranks, this is largely {{at the expense}} of the counterbalance weights. To restore the couple and reduce crankshaft deflection back to OEM spec further work has to undertaken, either installing slugs of high density metal (tungsten) in the counterweights or core drilling the big end journals. For both billet and re-worked OEM cranks if the deflection is greater than OEM spec the results will be poor fatigue and bearing life. For worst cases this may require frequent engine tear downs to replace bearing shells when the crank rubs on the bearing and seasonal replacement of the crank. All of the <b>rotating</b> <b>couple</b> due to crank throw and rotating portion of con-rod and 1/2 the reciprocating couple should be countered. As the balance mass is dependent on the mass of the piston and con-rods if these are changed (for lighter after-market items) then the effect on the couple should be calculated and corrected. Any reputable maker of billet or re-worked cranks should be able to either specify the weights of con-rods and pistons or correct the crank counter weights to suit con-rods and pistons.|$|R
