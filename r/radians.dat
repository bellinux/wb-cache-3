5|$|Angles in polar {{notation}} {{are generally}} expressed in either degrees or <b>radians</b> (2 rad being equal to 360°). Degrees are traditionally used in navigation, surveying, and many applied disciplines, while <b>radians</b> {{are more common}} in mathematics and mathematical physics.|$|E
5|$|The edible Coprinellus bisporus {{is nearly}} {{identical}} but lacks the yellowish cap granules and only has two spores per basidium. The scaly inky cap (Coprinus variegatus = Coprinus quadrifidus) has a grayish-brown cap with dull white to brownish scales; its odor is disagreeable. The trooping crumble cap (Coprinellus disseminatus, edible) has smaller, yellow-brown to grey-brown caps and white gills that turn black {{but do not}} dissolve away; it always grows in large clusters on rotting wood (sometimes buried wood). Coprinus atramentarius is a larger, gray species that grows in dense clusters on stumps or on the ground from buried wood, lacks glistening particles on the cap, and the cap and gills dissolve at maturity. Coprinellus <b>radians</b> develops singly or in clumps from a tufted mat of coarse yellow-orange mycelium on the wood. Coprinellus truncorum is also covered with glistening granules and {{is said to be}} almost indistinguishable from C.micaceus in the field; microscopy is needed to tell the difference, as C.truncorum has ellipsoid spores with a rounded germ pore, compared to the shield-shaped (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of C.micaceus. One study suggests that compared to C.truncorum, C.micaceus is browner {{in the center of the}} cap (rather than grayish) and has a greater tendency to grow in clusters; more molecular evidence is required to determine if the two taxa are genetically identical.|$|E
25|$|The angles are {{typically}} measured in degrees (°) or <b>radians</b> (rad), where 360°=2 rad. Degrees are {{most common in}} geography, astronomy, and engineering, whereas <b>radians</b> are commonly used in mathematics and theoretical physics. The unit for radial distance is usually determined by the context.|$|E

25|$|In general, mathematically {{important}} {{relationships between}} the sine and cosine functions and the exponential function (see, for example, Euler's formula) are substantially simplified when angles are expressed in <b>radians,</b> rather than in degrees, grads or other units. Therefore, in most branches of mathematics beyond practical geometry, angles are generally assumed to be expressed in <b>radians.</b>|$|E

25|$|An angle {{equal to}} 1 turn (360° or 2 <b>radians)</b> {{is called a}} full angle, {{complete}} angle, or a perigon.|$|E
25|$|Two angles that sum to a {{complete}} angle (1 turn, 360°, or 2 <b>radians)</b> are called explementary angles or conjugate angles.|$|E
25|$|This {{period of}} a full circle (that is, 2 <b>radians</b> or 360 degrees) is the {{smallest}} period of the sine and the cosine.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} updates for 8.00 were issued in 2017 to add {{integration}} with ODBC access to <b>Radian</b> data sources. This gave Release 8 {{the ability to}} connect, through <b>Radian,</b> to any data source <b>Radian</b> can use, expanding Release 8 connectivity to data sources 8.00 previously could not access, such as MrSID, ESRI file geodatabases, numerous GDAL/OGR sources and similar.|$|R
50|$|<b>Radian</b> {{was taken}} in the Horde's Earthbound base, in Cape Town, where the Kind Inquirer {{presented}} <b>Radian</b> with the captive Bruce Higashi, reiterating his claims about a cure. Higashi tried to discourage <b>Radian,</b> arguing {{that what he was}} suffering now was worse than death, but the Kind Inquirer did not allow him to continue his communication with the Morituri. <b>Radian</b> then asked the Horde warlord if they had procured the cure from Tuolema's colleague, Dr. Ledbetter, which the Kind Inquirer confirmed. He also informed <b>Radian</b> that they would not hold him captive, but he still had to pay a price. Indeed, <b>Radian</b> was forced to transmit a message throughout the globe, in which he informed the public that there is, in fact, a cure for the Morituri effect, but the Paedia refrains from discovering it, wanting to keep their superpowered warriors under check. He also publicly denounced the Paedia and its actions.|$|R

50|$|The term <b>radian</b> first {{appeared}} in print on 5 June 1873, in examination questions set by James Thomson (brother of Lord Kelvin) at Queen's College, Belfast. He had used the term as early as 1871, while in 1869, Thomas Muir, then of the University of St Andrews, vacillated between the terms rad, radial, and <b>radian.</b> In 1874, after a consultation with James Thomson, Muir adopted <b>radian.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Omega Gang then cause a riot at the Xavier Institute during Open Day, {{when the}} school was going to accept human students. During the riot, <b>Radian</b> {{and other members of}} the gang confront several X-Men on the mansion's front lawn. <b>Radian</b> is stopped by Cyclops, who breaks his leg with his optic blasts. Afterwards, <b>Radian,</b> along with Redneck and Tattoo, are sent to a jail, run by humans. Wolverine informs him that he and the others would be sent {{overseas}} to do charity work after they completed their jail time. <b>Radian</b> was one of many mutants that lost their superhuman powers after the M-Day.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly afterwards, <b>Radian</b> was {{returned}} to Earth and confronted his teammates. They all lashed at him for his perceived betrayal and one of them, the aggressive Shear, mortally wounded him. As he lay dying, <b>Radian</b> confessed to Blackthorn, by then his closest confidant, {{that there is no}} cure and the Horde were lying. Apparently, a [...] "Dr. Ledbetter" [...] doesn't exist and <b>Radian</b> called in their bluff. He also explained that his purpose, to die in battle instead of [...] "committing suicide" [...] (i.e. dying of the Morituri effect) had been achieved. Blackthorn forgave him. After <b>Radian</b> died, Shear proceeded to spit on his face.|$|R
25|$|This {{means that}} these sines and cosines are {{different}} functions, {{and that the}} fourth derivative of sine will be sine again only if the argument is in <b>radians.</b>|$|E
25|$|Consistent units must be used. For metric SI units, {{power is}} watts, torque is newton metres and angular speed is <b>radians</b> per second (not rpm and not {{revolutions}} per second).|$|E
25|$|Where {{there are}} an even number of cavities, two {{concentric}} rings can connect alternate cavity walls to prevent inefficient modes of oscillation. This is called pi-strapping because the two straps lock the phase difference between adjacent cavities at pi <b>radians</b> (180°).|$|E
50|$|Before he was depowered on M-Day, <b>Radian</b> had the superhuman {{ability to}} {{generate}} blinding flashes of ultraviolet light from his body. <b>Radian</b> could control the intensity of these bursts, choosing to either blind or burn his opponents.|$|R
5000|$|We {{assume that}} the {{position}} of [...] {{is what we want}} to solve, [...] is the <b>radian</b> from the tangential point to the moving point , and [...] is the <b>radian</b> from the starting point to the tangential point.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that because}} the <b>radian</b> is a {{dimensionless}} unit, the <b>radian</b> per second is dimensionally equivalent to the hertz—both are defined as one s−1. This means that great {{care must be taken}} to avoid confusing angular frequency ω and frequency ν.|$|R
25|$|In physics, {{the angular}} {{velocity}} {{of an object}} is {{the rate of change}} of its angular displacement with respect to time. The SI unit of angular velocity is <b>radians</b> per second. Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega (ω, rarely Ω).|$|E
25|$|A hosohedron is a {{tessellation}} of {{the sphere}} by lunes. A n-gonal regular hosohedron, {2,n} has n equal lunes of /n <b>radians.</b> An n-hosohedron has dihedral symmetry Dnh, , (*22n) of order 4n. Each lune individually has cyclic symmetry C2v, , (*22) of order 4.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} that is described below uses the paraxial approximation of ray optics, {{which means that}} all rays {{are assumed to be}} at a small angle (θ in <b>radians)</b> and a small distance (x) relative to the optical axis of the system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radian</b> {{is one of}} {{the many}} mutant {{teenagers}} that enrolls into the Xavier Institute after the revelation to the public that Professor X is a mutant. When Cassandra Nova makes her second attack on the school, <b>Radian</b> and other students, even knowing how dangerous Nova was, want to face her. Instead, they are put under her control and turned against X-Men members Wolverine, Beast, and Xorn. <b>Radian</b> and the others are freed soon after thanks to the intervention of the Stepford Cuckoos.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} <b>radian</b> measure, {{as opposed to}} the degree of an angle, is {{normally}} credited to Roger Cotes in 1714. He described the <b>radian</b> in everything but name, and he recognized its naturalness as a unit of angular measure. The idea of measuring angles by the length of the arc was already in use by other mathematicians. For example, al-Kashi (c. 1400) used so-called diameter parts as units where one diameter part was [...] <b>radian</b> and they also used sexagesimal subunits of the diameter part.|$|R
