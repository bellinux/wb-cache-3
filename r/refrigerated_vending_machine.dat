40|$|Ready-to-eat (RTE) food is characterised {{by a long}} {{shelf-life}} at refrigerated {{temperature and}} can be consumed as such, without any treatment. The aim of the work was to evaluate the presence of Listeria spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in RTEs collected from <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vending</b> <b>machines</b> placed in hospital environment and accessible to the hospitalised patients. In 4 different sampling, 55 RTEs were collected from <b>vending</b> <b>machines</b> of six hospitals located in different areas of Sardinia region. All the samples were characterised by similar manufacturing process, {{such as the use}} of modified atmosphere packaging and belonged to 5 different producers. Listeria spp. was not countable using the enumeration method in all of the analysed samples. Using the detection method, Listeria spp. was recovered from 9 sandwich samples. Interestingly, 3 of these samples (5. 5 %) made by the manufacturer, were positive for L. monocytogenes contamination. The risk related to the L. monocytogenes presence in RTEs proportionally increases when food is introduced in susceptible environments, such as hospitals and consumed by susceptible people. Although the RTEs analysed showed values that complied with the European microbiological criteria for foodstuffs, the availability of these products in a susceptible environment should be carefully checked. Therefore, in order to limit the possible exposition to L. monocytogenes, more information on the risk related to RTE consumption should be provided to the hospitalised patients...|$|R

A definitive version was subsequently published in Food Control, 56, (October 2015) ] DOI: 10. 1016 /j. foodcont. 2015. 01. 052 " - [URL] purpose of this paper was to analyse the quality and safety parameters of food products sold in <b>vending</b> <b>machines.</b> A hygienic-sanitary assessment was conducted on 338 <b>vending</b> <b>machines</b> located on the island of Gran Canaria. Hygiene Assessment System (HAS) surveys, food handler examinations and microbiological (processed food and water) and physicochemical (water) controls were applied, permitting evaluation through the identification of the main risks and/or hazards of the hygienic-sanitary quality of the products sold in <b>vending</b> <b>machines.</b> Despite the positive results obtained from the HAS surveys applied to all the <b>vending</b> <b>machines,</b> achieving a total mean score of 87. 6 ± 7. 5 out of 100, the microbiological analysis showed that 5. 7 % of the 105 food samples were contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, while Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were below the legally permitted limits. The lack of vehicles able to transport perishable food at correct temperatures (< 8 °C) and the fact that some <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vending</b> <b>machines</b> were not at an ideal cooling temperature may have contributed to these values. The assessment tools used in this study revealed hygienic deficiencies in the transportation and microbiological quality of the products, despite the favourable results obtained in the HAS surveys and food handler examinations, indicating that this relationship should be the subject of further study to improve its usefulness in the field of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{complements}} and updates a 2007 {{preparatory study}} by BIO Intelligence Service {{for the development}} of EU implementing measures on ecodesign for commercial refrigeration. The study confirms that commercial refrigeration display appliances have still large potentials for improvement of energy efficiency and reduction of other environmental impacts through better design. An overall reduction of 50 % of the energy use of these appliances in the EU is seen as realistically achievable by 2030. If these potentials are effectively seized, considerable economic savings for end-users can be expected, as well as increased competitiveness advantages for businesses. This study revises all detailed background techno-economic information necessary for the formulation of an EU legislative Ecodesign proposal, including definitions of commercial refrigeration appliances, appliance types included and excluded, scope and boundaries with existing EU legislation. It additionally describes the market situation, the supply chain, current refrigeration and display technologies and designs, energy use, and the use and end-of-life phases. The study revises also existing standards and underlines standard needs for the implementation of the Ecodesign measures on yet uncovered appliance types. The study includes first proposals of energy labels, based on a mapping of the current average energy consumption values of the appliances in the EU. Distinct proposals are made for refrigerated display cabinets of the supermarket segment, beverage coolers, small-ice-cream freezers, artisan gelato cabinets and <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vending</b> <b>machines.</b> The study includes also possible information provision requirements that help improve the end-of-life management of these appliances.

40|$|The {{substantial}} efficiency improvements {{which have}} been realized in residential refrigerators over {{the last twenty years}} due to implementation of the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act and changing consumer reactions to energy savings give an indication of the potential for improvement in the commercial sector, where few such efficiency improvements have been made to date. The purchase decision for commercial refrigerators is still focused primarily on first cost and product performance issues such as maximizing storage capacity, quick pulldown, durability, and reliability. The project applied techniques used extensively to reduce energy use in residential refrigeration to a commercial reach-in refrigerator. The results will also be applicable to other commercial refrigeration equipment, such as <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vending</b> <b>machines,</b> reach-in freezers, beverage merchandisers, etc. The project described in this paper was a collaboration involving the Appliance and Building Technology Sector of TIAX, the Delfield Company, and the U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Building Technologies. Funding was provided by DOE through Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC 26 - 00 NT 41000. The program plan and schedule were structured to assure successful integration of the TIAX work on development of efficient design concepts into Delfield's simultaneous development of the Vantage product line. The energy-saving design options evaluated as part of the development included brushless DC and PSC fan motors, high-efficiency compressors, variable-speed compressor technology, cabinet thermal improvement (particularly in the face frame area), increased insulation thickness, a trap for the condensate line, improved insulation, reduced-wattage antisweat heaters, non-electric antisweat heating, off-cycle defrost termination, rifled heat exchanger tubing, and system optimization (selection of heat exchangers, fans, and subcooling, superheat, and suction temperatures for efficient operation). The project started with a thorough evaluation of the baseline Delfield Model 6051 two-door reach-in refrigerator. Performance testing was done to establish a performance baseline which, to meet end-users requirements, would have to be met or exceeded by the high-efficiency refrigerator design. Energy testing was done to establish the baseline energy use. Diagnostic testing such as reverse heat leak testing and insulation conductivity testing was done to evaluate factors contributing to the cabinet load and energy use. Modeling was done to assess the energy savings potential of the energy saving design options. Discussion with vendors and cost modeling was done to assess the manufacturing cost impact of the options. Based on this work, the following group of design options was selected for incorporation in the final refrigerator design: (1) Brushless DC evaporator fans; (2) Improved face frame design; (3) Reduced antisweat heater wattage; (4) Condensate line trap; and (5) Optimized refrigeration system. There was no net cost premium associated with these design changes, leading to a high-efficiency design requiring no payback of any initial additional investment. Delfield incorporated these design options in the Vantage line design and built a first prototype, which was tested at TIAX. Additional design changes were implemented in the transition to manufacturing, based in part on results of initial prototype testing, and a pilot production unit was sent to TIAX for final testing. The energy use of the pilot production unit was 68 % less than that of the baseline refrigerator when tested according to the ASHRAE 117 Energy Test Standard. The energy test results for the baseline refrigerator and the two new-design units is shown in Figure ES- 1 below. The resulting energy consumption is well below Energy Star and proposed Canadian and California standards levels. Delfield has successfully transitioned the design to production and is manufacturing all configurations of the energy efficient reach-ins at a rate greater than 7, 000 per year, with production quantities projected to double within a year...|$|R
