In addition, they {{have to decide whether}} the body is to be cremated or buried, and register the death. The funeral director also helps to make arrangements for the wake and funeral, according to the <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> wishes of the family.|$|E
5|$|Black Hebrew Israelites (also called Black Hebrews, African Hebrew Israelites, and Hebrew Israelites) are {{groups of}} African Americans {{who believe that}} they are {{descendants}} of the ancient Israelites. Black Hebrews adhere in varying degrees to the <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices of both Christianity and Judaism. They are not recognized as Jews by the greater Jewish community. Many choose to identify themselves as Hebrew Israelites or Black Hebrews rather than Jews in order to indicate their claimed historic connections.|$|E

5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of {{malignant}} melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead a symptom of the already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs,</b> <b>and</b> instead the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring and {{was in the process of}} scheduling a world tour in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{was born}} and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, {{with whom he had}} three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a {{successful}} career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 around 1613, he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> whether the works attributed to him were written by others.|$|E
5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{faith in}} Rwanda is Roman Catholicism, {{but there have}} been {{significant}} changes in the nation's religious demographics since the genocide, with many conversions to Protestantism, especially its Evangelical wing, and, to a lesser degree, Islam. According to the 2012 census, Roman Catholics represented 43.7% of the population, Protestants (excluding Seventh-day Adventists) 37.7%, Seventh-day Adventists 11.8%, and Muslims 2.0%; 0.2% claimed no <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> 1.3% did not state a religion. Traditional religion, despite officially being followed by only 0.1% of the population, retains an influence. Many Rwandans view the Christian God as synonymous with the traditional Rwandan God Imana.|$|E
5|$|Ba Cụt {{was born}} circa 1923 in Long Xuyên, a {{regional}} {{town in the}} Mekong Delta, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned {{at an early age}} and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba Cụt was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's rice paddies were confiscated by a prominent landlord, the father of Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ. Ba Cụt's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and {{played a key role in}} Ba Cụt's eventual capture and execution. An aura of mystery surrounded Ba Cụt during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> spent increasing time with local religious men, Ba Cụt's father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. A defiant Ba Cụt severed his index finger, which was necessary for work in the rice paddies.|$|E
