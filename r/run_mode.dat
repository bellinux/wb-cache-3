25|$|In Pokémon Stadium and its sequel, both Koga and Janine {{continue}} {{to utilize the}} Pokémon in the respective games as bosses. In Pokémon Puzzle League, Weezing is one of Team Rocket's Pokémon. In , a Koffing serves as a third of Team Skull, acting as a partner to a Zubat and serving as a minor antagonist and for {{the course of the}} game. Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Melee featured Koffing and Weezing respectively as one of the Pokémon that could emerge when a Pokéball was thrown. Both had the same effect; upon appearing, they would release streams of toxic gas around them, dealing heavy damage to anyone who got caught. Weezing also appeared in Melee as the 5th float to appear on the Poke' Floats stage, while Koffing returned in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS as an enemy in the Smash <b>Run</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|In <b>Run</b> <b>mode,</b> {{the command}} line could be openly used to execute one-line, non-BASIC operations. This is the normal mode used, from where {{arbitrary}} calculations could be entered to receive results. The <b>Run</b> <b>mode</b> also allowed {{the execution of}} the BASIC programs stored in the device.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{algebraic}} geometry is {{the field of}} computational mathematics concerning the numerical solution of polynomial systems of equations. Bertini, a popular software package for computational applications of this field, includes implementations {{of a variety of}} algorithms based on polynomial homotopy continuation. The Macaulay 2 package Bertini. m 2 provides an interface to Bertini, making it possible to access the core <b>run</b> <b>modes</b> of Bertini in Macaulay 2. With these <b>run</b> <b>modes,</b> users can find approximate solutions to zero-dimensional systems and positive-dimensional systems, test numerically whether a point lies on a variety, sample numerically from a variety, and perform parameter homotopy runs...|$|R

25|$|In a {{monolithic}} kernel, {{the operating system}} <b>runs</b> in supervisor <b>mode</b> and the applications <b>run</b> in user <b>mode.</b> Other types of operating systems, like those with an exokernel or microkernel, do not necessarily share this behavior.|$|R
50|$|Apple Dylan {{includes}} a user interface framework, written in Dylan by Mike Lockwood. The framework is tightly integrated with a WYSIWYG interface builder code-named Meccano, written by Robin Mair. The interface builder is linked into an application, allowing users to switch between Edit and <b>Run</b> <b>modes</b> while the application is running. “Decorators” are represented as graphical objects {{that can be}} dragged onto a user interface object to modify its behavior or appearance via object composition.|$|R
50|$|The Shadow Hunters {{expansion}} {{was released}} on Xbox Live Arcade on October 12, 2011. It expands on the Lantern <b>Run</b> <b>mode</b> in the base game, allowing players to team up in {{a continuation of the}} storyline. Shadow Hunters was included for free in the PC port of the game.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the racing mode, Air Ride also has the option of Time Attack mode, where a single player races around a track for three laps. Lastly, a single player can also race Free <b>Run</b> <b>mode,</b> an endless race with {{the sole purpose of}} reaching the fastest possible Lap Time.|$|E
50|$|Calculations {{could be}} {{performed}} in two modes CAL and RUN. In the former the PC-1403 would behave like a normal scientific calculator at the time with formulas entered in algebraic logic or in <b>RUN</b> <b>mode</b> BASIC statements could be entered for immediate execution and print out. The later {{was similar to the}} Direct algebraic logic employed by modern calculators.|$|E

50|$|This chassis {{can support}} {{a maximum of}} 8000W (180A @ 42V). However, to obtain this, it must be <b>run</b> in {{combined}} <b>mode.</b> Therefore, {{it is suggested that}} it be <b>run</b> in redundant <b>mode</b> to obtain a maximum of 6000W (145A @ 42V).|$|R
50|$|Mayur Linux is a linux {{distribution}} based on LinuxPAE64 kernel. The aim of Mayur Linux {{is to use}} same set of device drivers for i386 and x86-64 operating system. The kernel <b>runs</b> in compatibility <b>mode</b> and applications can <b>run</b> in 64-bit <b>mode</b> or compatibility mode.|$|R
50|$|On the Sharp models, {{there was}} only one line {{numbering}} space. In order for multiple programs to exist on the device, they had to be written in different ranges of line numbers. For example, it was common to insert one program starting with line 100, and another program starting at line 200, etc. Valid line numbers in most models were from 1 to 999. To prevent run-on execution, each program had to finish with the END command, unless run-on execution was desired. On Sharp-derived units, labels could be inserted into the program, usually single characters such that in <b>Run</b> <b>mode,</b> that program could be executed by depressing a special DEF key followed by the key of that character. This was equivalent to an explicit GOTO command to the first line number of that section of program, which was also a valid way to execute programs from <b>Run</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Fetcher is {{responsible}} for fetching web pages from the sites and feeding them to the frontier which manages what pages should be crawled next.Fetcher can be implemented using Scrapy or any other crawling framework/system as the framework offers a generic frontier functionality.In distributed <b>run</b> <b>mode</b> Fetcher is replaced with message bus producer from Frontera Manager side and consumer from Fetcher side.|$|E
50|$|It was not {{possible}} to define new mathematical function commands for use in <b>Run</b> <b>mode.</b> However, on many Sharp derived models, a special AREAD command was added to BASIC which would assign the current value on the display line to a given variable, which could then be used in a program. Combined with a defined key, this allowed very quick custom operation.|$|E

50|$|Concurrently {{with the}} search for runs, the runs are merged with merge sort. Except where Timsort tries to {{optimise}} for merging disjoint <b>runs</b> in galloping <b>mode,</b> <b>runs</b> are repeatedly merged together two at a time, with the only concerns being to maintain stability and merge balance.|$|R
40|$|This update {{features}} various stability {{improvements and}} drops some superfluous features. The following pages {{have been dropped}} and {{may or may not}} appear in a future release: live waveforms, online monitoring, slow control viewing. The following pages saw large updates: Configuration now allows inheritance of <b>run</b> <b>modes</b> The <b>runs</b> page is updated to a streaming table to improve page load speed. The detail view is simplified with mustache templates. The control page should be more stable and support concurrent users better. A rudimentary timeout detection puts some protection against asynchronous updates from unrefreshed browser tabs...|$|R
50|$|VS - Multiple human players {{race against}} each other on any course with {{customized}} rules such as team racing and item frequency. The mode also includes single-player VS races and CPU controlled players to compete in VS races as well since Mario Kart DS (except for Mario Kart 7). Super Circuit, however, features a Quick <b>Run</b> <b>mode,</b> which shares similarities with VS mode.|$|E

50|$|Beyond {{the energy}} savings in <b>Run</b> <b>Mode,</b> the EFM32 {{is ideal for}} low duty cycle {{applications}} where it {{can take advantage of}} operating in lower energy states. The lower energy states are outlined in the section above as EM1 (Sleep), EM2 (Deep Sleep), EM3 (Stop), and EM4 (Shutoff). The Autonomous Peripherals, Peripheral Reflex System, and LESENSE are the core technologies that come into play in the lower energy modes.|$|E

On 64-bit computers, the Metro edition <b>runs</b> in 64-bit <b>mode</b> by default. The desktop edition can be <b>run</b> in 64-bit <b>mode</b> by enabling Enhanced Protected Mode.|$|R
50|$|CEF 3 is a {{multi-process}} implementation {{based on}} the Chromium Content API and has performance similar to Google Chrome. It uses asynchronous messaging to communicate between the main application process and one or more render processes (Blink + V8 JavaScript engine). It supports PPAPI plugins and extensions, both internal (PDF viewer) or externally loadable. The single-process <b>run</b> <b>mode</b> is not supported, but still present; currently is being used for debugging purposes only.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a handful}} of maps; one of which is {{selected}} by the player after selecting their aircraft. Most of the maps feature racing through narrow ravines and canyons, diving under bridges and rock structures accompanied by sharp turns and climbing maneuvers. Airplanes can't roll, and the game will stop your climb at a certain altitude, forcing players to mainly stick to the course direction. The game featured a time <b>run</b> <b>mode</b> and a split screen multi-player mode.|$|E
