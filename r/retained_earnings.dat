It reported income before grants to IDA members of $2.18 billion in fiscal year 2011, up from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2010 and $299 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in income before grants is ascribed to higher earnings from the IFC's investments and also from higher service fees. The IFC reported a partial offset from lower liquid asset trading income, higher administrative costs, and higher advisory service expenses. The IFC made $600 million in grants to IDA countries in fiscal 2011, up from $200 million in fiscal 2010 and $450 million in fiscal 2009. The IFC reported a net income of $1.58 billion in fiscal year 2011. In previous years, the IFC had reported {{a net loss of}} $151 million in fiscal 2009 and $1.75 billion in fiscal 2010. The IFC's total capital amounted to $20.3 billion in 2011, of which $2.4 billion was paid-in capital from member countries, $16.4 billion was <b>retained</b> <b>earnings,</b> and $1.5 billion was accumulated other comprehensive income.

40|$|Saki Bigio 1 Financial crises seem {{particularly}} lengthy when banks fail to recapitalize after large losses. I explain this through a model where banks provide intermediation in markets with informational asymmetries. Large equity losses reduce a bankâ€™s capacity to bear further losses. Losing this capacity leads to reductions in intermediation and exacerbates adverse selection. Adverse selection, in turn, lowers profits from intermediation which explains {{the failure to}} attract equity injections or <b>retain</b> <b>earnings</b> quickly. Financial crises are infrequent events characterized by low economic growth which is overcome only as banks slowly recover by <b>retaining</b> <b>earnings.</b> Several policy interventions are explored...|$|R

40|$|In 2004 Norwegian {{authorities}} {{announced a}} reform introducing dividend taxation for personal (but not corporate) owners {{to take effect}} starting in 2006. This change provided incentives to maximize dividends in 2004 and 2005, and to <b>retain</b> <b>earnings</b> in the following years. Using Norwegian registry data that cover the universe of non-publicly traded firms, we find that dividend payments responded very strongly to the anticipated reform, but also {{that much of the}} response was compensated by re-injecting shareholder equity in the same firms. On the other hand, following the reform firms began to <b>retain</b> <b>earnings.</b> While all categories of assets grow, the increase in durable assets categories that include equipment, machinery, company cars, planes and boats, is particularly striking. We find that personally owned firms and those that pursued aggressive dividend maximization policy in anticipation of the reform exhibit lower profits and economic activity in its aftermath, but <b>retain</b> <b>earnings</b> and accumulated assets at comparable or faster rate than others. The differential effect on assets is concentrated in financial (a potential substitute for private saving) and durable (a potential substitute for private consumption) asset categories. We interpret these results as indicating both the existence of real tax responses and supportive of the notion that in the presence of dividend taxation closely-held firms partially serve as tax shelters. ...|$|R

25|$|A {{dividend}} is {{a payment}} {{made by a}} corporation to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, the corporation is able to re-invest the profit in the business (called <b>retained</b> <b>earnings)</b> and pay a proportion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Distribution to shareholders may be in cash (usually a deposit into a bank account) or, if the corporation has a dividend reinvestment plan, the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares or share repurchase.|$|E
2500|$|The Share Insurance Fund is {{approximately}} $13 billion in total, {{made up of}} $2.8 billion in <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> and approximately $10 billion in contributed capital from credit unions.

[...] The Federal Credit Union Act requires the NCUA Board to set a target equity ratio of at least 1.20 percent and no more than 1.50 percent of total insured deposits.

2500|$|A {{dividend}} is allocated as a fixed {{amount per}} share, with shareholders receiving a dividend in proportion to their shareholding. [...] For the joint-stock company, paying dividends is not an expense; rather, it is the division of after-tax profits among shareholders. <b>Retained</b> <b>earnings</b> (profits {{that have not been}} distributed as dividends) are shown in the shareholders' equity section on the company's balance sheet [...] the same as its issued share capital. Public companies usually pay dividends on a fixed schedule, but may declare a dividend at any time, sometimes called a special dividend to distinguish it from the fixed schedule dividends. Cooperatives, on the other hand, allocate dividends according to members' activity, so their dividends are often considered to be a pre-tax expense.|$|E
5000|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the {{dividend}} distribution, generally as cash dividends or via a share buyback. Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to <b>retain</b> <b>earnings</b> or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the value of shares outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to <b>retain</b> <b>earnings</b> and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. A share buyback program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of undistributed profits. In all instances, the appropriate dividend policy is usually directed by that which maximizes long-term shareholder value.|$|R

In Model 2, firms can <b>retain</b> <b>earnings,</b> raise debt and equity, but face collateral constraints on debt capacity.

2500|$|Cash {{dividends}} are {{the most}} common form of payment and are paid out in currency, usually via electronic funds transfer or a printed paper check. Such dividends are a form of investment income and are usually taxable to the recipient in the year they are paid. This is the most common method of sharing corporate profits with the shareholders of the company. For each share owned, a declared amount of money is distributed. Thus, if a person owns 100 shares and the cash dividend is 50 cents per share, the holder of the stock will be paid $50.

40|$|Background:Â The {{value of}} equity {{investments}} depends {{to some extent}} on the tax consequences for investors. When groups of investors have different tax preferences, {{this can lead to}} conflicting pressures on firms to either <b>retain</b> <b>earnings</b> or pay dividends. The findings of this study will be of interest to researchers of taxation and corporate governance alike, as they highlight the role that corporate shareholders play in the decisions of the firm. Investors and regulators will also be interested in the findings as they reveal more about the interaction between shareholders with conflicting interests. Lastly, changes in behaviour as a result of changes in tax legislation are of interest to those with fiscal responsibility. Setting:Â A 2012 dividend tax change in South Africa, which simultaneously altered the tax preferences of individual and corporate investors, provides a unique opportunity to investigate firmsâ€™ reaction to their investorsâ€™ tax preferences. Aim:Â This article seeks to determine whether firms respond to changes in their investorsâ€™ tax preferences in their decisions to either <b>retain</b> <b>earnings</b> or pay dividends. Method:Â The article investigates the responses of firms to the 2012 dividend tax change using multivariate regressions. Results:Â Findings show that firms consider changes in the tax preferences of their investors in setting dividend policies. In addition, it appears that corporates have greater success in lobbying for beneficial dividend changes than individuals. Conclusion:Â Changes in investorsâ€™ tax preferences impact on firmsâ€™ dividend policy decisions. These decisions ultimately affect the value of the firm to its investor...|$|R

We develop a simple agency model in which managers and shareholders have conict-ing interests to explain the evidence. In this model, dividend taxation induces managers to undertake unproductive investments by <b>retaining</b> <b>earnings,</b> and cre-ates a 8 Ì† 5 rst-order deadweight cost. In contrast, corporate taxes do not distort the managers payout decision and may only create second-order e Â¢ ciency costs.

40|$|In 2003, the United States {{enacted a}} tax reform that reduced, {{but did not}} eliminate, {{individual}} dividend income taxes. Cutting the dividend tax deprives corporate insiders of a justification for <b>retaining</b> <b>earnings</b> to build unprofitable corporate empires.

This balance is broadly appropriate in the United Statesâ€”whose large companies are freestanding and widely held.

Real dividends per share increased by about 38 per cent between 1985 / 86 and 1990 / 91. We estimate that the tax changes account for a rise in real dividends per share of about 20 per cent during that period. ...|$|R
