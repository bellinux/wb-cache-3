2500|$|Grimsby - The Grimsby 'Fibro' {{plant was}} built {{on the bank of the}} Humber West of Grimsby between 1952 and 1957 to produce viscose <b>rayon</b> <b>staple</b> fibre, known as Fibro. [...] In 1959 a new 'Courtelle' factory was {{constructed}} to make a proprietary acrylic fibre. [...] Both factories were substantially expanded in the 1960s and 1970s. Later the advanced form of rayon known as Tencel fibre was manufactured using a more environmentally friendly process. [...] Acrylic dope for 'Grafil' carbon fibre was also manufactured. [...] The site was sold in 1998 to Accordis UK Ltd; the Tencel plant sold to the Lenzing Group, whilst the acrylic fibre plant went through a number of administrations in the 2000s, with production ceasing 2013.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 Avtex Fibers {{closed their}} plant in Nitro, West Virginia that {{manufactured}} <b>rayon</b> <b>staple.</b> In 1983, Avtex Fibers {{was the largest}} US manufacturer of rayon fiber, as well as operating plants that made polyester and acetate yarn.|$|E
50|$|The 90-92% {{cellulose}} content sulfite pulps {{are used}} mostly to make textiles (like rayon) and cellophane. The 96-% cellulose content sulfate pulps {{are used to}} make rayon yarn for industrial products such as tire cord, <b>rayon</b> <b>staple</b> for high-quality fabrics, and various acetate and other specialty products.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{subscale}} nozzle {{tests have}} identified new and promising carbon phenolic nozzle ablatives which utilize <b>staple</b> <b>rayon,</b> PAN, and pitch based carbon cloth. A 4 -inch throat diameter submerged test nozzle {{designed for the}} 48 -inch Jet Propulsion Laboratory char motor {{was used to evaluate}} five different designs incorporating 20 candidate ablatives. Test results indicate that several pitch and PAN-based carbon phenolic ablatives can provide erosion and char performance equivalent or superior to the present continuous rayon-based SRM ablative...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of study on the resin {{treatments}} of <b>rayon</b> in its <b>staple</b> form compressive resilience was measured together with various kinds of fiers in comparsion. It {{was found that the}} cellulosics(a), synthetics(b), and wool(C) have their own characteristic inclinations in resilience curves, resilience vs. loads. (a) was such that the curve slowed down, beginning with medium height, while(b) rose up with the load, beginning with almost the same height. (c) began with a considerable height which did not slow down very much...|$|R
40|$|The Performance of <b>staple</b> <b>rayon</b> {{fiber and}} AVTEX {{continuous}} rayon fiber was evaluated as precursor materials for heatshields. The materials studied were referenced to the IRC FM 5055 A heatshield materials flown {{during the past}} decade. Three different arc jet facilities were used to simulate portions of the reentry environment. The IRC FM 5055 A and the AVTEX FM 5055 G, both continuous rayon fiber woven materials having the phenolic impregnant filled with carbon particles were compared. The AVTEX continuous fiber, unfilled material FM 5822 A was also examined to a limited extent. Test {{results show that the}} AVTEX FM 5055 G material provided a close substitute for the IRC FM 5055 A material both in terms of thermal protection and roll torque performance...|$|R
50|$|The Oberbruch plant {{became a}} {{research}} and development facility for the Glanzstoff Group. In 1935, the first tests {{for the production of}} rayon for tyres and driving belts were performed. A pilot plant for continuous spinning, washing and drying of viscose silk began in 1937, while a process for the recovery of carbon disulphide in the <b>rayon</b> <b>staple</b> plant was developed.|$|E
