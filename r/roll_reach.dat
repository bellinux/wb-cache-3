Rolls was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating B.A in 1893 and M.A in 1896.|$|R
50|$|The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia {{was not an}} Eastern Bloc country, but {{a member}} of the Non-Aligned Movement and as such, it was far more opened to the Western culture {{comparing}} to the other socialist countries. Rock and <b>roll</b> <b>reached</b> Yugoslavia via foreign radio stations, most notably Radio Luxemburg, and rock and roll records, brought in from the West. Rock and <b>roll</b> influences <b>reached</b> schlager singers, most notably Đorđe Marjanović, who released the first popular music solo album in Serbia, in 1959. The end of the 1950s featured the appearances of first rock and roll acts, and the 1960s featured a large number of beat bands, such as Siluete and Elipse, which became enormously popular with the younger generations. Rock bands drew the public's attention to themselves, which was followed with the appearance of first rock music magazines, radio and TV shows.|$|R

In November 1870 a Volunteer Unit, part of the No 1 Clutha Rifles, was formed. A saw mill had been established sometime before 1872. In 1873 a town library was commenced.

The society debated an extensive range of subjects including scientific, religious, political, and social topics, often violating the constitution's rules banning religious and political subjects. The society's debates were often acrimonious and regularly spilled beyond the confines of the meetings and into the community.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to ascertain the bacteriological condition of commercially cooked Eastern-type (foil-wrapped-oven roasted) turkey rolls during processing and storage.

In stored whole rolls, coliform and enterococcus counts ranged, respectively, from about 10, 000 to more than 1 million per g and from < 100 to more than 1 million per g. Postcooking processing operations in two plants did not significantly affect the total count of turkey rolls.

50|$|Mossend has {{a public}} school 'Mossend Primary School' and a Roman Catholic School 'Holy Family Primary School.'In 1868, the Rev. James Milne built a new chapel-school having an {{attendance}} of 140 pupils and dedicated to the Holy Family. Miss Mary McCluskey was appointed the headmistress. In 1883, the Rev. Micheal Fox erected a large addition to the chapel-school providing accommodation for 400 pupils. Under the inspiration and guidance of the Rev. John Scannell, it was realised in 1904 that a modern school was needed {{to cope with the}} increasing roll. The foundation stone wad laid on 7 October 1906 by archbishop Maguire and the three story, red sandstone building formally dedicated and opened on Sunday 27 January 1907.

By 14:20, the power went out and her remaining 25mm anti-aircraft guns began to drop into the sea. Three minutes later, Yamato capsized. Her main 46cm turrets fell off, and as she rolled suction was created that drew swimming crewmen back toward the ship. When the <b>roll</b> <b>reached</b> approximately °, one of the two bow magazines detonated in a tremendous explosion. The resulting mushroom cloud—over [...] high—was seen [...] away on Kyūshū. Yamato sank rapidly, losing an estimated 3,055 of her 3,332 crew, including fleet commander Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō. The few survivors that weren't killed by strafing fighters were recovered by the four surviving destroyers, which withdrew to Japan.|$|R
50|$|A chapel, {{built of}} Bath stone, was erected in 1883 and consecrated on 16 October that year.

40|$|Abstract. EBSD {{investigation}} of texture and microstructure evolution during a complete thermomechanical treatment of commercially pure titanium (HCP-Ti) is presented. Titanium was cold <b>rolled</b> to <b>reach</b> {{various degrees of}} thickness reduction: 20 %, 40 % and 60 %. Next, annealing in air atmosphere was conducted at different conditions to achieve the recrystallized state. EBSD topological maps were measured on RD-TD and RD-ND surface of each sample.

Texture evolution in investigated titanium appears to be limited, especially in recrystallized state. However some subtle mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
