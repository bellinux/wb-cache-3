40|$|Under {{global climate}} change, arid regions, like California, face higher {{temperatures}} and more extended droughts. In response, California is implementing policies for reducing GHG emissions from the electricity and transportation sectors, such as renewable and zero emission vehicle (ZEV) targets. Electricity and transportation {{have historically been}} treated as independent. However, emission strategies applied to either can affect both, as well as water resources, either aiding or hindering the advancement of mutual sustainability goals. Expanding renewable utilization is increasing the need for stationary energy storage (SES) to manage renewable dynamics and shift energy to resolve the misalignment of supply and demand. The deployment of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to meet ZEV targets introduces a new variable load and, at the same time, an alternative grid resource that, with intelligent charging, can be utilized as to manage grid dynamics, thereby achieving high <b>renewable</b> <b>integration</b> and reducing both electricity and transportation emissions. This research employs an integrated platform to evaluate SES and PEV strategies to meet sustainability goals. The role of SES to facilitate <b>renewable</b> <b>integration</b> and meet emission targets under different scenarios is investigated. This is accomplished by (1) evaluating the effectiveness of SES to reduce emissions at high renewables, and (2) examining the impact of intelligent PEV deployment on SES requirements to reach renewable targets. The impact of water-intensive renewable technologies is also discussed. It is determined that intelligent PEV deployment provides an opportunity to further electricity and transportation emission targets by improving <b>renewable</b> <b>integration</b> and providing zero-emission energy for vehicles...|$|E

40|$|To {{achieve a}} {{sustainable}} and green energy-oriented power energy system, the Energy Internet was described {{to achieve this}} goal, in which the grids are envisioned as plug-in, energy shared and distributed controlled. The smart grid intelligence periphery (GRIP) was proposed as a future architecture for the Energy Internet with three basic functionalities, which are system operation with large scale <b>renewables</b> <b>integration,</b> frequency fluctuation alleviation and system failure mitigation. This thesis focuses on {{the first and third}} functionalities. In other words, the operational methods addressing uncertainties of renewables and system failures especially from severe events are developed. About the operational method for <b>renewables</b> <b>integration</b> in the GRIP, the risk-limiting dispatch is chosen as the operational method in the GRIP. In order to conquer the limitations in the basic risk-limiting dispatch model, four fundamental requirements for the risk-limiting dispatch are summarized from practical reports and academic research. The four requirements are the transmission network constraint, the dispatch framework composed of multiple delivery periods, alternative risk index which is computational tractable, and the necessity of integrating unit commitment in the context of risk-limiting dispatch. To satisfy such requirements, this thesis extends the basic risk-limiting dispatch to multi-period risk-limiting dispatch and risk-limiting unit commitment. They are in consistency with the current electricity markets, and can mitigate the operating risks through sequentially dispatching units, assisted by updated prediction information for uncertainties of renewables generations. About the operational method for system failure mitigation, this thesis puts emphasis on the system failure mitigation method against severe events, which is called system resilience enhancement. The operational method for system resilience enhancement including three stages which are prior-to-event stage, during-events stage and after-event stage. In the first stage, this thesis designs a resilience assessment criterion to evaluate the system resilience before severe event come, by means of measuring the risk of cascading failure during severe events. A self-organized criticality theory based assessment criterion is proposed so that such assessment can be effectively computed in large complex systems. In the second stage, a model predictive control based sequential operation is proposed to schedule the system resources to enable the system adaptability against unfolding events. Taking advantages of model predictive control, the sequential operation mitigates the damage of severe events by using the updated prediction information of severe events. In the third stage, the proposed optimal breaker sequence operation realizes the restoration strategies after severe events in the node-breaker model. In sum, this thesis contributes to develop the operational methods to accomplish two functionalities in the GRIP, where risk-limiting dispatch aims to tackle the uncertainties due to large scale <b>renewables</b> <b>integration,</b> and system resilience enhancement method spears at mitigate the system failures due to severe events. The achievements of this thesis carry a major step forward on the realistic implementation of the GRIP. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

The <b>Renewable</b> Energy <b>Integration</b> Problem is defined as finding the optimum set of components to supply the electric demand to a hybrid microgrid. The components considered are solar panels, wind turbines, diesel generators, electric batteries, connections to the power grid and converters, which can be inverters and/or rectifiers.
