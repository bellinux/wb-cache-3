40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{classification}} and analysis of failures of ultracapacitors {{to be used in}} <b>rail</b> <b>launchers</b> applications with the aim of investigating the influence of strong impulsive electromagnetic fields on their performance. Considering the very harsh environment present in <b>rail</b> <b>launchers</b> applications, a reliability analysis of components of the launch mass is very important to assess the failure modes and the relevant effects. To this purpose, we introduced a Failure Modes and Effects analysis methodology (FMEA) to ensure an optimal design and material choice as well as to evaluate the impact of all possible failure mechanisms and causes on the ultracapacitors. This approach allows to reduce or possibly eliminate the effects of potential failure modes before the launch mass design completion and before failures occur during the launch...|$|R
50|$|Missiles use hangers {{to mount}} to a rack which, in cross section, {{resemble}} either a T-bar called an internal T-shaped hanger or resemble a horseshoe called an external U-shaped shoe. Ambiguously, hangers are also {{often referred to}} as lugs or hooks.The majority of launchers can also be referred to as <b>rail</b> <b>launchers</b> because of the use of external rail flanges, a guide for the missile suspension hangers during firing.|$|R
50|$|Utilising a <b>rail</b> <b>launcher,</b> {{the first}} {{launch of a}} full Exos vehicle took place in June 1958, {{launched}} from the Wallops Flight Facility. Eight operational launches took place between 1960 and 1965, launched from Eglin Air Force Base.|$|E

5000|$|The KSShch (Корабельный снаряд «Щука» (КСЩ); tr.:Korabelny snaryad Shchuka (KSShch); Shchuka Anti-Ship Missile, [...] "Shchuka" [...] - pike in English) was a Soviet anti-ship {{cruise missile}} design that carried a nuclear warhead. Its GRAU {{designation}} is 4K32. It was {{sometimes referred to}} as P-1 or Strelka (Arrow). It was used in the 1950s and 1960s. The missile's NATO reporting name was SS-N-1 or Scrubber. It was tested in 1957-1958 on the destroyer Bedovyy (Kildin-class) and entered service in 1958, being deployed on Kildin- and Kanin-class ships. It was fired from a heavy <b>rail</b> <b>launcher</b> SM-59, with an armoured hangar. As those ships were retrofitted and modernized between 1966 and 1977, the missiles were removed (in favor of the SS-N-2 on the Kildin class and an anti-aircraft/anti-submarine weapons suite on the Kanin class).|$|E
5000|$|The Northrop JB-1 [...] "Bat" [...] was a United States surface-to-surface {{cruise missile}} {{that was a}} {{prototype}} jet-powered flying wing. The United States Army Air Forces MX-543 program was initiated in September 1942 to use US versions of Frank Whittle's jet engine (US-named General Electric J31). The Northrop Corporation was contracted in late 1943, and only 10 JB-1 airframes were built. [...] A manned version was towed for the 1st flight on [...] "August 27, [...] from Rogers Dry Lake; and a glider version was launched from a rocket-propelled sled and crashed in December 1944. [...] An unmanned JB-1 powered by an improvised General Electric B-1 turbojet with a wing span of 28 ft made its 1st flight from Eglin Field's Santa Rosa Island, Florida, on December 7, 1944, and crashed 400 yards from the <b>rail</b> <b>launcher.</b>|$|E
50|$|Design work on RS-82 and RS-132 rockets {{began in}} the early 1930s, by a team led by Georgy Langemak, and {{including}} Vladimir Artemiev, Boris Petropavlovsky, Yuriy Pobedonostsev, and others. The 82 mm (3.2 in) and 132 mm (5.2 in) diameters were chosen because the standard smokeless gunpowder charge used at the time was 24 mm (0.94 in) in diameter and seven of these charges fitted into an 82 mm cylinder. First test-firing was done in November 1929. In 1937, aerodynamically efficient RO-82 <b>rail</b> <b>launchers</b> were designed for mounting these weapons on aircraft.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{measuring}} current distribution in multiple-brush armatures for electromagnetic <b>rail</b> <b>launchers</b> is reapproached here {{to study the}} dynamic measurement during armature motion on a two-brush armature. The measurement method {{is based on an}} array of loops magnetically coupled to the brushes, placed along the rails. From the theoretical point of view the measured voltages on all the loops should make possible to reconstruct the current distribution between the brushes as a function of time and armature position. This has been experimentally verified on a launcher prototype...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} of current distribution across the <b>rails</b> of <b>rail</b> <b>launchers.</b> The proposed approach is based on inductive method by magnetically coupling an array of search loops with the rail-armature circuit. The procedure was already successfully employed for current distribution measurements among the brushes of multi-brush armatures and its extension to the current distribution reconstruction across the rails is here discussed. The method sensitivity and the measurement model uncertainty in a simple case study are firstly analyzed based on an analytical model formulation, to obtain information about the applicability of this approach. Then, a finite element analysis and experimental results are presented, discussing various rails-armature configurations...|$|R
50|$|The BMP-1 carries four ATGMs {{with their}} {{launching}} rails {{as a standard}} (two inside the turret and two inside the hull). In theory, a fifth missile can be carried on the launcher. The missiles are loaded onto a <b>rail</b> <b>launcher</b> through a small rectangular hatch in a turret's roof behind the launcher. Each 9M14M weighs 10.9 kg, a 9M14P is 11.4 kg. These missiles can only be fired in daylight {{because of the lack}} of a night sight. A guidance device used in the BMP-1 has the code 9S428. Besides such advantages as interference immunity and simple control equipment, wire-guided ATGMs are hampered by significant disadvantages, such as: a relatively low flight speed, response delay, the inability to load a new missile until the previous one has reached its target and a very long minimum range (500 m). Successful operation of the ATGM while the vehicle is on the move requires a very skilled gunner.|$|E
5000|$|Fife was {{the first}} and only British warship to bear the name, for county Fife. She was a Mk2 Guided Missile Destroyer (GMD, also {{referred}} to pre-1975 by its then US Navy/NATO designator DLG (Large Destroyer (USN 'Frigate') carrying long range surface to air missiles for area defence; post-1975 DDG, 'destroyer' with similar characteristics). The Mk2 designator refers to her primary armament, the Seaslug Mk2 missile. The weapon had begun development in the early fifties and entered service in the Mk1 GMDs like [...] By modern standards the Seaslug is a huge missile with one sustainer rocket motor and 4 disposable boosters. The missile was a so-called 'beam rider'. It was launched from a huge <b>rail</b> <b>launcher</b> in the stern and boosted into the guidance beam from the fire direction radar which pointed at the target, a high altitude supersonic attack aircraft. Once in the beam the missile would fly at supersonic speed to the target where a proximity fuze would detect the target and detonate the continuous rod warhead.|$|E

These methods aim at an approximate identification of the correlation among voltage samples introduced by the analog-to-digital converter, only based on the available measurements without requiring additional tests and instruments. An estimate of this correlation allows to better evaluate the overall measurement uncertainty, thus providing the applicability limits of the proposed inductive technique and contributing {{to a better understanding}} of the current and force distribution in the armature...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{shielding}} resonator structures for possible application in electromagnetic <b>rail</b> <b>launchers.</b> The main {{aspects of the}} resonant shield are revisited via the 'spatial averaging' concept of macroscopic quantities and of the effective magnetic behavior. In particular, it is recalled how a resonator structure defines a spatial region with effective negative permeability and it is shown how this can be exploited for shielding applications. Simulation results are obtained via a commercial finite element code through a three dimensional frequency analysis. The shielding effectiveness is estimated at different operating conditions by varying the resonance frequencies of the shield, while maintaining constant the field operating frequency. Possible advantages and critical aspects of such an approach are discussed throughout the paper, and a preliminary analysis of the thrust force acting on the projectile is also provided...|$|R

Small bomblets were put directly on bomb bay floors, in piles. A typical load was 182 (maximum 200) 2 kg AO-2,5-2 fragmentation bombs, or 144 PTAB-2,5-1,5 anti-tank HEAT bombs. Apart from bombs, four unguided rockets RS-82 or RS-132 could {{be carried on}} <b>rail</b> <b>launchers</b> under wings. Avia B-33s were also fitted to carry other rocket types. Late Soviet aircraft could carry ORO-82 and ORO-132 tube launchers.
