40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{cultural}} analyses of electric light, including aspects of actor-network theory, may raise the spectre of complexity, {{but do not}} do it justice when they omit to provide analysis of the intertwined roles of culture and political economy {{in the formation of}} the provision and use of electric light. The essay looks at the marketization of electric power, at outages in the eastern and western US megacities, at the collapse of the public utility model and chaotic implementation of market models in Mumbai, Lagos and other poor megacities, and concludes that while theft of power provides a temporary solution, abandoning centralized market models in favour of microgrids is the only sure way to <b>return</b> <b>agency</b> to slum dwellers...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{personal}} data has incredible potential to benefit both society and individuals, through increased understanding of behaviour, communication {{and support for}} emerging forms of socialisation and connectedness. However, there are risks associated with disclosing personal information, and present systems show a systematic asymmetry between the subjects of the data and those who control and manage the way that data is propagated and used. This leads to a tension between a desire to engage with online society and enjoy its benefits on one hand, and a distrust of those with whom the data is shared on the other. In this chapter, we explore a set of obfuscation techniques which may help to redress {{the balance of power}} when sharing personal data, and <b>return</b> <b>agency</b> and choice to users of online services...|$|E
40|$|Debate about {{underclass}} conceptualization {{has once}} again forced sociologists to acknowledge the political context and implications of our work. This article extends the critical examination of underclass conceptualization to relatively undeveloped but politically important areas of concern. Initially we discuss the political economic context of conceptual controversies surrounding poverty. With a preference for structural analysis, we call {{for the return of}} class to economically marginalized people and suggest how that goal might be enhanced by a focus on relations of distribution as well as production. Valuing subjects 2 ̆ 7 vantage points, we recommend how sociologists 2 ̆ 7 work can <b>return</b> <b>agency</b> and diversity to economically marginalized people. Finally, acknowledging the agency of sociologists, we call for greater attention to the implications of our class positions for how we, too, make history, either by intention or default...|$|E
50|$|Ability-inclusive {{curriculum}} is another curriculum {{model that}} adapts to the social, physical, and cultural {{needs of the}} students. Inclusion in the US education system refers to the approach to educating {{students with special needs}} in a mainstream classroom. This model involves cultivating a strong relationship between teacher and student, and between non-special needs students and special needs students. Like the other models of culturally-inclusive curriculum, ability-inclusive curriculum often involves collaboration, parental-involvement, the creation of a safe and welcoming environment, <b>returning</b> <b>agency</b> to the students over their learning, and fostering open discussion about individual differences and strengths.|$|R

40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{examines}} {{the security situation}} along the border between Thailand and Malaysia by conducting a discursive analysis of the security concerns of government officials {{on both sides of}} the border. The border between is the site of considerable contradiction. At once, dividing two ethnically and linguistically disparate states with different conceptions of security, the border also serves as the site for a number of cooperation efforts, including joint military patrols along the border, a cooperative mineral extraction regime encompassing a disputed territorial claim in the Gulf of Thailand, and one of the only border walls in the world that has been constructed jointly by the states on either side. In this thesis, I explore the concept of security and the imagined geography of the border from the perspective of both states, drawing extensively on two sources: personal interviews with mid-level government and military officials on both sides as well as local news media reports about border security issues over the last 15 years. In approaching the study of the border region in this way, I challenge the argument that borders are best studied at the local level. Instead, this paper seeks to <b>return</b> <b>agency</b> to state actors who ultimately wield the economic and military might to define borders performatively, and are in any case, the referent objects of local resistance movements...|$|E
40|$|While {{existing}} {{criticism of}} Emma Tennant's work emphasizes its feminist agenda, less {{attention has been}} paid to her rewriting of different narratives and discourses. Tennant's career has centered on challenging literary values as well as generic categories, realist conventions, and gender stereotypes. Contrary to implications that rewriting is "re-vision," an "act of survival" that corrects or subverts earlier texts, this thesis argues that Tennant's characteristic resistance to categories also extends to the work of rewriting and revision. Her texts suggest that the act of "writing back" is not as straightforward as it may seem, but deeply ambiguous and ambivalent. Developing theories of the "signature" that return the writer-as-agent to the otherwise anonymous field of intertextuality, this thesis traces Tennant's figurations of writing, metafictional devices, and intertextual allusions to show how these relate to themes in the fiction. Examining groupings of the texts from different critical perspectives, each chapter shows how Tennant's rewritings destabilize notions of originality, identity, and agency, and represent political discourses and social progress in an ambivalent way. While this thesis offers very specific insights into Tennant's work, the close readings also encompass broader themes, such as feminism and postmodernism, the gothic, myths of home and exile, and the ventriloquistic techniques of pastiche and biofiction. The arguments centered on her work contribute to the larger discourse on rewriting in two ways. First, in problematizing assumptions that rewriting inherently strives toward progress or correction, this thesis argues that rewriting can dramatize the ambiguity and ambivalence that haunt acts of resistance. Second, in advancing challenges to the idea that intertextuality functions anonymously, it argues that rewriting can <b>return</b> <b>agency</b> to the text by offering representations of authorship that engage with literary and cultural history. </p...|$|E

40|$|The rise of {{index funds}} {{has been one}} of the most {{remarkable}} phenomena in the fund industry over the last 25 years. The traditional rationale for the success of index funds is based on market efficiency, net of transactions costs. In addition, we focus on the role played by agency conflicts between fund managers and investors, which are hard to resolve given the low power of statistical tests of performance. Most of the empirical evidence about the superiority of index funds is from the US. We discuss issues in the application of index funds in developing countries, and the policy issues in the financial sector that impact on the enabling market infrastructure for index funds. Finally, we apply these ideas to thinking about the relevance of index funds in pension investment.

40|$|Corporations in many {{countries}} are run by controlling shareholders whose cash flow rights in the firm are substantially smaller than their control rights. This separation of ownership and control allows the controlling shareholders to pursue private benefits {{at the cost of}} minority investors by diverting resources away from the firm and distorting corporate investment and payout policies. We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model to study the asset pricing and welfare implications of imperfect investor protection. The model predicts that countries with weaker investor protection have more incentives to overinvest, lower Tobin’s q, higher return volatility, larger risk premium, and higher interest rate, consistent with existing empirical evidence. We show that weak investor protection causes significant wealth redistribution from outside shareholders to controlling shareholders. Finally, we provide evidence consistent with our model’s two new predictions: countries with higher investment-capital ratios have both larger variance of GDP growth and larger variance of stock <b>returns.</b> <b>agency</b> conflicts; asset pricing; investment specific technological change; investor protection; overinvestment...|$|R
