He escapes after killing the sole remaining guard {{and makes his}} way home, {{only to discover that}} his mother had also died during the pandemic. Price's remorselessness and violent streak provide an element of friction within the group, though he is often proven <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> darker side of human nature. Largely through his relationship with Anya, Tom becomes quite loyal to the group. At the close of the second series (and the programme), Tom has secreted himself aboard a consortium aeroplane bound for parts unknown.|$|E

Cyclops and the X-Men believe that the Phoenix Force will save their race, and oppose Captain America's wishes.

The Phoenix Force eventually possesses the five X-Men present, leaving the Avengers at an extreme disadvantage. The Phoenix Five, who become corrupted by the power of the Phoenix, are eventually defeated and scattered, with Cyclops imprisoned for turning the world into a police state and murdering Charles Xavier after being pushed too far, only for him to note that, in the end, he was proven <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Phoenix's intentions.

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it.

[...] D. B.

[...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show.

500|$|Cancellara {{was again}} {{thought to be}} the odds-on {{favorite}} at the next monument classic, Paris–Roubaix. After an aggressive first two hours of racing kept any breakaway groups from going clear, a leading group of 21 slowly formed between the start of the cobbles and the Arenberg sector. They took a maximum advantage of two and a half minutes. The second group on the road gradually whittled down to a select group of top favorites. Cancellara tried several times to accelerate out of this group to bridge {{to the front of the}} race. Thor Hushovd, Alessandro Ballan, and Juan Antonio Flecha marked his moves, but did not contribute any work, instead simply holding Cancellara's wheel. Eventually, Cancellara decided against towing the superior sprinter Hushovd to the front of the race with him, and for a while forewent further attacks. During this time, the leaders' time gap held steady at about 90 seconds for many kilometers. <b>Right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> time that Johan Vansummeren attacked from the leading group and got free to occupy first position on the road, with [...] left to race, Cancellara did likewise out of the group of favorites, putting in easily his most intensive pull. Only Hushovd and Ballan could follow, and they stormed past the remnants of the earlier breakaway, with the exception of Vansummeren who remained out front for victory. Cancellara bested Maarten Tjallingii and Grégory Rast in a sprint for second place 19 seconds back of the Belgian. Cancellara again rued after the race that everyone had marked him and only him. He claimed that the non-cooperation of riders like Hushovd and Ballan had meant victory for him was not possible, and so second place for him was like a victory that day. Vaughters commented that Cancellara was indeed the strongest single rider in the race, but his squad had been the strongest team, which was why they won. Cancellara was also badly isolated from his teammates as a result of his rivals' tactics and his teammates' lesser form. The only other Leopard Trek rider after to finish the race was Mortensen in 94th, almost 14 minutes down. Cancellara's ride was not entirely without reward, as it was after Paris–Roubaix that he attained the UCI world number one ranking, thanks mostly to his three podium finishes at the monuments.|$|E
