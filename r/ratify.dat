5|$|Three {{states did}} not {{complete}} action on the twelve articles of amendment when they were initially put before the states. Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to <b>ratify.</b> Both chambers of the Massachusetts General Court ratified {{a number of the}} amendments (the Senate adopted 10 of 12 and the House 9 of 12), but failed to reconcile their two lists or to send official notice to the Secretary of State of the ones they did agree upon. Both houses of the Connecticut General Assembly voted to <b>ratify</b> Articles Three through Twelve but failed to reconcile their bills after disagreeing over whether to <b>ratify</b> Articles One and Two. All three later ratified the Constitutional amendments originally known as Articles Three through Twelve as part of the 1939 commemoration of the Bill of Rights' sesquicentennial: Massachusetts on March 2, Georgia on March 18, and Connecticut on April 19. Connecticut and Georgia would also later <b>ratify</b> Article Two, on May 13, 1987 and February 2, 1988 respectively.|$|E

5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to <b>ratify</b> the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to <b>ratify</b> the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{describes}} how a North Korean underground nuclear test on 25 May 2009 was detected {{and the source}} located by GPS satellites. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of GPS satellites for detecting nuclear explosions enhances the ability to verify compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, giving the United States more reason to <b>ratify</b> it.|$|E
5|$|From 1786 to 1787, {{an armed}} uprising, known as Shays' Rebellion led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays wrought havoc {{throughout}} Massachusetts and ultimately attempted {{to seize the}} Federal armory.

On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state to <b>ratify</b> the United States Constitution.|$|E

50|$|As of 2013, the {{convention}} had been <b>ratified</b> by 46 states. Of the <b>ratifying</b> states, 12 had denounced the treaty by an automatic process which denounces the 1952 convention {{when the state}} <b>ratifies</b> a superseding treaty.|$|R

5|$|On January 14, 1919, Indiana {{became the}} twenty-fifth state to <b>ratify</b> the Eighteenth Amendment, which {{mandated}} nationwide prohibition. Three days later Nebraska became the thirty-sixth state to <b>ratify</b> the amendment, providing the two-thirds majority of states required {{to amend the}} U.S. Constitution. With the beginning of nationwide Prohibition on January 17, 1920, after formal ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the previous day, efforts turned to enforcement of the new law. Protestant support for Prohibition remained intense in Indiana in the 1920s. Shumaker and the IASL lead a statewide grassroots campaign that successfully passed a new prohibition law for the state. Sponsored by Indiana representative Frank Wright and known as the Wright bone-dry law, it was enacted in 1925. The Wright law {{was part of a}} national trend toward stricter prohibition legislation and imposed severe penalties for alcohol possession.|$|E
5|$|The Afghan people revolted {{against the}} PDPA {{government}} {{when the government}} introduced several socialist reforms, including land reforms. By early 1979, twenty-five out of Afghanistan's twenty-eight provinces were unsafe because of armed resistance against the government. On 29 March 1979, the Herat uprising began; the uprising turned the revolt into an open war between the Mujahideen and the Afghan government. It was during this period that Amin became Kabul's strongman. Shortly after the Herat uprising had been crushed, the Revolutionary Council convened to <b>ratify</b> the new Five-Year Plan, the Afghan–Soviet Friendship Treaty, and to vote {{on whether or not}} to reorganise the cabinet and to enhance the power of the executive (the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council). While the official version of events said that all issues were voted on democratically at the meeting, the Revolutionary Council held another meeting the following day to <b>ratify</b> the new Five-Year Plan and to discuss the reorganisation of the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The Estates-General were {{convened in}} May 1789 to <b>ratify</b> {{financial}} reforms.

5|$|The {{extensive}} {{environmental damage}} {{that resulted from}} usage of the herbicide prompted the United Nations to pass Resolution 31/72 and <b>ratify</b> the Environmental Modification Convention. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban {{on the use of}} herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require case-by-case consideration.|$|E
5|$|The first {{assemblies}} of the Republic {{emerged during}} the Kingdom, with their use to <b>ratify</b> regal elections and the repurposing of the comitia centuriata to elect the first consuls.

5|$|After the war, {{he moved}} back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson {{was a member of}} the Committee of Nine, led by Alexander H. H. Stuart, that sought Virginia's {{readmission}} to the Union. At issue was the new state constitution, which included disenfranchisement of many white males. The committee successfully negotiated with the Federal government to have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and <b>ratify</b> the new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E
