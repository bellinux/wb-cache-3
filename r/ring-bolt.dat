60|$|But {{hold them}} fast--all {{those who have}} not yet weighed their anchors for the Navy-round and round, hitch over hitch, bind your leading-strings on them, and {{clinching}} a <b>ring-bolt</b> into your chimmey-jam, moor your boys fast to that best of harbours, the hearth-stone.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} more and they swept round {{into the space}} where the hut had once stood. There was nothing left but the bit of rope {{that had been made}} fast to the <b>ring-bolt.</b> Poor Winklemann let his paddle drop and sank almost double with his face in his hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wot {{a bag of}} impudence it is!" [...] said Dick Moy, {{catching}} the <b>ring-bolt</b> {{on the top of}} the buoy with the boat-hook, and holding the boat as close to it as possible, while his mates dipped their brushes in the black and white paint respectively, and began to work with the energy of men who know that their opportunity may be cut short at any moment by a sudden squall or increasing swell.|$|E
60|$|Four sailors {{folded up}} the chairs, piled them together, and passing cords over them lashed them to two <b>ring-bolts.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Excepting the <b>ring-bolts,</b> eye-bolts, and belaying-pins {{scattered}} about the decks, this bright-work, as it is called, is principally about the guns, embracing the [...] "monkey-tails" [...] of the carronades, the screws, prickers, little irons, and other things.|$|R
6000|$|Without {{being at}} all neat about his premises, this old cook was very {{particular}} about them; {{he had a}} warm love and affection for his cook-house. In fair weather, he spread the skirt of an old jacket before the door, {{by way of a}} mat; and screwed a small <b>ring-bolt</b> into the door for a knocker; and wrote his name, [...] "Mr. Thompson," [...] over it, with a bit of red chalk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's {{a friend}} of mine,' murmured the Captain, in an absent manner, 'but he's at present {{coasting}} round to Whitby, that would deliver such an opinion on this subject, or any other that could be named, as would give Parliament six and beat 'em. Been knocked overboard, that man,' said the Captain, 'twice, and none the worse for it.

60|$|Had it been my affair, I believe I {{should have}} obeyed a ridiculous impulse and begged {{them to keep}} it for their trouble; so weary was I of the machine. Byfield, however, {{directed}} them to slit a seam of the oiled silk and cut away the car, which was by this time wholly submerged {{and not to be}} lifted. At once the Lunardi collapsed and became manageable; and having roped it to a <b>ring-bolt</b> astern, the crew fell to their oars.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, {{that were}} impossible. A jerk from the {{tow-rope}} of a steamer {{at full speed}} would tear us asunder. Have you observed these two strong ropes running all round our gunwale, and the bridles across with <b>ring-bolts</b> in them?" ...|$|R
60|$|The further {{extremity}} of the cuddy, overhanging the ship's stern, was {{pierced with}} three openings, windows or port-holes, according as men or cannon might peer, socially or unsocially, out of them. At present neither men nor cannon were seen, though huge <b>ring-bolts</b> and other rusty iron fixtures of the wood-work hinted of twenty-four-pounders.|$|R
6000|$|... "Faix, an' {{it would}} be a rale misfortune if there was, sir," [...] remarked Bryan, who came up at this moment, and touched his cap; [...] "for {{it would be}} only sperits and wather, which wouldn't kape in this cowld climate. I've {{finished}} the <b>ring-bolts</b> for the sled, sir, an' came to see when ye would have them fixed." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{first he}} thought he had left the {{alleyway}} in the very moment of her sinking. The bridge ladders had been washed away, but an enormous sea filling the after-deck floated him up. After that he had to lie on his stomach for some time, holding to a <b>ring-bolt,</b> getting his breath now and then, and swallowing salt water. He struggled farther on his hands and knees, too frightened and distracted to turn back. In this way he reached the after-part of the wheelhouse. In that comparatively sheltered spot he found the second mate.|$|E
60|$|The sun {{was rising}} and the mist rolled {{back from the}} lagoon. The tide was low and Arcturus' rusty side rose high above the smooth green water. Damp weed hung from the beams in her poop cabin and a dull light came down through the broken glass. A sailor, {{kneeling}} on the slimy planks, tried to force a corroded <b>ring-bolt</b> from its niche; another trimmed a smoky lantern. Lister, Brown and Montgomery waited. In the half-light, their faces looked gray and worn. The sun had given them a dull pallor, and on the West African coast nobody sleeps much.|$|E
60|$|Dorkin {{made some}} grumbling reply {{as he stepped}} upon the rock, and {{fastened}} the painter to a <b>ring-bolt.</b> His comrades sprang after him, and while some began to heave the tools from the boat, others busied themselves round {{the base of the}} column, which had by that time risen to a considerable height. It looked massive enough to bid defiance to wind and waves, however fierce their fury. Some such thought must have passed through Mr Rudyerd's mind just then, for a satisfied smile lighted up his usually grave features as he directed the men to arrange the tackle of the crane, by which the stones were to be removed from the boat to their place on the building. They were all quickly at work; for they knew from experience how suddenly their operations might be cut short by a gale.|$|E
60|$|Before he left Genoa he {{had thought}} that it was {{possible}} that he might make this sort of an attack upon the Dunkery Beacon, and he had therefore provided for it. He had shipped a number of grappling-irons with long chains attached which were run through <b>ring-bolts</b> on his deck. With these and other appliances for making fast to a vessel alongside, Banker was sure he could stick to an enemy or a prize as long as he wanted to lie by her.|$|R
6000|$|Dazed, I {{put my hand}} to my hair to find it {{warm and}} {{wringing}} wet. When I had been hit, I knew not. But I shook my head, for {{the very notion of}} that cockpit turned my stomach. The blood was streaming from a gash in his own temple, to which he gave no heed, and stood encouraging that panting line until at last the gun was got across and hooked to the <b>ring-bolts</b> of its companion that lay shattered there. [...] "Serve her with double-headed, my lads," [...] he shouted, [...] "and every shot into the Englishman's mainmast!" ...|$|R
50|$|From 1879 to 1887, the The Southwestern Mining Company was mining large {{quantities}} of salt in the mountains along the Virgin River, and had leased steamboats of the Colorado Steam Navigation Company to ship it to their mill at Eldorado Canyon. In April 1883, Captain J. A. Mellon took a small boat up river to Devil's Gate Canyon to plant six ring bolts eight inches in diameter, four feet long, made of 1.75 inches of iron. These <b>ring-bolts</b> were {{for the purpose of}} securing lines from the steamers as they passed over the dangerous rapids of Devil's Gate Canyon, during the high water runs of their boats to the mouth of the Virgin River at Rioville.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{unsettled}} weather {{is as much}} as a mile an hour against us," [...] observed Captain Truck, who was far from pleased at the fact of his being outsailed by anything that floated; [...] "and, if truth must be said, I think that fellow has somewhere about half a knot the best of it, in the way of foot, on a bowline and with this breeze. But he has no cargo in, and they trim their boats like steel-yards. Give us more wind, or a freer, and I would leave him to digest his orders, as a shark digests a marling-spike, or a <b>ring-bolt,</b> notwithstanding all his advantages; for little good would it then do him to be trying to run into the wind's eye, like a steam-tug. As it is, we must submit. We are certainly in a category, and be d---d to it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|One inch more, {{five minutes}} longer, and the flood would reach {{the bodies of}} the old couple. Liz looked round wildly for some mode of {{delivering}} them, but looked in vain. Even if her strength had been adequate, there was no higher object in the room to which she could have lifted them. The bed, being a truckle one, and lower than the chairs, was already submerged, and old Liz herself was coolly, if not calmly, seated in two inches of water. At the very last moment deliverance came in an unexpected manner. There was a slight vibration in the timbers of the hut, then a sliding of the whole edifice. This was followed by a snap and a jolt: the <b>ring-bolt</b> or the rope had gone, and old Liz might, with perfect propriety, have exclaimed, {{in the words of the}} sea song, [...] "I'm afloat! I'm afloat! and the Rover is free!" ...|$|E
60|$|And as we {{laid out}} on the next tack to wind-ward, I bent a piece of line to a small {{grappling}} hook I had seen lying in the bail-hole. The end of the line I made fast to the <b>ring-bolt</b> in the bow, and with the hook out of sight I waited for the next opportunity to use it. Once more they made their leeward pull down the port side of the Lancashire Queen, and once more we churned down after them before the wind. Nearer and nearer we drew, and I was making believe to reach for them as before. The stern of the skiff was not six feet away, and they were laughing at me derisively as they ducked under the ship's stern. At that instant I suddenly arose and threw the grappling iron. It caught fairly and squarely on the rail of the skiff, which was jerked backward out of safety as the rope tautened and the salmon boat ploughed on.|$|E
60|$|The lesson {{would have}} been easier had the deck been at all free; but there {{appeared}} to be a place on it for everything and anything except a man. Forward lay the windlass and its tackle, with the chain and hemp cables, all very unpleasant to trip over; the fo'c'sle stovepipe, and the gurry-butts by the fo'c'sle-hatch to hold the fish-livers. Aft of these the fore-boom and booby of the main-hatch took all the space that was not needed for the pumps and dressing-pens. Then came the nests of dories lashed to <b>ring-bolts</b> by the quarter-deck; the house, with tubs and oddments lashed all around it; and, last, the sixty-foot main-boom in its crutch, splitting things lengthwise, to duck and dodge under every time.|$|R
6000|$|One afternoon, I {{was walking}} with him along the gun-deck, when he paused {{abreast of the}} main-mast. [...] "This part of the ship," [...] said he, [...] "we called the {{slaughter-house}} on board the Macedonian. Here the men fell, five and six at a time. An enemy always directs its shot here, in order to hurl over the mast, if possible. The beams and carlines overhead in the Macedonian slaughter-house were spattered with blood and brains. About the hatchways {{it looked like a}} butcher's stall; bits of human flesh sticking in the <b>ring-bolts.</b> A pig that ran about the decks escaped unharmed, but his hide was so clotted with blood, from rooting among the pools of gore, that when the ship struck the sailors hove the animal overboard, swearing that it would be rank cannibalism to eat him." ...|$|R
60|$|I went between-decks, {{where the}} {{families}} with children swarmed in the dark, where unavoidable confusion had been caused by the last arrivals, and where the confusion was increased by the little preparations for dinner {{that were going on}} in each group. A few women here and there, had got lost, and were laughing at it, and asking their way to their own people, or out on deck again. A few of the poor children were crying; but otherwise the universal cheerfulness was amazing. 'We shall shake down by to-morrow.' 'We shall come all right in a day or so.' 'We shall have more light at sea.' Such phrases I heard everywhere, as I groped my way among chests and barrels and beams and unstowed cargo and <b>ring-bolts</b> and Emigrants, down to the lower-deck, and thence up to the light of day again, and to my former station.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{no longer}} hesitated what to do. I {{resolved}} to lash myself securely {{to the water}} cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my brother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us, and did {{everything in my power}} to make him understand what I was about to do. I thought at length that he comprehended my design--but, whether this was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move from his station by the <b>ring-bolt.</b> It was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another moment's hesitation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our {{boat was}} the lightest feather {{of a thing}} that ever sat upon water. It had a {{complete}} flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and this hatch {{it had always been}} our custom to batten down when about to cross the Ström, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But for this circumstance we should have foundered at once--for we lay entirely buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands grasping a <b>ring-bolt</b> near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this--which was undoubtedly the very best thing I could have done--for I was too much flurried to think.|$|E
6000|$|His {{voice had}} {{produced}} {{no apparent effect}} on his friend; but, at the light touch of his hand in passing, Midwinter started, and moved out slowly from {{the shadow of the}} bulwark. [...] "Come along!" [...] cried Allan, suspending his singing for a moment, and glancing back. Still, without a word of answer, the other followed. Thrice he stopped before he reached the stern end of the wreck: the first time, to throw aside his hat, and push back his hair from his forehead and temples; the second time, reeling, giddy, to hold for a moment by a <b>ring-bolt</b> close at hand; the last time (though Allan was plainly visible a few yards ahead), to look stealthily behind him, with the furtive scrutiny of a man who believes that other footsteps are following him in the dark. [...] "Not yet!" [...] he whispered to himself, with eyes that searched the empty air. [...] "I shall see him astern, with his hand on the lock of the cabin door." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{our arrival}} at Samarang, the mate got a doctor from a Dutch frigate, {{to look at}} me, who {{declared}} nothing ailed me. By these means nearly all hands in the ship were set against me, but my four companions, and the little boy fancying that I was a skulk, and throwing labour on them. I was ordered on deck, and set to work graffing <b>ring-bolts</b> for the guns. Walk I could not, being obliged, literally, to crawl along the deck {{on my hands and}} knees. I suffered great pain, but got no credit for it. The work was easy enough for me, when once seated at it, but it caused me infinite suffering to move. I was not alone in being thought a skulk, however. The doctor himself was taken ill, and the mate accused him, too, very much as he did me, of shirking duty. Unfortunately, the poor man gave him the lie, by dying.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's mair shifts by stealing, Jeanie," [...] said Madge Wildfire; [...] "though whiles I {{can hardly}} get our mother to think sae. Wha wad hae thought but mysell {{of making a}} bolt of my ain back-bane? But it's no sae strong as thae that I hae seen in the Tolbooth at Edinburgh.

6000|$|Miles had not to wait long. The gale when fully [...] "brewed up" [...] {{proved to}} be no mean {{descendant}} {{of the family of}} storms which have tormented the celebrated bay since the present economy of nature began; and many of those who were on board of the troop-ship at that time had their eyes opened and their minds enlarged as to the nature of a thorough gale; when hatches have to be battened down, and the dead-lights closed; when steersmen have to be fastened in their places, and the maddened sea seems to roar defiance to the howling blast, and all things movable on deck are swept away as if they were straws, and many things not meant to be movable are wrenched from their fastenings with a violence that nothing formed by man can resist, and timbers creak and groan, and loose furniture gyrates about until smashed to pieces, and well-guarded glass and crockery leap out of bounds to irrecoverable ruin, and even the seamen plunge about and stagger, and landsmen hold on to <b>ring-bolts</b> and belaying-pins, or cling to bulkheads for dear life, while mighty billows, thundering in-board, hiss along the decks, and everything, above, below, and around, seems being swept into eternity by the besom of destruction! ...|$|R
60|$|A Sag Harbor ship {{visited his}} father's bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full {{complement}} of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's influence could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, {{he sat down in}} the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a <b>ring-bolt</b> there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{often we}} made the circuit of the belt it is {{impossible}} to say. We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than floating, getting gradually more and more {{into the middle of the}} surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time I had never let go of the <b>ring-bolt.</b> My brother was at the stern, holding on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act--although I knew he was a madman when he did it--a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did not care, however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even keel--only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl. Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.|$|E
6000|$|Hours passed. They were {{sheltered}} by {{the heavy}} inclination {{of the ship}} from the wind that rushed in one long unbroken moan above their heads, but cold rain showers fell at times into the uneasy calm of their refuge. Under the torment of that new infliction a pair of shoulders would writhe a little. Teeth chattered. The sky was clearing, and bright sunshine gleamed over the ship. After every burst of battering seas, vivid and fleeting rainbows arched over the drifting hull in the flick of sprays. The gale was ending in a clear blow, which gleamed and cut like a knife. Between two bearded shellbacks Charley, fastened with somebody's long muffler to a deck <b>ring-bolt,</b> wept quietly, with rare tears wrung out by bewilderment, cold, hunger, and general misery. One of his neighbours punched him in the ribs asking roughly:--"What's the matter with your cheek? In fine weather there's no holding you, youngster." [...] Turning about with prudence he worked himself out of his coat and threw it over the boy. The other man closed up, muttering:--"'Twill make a bloomin' man of you, sonny." [...] They flung their arms over and pressed against him. Charley drew his feet up and his eyelids dropped. Sighs were heard, as men, perceiving {{that they were not}} to be [...] "drowned in a hurry," [...] tried easier positions. Mr. Creighton, who had hurt his leg, lay amongst us with compressed lips. Some fellows belonging to his watch set about securing him better. Without a word or a glance he lifted his arms one after another to facilitate the operation, and not a muscle moved in his stern, young face. They asked him with solicitude:--"Easier now, sir?" [...] He answered with a curt:--"That'll do." [...] He was a hard young officer, but many of his watch used to say they liked him well enough because he had [...] "such a gentlemanly way of damning us up and down the deck." [...] Others unable to discern such fine shades of refinement, respected him for his smartness. For {{the first time since the}} ship had gone on her beam ends Captain Allistoun gave a short glance down at his men. He was almost upright--one foot against the side of the skylight, one knee on the deck; and with the end of the vang round his waist swung back and forth with his gaze fixed ahead, watchful, like a man looking out for a sign. Before his eyes the ship, with half her deck below water, rose and fell on heavy seas that rushed from under her flashing in the cold sunshine. We began to think she was wonderfully buoyant--considering. Confident voices were heard shouting:--"She'll do, boys!" [...] Belfast exclaimed with fervour:--"I would giv' a month's pay for a draw at a pipe!" [...] One or two, passing dry tongues on their salt lips, muttered something about a [...] "drink of water." [...] The cook, as if inspired, scrambled up with his breast against the poop water-cask and looked in. There was a little at the bottom. He yelled, waving his arms, and two men began to crawl backwards and forwards with the mug. We had a good mouthful all round. The master shook his head impatiently, refusing. When it came to Charley one of his neighbours shouted:--"That bloom-in' boy's asleep." [...] He slept as though he had been dosed with narcotics. They let him be. Singleton held to the wheel with one hand while he drank, bending down to shelter his lips from the wind. Wamibo had to be poked and yelled at before he saw the mug held before his eyes. Knowles said sagaciously:--"It's better'n a tot o' rum." [...] Mr. Baker grunted:--"Thank ye." [...] Mr. Creighton drank and nodded. Donkin gulped greedily, glaring over the rim. Belfast made us laugh when with grimacing mouth he shouted:--"Pass it this way. We're all taytottlers here." [...] The master, presented with the mug again by a crouching man, who screamed up at him:--"We all had a drink, captain," [...] groped for it without ceasing to look ahead, and handed it back stiffly as though he could not spare half a glance away from the ship. Faces brightened. We shouted to the cook:--"Well done, doctor!" [...] He sat to leeward, propped by the water-cask and yelled back abundantly, but the seas were breaking in thunder just then, and we only caught snatches that sounded like: [...] "Providence" [...] and [...] "born again." [...] He was at his old game of preaching. We made friendly but derisive gestures at him, and from below he lifted one arm, holding on with the other, moved his lips; he beamed up to us, straining his voice--earnest, and ducking his head before the sprays.|$|E
6000|$|From {{first to}} last the seaman's {{thoughts}} {{are very much}} concerned with his anchors. It {{is not so much}} that the anchor is a symbol of hope as that it is the heaviest object that he has to handle on board his ship at sea in the usual routine of his duties. The beginning and the end of every passage are marked distinctly by work about the ship's anchors. A vessel in the Channel has her anchors always ready, her cables shackled on, and the land almost always in sight. The anchor and the land are indissolubly connected in a sailor's thoughts. But directly she is clear of the narrow seas, heading out into the world with nothing solid to speak of between her and the South Pole, the anchors are got in and the cables disappear from the deck. But the anchors do not disappear. Technically speaking, they are [...] "secured in-board"; and, on the forecastle head, lashed down to <b>ring-bolts</b> with ropes and chains, under the straining sheets of the head-sails, they look very idle and as if asleep. Thus bound, but carefully looked after, inert and powerful, those emblems of hope make company for the look-out man in the night watches; and so the days glide by, with a long rest for those characteristically shaped pieces of iron, reposing forward, visible from almost every part of the ship's deck, waiting for their work {{on the other side of}} the world somewhere, while the ship carries them on with a great rush and splutter of foam underneath, and the sprays of the open sea rust their heavy limbs.|$|R
6000|$|Spike had tact {{enough to}} {{understand}} he {{would be out of}} his element in assisting females along that plank, and he was busy in sending what he called [...] "the old lady's dunnage" [...] on board, and in discharging the cabman. As soon as this was done, he sprang into the main-channels, and thence vid the bulwarks, on deck, ordering the plank to be hauled aboard. A solitary labourer was paid a quarter to throw off the fasts from the <b>ring-bolts</b> and posts, and everything was instantly in motion to cast the brig loose. Work went on as if the vessel were in haste, and it consequently went on with activity. Spike bestirred himself, giving his orders in a way to denote he had been long accustomed to exercise authority on the deck of a vessel, and knew his calling to its minuti. The only ostensible difference between his deportment to-day and on any ordinary occasion, perhaps, was in the circumstance that he now seemed anxious to get clear of the wharf, and that in a way which might have attracted notice in any suspicious and attentive observer. It is possible that such a one was not very distant, and that Spike was aware of his presence, for a respectable-looking, well-dressed, middle-aged man had come down one of the adjacent streets, to a spot within a hundred yards of the wharf, and stood silently watching the movements of the brig, as he leaned against a fence. The want of houses in that quarter enabled any person to see this stranger from the deck of the Swash, but no one on board her seemed to regard him at all, unless it might be the master.|$|R

Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;-- that's not good. Best spill it?--wait. I'll cure myself of this. I'll hold the musket boldly while I think.--I come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and doom,-- that's fair for Moby Dick. It's a fair wind that's only fair for that accursed fish.--The very tube he pointed at me!--the very one; this one--I hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.--Aye and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead {{reckoning}} of the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear {{that he would have}} no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom with him?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this instant-- put aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,--in there, he's sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I can't withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye, and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow; say'st all of us are Ahabs. Great God forbid!-- But is there no other way? no lawful way?--Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man's living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to <b>ring-bolts</b> on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law.--Aye, aye, 'tis so.-- Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin together?-- And would I be a murderer, then, if"--and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket's end against the door.|$|R
