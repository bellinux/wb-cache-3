To study the transport processes, however, handling the phenomena from Lagrangian viewpoint is necessary. Many factors like tide, wind and density are related to <b>residual</b> <b>currents.</b> In case of Osaka Bay, additionally, the existence of currents running toward the east in the Seto island sea (the constant flow) is pointed out in the previous studies, and the currents has influence on transport processes.

40|$|Study on tidal {{waves and}} <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> in Mayalibit Bay was {{conducted}} by constructing the 2 D numerical hydrodynamics to find the characteristics of tide and <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> inside the Bay. The 2 D hydrodynamic equations with non-linier terms were solved by finite difference methods explicitly. M 2 and K 1 wave propagations were observed and analyzed at 25 observation points. M 2 and K 1 <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> were obtained and described spatially. Simulation results of tidal currents were validated with field measurements. The validation result showed that the tidal currents between the model results and field measurements were quite fit. Generally, simulation results showed the {{significant differences between the}} tide inside and outside the Bay. This was strongly explained by the simulation results of M 2 and K 1 wave propagations. The M 2 and K 1 amplitudes were 10 times lower inside than outside the Bay with the phase lags of about 180 °(M 2) and 160 °(K 1). This result indicated that the tide inside and outside the Bay were in the opposite conditions. The tide had an ebb inside while the flood was outside and vice versa. M 2 <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> was flowed into the Bay uniformly, while K 1 <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> flowed out to the open sea in the Northern part and it flowed into the Bay in the Southern part of the Bay.

40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>currents</b> {{induced by}} {{asymmetric}} tidal mixing were examined for weakly stratified, narrow estuaries using analytical and numerical models. The analytical model {{is an extension}} of the work of R. K. McCarthy, with the addition of tidal variations of the vertical eddy viscosity in the longitudinal momentum equation. The longitudinal distribution of residual flows driven by asymmetric tidal mixing is determined by the tidal current amplitude and by asymmetries in tidal mixing between flood and ebb. In a long channel, the magnitude of the residual flow induced by asymmetric tidal mixing is maximum at the estuary mouth and decreases upstream following the longitudinal distribution of tidal current amplitude. Larger asymmetry in tidal mixing between flood and ebb produces stronger <b>residual</b> <b>currents.</b> For typical tidal asymmetry, mixing is stronger during flood than during ebb and results in two-layer <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> with seaward flow near the surface and landward flow near the bottom. For reverse tidal asymmetry, mixing is weaker during flood than during ebb and the resulting residual flow is landward near the surface and seaward near the bottom. Also, the residual flow induced by tidal asymmetry has the same order of magnitude as the density-driven flow and therefore is important to estuarine dynamics. Numerical experiments with a primitive-equation numerical model [the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) ] generally support the pattern of <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> driven by tidal asymmetry suggested by the analytical mode...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts: (I) variability of currents and water properties in late spring in the northern Great South Channel and (II) numerical study of stratified tidal rectification over Georges Bank. In part I, the combined analysis of CTD, ADCP, satellite-track drifters, and zooplankton distributions in the northern Great South Channel clearly shows (1) the seasonal evolution of the surface low salinity plume, (2) the three-dimensional structure of residual flow, and (3) a coherent relationship between the surface low salinity plume and high concentration of zooplankton. In part II, the numerical model of Georges Bank shows that as the fluid becomes stratified, tidal mixing and rectification intensify both along- and cross-bank <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> and modify the vertical structure of the flow. Along- and cross-bank <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> increase as either stratification increases or {{the depth of the}} bank decreases.

40|$|Time {{variability}} of Eulerian <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> in the German Bight (North Sea) is studied drawing on existing multi-decadal 2 D barotropic simulations (1. 6 km resolution) {{for the period}} Jan. 1958 –Aug. 2015. <b>Residual</b> <b>currents</b> are calculated as 25 h means of velocity fields stored every hour. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals that daily variations of these <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> can be reasonably well represented in terms of only 2 – 3 degrees of freedom, partly linked to wind directions. The daily data refine monthly data already used in the past. Unlike existing classifications based on subjective assessment, numerical principal components (PCs) provide measures of strength and can directly be incorporated into more comprehensive statistical data analyses. Daily resolution in particular fits the time schedule of data sampled at the German Bight long-term monitoring station at Helgoland Roads. An example demonstrates the use of PCs and corresponding empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) for the interpretation of short-term variations of these local observations. On the other hand, monthly averaging of the daily PCs enables to link up with previous studies on longer timescales...|$|R

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} numerical lattice is used {{to study}} a topographically trapped motion around islands and shallow banks of the western Barents Sea caused both by the semidiurnal and diurnal tidal waves. Observations and model computations {{in the vicinity of}} Bear Island show well-developed trapped motion with distinctive tidal oscillatory motion. Numerical investigations demonstrate that one source of the trapped motion is tidal current rectification over shallow topgraphy. Tidal motion supports <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> of the order of 8 cm/s around Bear Island and shallow Spitsbergenbanken. The structures of enhanced tidal currents for the semidiurnal components are generated in the shallow areas due to topographic amplification. In the diurnal band of oscillations the maximum current is associated with the shelf wave occurrence. <b>Residual</b> <b>currents</b> due to diurnal tides occur at both the shallow areas and the shelf slope in regions of maximum topographic gradients. Surface manifestation of the diurnal current enhancement is the local maximum of tidal amplitude at the shelf break of the order of 5 to 10 cm.

40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>currents</b> {{induced by}} {{asymmetric}} tidal mixing (ATM) were examined using {{a series of}} idealized numerical experiments for weakly stratified, partially mixed, and highly stratified narrow estuaries that neglected lateral variations of bathymetry {{and the effects of}} Earth's rotation. The Eulerian <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> were decomposed into four components, i. e., river-induced, density-driven, nonlinearities-induced, and ATM-induced flows such that the longitudinal distribution and strength of each component can be depicted and evaluated. In weakly stratified estuaries, ATM-induced flow has a two-layer structure similar to that of density-driven flow. It reinforces the estuarine exchange flow. In partially mixed and highly stratified estuaries, the ATM-induced flow tends to have a three-layer structure with landward flows near the surface and the bottom and seaward flow {{in the middle of the}} water column. It appears to act against the estuarine exchange flow in parts of the water column. The relative importance of ATM-induced flow to estuarine <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> varies in different types of estuaries. Compared to the density-driven flow, the relative importance of ATM-induced flow decreases as stratification increases. In the central regime of the estuary, the strength of the ATM-induced flow is greater than that of density-driven flow under weak stratification and tends to be smaller under strong stratification...|$|R

40|$|Coherent sandy shoals that migrate {{toward the}} downdrift coast are {{observed}} on many ebb-tidal deltas. In this study, processes {{that cause the}} growth and migration of shoals on ebb-tidal deltas are identified. Moreover, {{the effect of the}} incident wave energy and the tidal prism of an inlet on the migration speed of these shoals is investigated. For this, a numerical morphodynamic model with an idealized geometric setup is employed. The model computes the bed level evolution due to local erosion and deposition of sand driven by tides and waves. Analysis of model results shows that shoals grow when there is a local imbalance between the bathymetry and the wave conditions, which in this study was imposed by manually breaching the ebb-tidal delta or by adding storms to the wave forcing. There are thresholds for shoal formation that depend on the distribution of the sand and the incident wave energy. Wave refraction over the shoals leads to focusing of wave energy and increased wave energy dissipation around the location of the local minimum water depth. This generates <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> over the shoal and increased skin friction toward the local minimum water depth, which together create a sand transport pattern that induces the growth and migration of the shoal. Sand transport due to asymmetric waves contributes to keeping the shoal a coherent structure. The shoal migration speed increases with increasing incident wave energy and decreasing tidal prism; this is because tidal <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> oppose the wave-driven <b>residual</b> <b>currents</b> that cause shoal migration...|$|R
