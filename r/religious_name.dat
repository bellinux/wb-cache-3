In 1910, Kolbe was allowed to enter the novitiate, where {{he was given the}} <b>religious</b> <b>name</b> Maximilian.

5|$|Levski {{began his}} {{education}} {{at a school}} in Karlovo, studying homespun tailoring as a local craftsman's apprentice. In 1855, Levski's uncle Basil—archimandrite and envoy of the Hilandar monastery—took him to Stara Zagora, where he attended school and worked as Basil's servant. Afterward, Levski joined a clerical training course. On 7 December 1858, he became an Orthodox monk in the Sopot monastery under the <b>religious</b> <b>name</b> Ignatius (Игнатий, Ignatiy) and was promoted in 1859 to hierodeacon, which later inspired one of Levski's informal nicknames, The Deacon (Дякона, Dyakona).|$|E
5|$|By 1858, Malo-Galipeau {{had become}} widely {{recognised}} as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters, {{partly due to}} her role as Mother Superior and {{partly due to the}} endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival. This understanding was reflected in published works of the time, including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853. However, during Bourget's visit to the Institute in late 1858, he made a speech to the assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church, Cadron-Jetté should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation. He also bestowed upon Cadron-Jetté the title of Mother (such that her <b>religious</b> <b>name</b> became Mother Mary of the Nativity, or Mère de la Nativité) and confirmed that she was second in authority only to the current Mother Superior of the community.|$|E

5|$|The album's {{photographs}} were shot by Steven Meisel. Madonna wanted the album title and the cover image to make provocative link between her own <b>religious</b> <b>name</b> Madonna, as the Roman Catholic title for Jesus' mother Mary, and the Christian {{concept of the}} virgin birth. While not a substantial musical departure from Madonna's first album, she felt that the material from Like a Virgin was stronger. Consisting of dance-pop music, the songs also incorporated new wave. After its release, Like a Virgin received mixed reviews from the critics, but was a commercial success. It became Madonna's first number one album on the Billboard 200, while reaching {{the top of the}} charts in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it diamond for shipment of ten million copies across the United States. Worldwide it has sold 21 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the personal naming practices in Konso, a Cushitic-speaking people in southwest Ethiopia. Personal naming in Konso can be formal or informal. Formal personal names are given during a ceremony called sookata, while informal names are given either {{before or after}} the sookata ceremony. This article argues that the Konso have family names in their naming practice. This article analyses the typology of personal names in Konso and shows an intrinsic interplay between poetry, songs and personal names. The unitary state policies of the previous regimes and the proliferation of religions have resulted in trends in which people give Amharic or <b>religious</b> <b>names</b> to their children or replace indigenous Konso personal names either by Amharic or <b>religious</b> <b>names.</b> The new trends of changing indigenous names into Amharic and/or <b>religious</b> (mainly biblical) <b>names</b> compromise the knowledge and role of the Konso language as an expression of culture and an identity marker...|$|R

The study also investigated whether the participants’ attitudes towards <b>religious</b> brand <b>names</b> varied based on levels of religious orientation. The sample of this study consisted of university students residing in Eskisehir. Data were collected from a sample determined by convenience sampling method due to the constraints of time and cost as well as the difficulty in reaching an updated list of university students residing in Eskisehir. Data were obtained with a questionnaire and the drop-and-collect method after briefing the participants. The findings showed that religious brand image and religious orientation had a positive significant influence on the attitudes towards <b>religious</b> brand <b>names</b> and that in comparison with the participants with lower levels of religious orientation, the participants with higher levels of religious orientation held more positive attitudes towards <b>religious</b> brand <b>names.</b> Finally, a significant relationship was found between religious orientation and the brand image of <b>religious</b> brand <b>names...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1823 Anne-Thérèse {{entered the}} young {{congregation}} of the Sisters of Providence of Ruillé-sur-Loir. She {{was given the}} <b>religious</b> <b>name</b> Sister St. Théodore. She professed first vows September 8, 1825, and perpetual vows, {{which at the time}} were optional, on September 5, 1831. Sister St. Théodore was first sent to teach at Preuilly-sur-Claise in central France. There, she became ill, most likely with smallpox, and nearly died. The illness damaged her digestive system and, {{for the rest of her}} life, she could only eat a simple, bland diet.|$|E
25|$|She was {{admitted}} to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in Cologne the following October.

In 1938, she and her sister Rosa, by then also a convert and an extern sister (tertiaries of the Order, who would handle the community′s needs outside the monastery), were sent to the Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands for their safety. Despite the Nazi invasion of that state in 1940, they remained undisturbed until they were arrested by the Nazis on 2 August 1942 and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where they died in the gas chamber on 9 August 1942.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in the Peloponnese {{peninsula}} in southern Greece, of mixed-race parentage, his Greek mother being a noble lady and his father was Albanian. He was tonsured a monk at Epidaurus, taking the <b>religious</b> <b>name</b> of Nephon. He was involved in calligraphy and copying manuscripts. He then followed a monk named Zacharias and settled in the Monastery of the Theotokos in Ohrid. When Zacharias was elected Archbishop of Ohrid, Nephon went to Mount Athos and there he was ordained a hieromonk. In 1482 he was elected Metropolitan of Thessaloniki {{and at the end of}} 1486 he was elected Patriarch of Constantinople, supported by the wealthy rulers of Wallachia, who thus made their entry in the history of external influences on the Patriarchate's election process.|$|E

25|$|Surnames with {{religious}} meanings or connotations are common. It {{is possible that}} some of these originated from an ancestor who converted to Catholicism and intended or needed to demonstrate his new faith.

They were usually baptized with a name related to the date near when they were found or baptized.

25|$|In 1722, Pavlovich {{took the}} monastic vows and adopted the <b>religious</b> <b>name</b> Parteniy (Parthenius).

In 1728, he was ordained a priest and by 1730 {{he was in charge of}} a parish. In 1735, he became a metropolitan bishop's secretary, in 1749 he was ordained as archimandrite, and in 1751 he took holy orders as a vicar bishop of the metropolitan bishop of Karlowitz, Pavle Nenadović. From 1737 to the end of his life, Parteniy was based in the city of Karlowitz in the Habsburg Monarchy's Military Frontier (today Sremski Karlovci in Vojvodina, Serbia), a prospering centre of South Slavic education and culture at the time.|$|E

500|$|Its {{association}} with storms makes the storm petrel a bird of bad omen to mariners; they {{are said to}} either foretell or cause bad weather. A more prosaic explanation of their appearance in rough weather is that, like most oceanic seabirds, they rely on the winds to support them in flight and just sit on the water surface when becalmed. The birds were sometimes thought to be the souls of perished sailors, and killing a petrel was believed to bring bad luck. The petrel's reputation led to the old name of witch, although the commonest of the folk names is Mother Carey's Chicken, a name also used for storm petrels in general in the UK and USA from at least 1767. This is believed to be a corruption of mater cara (dear mother, the Virgin Mary), a reference to the supernatural Mother Carey, or a superstitious modification of an earlier Mother Mary's Chicken to reduce the potency of the <b>religious</b> <b>name.</b> The Mother Carey character appears a number of times in literature. In the Cicely Fox Smith poem [...] "Mother Carey", she calls old sailors to return to the sea, but in John Masefield's poem of the same name she is seen as a wrecker of ships. She appears as a fairy in Charles Kingsley's The Water Babies and is depicted in one of Jessie Willcox Smith's illustrations for the book.|$|E
