500|$|Upon graduation, Osman Hill {{continued}} {{his role as}} a lecturer at the University of Birmingham under an apprenticeship until 1930, but teaching anatomy instead of zoology. [...] In 1930, his career took shape when he moved to Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, to become both Chair of Anatomy and Professor of Anatomy at the Ceylon Medical College (more recently named Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo or Colombo Medical School). His position allowed him to pursue anthropological studies of the indigenous Veddah people and comparative anatomy of primates. [...] During this time, he began developing a private menagerie of exotic and native species. [...] Consisting mostly of a variety of primates and parrots, the collection reported included several types of cockatoo (family Cacatuidae), red-fan parrots (Deroptyus accipitrinus), eclectus parrots (Eclectus roratus), star tortoises (genus Geochelone), leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis), Galápagos tortoises (Chelonoidis nigra), and <b>ruddy</b> <b>mongooses</b> (Herpestes smithii). Osman Hill held this position in Ceylon for 14years, returning to the UK after being appointed as Reader in Anthropology at the University of Edinburgh in 1945. Upon his departure from Ceylon, his menagerie was divided between the London Zoo and the National Zoological Gardens of Sri Lanka.|$|R

50|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>{{mongoose}}</b> (Herpestes smithii) is {{a species}} of mongoose found in hill forests of peninsular India and Sri Lanka. This mongoose, along with the striped-neck and Indian grey mongeese, are the only mongoose species endemic to India and Sri Lanka. The <b>ruddy</b> <b>mongoose</b> is very closely related to Indian grey mongoose, but distinguished by its slightly larger size and black-tipped tail extending for 2 to 3 inches at the distal end. There are two sub-species of this mongoose, H. smithii smithii in India, and H. smithii zeylanicus (Thomas, 1852) in Sri Lanka.|$|E

40|$|During {{the present}} study in Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve (BRT), nine species of small {{carnivores}} viz., Jungle Cat Felis chaus, Rusty-spotted Cat Prionalilurus rubiginosus, Leopard Cat Prionailurus bengalensis, Small Indian Civet Viverricula indica, Asian Palm Civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus, Striped-necked Mongoose Herpestes vitticollis, <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Mongoose</b> Herpestes smithii, Common Mongoose Herpestes edwardsii and Smooth-coated Otter Lutrogale perspicillata, were recorded using camera-trapping technique, transect walks, and night surveys. Vegetation type strongly influences the presence and abundance of each species. The most sightings of small carnivores occurred in dry deciduous forests. Among all the species, the Asian Palm Civet was the most abundant and {{was followed by the}} small Indian Civet. Compared to many other forests or regions in India, the sight records of the Rusty-spotted Cat were relatively higher in BRT. Although we were unable to use statistical methods to search for higher levels of interdependencies between forest types and small carnivore abundance, our study sheds light on patterns of small carnivore distribution in this unique habitat which bridges the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{first ever}} {{detailed}} {{study on the}} small carnivores of the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve (PkTR) in the southern Western Ghats, using camera trap techniques, reported 11 species.   A total of 1, 350 camera-trap nights {{were used for the}} study.   This was supplemented with 242 km of day transects and 344 km of night transects using spot-lights.   The small carnivores reported were the Small Indian Civet Viverricula indica, Common Palm Civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus, Brown Palm Civet Paradoxurus jerdoni, Indian Grey Mongoose Herpestes edwardsii, Stripe-necked Mongoose Herpestes vitticollis, Brown Mongoose Herpestes fuscus, <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Mongoose</b> Herpestes smithii, Smooth-coated Otter Lutrogale perspicillata, Nilgiri Marten Martes gwatkinsii, Jungle Cat Felis chaus and Leopard Cat Prionailurus bengalensis.   About 90 % of the small carnivores captured in the camera traps in PKTR were members of the Viverridae family such as the Small Indian Civet (31. 67 %), Common Palm Civet (30 %) and Brown Palm Civet (28. 33 %).   The study recorded all the four species of mongoose known from the Western Ghats from PkTR.   Two out of the 11 small carnivores belong to the ‘Vulnerable’ category on the IUCN Red List.  </p...|$|E
