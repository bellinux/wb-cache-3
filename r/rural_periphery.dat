50|$|In {{response}} to the constraints and fears of living in Peter's police state, large numbers of serfs absconded, abandoning the major urban areas, especially Moscow and the new capital at St. Petersburg. While some groups emigrated to Poland or Austria, many chose to avoid the border patrols and instead fled to the <b>rural</b> <b>periphery</b> and the river regions already inhabited by the Cossacks. It was Peter's policy to hunt down and arrest absconders and return them to their lords {{where they could be}} counted for taxes, a policy which, by this time, had no statute of limitations. In accordance with this policy, Peter deployed a group of bounty hunters under Yuri Dolgoruki to scout the Cossack regions for fugitive peasants. Despite the fact that the Cossacks harbored some resentment towards the peasants (for overpopulating their region and generally competing for local resources), more deplorable to them was the idea of Petrine agents roaming freely through their territory. They not only refused to give up the fugitive peasants, but on 8 October 1707 a small band of local atamans headed by Kondraty Bulavin ambushed and murdered Dolgoruki and his men in the village of Shulgin on the Aidar River, opening the door to violence and beginning the Bulavin Rebellion.|$|E

Thomas and his father lived in an extended family situation with his maternal grandfather at Linden House at Turnham Green in what was then London's <b>rural</b> <b>periphery.</b> Griffiths was well connected in the literary world and Thomas must have profited from the society that visited Griffiths' home. When Griffiths wrote his will in 1803 Thomas's father was already dead and he himself died later in that year. The child then came under the care of his maternal uncle, George Griffiths. He was educated at the expense of his distant relative, Charles Burney, the headmaster of the Greenwich academy that Wainewright attended. His background was most advantageous and his early adulthood was the evidence that he profited from it.|$|E

40|$|This volume {{provides}} an overview of research on seemingly, current and former peripheral areas and on processes of peripheralisation in Europe. Particular emphasis is given to questions of local and regional governance, to multiple actors of peripheralisation and residential revitalisation as well as to economic and ecological transformations. International audienceIn a context of strengthened metropolization and urban growth, official French spatial categories have erased the references to rural areas as a space distinct from cities and their influence, so that the adjective ‚Äúrural‚Äù appears now to be an out-dated socio-spatial scientific reference. However, this paper intends to demonstrate that <b>rural</b> <b>peripheries</b> in France are still to be considered as a research object per se, since recent changes into the most remote, scarcely populated areas in France have occurred.

40|$|The {{future of}} Europe‚Äôs <b>rural</b> <b>peripheries</b> {{as well as}} the future of rural {{societies}} {{is one of the most}} important development and planning issues of the EU. Several typologies of rural areas and different rural development indicators have been developed by researchers and international organizations such as OECD and EU to better understand the dynamics of rural areas and to develop relevant policies for these areas. The typologies of rural areas are based on sub-national territories and administrative or statistical units (i. e. local, regional, NUTS 3, NUTS 5), whereas rural development indicators include a wide range of indicators from population and migration to economic structure and performance and from social well-being and equity to environment and sustainability. Against this background, the aim of this paper is to compare and evaluate Turkey‚Äôs rurality with the EU- 25 countries on the basis of rural development indicators. The data and information used for comparison and evaluation are based on EUROSTAT data. A multicriteria analysis technique, factor analysis is deployed to define Turkey‚Äôs rurality in the European context. To map out the characteristics and dynamics of Turkey‚Äôs rurality may also help to develop relevant policies for rural development of the country. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{strategies}} adopted by the Sudanese police in dealing with migration from Sudan‚Äôs <b>rural</b> <b>peripheries</b> to the central urban riverain areas of Sudan, in particular Khartoum. It contends that police policy in these regions demonstrated the limited governmental ambitions of the Sudanese state and its inability, or unwillingness, to individuate its population. It thus shifts the focus of analysis away from debates which emphasise the role of country size and ethnic diversity in limiting {{the social and political}} integration between the marginalised rural areas and the urban cores of Sudan, towards understanding this divide as an active product of government policy. Rather than attempting to regulate these rural migrants as part of an overall social body, police strategies in these periurban areas have in effect served to re-inforce the divide between the centres and peripheries of Sudanese society. They have often treated the outskirts of Khartoum as if they represent a national border, and control the burgeoning shanty-towns using collective and arbitrary methods such as ‚Äòdragnet‚Äô operations and mass demolition of shanty housing. However, the article also attempts to problematise the notion of a strict centre-periphery dichotomy by arguing that the police were never fully successful in imposing this divide, as was seen in their increasing reliance on recruiting migrants from the rural peripherie...|$|R
40|$|Some new {{values and}} trends based on {{strengthened}} needs for nature, culture and safety have emerged and offer favourable {{opportunities for the}} less developed rural areas. The environmental and social aspects of economies are getting to have more power {{as well as the}} information society provides assets to break off the distances and these processes lead to change the term of underdevelopment especially in <b>rural</b> <b>peripheries.</b> While the <b>rural</b> spaces have resources necessary to start a new way of development, they are in a dual cultural snare. On one hand, rural policy forces to follow one kind of modernization, most of the rural areas do not have resources for that. On the other hand, local societies are not ready to follow a post-modern way. Post-modern values are imported by migrants and this is accompanied by important conflicts. The main question of our research is how the pure nature, the sustainability, the cultural heritage and social participation as some of the basic values for post-modern type development are present in rural spaces. According to our hypothesis the relation of local society to post-modern values depends on economic development, the size of community and their links to the outside of the region.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} in the <b>rural</b> <b>periphery</b> of the North requires modernization because {{it is necessary to}} overcome the backwardness of its technical and technological level, to improve the provision of the population with local food products, to create competitive advantages in the local and regional markets, to use natural and human capital rationally, to raise the standard of living and quality of life of agricultural workers, to retain young people in rural areas, to reduce significant differentiation in socioeconomic development of remote and suburban areas. The period of market reforms was marked by the destruction of the material-technical base of agriculture, the sharp reduction in cultivated agricultural land, number of animals, number of workers, the deterioration of their professional level and quality of life, the decline in production of all kinds of agricultural products. In the period of market reforms the facilities and infrastructure basis of agriculture was destroyed, the volume of cultivated land reduced greatly, as well as the population of livestock, and the number of employees; their professional level and quality of life deteriorated, the production of all kinds of agricultural products reduced. Agriculture was deprived of possible technological re-equipment because of prices liberalization, the drastic reduction in state support and in the amount of investments. The article proves that current views on the lack of prospects for development of agricultural {{production in}} the <b>rural</b> <b>periphery</b> and the reorientation of rural residents on other activities are not acceptable. The authors point out the need to accelerate modernization in agriculture, and they conclude that sustainable agricultural and rural development is a long-term priority for the state and municipal authorities.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the institutional {{development of the}} Sudanese police between 1924 and 1989, focusing in particular on its role in governing Sudanese society and {{its relationship with the}} state at large. It seeks to challenge the static picture which represents the police as servile tools of ruling colonial and post-colonial regimes in Africa and a simple extension of the political executive. It contends that the police cannot be understood as the passive tools of the state, since both colonial and post-colonial states have been highly divided. The competing factions included legal and professional groups that wanted to develop a strong, united and institutionalized police force so as to exercise a systematic governance of Sudanese society, and political and administrative factions that sought to make the police serve the narrower political agendas of the regime. Central ruling factions, such as the Sudan Political Service in the colonial era and the military in the post-colonial era, have often seen a strong and institutionalized police force as a potential threat to their status, and have thus sought to weaken the police by conferring police authority to a number of parallel bodies. It will be seen that this conflict at the centre of the state helped to exacerbate the rift between the urban core and <b>rural</b> <b>peripheries,</b> as the various colonial and post-colonial governments sought to prevent the development of a united police force by dividing it along regional lines ‚Äì and that the police came to serve, in some respects, as the state‚Äôs tools for enforcing this divide.

While the physical annexation of small towns and their environs is a common feature of Mexico City's growth, the settlement of Ampliacion San Marcos is more accurately described as a two-pronged process involving the extension of a nearby pre-Hispanic town and the expansion of Mexico City itself. The case study shows that the <b>rural</b> <b>periphery</b> of Mexico City is no tabula rasa upon which urban growth simply 'takes place', rather, settlement processes are influenced by longstanding in situ social relations and practices related to property.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{materiality}} of hospitality situations in an industrial county-level town in south-west China, and its <b>rural</b> <b>peripheries.</b> Using ethnographic data, it demonstrates the movement of structures of habituated hospitality practices from ‚Äòguest hall‚Äô rooms in homes to a plethora of new commercial venues that have emerged in the town during the ‚Äòreform and opening‚Äô period. The {{first half of the}} thesis illustrates how, in the domestic sphere, these layouts serve to create a locale around which the family is both literally and metaphorically arranged, but also as a key site in which the family attempts to manage and control their interactions with non-family guests. In recent years, the expectations that hosting situations should be ever more exuberant in nature (typified by the creation of large amounts of ‚Äòsocial heat‚Äô) has resulted in such gatherings being considered increasingly unsuitable for the home environment, which is progressively being reconceptualised as a location for ‚Äòrelaxation‚Äô. The second half of the thesis focuses upon the town‚Äôs commercial venues, examining both the material environment and social interactions taking place within, to demonstrate the similarities that exist between these spaces and the home‚Äôs guest hall. It will be shown that the widespread commodification and de-domestification of hosting situations has brought about a number of changes in the town, including concerns over a lack of co-presence of family members, and an enhanced facility for the creation of socially efficacious relationships that are free of the ties and purview of kin relations. The thesis concludes by proposing the term 'structured hosting' to inform both existing anthropological notions of the home and hospitality, and to extend Bourdieu‚Äôs notion of habitus by demonstrating how it can become inscribed upon new social domains. link_to_OA_fulltextDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Since colonial times, in the Sahel-Sudan belt {{large-scale}} {{irrigation schemes}} were developed {{along the main}} waterways (the Nile, the Niger, the Senegal, the Logone). The first objective {{of this paper is}} to illustrate the outcomes of the large-scale irrigation schemes in terms of geographical, organizational, institutional, cognitive and social (according to Boschma, 2005). The second objective is to observe what happens to these proximities when these large-scale projects go through recurring crises. In the end, the emergence of new proximity configurations is highlighted. These new configurations may constitute the core of innovative and possibly more sustainable models of local development. These ‚Äúlarge-scale projects‚Äù are made up of massive infrastructure and activate proximity dynamics. They bring closer what was once far (the <b>rural</b> <b>peripheries</b> to the political and economic centres, and the productive areas to the global markets). Circulation and communication networks modify the relative distance. At the same time, however, large-scale schemes distance what was once near: they create a spatial separation that keeps the project area at a distance from the local context. The generalized extension of the large-scale irrigation schemes has redrawn the Sahel area in its physical, social and economic geography. Through the projects, governments and large development organizations thought they could give a boost to a rapid modernization of the societies and the local cultures. Yet the history of the irrigation schemes has been a tormented one. Significant problems arose immediately. The projects have gone through recurring phases of crisis: in some cases production was paralyzed. Large areas set up for irrigation and mechanized farming were abandoned. Modernized farming has not given the expected results and the proximities implemented by the projects have been weakened.
