5000|$|As {{some of you}} know, I am {{under orders}} to be detached, and upon being {{relieved}} as Commander Service Squadron 10, I am to proceed and report to a naval hospital in the United States for treatment. Upon the eve of my departure, I wish to express some thoughts about the Squadron, its people, and the work they have done during the past nineteen months.To give you some of its historical background, the Squadron had its beginning back in November 1943, and Lieutenant (jg) Simon, my Staff Secretary, Lieutenant Commander McCall, my Ammunition Officer, Lieutenant Connitt, Lieutenant Weaver, and other [...] "old timers, so to speak, with me {{will tell you that}} we started from scratch {{in every sense of the}} word. We began with very few personnel, but we did have backing and we had an idea. That backing was from Admiral Nimitz, Admiral Spruance, and others whose support and foresight stimulated the development of the idea; and that idea, or mission, was the LOGISTICS SUPPORT OF FLEET OPERATIONS FROM FLOATING MOBILE BASES. In other words, we were to be mobile and to serve the fleet from floating equipment, and to move forward as the operations advanced to the westward.As I have already mentioned, our beginnings were modest ones — few officers, few men, and scant equipment marked those early days. However, we progressed and from a small office in Pearl we later set up operations in Majuro on 13 February 1944 when the Squadron Flagship, U.S.S. Prairie arrived from Pearl with my staff and enlisted personnel. Two or three days before the arrival of the Prairie, the U.S.S. Vega had reached Majuro with a load of pontoon cells. Based on difficulties encountered while attempting to assemble pontoons ashore in the South Pacific (sic), arrangements were made to assemble sections in the water alongside the ship. In twenty-one days, twenty pontoon barges were put together without shore assistance. Later as we grew, more adequate transportation was procured, but, this incident is recalled as it marked an early means of servicing the fleet. Pontoon barges were used for transportation of provisions, supplies, and were even employed then to take liberty parties ashore. As I look back, I feel grateful to the men who assembled and manned those barges — their service was invaluable in supplying the fleet in those early days. I should like to mention, that, of comparatively few ships which carried the work load of the Squadron at Majuro over a year ago, some are still with the Squadron. The Prairie, then commanded by Captain Kneeland; and the Vestal, commanded by Commander Singer; were the only repair ships and tenders at Majuro when we started and for the first hectic weeks thereafter. Later we were joined by the Ajax, commanded by Captain Brown, which arrived from the Gilberts; the Markab, commanded by Captain Farrell; the Phaon; and the ARD-13, commanded by Commander Travis. The Cascade had been running the Service Squadron 10 business at Kwajalein, under Captain Ogden, who was also my representative there. When the Argonne arrived in May 1944, it was sent to Kwajalein to serve as the flagship for the Service Squadron 10 Representative, and the Cascade, the commanded by Captain Gates, joined us at Majuro in May. All of the above still carry on.During our days at Majuro, it was my privilege to commission six naval vessels two thousand miles from the nearest naval district. They were six over-age merchant tankers which were commissioned as the Aretusa, Quiros, Signal, Malvern, Antona, and Manileno. Those ships, along with the Sepulag, have been the backbone of our harbor fuel fleet. The daily life of the officers and men on those ships may have seemed dull and unexciting (and it certainly was not very inspiring) but I am most appreciative of their persistent efforts, and fine work accomplishing without complaining.Prior to our departure from Majuro, we were joined by the first of the concrete ships, or [...] "crockery" [...] fleet, the Trefoil and Quartz.The above were the ships we had at Majuro. The were the ships that serviced Admiral Spruance's fleet prior to strikes against the Palaus, Truk, and the Marianas, prior to the occupation of Hollandia, and prior to offensive operations against the Marianas in the summer of 1944. They were the ships that helped to stage the amphibious forces through Kwajalein, Roi and Eniwetok prior to landings on Saipan.After Majuro days, ships too numerous to mention individually, joined the Squadron.In June 1944, the Squadron moved to Eniwetok. Here the demands upon the Squadron increased as more combatant units had to be replenished, and amphibious groups staged through. As in Majuro, with hard work and [...] "Yankee" [...] ingenuity, and with facilities sorely overtaxed, you overcame the many difficulties imposed upon the Squadron by this greatly increased work load. This was our critical test period, and our [...] "fight" [...] during June and July and part of August was tough, but you made it.In August, Captain Rhoads was sent to Saipan as a representative, Captain Odgen to Manus, and in September, Captain Houser was sent to Guam. We were spreading out and I look back with pride upon those days when the Squadron was becoming better known and when it was beginning to play an increasingly important part in giving service, not only at the main fleet anchorage, but at advanced island bases as well. We made our share of mistakes and pulled a boner now and then, but we tried to do better the next time, and we did.In October, we began the trek from Eniwetok to the westward. This time our destination was Ulithi Atoll in the Carolines. This was accomplished by despatching four towing convoys consisting of strings of floating equipment of assorted types and sizes — liberty ships towed barges and pontoon floats; fleet tugs towed drydocks large and small; smaller tugs going along as retrievers. Into the drydocks were loaded LCVP's, derrick barges, and small harbor tugs — LCM's were loaded on the deck of any ship that would carry them. Our supply and ammunition ships went forward. Covered lighters with ammunition and provisions, drydocks with their precious cargo of small craft, target rafts, etc., made their way across 1400 miles of open water, slow and vulnerable to storm damage and enemy submarine action, to a new operating base. I can not pass these incidents without a most favorable comment on the manner in which these large groups of slow vessels, with their ponderous tows of no-self-propelled equipment, were mothered across the ocean without a single loss. This incident testifies to your painstaking attention to the many details to insure, as far as you were humanly able, that the transfer of our equipment to a new location would be accomplished without mishap. Needless to say, I am humbly grateful that we encountered no bad weather.It was while at Ulithi that the duties of Service Squadron 10 became more arduous, and the responsibilities more challenging than ever, for it was here that greatly increased naval task forces of all types were serviced prior to action against the enemy, this in spite of storms and rough water. The tempo was being stepped up, and sometimes you had only a few days to replenish a group before it had to sail again. This meant careful planning and hard work, both night and day. In relatively short times, very large quantities of supplies and materials of all classes were delivered. You may be interested in learning some of the figures recorded for a period during one of our operations. The daily average volume for a month of some items was as follows:* Dry provisions: 376 tons* Fresh and Frozen: 320 tons* General stores: 289 tons (including 5 tons of rope)* Ship's store stock: 50 tons* Black oil: 75,000 bbls* Diesel oil: 8,000 bbls* Aviation gas: 216,000 gals* Water: 157,000 gals* Ammunition: 660 tons* Prepacked medical supplies: 1 ton (plus)* Whole blood: 100 pts* Transportation of planes between ships: 10* Salvage aviation material: 14* Transportation air group personnel: 300 men* Repairs to: 27 different ships* Issued by radio pool: 4,000 items* Spare parts issued by one ship: 227* Transportation of recreation parties: 4,125 men* Issues of 35 mm films: 157 programs* Issues of 16 mm films: 45 programs* Issues of sea prints: 33* Surface and anti-aircraft firing: 5* Exercises set up, Visual messages: 527 (one every 2.7 minutes)* Radio traffic: 21,298 groups (14.8 groups a minute)* Officer Messenger Mail center: 450 ship's representative's called at office; 897 pieces of mail distributed.The above are <b>representative</b> <b>items</b> of various departments, and take note that these figures are average for one day only. Obviously, in this letter, one cannot assemble all of the descriptive data properly to show the work necessary to make the delivery of all items, or the effort expended to accomplish all services, some which have not been listed. But, whether recorded or not, I have not lost sight of the part all must play in the game of replenishing, repairing and rearming the fleet.The term [...] "all" [...] must include everyone; not forgetting — coxswains and bow hooks of boats, men on tugs, on barges, storekeepers on concretes, welders on repair ships, fuze setters, winch handlers, hatch tenders, stevedores, shore patrol, cleaning details, divers, yeomen, signalmen, ammunition handlers, pharmacists mates, every one in every contributing capacity, almost too numerous to name. To all — well done! Or as Commander Third Fleet stated it in a message to me just after his command had been serviced, [...] "A rousing well done to you and your hard working gang for a magnificent job in taking care of our needs. Beans, bullets, black oil, bulk stores and even bulkheads have been promptly forthcoming on each request. Service Squadron 10 is a tried and proven member of our big blue team." [...] Signed [...] "Admiral Halsey." [...] I was immensely proud to have received that message. It gave me cheer and confidence, it made us tighten our belts for more strenuous duties to come. And more strenuous duties did come with the demands of the fleet steadily increasing!For the Third Fleet, and later again the Fifth Fleet under Admiral Spruance had to be made ready for strikes against the enemy. The fleet was reaching out to support operations moving steadily westward and northward toward the Empire and to make strikes of its own against the Japanese homeland itself which included air strikes over Tokyo. The Admiral brought his ships back into port again and again to be replenished, repaired and rearmed by you. Again an Admiral in command of a Fleet after periods of replenishment, in this case, Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, sent our Squadron messages of appreciation of the work accomplished. Task force, task group and task unit commanders also commented favorably. These messages gave us a warm glow of pride, and spurred us on to even greater efforts.Over a period of eight months you worked at Ulithi, and except for the inspiring sight of the fleet coming in and going out again, you had another to look at taller than an 80-foot coconut tree on the top of the coral rim of the atoll. Officers and men of the active units of the fleet had the excitement and inspiration of attacks against the enemy, while you had the steady grind of the work day and night, in order that the fleet might keep its unrelenting pressure steadily on the enemy. With unchanging scenery, sameness, and tropical heat, you did your work without complaining and you did it well. I give you credit! However, in May 1945, a change of scenery came at last, and again you packed your boats into docks, took the barges in tow, and again, through threat of typhoon and danger from enemy attack, made your way across the ocean to our present operating base. The good Lord was with us, and again our equipment arrived without loss of personnel or material, to set up our organization for the servicing of a fleet operating still closer to the Japanese Empire.This brings me near the end of my message to you. We must soon part company but I hope it will only be temporarily, for, having been in the game so long, I want to see it through to the end. However, come what may, I want you to realize the important part you have played in the prosecution of this war, and that your work has fully justified the soundness of the idea that the fleet could be supported from floating and mobile bases, moving that floating equipment along with the fleet as it advanced further toward the Japanese Empire. As I have mentioned heretofore, your job may be lacking in the spectacular and glamorous features of battles at sea, nevertheless, as time goes on, and more of the history of this war is written, you will find that the contribution of our Squadron to the war effort will be one of the unique pages in the annals of this war, and so I want you to know the honor which I feel in having commanded Service Squadron 10 in carrying out its mission of giving LOGISTICS SUPPORT TO FLEET OPERATIONS FROM FLOATING MOBILE BASES.In closing, may I offer my sincere thanks to all of my officers and men for your leadership, hard work, your foresight, your effective planning, your loyalty, your tireless support, - without any of these, the job could not have been done. Keep up the good work! Good luck!:W.R. Carter ...|$|E

40|$|Diversified {{retrieval}} is a {{very important}} problem on many e-commerce sites, e. g. eBay and Amazon. Using IR ap-proaches without optimizing for diversity results in a clutter of redundant items that belong to the same products. Most existing product taxonomies are often too noisy, with over-lapping structures and non-uniform granularity, to be used directly in diversified retrieval. To address this problem, we propose a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based diversi-fied retrieval approach that selects diverse items based on the hidden user intents. Our approach first discovers the hidden user intents of a query using the LDA model, and then ranks the user intents by making trade-offs between their relevance and information novelty. Finally, it chooses the most <b>representative</b> <b>item</b> for each user intent to display. To evaluate the diversity in the search results on e-commerce sites, we propose a new metric, average satisfaction, measur-ing user satisfaction with the search results. Through our empirical study on eBay, we show that the LDA model dis-covers meaningful user intents and the LDA-based approach provides significantly higher user satisfaction than the eBay production ranker and three other diversified retrieval ap-proaches...|$|R

40|$|Didelphis albiventris Lund, 1840 {{is one of}} {{the least}} known Brazilian {{marsupials}} with respect to its feeding habits. Since the white-eared opossum is omnivorous, it occupies several niches and may be found in urban areas as well as in forest fragments. Current analysis aimed at determining and comparing the diet of D. albiventris in two periurban areas of the municipality of Viamão, a conserved forest remnant and a degraded area resulting from agricultural activities. Captures of D. albiventris were carried out for a period of 30 months by a sampling effort of 504 trap-nights. Forty fecal samples were collected from 45 captures corresponding to 18 specimens.   Diet was determined by fecal analysis. Fruit was the most <b>representative</b> <b>item,</b> at an occurrence of 77. 5 %, comprising six species of plants, followed by invertebrates (62. 5 %) and vertebrates (37. 5 %).

Since there was a greater diversity of food items and fruits in the more conserved area, seasonal variations in the diet could be detected.

The anticipation concept is performed using simulation models supported by inventory control algorithms on a selected sample of <b>representative</b> <b>items.</b> The inventory control algorithms include Silver-Meal, Part period balancing, Least-unit cost, and Fuzzy inventory control algorithm based on fuzzy stock-outs, highest inventory level and total cost. Transportation cost is explicitly defined as a discrete function of shipment size. The algorithms are tested on historic data. Simulation results are presented {{and the risk of}} accepting them as reliable is discussed. The process of simulation model implementation is briefly discussed to further validate the model and train order managers to use the simulation model in their order placement process.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} the diet of the adult cutlassfish, Trichiurus lepturus, in northern Rio de Janeiro, through stomach content analysis. The sampling included 350 specimens measuring between 100 and 163 cm in total length, collected from 2004 to 2006. For each prey species, the frequency of occurrence, density and biomass, body length and weight, and Index of Relative Importance (IRI) were calculated. The cannibalistic feeding behavior of the cutlassfish was also recorded. According to the IRI, the preferential prey species were the fishes T. lepturus, Pellona harroweri, Chirocentrodon bleekerianus, Lycengraulis grossidens, Peprilus paru, Chloroscombrus chrysurus, Odontognathus mucronatus, Stellifer brasiliensis and Isophisthus parvipinnis, and the crustacean Pleoticus muelleri. The cephalopods Loligo sanpaulensis and L. plei occurred occasionally in the stomach contents analyzed. The diet of T. lepturus in northern Rio de Janeiro was composed of pelagic and demersal prey species, associated with estuarine and coastal areas. The fish species and one crustacean species were the most <b>representative</b> <b>items</b> in its diet...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{aim was to}} develop a theoretically-grounded and psychometrically-sound measure of organizational work team cohesion. Carron, Widmeyer and Brawley's (1985) context-independent conceptual model capturing task, social, team and individual dimensions of cohesion was extended to include the context-dependent dimensions 'valued roles', 'unity of purpose', 'vertical' and 'horizontal' cohesion; identified from existing literature and a subject matter experts (SMEs) focus group. This extended model provided the a priori basis for development of the Multidimensional Team Cohesion Scale (MTCS). The MTCS was found to have good content validity with two samples of SMEs and work team <b>representatives.</b> <b>Items</b> were reduced from 219 to 103 using item analytic correlation methods (N= 204). Psychometric properties of the MTCS were examined through reliability and construct validity analysis in work teams (N= 214). MTCS subscales had excellent reliability a >. 75. Evidence of convergent and divergent validity was obtained through correlation analysis against the GEQ (convergent validity), Reichman's (1998) Team Performance Questionnaire (TPQ) and Cammann, Fichman, Jenkins and Klesh's (1983) Overall Job Satisfaction Scale (MOAQ-JSS) (divergent validity). MTCS subscales differentially correlated with team performance and job satisfaction (differential validity). A paired t test applied to a repeat sample (N= 90) was used to test differences in cohesion before and after a major reorganization. Independent-sample t tests were conducted to examine differences according to individual- and team level characteristics. Subscale differences across age and position (team leader vs. team member) were identified. The factorial validity of the MTCS, examined using principal axis factoring (PAF) and oblimin rotation could not be established due to an insufficient sample size. A norm-referenced scoring mechanism was derived to support interpretation of MTCS scores. The comprehensive methodology adopted in this research and evidence of construct validity provides a sound basis for the continued validation of the MTCS and indicates its practical utility in occupational settings...|$|R
40|$|Microsensors {{operate under}} severe energy {{constraints}} {{and should be}} deployed in large numbers without any pre-configuration. We construct a generalized self-clustering algorithm, called Low-energy Localized Clustering (LLC). It integrates the ideas of two self-configuring clustering algorithms: the Localized algorithm and the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy algorithm. LLC covers a range of behaviors from the better-clustering performance of the Localized method to the energy-efficient operation of the LEACH method. The main advantage of LLC {{is that it can}} be energy-efficient while maintaining localization. Data aggregation techniques such as summarization, finding <b>representative</b> data <b>items,</b> and pattern matching are proposed. Data aggregation is a necessity in microsensor networks, since transmitting huge volumes of raw data is an energy-intensive operation. Finally, security issues are discussed and an energyefficient Randomized Data Authentication algorithm is designed specifically for microsensor applications...|$|R
40|$|Training {{and using}} overcomplete {{dictionaries}} {{has been the}} subject of many developments in the area of signal processing and sparse representations. The main idea is to train a dictionary that is able to achieve good sparse representations of the items contained in a given dataset. The most popular approach is the K-SVD algorithm and in this paper we study its application to large datasets. The main interest is to speedup the training procedure while keeping the representation errors close to some specific values. This goal is reached by using a clustering procedure, called here T-mindot, which reduces the size of the dataset but keeps the most <b>representative</b> data <b>items</b> and a measure of their importance. Experimental simulations compare the running times and representation errors of the training method with and without the clustering procedure and they clearly show how effective T-mindot is...|$|R
