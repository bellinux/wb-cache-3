The objectives of this thesis were 1) to propose modifications of the ENDF/BVI delayed neutron data, 2) to derive new delayed neutron parameters for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 using the summation method, and 3) to establish the relative importance of individual parameters in delayed neutron data sets. The ENDF/B-VI delayed neutron parameters for groups 1 and 2 were reevaluated using a different database than the one used originally. The modified set of delayed neutron data decreases the value of the average delayed neutron lifetime by 15 % for U- 235 thermal fission, which agrees more closely with Keepin's results. The modified delayed neutron data set also improves the calculated <b>reactor</b> <b>period</b> (relative to the <b>reactor</b> <b>period</b> calculated using Keepin's delayed neutron data). In the new six group set of delayed neutron data, the decay constant of group 1 (Al) is equal to the decay constant of the delayed neutron precursor Br- 87 for any fissioning system. A second set of delayed neutron parameters (for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4) were also obtained using the summation method and more recent database. The <b>reactor</b> <b>period</b> calculated using this set agrees within 7 % of the <b>reactor</b> <b>period</b> calculated using Keepin's delayed neutron parameters. Finally, the relative importance of each of the thirteen delayed neutron parameters was established. The calculated <b>reactor</b> <b>period</b> is found to be most sensitive to the value of the delayed neutron fraction (fl), the decay constants for groups 1, 2, and 4, (i. e., Al, A 2, and A 4), and the relative abundances for groups 2, 3, and 4, (i. e., a 2, a 3, and a 4).

40|$|The Doppler {{feedback}} {{mechanism is}} {{a major contributor to}} the passive safety of gas-cooled, graphite-moderated High Temperature Reactors that use fuel based on TRISO particles. It follows that the correct prediction of the magnitude and time-dependence of this feedback effect is essential to the conduct of safety analyses for these reactors. Since the effect is directly dependent on the actual temperature reached by the fuel during transients, the underlying phenomena of heat transfer and temperature rise must be correctly predicted. This paper presents an improved model for the TRISO particle and its thermal behavior during transients. The improved approach incorporates an explicit TRISO heat conduction model to better quantify the time dependence of the temperature in the various layers of the TRISO particle, including its fuel central zone. There follows a better treatment of the Doppler Effect within said fuel zone. The new model is based on a 1 -D analytic solution for composite media using the Green’s function technique. The modeling improvement takes advantage of some of the physical behavior of TRISO fuel under irradiation and includes a distinctive look at the physics of the neutronic Doppler Effect. The new methodology has been implemented within the coupled R-Z nodal diffusion code CYNOD-THERMIX. The new model has been applied to the analysis of earthquakes (presented in a companion paper). In this paper, the model is applied to the control rod ejection event, as specified in the OECD PBMR- 400 benchmark, but with temperature dependent thermal properties. The results obtained for this transient using the enhanced code are a considerable improvement over the predictions of the original code. The incorporation of the enhanced model shows that the Doppler Effect plays a more significant role than predicted by the original unenhanced model based on the THERMIX homogenized fuel region model. The new model shows that the overall energy generation during the rod ejection transient is significantly lower than predicted by the unenhanced model. The fuel temperature reaches a slightly higher maximum, but at no time does it approach the nominal allowable TRISO fuel temperature. The analyses with the enhanced model also show that the <b>reactor</b> <b>period</b> during the cool down is larger than previously predicted with the homogenous fuel region model...|$|E

In addition, {{the effectiveness of the}} farm scale Røysland biogas plant has been investigated by analysing the COD and VS removal, the VFA, pH and alkalinity variations for a period of 3 months (January to April 2017). The farm itself is equipped with one up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB, R 1) and one anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR, R 2). High BMP was found in mixed food waste (0. 672 m 3 CH 4 /kg VS), Grødaland primary sludge (0. 756 m 3 CH 4 /kg VS) and in influent R 1 (0. 614 m 3 CH 4 /kg VS). The specific methanogenic activity of the granules/inoculum, the extent of fat fraction (thus COD/VS ratio), the environmental conditions, as well as the availability of substrates are the main parameters influencing the methane potential. Analysis of the manure percolate of R 1 has shown a low VFA concentration and higher pH in post-starting of the <b>reactor</b> (<b>period</b> 1, from 1 to 69 days) compared to a high VFA and a lower pH found in period 2 (from 85 to 139 days). Period 3 (from 161 and further) where restarting of the reactor occurred has shown a low VFA and high pH, which is similar as found in period 1. Also, a significant increase in COD and VS was found from period 1 to period 2, which led to an increase in the organic loading rate (OLR). The change in the type of feed manure might be the reason behind the COD increase. Performance issue was observed concerning the COD/VS removal in R 1, which upset the process. Bad hydraulics leading to a channelling of substrate distribution), and/or bad quality granule might have caused the low biogas production, far from the total estimated potential. While a high alkalinity prevented reactor souring due to high VFA observed in the sample. The methane potential results were within expectation.

40|$|Le modèle de l'IAWQ du {{processus}} de boues activées représente les mécanismes endogènes de la biomasse nitrifiante par le décès des micro-organismes (équation d'ordre 1 {{par rapport}} à la biomasse). La constante de décès, ou taux de mortalité bA, est aujourd'hui encore mal connue, et en particulier les facteurs influants sur sa valeur. De récentes études ont montré que la prédation par la microfaune pourrait être un facteur déterminant sur la valeur de bA. Cette étude se propose donc de quantifier l'effet de la prédation sur la valeur de bA. Deux réacteurs maintenus sans alimentation en substrat ont été caractérisés en parallèle: l'un a reçu une dose d'antibiotique spécifique aux eucaryotes (cycloheximide) afin de diminuer la quantité d'organismes de la microfaune, alors que l'autre n'a reçu aucun antibiotique (témoin). Les résultats obtenus montrent que le cycloheximide inhibe la plupart des organismes de la microfaune sauf les amibes; celles-ci semblent plutôt stimulées par cet antibiotique. En ce qui concerne la nitrification, un ralentissement de la production de nitrate dans le réacteur traité à l'antibiotique est observé à partir du sixième jour. Cette diminution de production de nitrate est probablement causée par une réduction de l'azote nitrifiable (qui est mobilisé par les amibes) couplée à une prédation des organismes nitrifiants par les amibes. D'ailleurs, l'augmentation de la prédation par les amibes à partir du jour 6 a diminué l'activité nitrifiante également mesurée par respirométrie (rO 2 Nmax). Cette diminution du taux de respiration indique une augmentation du taux de mortalité (bA) des organismes nitrifiants. En effet, la valeur du taux de mortalité mesurée dans le réacteur témoin est de 0. 08 d- 1 alors que selon la microfaune présente dans le réacteur inhibé au cycloheximide, la valeur de ce taux de mortalité a varié entre 0. 05 d- 1 et 0. 15 d- 1. Designing biological {{wastewater treatment plants}} {{with the aid of}} the model developed by the IAWQ requires the knowledge of biological kinetic parameters. For nitrifying activated sludge, these parameters are related to nitrifying bacteria: maximum autotrophic growth rate µAmax, yield coefficient YA and the autotrophic decay rate bA.

MARTINAGE and PAUL (2000) have recently shown that the bA value is strongly influenced by the influent quality, leading to the assumption that influent quality has a strong effect on microfauna composition, and consequently on the grazing rate of microfauna on nitrifying bacteria. In fixed-film processes, protozoan grazing reduces the bacterial population considerably (NATUSCKA and WELANDER, 1994). However, although many data are available concerning the grazing rates of different protozoa, the effect of microfaunal grazing on nitrification is still a matter of debate (RATSAK et al., 1994) and its effect on the bA value is still unknown. These two topics are investigated here. Nitrifying activated sludges were grown in two identical batch reactors, but in one, cycloheximide was added to inhibit eucaryotic growth (MAURINES CARBONEILL et al., 1998). Microfauna organism numbers were quantified in both reactors by microscopic observations of flagellated protozoa (> 8 µm), amoebae, ciliates, rotifers and higher invertebrates (Fig. 3). Microbial counts were then correlated with the bA value. The latter was determined using the procedure proposed by SALZER (1992) which consists of characterising the time behaviour of the maximum nitrification rate measured by respirometry of activated sludge under substrate starvation. Under these conditions bacteria die and organic nitrogen is released into the bulk phase. This nitrogen is ammonified, and nitrifying bacteria use this substrate to produce nitrate, and then autotrophic bacterial growth occurs. This method takes this growth into account by characterising nitrate production during the experiment (Fig. 2). The effect of cycloheximide on nitrification was first determined to make sure that this compound is not inhibitory toward nitrifiers. Results obtained (Table 1) show that cycloheximide was not inhibitory toward nitrate production or the maximum nitrification oxygen uptake rate (rO 2 N) after 4 hours of contact with nitrifying biomass. Cycloheximide addition in the activated sludge had an important impact on rotifers and flagellates but no effect on ciliates; it also seemed to stimulate amoebae growth. In both reactors, flagellates were mainly Peranama, attached ciliates were mainly Opercularia and Epistylis and a few Vorticella. Free ciliates like Aspidisca and Euplotes were found in both reactors. Variation with time of the abundance of microfauna organisms is shown in Figures 4 and 5 for both reactors. In the reference reactor the number of microfauna organisms decreased with time (Fig. 4) probably due to substrate starvation. Microfauna composition remained however diversified. For the inhibited reactor (Fig. 5), three periods were observed. During period I, the microfauna was mainly composed of ciliates and the number of microfaunal organisms decreased rapidly. During period II, an important growth of amoebae was observed. Cycloheximide was then added during this period to reduce their number. This growth of amoebae seems to be caused by the resistance of these micro-organisms toward inhibiting compounds (SRIKANTH et BERK, 1993). During period III, the number of microfaunal organisms was lower than during period II, and microfauna was mainly composed of ciliates. Nitrate concentration behaviour, necessary for bA calculation, is shown on Figure 6. In the reference reactor, nitrate concentrations varied linearly. For the inhibited reactor, the linear pattern was not observed during period II. This result was probably caused by an important nitrogen assimilation need of amoebae (ELDRIGE and JACKSON, 1993). Because organic nitrogen released by bacterial decay is consumed by amoebae assimilation, less nitrogen is available for the ammonification process and therefore for nitrification. Ammonia concentrations remained below 0. 2 mg N·l- 1 during all the experiment for both reactors. When amoebae disappeared from the inhibited <b>reactor</b> (<b>period</b> III) nitrate concentration varied linearly again. Variations of the maximum nitrification oxygen uptake rate (rO 2 Nmax) with time are presented in Figure 7 (A&B) for both reactors. Two curves are plotted on each figure. Empty squares represent the measured rO 2 N and black points represent the maximum nitrification rate that would have been measured if no growth on ammonification products had occurred. For the reference reactor (Fig. 7 A), a value for bA of 0. 08 d- 1 can be calculated and can be considered constant for a constant microfauna composition. Three bA values can be estimated for the reactor inhibited with cycloheximide (Fig. 7 B), corresponding to the three periods observed for microfauna composition. During period I, the bA value is 0. 05 d- 1  : a decrease in the microfaunal organism numbers implies a decrease of the bA value. During period II, when a development of amoebae is observed, the bA value increases and reaches 0. 15 d- 1. During period III with reduced grazing, the bA value is 0. 13 d- 1. Since during periods I and III the microfauna is mainly composed of ciliates, this difference between bA values is likely due to the observed difference in floc size between periods I and III. The results obtained during this study tend to prove (1) that the use of cycloheximide reduces microfaunal populations but can lead to a development of amoebae, and (2) that microfauna grazing seems to have an influence on the bA value, which can vary from 0. 05 to 0. 15 d- 1 depending on microfaunal composition and abundance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractUnder tritium {{production}} method using a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor loaded Li compound, Li compound {{has to be}} coated by ceramic materials in order to suppress the spreading of tritium to the whole reactor. Pyrolytic carbon (PyC) is a candidate of the coating material because of its high resistance for gas permeation. In this study, hydrogen permeation experiments using a PyC-coated isotropic graphite tube were conducted and hydrogen diffusivity, solubility and permeability were evaluated. Tritium permeation behavior through PyC-coated Li compound particles was simulated by using obtained data. Hydrogen permeation flux through PyC in a steady state {{is proportional to the}} hydrogen pressure and is larger than that through Al 2 O 3 which is also candidate coating material.
