5|$|The {{reason for}} the {{presence}} of these non canonical bases in DNA is not known. It seems likely that {{at least part of the}} <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> presence in bacterial viruses (phages) is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.|$|E

5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for sand martin). The beetles {{have no effect on}} the nesting birds, and the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.|$|E

5|$|The {{behavior}} {{of matter and}} energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws. These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure {{and the evolution of}} the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants that appear to be static across the observable universe. The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> specific values remains a mystery.|$|E
5|$|The story {{focuses on}} Class Zero, {{a group of}} {{fourteen}} students from the Vermillion Peristylium, a magical academy in the Dominion of Rubrum. When the Militesi Empire launches {{an assault on the}} other Crystal States of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals, Class Zero is mobilized for the defense of Rubrum. Eventually, the group becomes entangled in the secrets behind both the war and the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> existence. The setting and presentation were inspired by historical documentaries, and the story itself was written to be darker than other Final Fantasy titles.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{volcanic}} {{areas in the}} world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure is loose, eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.|$|E

Johansson began a relationship with Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds in 2007, and in May 2008, they became engaged. In September 2008, the couple married in a quiet ceremony near Tofino, British Columbia. In December 2010, the couple announced their separation; their divorce was finalized in July 2011.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around {{the start of the}} 1st millennium BC. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E
5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E

Authorities have never officially disclosed the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> arrests, but according to news accounts, statements made by Van der Sloot and Kalpoe {{may have been a}} factor in the arrests of John and Jones. Reports also indicated that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women, and {{at least one of them}} had a prior incident with law enforcement. John and Jones were released on June 13 without being charged.|$|E
5|$|Part of the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> lackluster {{performance}} was repeated injuries to starting quarterback Al Clark, who missed three regular-season games due to injuries. Heading into the Music City Bowl, he {{was recovering from}} a rib injury suffered in Tech's final regular-season game. Despite the missed games, Clark completed 72 of 148 passes for 1,050 passing yards, nine touchdowns, and five interceptions for the 1998 season. On the ground, Virginia Tech running backs Lamont Pegues and Shyrone Stith combined for 1,444 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns. Together, they averaged 178 yards per game on the ground. Another bright spot on the Virginia Tech offense was kicker Shayne Graham, who was named a first-team All Big East selection. He kicked 37 extra points and was successful on 22 field goal attempts, earning the Hokies 103 points in total.|$|E

5|$|There {{appear to}} be no extant records of the {{meetings}} which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919, however the book Making the Arsenal proposes a different <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> election in that year. The site argues that the match fixing issues of {{the final year of}} football before the war (1914–15) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted. He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United (some of who's players had been found guilty of match fixing) be punished by relegation or expulsion, and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done. To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division.|$|E

5|$|During the match, UEFA.com {{users were}} able to vote for their man of the match; the public vote went to the scorer of Barcelona's second goal, Lionel Messi. The UEFA Technical Study Group, however, chose the man who {{provided}} the cross for Messi's goal, Xavi, as their man of the match, citing his control of the tempo of the match as the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> decision. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola {{took the time to}} give special praise to Messi, whom he said he moved back into the midfield in order to increase the team's effectiveness when in possession of the ball. Messi had been withdrawn from his usual right-wing role into a more central position, while Samuel Eto'o, who had started the match as Barcelona's lone centre-forward, was moved out to the right. Guardiola also lauded the bravery of his entire team, stating that he believed that his team's victory hinged on their hard work and propensity for taking risks in attack, but he admitted that although his side had had the best season {{in the history of the}} club, they were not yet the best Barcelona team.|$|E

5|$|In {{the journal}} Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago {{writes that the}} Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an {{obstacle}} to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, {{since the publication of}} the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes-Benz officially {{withdrew from}} motor racing in 1931—citing the global {{economic}} downturn as a <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> decision—although they continued to support Caracciola {{and a few other}} drivers covertly, retaining manager Alfred Neubauer to run the 'independent' operation. In part because of the financial situation, Caracciola was the only Mercedes driver to appear at the 1931 Monaco Grand Prix, driving an SSKL (a shorter version of the SSK). Caracciola and Maserati driver Luigi Fagioli challenged the Bugattis of Louis Chiron and Achille Varzi for the lead early in the race, but when the SSKL's clutch failed Caracciola withdrew from the race. A crowd of 100,000 turned out for the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. Rain began to fall before the race, and continued as Caracciola chased Fagioli for the lead in the early laps. The spray from Fagioli's Maserati severely impaired Caracciola's vision, but he was able to pass to take the lead at the Schwalbenschwanz corner. The track began to dry on lap six, and Chiron's Bugatti, which was by then running second, began to catch the heavier Mercedes. Caracciola's pit stop, completed in record time, kept him ahead of Chiron, and despite the Bugatti lapping 15seconds faster than the Mercedes late in the race, Caracciola won by more than one minute.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians also {{interacted with}} deities through the {{donation}} of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae. Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving {{portions of the}} temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, {{so many of these}} statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor. Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child.|$|E
