40|$|A {{series of}} upper-rim diphosphinated calixarene receptors bearing various R and R' substituents {{at the lower}} <b>rim</b> (<b>L</b> n; n = 1 - 5) were synthesized, and their {{reactions}} with [Pt(Thpy) (HThpy) Cl] afforded the phosphorescent platinum(II) -modified calixarene receptors [(PtThpyCl) 2 L n]. The structure of [{PtThpy(CH 3 CN) } 2 L 1](ClO 4) 2 and [(PtThpyCl) 2 L 5] were determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis, and the photo-physical properties of [(PtThpyCl) 2 L n] were investigated. © 2009 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
50|$|The outer rim of Anderson {{is heavily}} worn and eroded. Small craters overlie the southeastern and southwestern rims. The {{interior}} is relatively flat, with multiple tiny craters covering {{parts of the}} floor. The most prominent of these is Anderson L, located near the southeastern <b>rim.</b> Anderson <b>L</b> is also {{commonly known as the}} Anderson Finger.|$|R
40|$|On average, {{secondary}} impact craters {{are expected}} to deepen and become more symmetric as impact velocity (vi) increases with downrange distance (L). We have used high-resolution topography (1 – 2 m/pixel) to characterize the morphometry of secondary craters {{as a function of}} L for several well-preserved primary craters on Mars. The secondaries in this study (N = 2644) span a range of diameters (25 m ≤D≤ 400 m) and estimated impact velocities (0. 4 km/s ≤vi≤ 2 km/s). The range of diameter-normalized rim-to-floor depth (d/D) broadens and reaches a ceiling of d/D≈ 0. 22 at L≈ 280 km (vi= 1 – 1. 2 km/s), whereas average rim height shows little dependence on vi for the largest craters (h/D≈ 0. 02, D > 60 m). Populations of secondaries that express the following morphometric asymmetries are confined to regions of differing radial extent: planform elongations (L< 110 – 160 km), taller downrange <b>rims</b> (<b>L</b> < 280 km), and cavities that are deeper uprange (L< 450 – 500 km). Populations of secondaries with lopsided ejecta were found to extend to at least L ∼ 700 km. Impact hydrocode simulations with iSALE- 2 D for strong, intact projectile and target materials predict a ceiling for d/D versus L whose trend is consistent with our measurements. This study illuminates the morphometric transition from subsonic to hypervelocity cratering and describes the initial state of secondary crater populations. This has applications to understanding the chronology of planetary surfaces and the long-term evolution of small crater populations...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a technique to}} fabricate three-dimensional (3 D), freestanding metallic micro hollow tubes by template-free localized electrochemical deposition. The features of the grown structure are controlled by the field strength distribution in its proximity {{that depends on the}} applied voltage and the microelectrode-structure distance (L). The formation of micro hollow tubes is induced by the enhanced electric field at the microelectrode <b>rim</b> for small <b>L</b> values (a few micrometers or less) and high applied voltages. © 2007 The Electrochemical Society.

50|$|In 2011, {{a genetic}} {{analysis}} using DNA from preserved museum specimens of the Vegas Valley leopard frog revealed it is 100% identical, genetically, to the northwestern Mogollon Rim {{populations of the}} Chiricahua leopard frog (Lithobates chiricahuensis), which is extant but threatened. While it has been extirpated from the Las Vegas area, the frog is no longer considered extinct {{because it is the}} same species as the Chiricahua leopard frog. According to nomenclatural priority, the northwestern Mogollon <b>Rim</b> population of <b>L.</b> chiricahuensis, described in 1979, is referable to the 1893-described, extinct population of the species, L. fisheri. L. chiricahuensis may remain a valid taxon for the southern and eastern range of the Chiricahua leopard frog.|$|R

40|$|New Calix[4]arene {{compounds}} substituted at {{the lower}} <b>rim</b> by four (<b>L</b> 3) or two (L 6) benzo- 15 -crown- 5 (2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12 -octahydro- 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 -benzopentaoxacyclopentadecine) groups respectively have been prepared. Proton NMR co-ordination studies with sodium and potassium cations in deuteriated acetonitrile revealed that L 3 forms L 3 · 5 M+ (M+ = Na+ or K+) solution stoichiometric complexes consisting of an alkali-metal cation bound {{in each of the}} four crown ether moieties and one occupying the tetraamide lower-rim cavity. Compound L 6 complexes K+, Ba 2 + and NH 4 + exclusively at the crown ether binding sites in a 1 : 1 intramolecular sandwich stoichiometric fashion. A crystal-structure determination of [KL 6][I 3] has been carried out. Although neither L 3 nor L 6 coordinates anions the potassium and ammonium complexes [ZL 6]PF 6 (Z = K+ or NH 4 +) form 1 : 1 complexes with Cl-, NO 3 -, HSO 4 - and H 2 PO 4 -.

40|$|We {{describe}} here {{a procedure}} {{to bridge the}} gap in the field of calixarene physicochemistry between solid-state atomic-resolution structural information and the liquid-state low-resolution thermodynamics and spectroscopic data. We use MD simulations to study the kinetics and energetics involved in the complexation of lower <b>rim</b> calix[4]arene derivatives (<b>L),</b> containing bidentate ester (1) and ketone (2) pendant groups, with acetonitrile molecule (MeCN) and Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + ions (M 2 +) in acetonitrile solution. On one hand, we found that the prior inclusion of MeCN into the calix to form a L(MeCN) adduct has only a weak effect in preorganizing the hydrophilic cavity toward metal ion binding. On the other hand, the strong ion-hydrophilic cavity interaction produces a wide open calix which enhances the binding of one MeCN molecule (allosteric effect) to stabilize the whole (M 2 +) 1 (MeCN) bifunctional complex. We reach two major conclusions: (i) the MD results for the (M 2 +) 1 (MeCN) binding are in close agreement with the ""endo"", fully encapsulated, metal complex found by X-ray diffraction and in vacuo MD calculations, and (ii) the MD structure for the more flexible 2 ligand, however, differs from the also endo solid-state molecule. In fact, it shows strong solvation effects at the calixarene lower bore by competing MeCN molecules that share the metal coordination sphere with the four C=O oxygens of an ""exo"" (M 2 +) 2 (MeCN) complex.
