40|$|AbstractIn all {{engineering}} {{programs offered}} in the Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment (FKAB), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, each student {{has to go through}} a <b>research</b> <b>project</b> in his final year study. The <b>research</b> <b>project</b> is completed individually and is spread into two semesters in the final year as <b>Research</b> <b>Project</b> I in the first semester and <b>Research</b> <b>Project</b> II for the second semester of an academic session. In FKAB, each department has its own way to implement the <b>research</b> <b>project.</b> For the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, FKAB, starting Semester I 2011 / 2012, the department has come out with an academic planner for the students and the lecturers (as supervisors to students) to follow. The planner has included the definite datelines for each activity under the implementation of the <b>research</b> <b>project.</b> Previously, the department faced problems of students not completing their <b>research</b> <b>project</b> according to the allocated time frame. By introducing definite datelines as the semester starts to each of the activity under <b>research</b> <b>project</b> such as presentation research proposal, submission draft thesis to supervisors and final thesis to the department office, viva and submission of final marks by lecturers has improved the turnover of students completing the thesis within the time frame. For the previous semester, Semester II 2011 / 2012, only 3 out of 60 students failed to complete their <b>research</b> <b>project</b> on time. 95 % of the JKKP students had successfully completed their <b>research</b> <b>project</b> on time, compared to only 60 % of successful rate to complete their thesis on time before the introduction of the improved implementation...|$|R

5|$|During World War II, {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project that {{developed}} the first atomic bombs. In 1949, he began developing his theory that, contrary to what was then believed, not all atomic nuclei are spherical.

5|$|Ex situ {{research}} (or off-site research) is also {{popular among}} researchers looking {{to answer questions}} {{that are difficult to}} test in the field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important <b>research</b> <b>projects</b> have been carried out there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted <b>research</b> <b>projects,</b> such as one that looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} apparent to U.S. planners that, {{in a military}} confrontation with Warsaw Pact forces, NATO aircraft would quickly suffer heavy losses. This came {{as a result of}} sophisticated Soviet defense networks, which used surveillance radars and radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery to seek and eliminate enemy aircraft. Consequently, the Defense Advanced <b>Research</b> <b>Projects</b> Agency (DARPA) started a study on low-observability aircraft, seeking to design and produce an operational stealth aircraft. Five companies were initially invited, three of which bowed out early. The remaining two were later joined by Lockheed.|$|E
