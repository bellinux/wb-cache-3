25|$|Her first {{published}} novel, The Lying Days (1953), {{takes place in}} Gordimer's home town of Springs, Transvaal, an East Rand mining town near Johannesburg. Arguably a semi-autobiographical work, The Lying Days is a Bildungsroman, charting the growing political awareness of a young white woman, Helen, toward small-town life and South African <b>racial</b> <b>division.</b>|$|E

Wright while 24 percent believed he did share Wright's views. 36 percent of Republicans, 20 percent of independents, and 17 percent of Democrats believed that Obama shared Wright's views. The poll also found that 35 percent of voters (including 25 percent of Democrats and 27 percent of independents) had doubts about Obama because of his relationship with Rev. Wright. The <b>racial</b> <b>division</b> was especially noteworthy, with 40 percent of whites expressing doubts in comparison to only 2 percent of African Americans.|$|E

500|$|Evans {{also argued}} against {{miscegenation}} and Catholic and Jewish immigration, {{on the grounds}} that they were threats to genetic [...] "good stock", a <b>racial</b> <b>division</b> which was then widely supported among white Americans. Evans opposed Catholicism because he believed that the Catholic Church sought to take control of the U.S. government; he also questioned American Catholics' loyalty to their country, writing that they were subject to their priests, and, as such, to the entire Roman Catholic hierarchy and the Pope. In other writings he expressed fears that the Catholic Church, in alliance with Jews and non-white Protestant groups, was becoming increasingly active in politics and thus blurring the separation of church and state.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{critics have}} {{connected}} the novella's themes of <b>racial</b> <b>division</b> to a violent episode in Port Jervis' history. On June 2, 1892, an African-American man named Robert Lewis was lynched for allegedly assaulting a local white woman. On {{his way to}} the Port Jervis jail, Lewis was set upon by a mob of several hundred white men who dragged him through the town, beat him and hanged him from a tree. William Howe Crane lived within sight of where the lynching took place {{and was one of the}} few men, together with the chief of police, who attempted to intervene. Although Stephen Crane was not present, there were detailed accounts published in both the Port Jervis Gazette and the New-York Tribune, and Crane contributed to the Tribune at the time. [...] The Gazette marked the day of Lewis' lynching as [...] "one of the most disgraceful scenes that was ever enacted in Port Jervis", and activist Ida B. Wells launched a campaign to investigate the murder as well as the widespread theory that Lewis was set up. Of the 1,134 reported lynchings throughout the United States between 1882 and 1899, Lewis was the only black man to be lynched in New York.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{before the}} {{apartheid}} laws {{were introduced to}} South Africa in 1948 the Springboks had been an all-white team. The team {{became a symbol of}} <b>racial</b> <b>division</b> within South Africa, and following the first open elections in 1994, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) instituted a policy of transformation in South African sport. In this context transformation can be defined as [...] "a complete alternation of the appearance or character of South African rugby", and one aim is to transform the Springboks into a team more representative of South Africa's race and class.|$|E

2500|$|Obama {{described}} the resultant situation as [...] "a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years." [...] He {{pointed out that}} his [...] "imperfect" [...] candidacy is not the solution to <b>racial</b> <b>division,</b> but argued {{that it is possible}} and important for Americans of all races to work together to overcome it. [...] To that end, he called for the African-American community to [...] " [...] our particular grievances—for better health care, and better schools, and better jobs—to the larger aspirations of all Americans" [...] and for the white community to acknowledge the [...] "legacy of discrimination ... and current incidents of discrimination."

2500|$|For Aurobindo, an [...] "Aryan" [...] was not {{a person}} who belonged to a {{particular}} race, but a person who [...] "accepted {{a particular type of}} self-culture, of inward and outward practice, of ideality, of aspiration." [...] He wanted to revive India's strength by reviving the Aryan strength and character. Aurobindo denied the historicity of a <b>racial</b> <b>division</b> in India between [...] "Aryan invaders" [...] and a native dark-skinned population. Nevertheless, he did accept two kinds of culture in ancient India, namely the Aryan culture of northern and central India and Afghanistan, and the un-Aryan culture of the east, south and west. Thus, he accepted the division of European historians between two types of cultural configurations.|$|E
2500|$|A {{hypothesis}} that caste amounts to race has {{been rejected by}} some scholars. Ambedkar, for example, wrote that [...] "The Brahmin of Punjab is racially of the same stock as the Chamar of Punjab. The Caste system does not demarcate <b>racial</b> <b>division.</b> The Caste system is a social division of people of the same race." [...] Various sociologists, anthropologists and historians have rejected the racial origins and racial emphasis of caste and consider the idea to be one that has purely political and economic undertones. Beteille writes that [...] "the Scheduled Castes of India taken together are no more a race than are the Brahmins taken together. Every social group cannot {{be regarded as a}} race simply because we want to protect it against prejudice and discrimination", and that the 2001 Durban conference on racism hosted by the U.N. is [...] "turning its back on established scientific opinion".|$|E

2500|$|Hurston {{was born}} in Notasulga, Alabama, and moved to Eatonville, Florida, with her family in 1894. [...] Eatonville would become the setting for many of her stories {{and is now the}} site of the Zora! Festival, held each year in Hurston's honor. In her early career, Hurston {{conducted}} anthropological and ethnographic research while attending Barnard College. While in New York she became a central figure of the Harlem Renaissance. [...] Her short satires, drawing from the African-American experience and <b>racial</b> <b>division,</b> were published in anthologies such as The New Negro and Fire!!. After moving back to Florida, Hurston published her literary anthropology on African-American folklore in North Florida, Mules and Men (1935) and her first three novels: Jonah's Gourd Vine (1934); Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937); and Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939). [...] Also published during this time was Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica (1938), documenting her research on rituals in Jamaica and Haiti.|$|E
2500|$|After the Martin Luther King assassination, and the {{subsequent}} riots, the neighborhood experienced a tense <b>racial</b> <b>division</b> during the 1970s and 1980s which left a segregation between Old Town north of North Ave. and Old Town south of North Ave. In the early 2000s this trend has begun to shift towards a gentrification of the area south of North Ave. on Sedgwick, Blackhawk, Hudson and Mohawk streets, near the Marshall Field Garden Apartments. The area {{to the west of}} these streets, near the North and Clybourn Red Line stop has been dubbed [...] "SoNo" [...] by real estate developers. SoNo's boundaries are North Avenue, Halsted Street, Division Street and the North Branch of the Chicago River. Currently, Old Town south of North Avenue is a mixture of rich and poor, though is steadily gentrifying. The demolition of the Cabrini–Green high rise housing projects to the south has led to significant demographic changes in the neighborhood. The original Francis X. Cabrini Row Houses still are standing. The Parkside of Old Town development was built replacing the Cabrini-Green high rises just south of Old Town.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that from 25 to 28 distinct ethnic groups made up the population of the Khazar Qağanate, aside from the ethnic elite. The ruling elite seems to have been constituted out of nine tribes/clans, themselves ethnically heterogeneous, spread over perhaps nine provinces or principalities, each of which would have been allocated to a clan. In terms of caste or class, some evidence suggests that there was a distinction, whether racial or social is unclear, between [...] "White Khazars" [...] (ak-Khazars) and [...] "Black Khazars" [...] (qara-Khazars). The 10th-century Muslim geographer al-Iṣṭakhrī claimed that the White Khazars were strikingly handsome with reddish hair, white skin, and blue eyes, while the Black Khazars were swarthy, verging on deep black, as if they were [...] "some kind of Indian". Many Turkic nations had a similar (political, not <b>racial)</b> <b>division</b> between a [...] "white" [...] ruling warrior caste and a [...] "black" [...] class of commoners; the consensus among mainstream scholars is that Istakhri was confused by the names given to the two groups. However, Khazars are generally described by early Arab sources as having a white complexion, blue eyes, and reddish hair. The name of the presumed founding Āshǐnà clan may reflect an etymology suggestive of a darkish colour. The distinction appears to have survived the collapse of the Khazarian empire. Later Russian chronicles, commenting {{on the role of the}} Khazars in the magyarisation of Hungary, refer to them as [...] "White Oghurs" [...] and Magyars as [...] "Black Ogurs". Studies of the physical remains, such as skulls at Sarkel, have revealed a mixture of Slavic, other European, and a few Mongolian types.|$|E
50|$|Morales {{claimed his}} victory marked Bolivia's first {{election}} of an indigenous head of state, but this claim generated controversy, {{due to the}} number of mestizo presidents who came before him, and was challenged publicly by such figures as Mario Vargas Llosa, who accused Morales of fomenting <b>racial</b> <b>divisions</b> in an increasingly mestizo Latin America.|$|R
50|$|Races {{were once}} {{considered}} human subspecies, but genetic {{research shows that}} inherited differences do not accurately match common <b>racial</b> <b>divisions.</b> For example, since non-Africans are descended from a small population that emigrated from Africa about 100,000 years ago, non-Africans (even those representing different races) are {{more closely related to}} each other than Africans are to each other.|$|R

40|$|A {{normative}} {{desire for}} interracialism undergirds and structures {{the sociology of}} race. However, focusing almost exclusively on <b>racial</b> <b>divisions</b> and conflicts, the sociology of race rarely subjects interracialism to explicit analysis. One conse-quence of this somewhat peculiar situation is that interracialism is understood nega-tively, as deracialization. Even the few studies that appear to redress this negativity through explicit analysis reproduce it. Prototypically, there {{has long been a}} scholarly consensus that Hawaii’s interracial working-class movement of the late 1930 s and 1940 s presupposed deracialization: that a “colorblind ” class ideology, advanced by the left-led International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union, effaced <b>racial</b> <b>divisions.</b> Refuting this interpretation, this paper demonstrates that a deracializing class ideology was not straightforwardly adopted by Hawaii’s racially divided work-ers. Instead, a leftist ideology of class served as the initial pivot for an affirmative transformation of race, producing an interracial ideology that rearticulated, rather than disarticulated, race and class. The paper concludes with several implications of reconceptualizing interracialism affirmatively...|$|R
