40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports a}} series of {{centrifuge}} model tests on torsionally loaded 12, 22, and 33 pile groups in sand. <b>The</b> objectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper are to investigate: 1 <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pile groups subjected to torsion; 2 {{the way in which}} the applied torque is transferred in the pile groups; 3 the internal forces mobilized in these torsionally loaded pile groups and their contributions to resist the applied torque; and 4 the influence factors that affect the load transfer, such as soil density and pile-cap connection. In these model tests, <b>the</b> group torsional <b>resistances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pile groups increased monotonically in <b>the</b> test range <b>of</b> twist angles up to 8 °.
