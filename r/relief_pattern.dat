40|$|Context Symptom {{relief is}} a key goal of palliative care. There {{is a need to}} {{consider}} complexities in symptom <b>relief</b> <b>patterns</b> for groups of people to understand and evaluate symptom relief as an indicator of quality of care at end of life. Objectives The aims of this study were to distinguish classes of patients who have different symptom <b>relief</b> <b>patterns</b> during the last week of life and to identify predictors of these classes in an adult register population. Methods In a cross-sectional retrospective design, data were used from 87, 026 decedents with expected deaths registered in the Swedish Register of Palliative Care in 2011 and 2012. Study variables were structured into patient characteristics, and processes and outcomes of quality of care. A latent class analysis was used to identify symptom <b>relief</b> <b>patterns.</b> Multivariate multinomial regression analyses were used to identify predictors of class membership. Results Five latent classes were generated: “relieved pain,” “relieved pain and rattles,” “relieved pain and anxiety,” “partly relieved shortness of breath, rattles and anxiety,” and “partly relieved pain, anxiety and confusion. ” Important predictors of class membership were age, sex, cause of death, and having someone present at death, individual prescriptions as needed (PRN) and expert consultations. Conclusion Interindividual variability and complexity in symptom <b>relief</b> <b>patterns</b> may inform quality of care and its evaluation for dying people across care settings...|$|R

40|$|When an azobenzene-containing {{polymer film}} {{is exposed to}} a {{non-uniform}} illumination, a light-induced mass migration process may be induced, leading {{to the formation of}} <b>relief</b> <b>patterns</b> on the polymer free surface. Despite a research effort of many years and several proposed models many aspects of this phenomenon remain not well understood. Here we report the appearance of spiral-shaped <b>relief</b> <b>patterns</b> on the polymer under the illumination of focused Laguerre-Gauss beams, having helical wavefront and an optical vortex at their axis. The induced spiral reliefs are sensitive to the vortex topological charge and to the wavefront handedness. These findings are unexpected, because the "doughnut"-shaped intensity profile of Laguerre- Gauss beams contains no information about the wavefront handedness. We propose a model that explains the main features of this phenomenon from the surface-mediated interference of the longitudinal and the transverse components of the optical field. These results may find applications in optical micro- and nanolithography and optical-field. Comment: Open Access at Journal Reference homepag...|$|R

5000|$|A typical pad on {{a printed}} circuit board is only {{connected}} to a few narrow tracks. A pad directly connected to the copper pour is difficult to solder since the heat quickly leaks away from the pad into the copper pour due to high thermal conductivity of copper. A thermal connection restricts the heat flow, making the pad easier to solder.Via holes that only connect one layer to another, without having soldering wires or pins into the hole, do not normally need thermal restriction.Wire leaded components that are either carrying radio frequency currents, where the additional inductance would be problematic, or where very high current densities are expected, and the spokes of the thermal relief may act as a fuse, may require the thermal <b>relief</b> <b>pattern</b> to be customised or even omitted, in which case the parts may require additional hand soldering during assembly.|$|E

The 7.62×54mmR Al-Kadesih rifle {{is not to be}} confused with the Iraqi 7.62×39mm Tabuk sniper rifle. The Al-Kadesih, while cosmetically similar to the SVD, is essentially a hybrid of the SVD and Romanian PSL rifles and has some key differences with the SVD that prevent parts interchangeability between the two rifles. The Al-Kadesih has a unique pressed-metal receiver which is longer than that of the SVD, although the overall length of the rifle is similar to that of the SVD. It is fitted for the Soviet-era PSO-1 optical sight. Further, the barrel is pinned, rather than screwed, to the receiver, although it is of the same length as that of the SVD. The fore-end has four longitudinal slots on each side instead of six short slots. Another readily visible distinguishing feature of the Al-Kadesih is that the magazine has an ornamental <b>relief</b> <b>pattern</b> showing a stylised palm tree.|$|E

5000|$|In the US and Britain, the {{tradition}} of preserving miniature paintings in a wooden case covered with leather or paper stamped with a <b>relief</b> <b>pattern</b> continued through to the daguerreotype. Some daguerreotypists were portrait artists who also offered miniature portraits. Black-lacquered cases ornamented with inset mother of pearl were sometimes used. The more substantial Union case was made from a mixture of colored sawdust and shellac (the main component of wood varnish) formed in a heated mold to produce a decorative sculptural relief. The word [...] "Union" [...] referred to the sawdust and varnish mixture—the manufacture of Union cases began in 1856. In all types of cases, {{the inside of the}} cover was lined with velvet or plush or satin to provide a dark surface to reflect into the plate for viewing and to protect the cover glass. Some cases, however, held two daguerreotypes opposite each other. The cased images could be set out on a table or displayed on a mantelpiece. Most cases were small and lightweight enough to easily carry in a pocket, although that was not normally done. The other approach, common in France and the rest of continental Europe, was to hang the daguerreotype on the wall in a frame, either simple or elaborate.|$|E
5000|$|PDMS stamps are {{pieces of}} {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS), a silicone, {{that have been}} patterned usually against a master to form a <b>relief</b> <b>pattern</b> used in soft lithography. This PDMS stamp {{can be used in}} either its current form as a relief surface for techniques such as microcontact printing or can also be attached to an external source by tubing so that liquid may be passed through channels on its surface. In this second case it will often be laminated to a surface so that chemistry can be performed on that surface producing a pattern of the PDMS stamp on to the surface. Alternatively a PDMS stamp can be laminated to a second piece of PDMS to form a contained device. It is possible to pattern PDMS with nanometre resolution. PDMS stamps can be procured from some commercial sources such as Research Micro Stamps. [...] Many techniques have been developed to modify the basic setups to perform a range of tasks such as assays on small volumes. These kinds of devices are often referred to as microfluidic devices. Because of the small dimensions of these devices flow is laminar not turbulent which can lead to many useful properties; however, this reduces the ability of fluid streams to mix.|$|E
