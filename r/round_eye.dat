25|$|One of Enju's allies. He also {{drank the}} moon spring water. He dresses up as a girl. It was shown {{that when he}} was young, he had ugly scars from an {{accident}} and that his fellow villagers thought of him as repulsive. One girl, Mai, the most beautiful girl in the village, befriended him because she thought he was pitiful. After Maimai became beautiful from the spring water, he murdered everyone from his village and killed Mai because he felt ugly in her presence. He is Princess Yuri's younger brother, and has the same soul symbol as she has. Soul Symbol: Beauty. Similarly to Maora from The Gentlemen's Alliance Cross, his physical appearance is drastically different dressing as a girl: he has a girly <b>round</b> <b>eye</b> shape and a delicate feminine neck as opposed to his masculine appearance.|$|E
500|$|In general, most medicanes {{maintain}} a radius of , last between 12hours and 5days, travel between , develop {{an eye for}} less than 72hours, and feature wind speeds of up to in addition, a majority are characterized on satellite imagery as asymmetric systems with a distinct <b>round</b> <b>eye</b> encircled by atmospheric convection. Weak rotation, {{similar to that in}} most tropical cyclones, is usually noted in a medicane's early stages, increasing with intensity; medicanes, however, often have less time to intensify, remaining weaker than most North Atlantic hurricanes and only persisting for the duration of a few days. The maximum achievable intensity of medicanes is equivalent to the lowest classification on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, Category1. While the entire lifetime of a cyclone may encompass several days, most will only retain tropical characteristics for less than 24hours. Circumstances sometimes permit the formation of smaller-scale medicanes, although the required conditions differ even from those needed by other medicanes. The development of abnormally small tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean usually requires upper-level atmospheric cyclones inducing cyclogenesis in the lower atmosphere, leading to the formation of warm-core lows, encouraged by favorable moisture, heat, and other environmental circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|Passing {{just south}} of Vanua Levu, Winston {{achieved}} its record intensity early on 20 February with ten-minute sustained winds of 280km/h (175mph) and a pressure of 884hPa (mbar; 26.10inHg). It was operationally estimated with ten-minute sustained winds of 230km/h (145mph) and a pressure of 915hPa (mbar; 27.02inHg). The JTWC estimated Winston with one-minute sustained winds of 285km/h (180mph). At peak intensity, it revealed a fairly symmetric convective structure with a 25km (15mi) <b>round</b> <b>eye,</b> under low vertical wind shear easily offset by strong divergence aloft; moreover, sea surface temperatures remained warm, near [...] Winston soon made landfall in the Rakiraki District on Viti Levu at peak intensity, making it the only known Category5 storm, on both the Australian tropical cyclone scale and the Saffir-Simpson scale, to directly impact Fiji, and therefore the most intense storm on record to strike the nation. It also marked the strongest landfall by any cyclone in the South Pacific basin, {{and one of the}} strongest landfalls worldwide. Despite deteriorating slightly while crossing the northern portion of Viti Levu, Winston remained well-organised, reforming a ragged and cloud-filled eye after re-emerging into open waters.|$|E

60|$|They slept or sat unmoving and patient. As the sun mounted {{higher the}} breeze died out, and perfect stillness reigned {{in the empty}} creek. A troop of long-nosed monkeys appeared, and {{crowding}} on the outer boughs, contemplated the boat and the motionless men in it with grave and sorrowful intensity, disturbed now and then by irrational outbreaks of mad gesticulation. A little bird with sapphire breast balanced a slender twig across a slanting beam of light, and flashed in it to and fro like a gem dropped from the sky. His minute <b>round</b> <b>eye</b> stared at the strange and tranquil creatures in the boat. After a while he sent out a thin twitter that sounded impertinent and funny in the solemn silence of the great wilderness; in the great silence full of struggle and death.|$|E
6000|$|When he {{returned}} from his military service Jean-Pierre Bacadou found the old people very much aged. He remarked with pain {{that the work of}} the farm was not satisfactorily done. The father had not the energy of old days. The hands did not feel over them the eye of the master. Jean-Pierre noted with sorrow that the heap of manure in the courtyard before the only entrance to the house was not so large as it should have been. The fences were out of repair, and the cattle suffered from neglect. At home the mother was practically bedridden, and the girls chattered loudly in the big kitchen, unrebuked, from morning to night. He said to himself: [...] "We must change all this." [...] He talked the matter over with his father one evening when the rays of the setting sun entering the yard between the outhouses ruled the heavy shadows with luminous streaks. Over the manure heap floated a mist, opal-tinted and odorous, and the marauding hens would stop in their scratching to examine with a sudden glance of their <b>round</b> <b>eye</b> the two men, both lean and tall, talking in hoarse tones. The old man, all twisted with rheumatism and bowed with years of work, the younger bony and straight, spoke without gestures in the indifferent manner of peasants, grave and slow. But before the sun had set the father had submitted to the sensible arguments of the son. [...] "It is not for me that I am speaking," [...] insisted Jean-Pierre. [...] "It is for the land. It's a pity to see it badly used. I am not impatient for myself." [...] The old fellow nodded over his stick. [...] "I dare say; I dare say," [...] he muttered. [...] "You may be right. Do what you like. It's the mother that will be pleased." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was not till, like a {{child with}} a sea-shell at his ear, he began {{to be aware of the}} great roar of the [...] "underground," [...] that, in his third-class carriage, the cruelty of the {{reservation}} penetrated, with the taste of acrid smoke, to his inner sense. It was really degrading to be eager in the face of having to [...] "alter." [...] Peter Baron tried to figure to himself at that moment that he was not flying to betray the extremity of his need, but hurrying to fight for some of those passages of superior boldness which were exactly what the conductor of the [...] "Promiscuous Review" [...] would be sure to be down upon. He made believe--as if to the greasy fellow-passenger opposite--that he felt indignant; but he saw that to the small <b>round</b> <b>eye</b> of this still more downtrodden brother he represented selfish success. He would have liked to linger in the conception that he had been [...] "approached" [...] by the Promiscuous; but whatever might be thought in the office of that periodical of some of his flights of fancy, there was no want of vividness in his occasional suspicion that he passed there for a familiar bore. The only thing that was clearly flattering was the fact that the Promiscuous rarely published fiction. He should therefore be associated with a deviation from a solemn habit, and that would more than make up to him for a phrase in one of Mr. Locket's inexorable earlier notes, a phrase which still rankled, about his showing no symptom of the faculty really creative. [...] "You don't seem able to keep a character together," [...] this pitiless monitor had somewhere else remarked. Peter Baron, as he sat in his corner while the train stopped, considered, in the befogged gaslight, the bookstall standard of literature and asked himself whose character had fallen to pieces now. Tormenting indeed had always seemed to him such a fate as to have the creative head without the creative hand.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Furnival {{herself was}} a stout, solid woman, {{sensible}} on most points, but better adapted, perhaps, {{to the life}} in Keppel Street than that to which she had now been promoted. As Kitty Blacker she had possessed feminine charms {{which would have been}} famous had they been better known. Mr. Furnival had fetched her from farther East--from the region of Great Ormond street and the neighbourhood of Southampton Buildings. Her cherry cheeks, and her <b>round</b> <b>eye,</b> and her full bust, and her fresh lip, had conquered the hard-tasked lawyer; and so they had gone forth to fight the world together. Her eye was still round, and her cheek red, and her bust full,--there had certainly been no falling off there; nor will I say that her lip had lost its freshness. But the bloom of her charms had passed away, and she was now a solid, stout, motherly woman, not bright in converse, but by no means deficient in mother-wit, recognizing well the duties which she owed to others, but recognizing equally well those which others owed to her. All the charms of her youth--had they not been given to him, and also all her solicitude, all her anxious fighting with the hard world? When they had been poor together, had she not patched and turned and twisted, sitting silently by his side into the long nights, because she would not ask him {{for the price of a}} new dress? And yet now, now that they were rich--? Mrs. Furnival, when she put such questions within her own mind, could hardly answer this latter one with patience. Others might be afraid of the great Mr. Furnival in his wig and gown; others might be struck dumb by his power of eye and mouth; but she, she, the wife of his bosom, she could catch him without his armour. She would so catch him and let him know what she thought of all her wrongs. So she said to herself many a day, and yet the great deed, in all its explosiveness, had never yet been done. Small attacks of words there had been many, but hitherto the courage to speak out her griefs openly had been wanting to her.|$|E
