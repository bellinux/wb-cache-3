5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a <b>ripple</b> <b>effect,</b> as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} {{what seems to be}} a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the non-Euclidean geometries had a <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> which went far {{beyond the boundaries of}} mathematics and science. The philosopher Immanuel Kant's treatment of human knowledge had a special role for geometry. It was his prime example of synthetic a priori knowledge; not derived from the senses nor deduced through logic— our knowledge of space was a truth that we were born with. Unfortunately for Kant, his concept of this unalterably true geometry was Euclidean. Theology was also affected by the change from absolute truth to relative truth in the way that mathematics is related to the world around it, that was a result of this paradigm shift.|$|E

25|$|Before {{winning the}} {{presidency}} in 2002, Lula had been a strident union organizer known for his bushy beard and Che Guevara T-shirts. In the 2002 campaign, Lula foreswore both his informal clothing style and his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit. This last point had worried economists, businessmen and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default along with the existing Argentine default would have a massive <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> through the world economy.

25|$|The Penn Central's {{bankruptcy}} had a <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> on the Northeast economy. The PC bankruptcy absolved {{them from}} paying their debts, which included payments owed to other railroads. The PC's {{failure to pay}} was a major contribution to other Northeast lines that also entered bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was the final blow to long-haul private-sector passenger train service in the United States. The troubled company filed proposals with the ICC to abandon most of its remaining passenger rail service, causing a chain reaction among its fellow railroads, who also decided to drop their money losing passenger trains. In 1971 Congress created Amtrak, a government corporation, which began to operate a skeleton passenger service on the tracks of Penn Central and other U.S. railroads.|$|E

25|$|Manex also handled {{creature}} effects, such as Sentinels {{and machines}} {{in real world}} scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent {{at the end of}} the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.|$|E
25|$|The federal {{government}} tied its loan assistance to requirements that these housing co-ops provide {{a percentage of}} their units, usually at least 15 to 20 per cent, for what are termed income-tested residents. These people voluntarily provide information to the co-op on a confidential basis about their gross income, and their monthly housing charge (rent)is then calculated according to a formula. If the calculated charge {{is less than the}} market rent of the units, then the {{federal government}}, through another formula, would provide funding to those units to bring their unit revenue up to the market rate. This produced mixed-income co-op housing, in which relatively well-off people lived side-by-side with relatively low-income people and worked with them on committees. This often had the <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> of improving the financial health of those less well-off.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{records show}} that this beetle once lived in 35 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, and three Canadian provinces: Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. Now, natural populations are known to occur in only five states {{and at least one}} province: on Block Island in Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Arkansas, South Dakota, Nebraska and Ontario. They have also been reintroduced to Ohio. In Oklahoma, {{petitions}} were made in 2015 and 2016 to delist the species from endangered status as it came {{in the way of the}} oil and gas industry in the region. N. americanus was listed as an endangered species in 1989; the IUCN lists the species as critically endangered. Biologists have determined conclusively why N. americanus has disappeared from so many areas. Widespread use of pesticides may have caused local populations to disappear. The dramatic disappearance of this insect from many areas, however, took place before widespread use of DDT. Lack of small carcasses to bury would prevent the species from reproducing, and changes in land use has reduced the quantity of small- to medium-sized birds and mammals preferred by N. americanus. Even the extinction of the once ubiquitous passenger pigeon may have had a <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> on carrion feeders like this beetle.|$|E

50|$|A Booster Break {{program can}} {{transform}} workplace policies to improve organizational morale and lower {{health care costs}} with favorable <b>ripple</b> <b>effects</b> for society. To illustrate {{the impact of the}} Booster Break program, the Booster Break <b>Ripple</b> <b>Effects</b> Model was developed and has six levels: Booster Break practices, health effects, organizational morale, productivity, health care costs, and organizational image. The first level provides examples of Booster Break behaviors (e.g., physical activity, meditation, and breath training). The second level presents the immediate proximal effects of Booster Break practices (e.g., improved health, reduced stress, increased energy, and fun). The third level, organizational morale, is a proximal effect of the second level related to practice and policy. The fourth, fifth, and sixth levels are increasingly distal but substantial effects of Booster Break practices and policies (i.e., increased productivity, decreased health care costs, and improved organizational image). The first waves of the <b>ripple</b> <b>effects</b> are the strongest, and each successive wave is less robust than the previous waves. The levels are interconnected and synergistic. The strength and robustness of each level affects the impact of each successive level. For example, frequent Booster Break practices by a greater number of employees will yield greater health care savings. Recent research provided scientific support for the first three levels of the Booster Break <b>Ripple</b> <b>Effects</b> Model. The full impact of the Model is being studied.|$|R

The supervisor decided on subtlety, throwing color separations out of sync to create a blurry <b>ripple</b> <b>effect.</b> While simple, the sequence was more effective than the elaborate planned scene. Effects such as the destruction of the merchant ship were created using projected explosions, a technique perfected during the production of Return of the Jedi. Simulated zero-gravity explosions were filmed and reflected onto a card using the same motion control program used for the models. The result was an explosion that moved with the model.|$|E
