25|$|No-one {{has ever}} been charged with the bombings. A {{campaign}} by the victims' families led to an Irish government inquiry under Justice Henry Barron. His 2003 report criticised the Garda Síochána's investigation and said the investigators stopped their work prematurely. It also criticised the Fine Gael/Labour government of the time for its inaction and {{lack of interest in}} the bombings. The report said it was likely that British security force personnel were involved but had insufficient evidence of higher-level involvement. However, the inquiry was hindered by the British government's refusal to <b>release</b> <b>key</b> documents. The victims' families and others have continued to campaign for the British government to release these documents.|$|E

25|$|In August 1999, Irish Victims Commissioner, John Wilson, {{reported}} on the demand for a public inquiry. He proposed a judicial inquiry, held in private. In December 1999, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern appointed Mr Justice Liam Hamilton to undertake an inquiry into the bombings. The inquiry began work early in 2000 and in October Mr Justice Henry Barron was appointed to succeed Mr Justice Hamilton. The Irish Government and others reported that the British Government were slow to co-operate with the inquiry. It wrote to the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, John Reid, in November 2000. He replied in February 2002, saying that British documents on the bombings would not be made available due to national security concerns. The Barron Report was published in December 2003. The report said it was likely that British security force personnel {{were involved in the}} bombings but had insufficient evidence of higher-level involvement. However, the inquiry reported that it was hindered by the British Government's refusal to <b>release</b> <b>key</b> documents. For details on the Barron Report's findings, see below.|$|E
2500|$|The 40th Anniversary mix of {{the debut}} album {{presents}} a stereo version of [...] "Light My Fire" [...] in speed-corrected form for the first time. The speed discrepancy (being about 3.5% slow) was brought to Bruce Botnick's attention by Brigham Young University professor Michael Hicks, who noted that all video and audio live performances of the Doors performing the song, the sheet music, and statements of band members show the song in a key almost a half step higher (key of A) than the stereo LP <b>release</b> (<b>key</b> of A♭/G♯). Until the 2006 remasters, only the original 45 RPM singles ("Light My Fire" [...] and [...] "Break On Through") were produced at the correct speed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} irregular operation of the block apparatus by the signalman at Barnes Junction. The signals were interlocked {{so that they could}} not be freed to show clear unless the block ahead was clear. A manual <b>release</b> <b>key</b> could be used to circumvent this interlocking if, for example, a broken mechanical link or track circuit gave a false indication of a train on the line. The signalman for Point Pleasant, the block behind Barnes, offered the passenger train forward improperly, without waiting for the [...] "Train out of section" [...] acknowledgement from Barnes. The Barnes signalman had forgotten about the freight train and used his <b>release</b> <b>key</b> to clear the signals.|$|E

5000|$|The {{transistorized}} IBM 129 Card Data Recorder's primary {{advantage over}} other IBM keypunches {{was that it}} featured an electronic 80-column buffer to hold the card image [...] When using earlier IBM keypunches, a keystroke error required the card to be ejected by pressing the Release and Register keys, the error corrected by pressing the Duplicate key until the error column was reached, typing the correct data {{for the rest of}} that card, then pressing the <b>Release</b> <b>key</b> and manually removing the bad card from the output card stacker before it was placed in the deck (this required some practice, but quickly became an automatic action that you no longer had to think about). With the 129, a keystroke error could be erased by pressing the Backspace key and re-keyed. The entire 80-column card was punched automatically, as fast as the mechanism could go, when the <b>Release</b> <b>key</b> was pressed.|$|E

50|$|For the Italian {{market the}} {{keyboard}} {{is in the}} QZERTY layout, as with most Italian machines (excluding modern computer keyboards). Aside from the typing keys, the keyboard includes a space bar, two shift keys, one caps lock key, a backspace key and a margin <b>release</b> <b>key.</b> Of these, only the backspace key bears a mark on it (an arrow pointing right), while the other five mentioned are left anonymous.|$|E
5000|$|Very few {{machines}} of {{this type}} were built, but all were made between 1913 and 1915. This was a transition machine that introduced the [...] "Controlled-Key" [...] safeguard, {{which was part of}} an error detection mechanism that blocked most of the keyboard if a key was not pressed enough to add its total to the result. When this mechanism was activated, all the columns of keys were blocked except for the one where the error occurred. Therefore, the operator could find the column in question, reenter the number and unlock the keyboard by pressing the <b>release</b> <b>key</b> in order to resume the operations.|$|E

5000|$|Electromagnets: Electromagnets {{can be used}} to <b>release</b> <b>keys</b> after a delay.

5000|$|The {{crash was}} a {{rear-end}} collision {{caused by a}} signalman's error. The inexperienced signalman at Purley Oaks forgot about a train from Haywards Heath to London Bridge standing invisible in the fog. The line was protected by the Sykes [...] "Lock and Block" [...] apparatus, which prevented him from allowing another train into the section until the preceding one had left it. However, {{he believed that the}} elderly apparatus was faulty and used a <b>release</b> <b>key.</b> This allowed a train from Tattenham Corner to London Bridge into the same section, and they collided near South Croydon Junction. The trains were crowded in the rush hour, carrying 800 and 1000 people respectively, hence the heavy death toll.|$|E
