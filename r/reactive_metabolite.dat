[...] These studies have suggested that hepatotoxicity of troglitazone results from a combination of nonmetabolic and metabolic factors. [...] The nonmetabolic toxicity is a complex function of drug-protein interactions in the liver and biliary system. Initially the metabolic toxicity was largely associated with <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolite</b> formation from the thiazolidinedione and chromane rings of troglitazone.

Initial rapid screening involved electrochemiluminescent (ECL) arrays featuring spots containing ruthenium poly(vinylpyridine), DNA, and rat liver microsomes or bicistronically expressed human cyt P 450 2 E 1 (h 2 E 1). Cyt P 450 enzymes were activated via the NADPH/reductase cycle. When bioactivation of substrates in the films gives <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolites,</b> they are trapped by covalent attachment to DNA bases. The rate of increase in ECL with enzyme reaction time reflects relative DNA damage rates. “Toxic hits” uncovered by the array were studied in structural detail by using enzyme/DNA films on silica nanospheres as “nanoreactors” to provide nucleobase adducts from <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolites.</b> The utility of this synergistic approach was demonstrated by estimating relative DNA damage rates of three mutagenic N-nitroso compounds and styrene. Relative enzyme turnover rates for these compounds using ECL arrays and LC-UV-MS correlated well with TD 50 values for liver tumor formation in rats.

50|$|There {{has been}} a {{reluctance}} for modern drug discovery programs to consider covalent inhibitors due to toxicity concerns (Park et al., 2011). An important contributor has been the drug toxicities of several high-profile drugs believed {{to be caused by}} metabolic activation of reversible drugs(Park et al., 2011). For example, high dose acetaminophen can lead to the formation of the <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolite</b> N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine. Also, covalent inhibitors such as beta lactam antibiotics which contain weak electrophiles can lead to idiosyncratic toxicities (IDT) in some patients. It has been noted that many approved covalent inhibitors have been used safely for decades with no observed idiosyncratic toxicity. Also, that IDTs are not limited to proteins with a covalent mechanism of action(Bauer, 2015). A recent analysis has noted that the risk of idiosyncratic toxicities may be mitigated through lower doses of administered drug. Doses of less than 10 mg per day rarely lead to IDT irrespective of the drug mechanism(Nakayama et al., 2009).|$|E

It could also be possible that a reactive intermediate is formed due to the unstable β -lactam ring. The pyridinium side-group of cephaloridine has unstable bonds to the core of the compound (in comparison with other cephalosporins).

50|$|In addition, the cytosolic N,O-aryl hydroxamic acid acyl{{transfer}}ase enzyme catalyzes {{the transfer}} of the acetyl group from the N atom of the N-OH-2-AAF to the O atom of the N-OH group to produce N-acetoxy-2-aminofluorene (N-OH-2-AF). This <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolite</b> spontaneously decomposes to form a nitrenium ion which will also react with DNA. However, the product of this latter reaction is the deacetylated aminofluorene adduct. The interconversion of amide and amine metabolites of 2-AAF can further occur via the microsomal enzyme deacetylase producing the N-hydroxy metabolite of the amine derivative. Subsequent esterification of the aryl hydroxylamine by sulfur transferase yields the sulfate ester which also spontaneously decompose to form nitrenium ion. The reactive nitrenium, carbonium and arylamidonium ion metabolites of 2-AAF react with the nucleophilic groups in DNA, proteins and endogenous thiols like glutathione. Other metabolites such as the N,O-glucuronide, although not directly activated products, can be important in the carcinogenic process because they are capable of degradation to proximal N-hydroxy metabolites. This metabolite is presumed to be involved in formation of bladder tumors. The mechanism for this is thought to involve degradation of glucuronide in the bladder due to acidic pH of urine.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Isoniazid (INH) is {{associated}} with serious liver injury and autoimmunity. Classic studies in rats indicated that a <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolite</b> of acetylhydrazine {{is responsible for the}} covalent binding and toxicity of INH. Studies in rabbits suggested that hydrazine might be the toxic species. However, these models involved acute toxicity with high doses of INH, and INH-induced liver injury in humans has very different features than such animal models. In this study, we demonstrated that a <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolite</b> of INH itself can covalently bind in the liver of mice and also to human liver microsomes. Covalent binding also occurred in rats, but it was much less than that in mice. We were able to trap the <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolite</b> of INH with N-α-acetyl-L-lysine in incubations with human liver microsomes. This suggests that the reactive intermediate of INH that leads to covalent binding is a diazohydroxide rather than a radical or carbocation because those reactive metabolites would be too reactive to trap in this way. Treatment of mice or rats with INH for up to 5 weeks did not produce severe liver injury.

40|$|ABSTRACT During {{development}} of pharmaceuticals, {{it is essential}} to as early as possible identify and preferably avoid formation of <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolites</b> and intermediates. <b>Reactive</b> <b>metabolites</b> may represent obstacles in the development and use of drugs, due to their potential toxicity. The formation of <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolites</b> often involves oxidation reactions and the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes are the most important enzymes catalyzing oxidative phase I drug metabolism. The present studies were initiated with the aim to chemically mimic phase I drug oxidations, using electrochemistry for characterization and identification of <b>reactive</b> drug <b>metabolites</b> and to avoid metabolic activation by altering the chemical structure of the parent drug. Three complementary chemical systems were evaluated for their abilities to mimic CYP-catalyzed oxidations. All relevant oxidative reactions were mimicked by {{at least one of the}} three systems. The oxidative metabolism of the antimalarial agent amodiaquine was studied in liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes. Electrochemical oxidation was used to characterize metabolic intermediates and enabled the structural determination of an aldehyde metabolite of amodiaquine by NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the bioactivation of the neuroleptic drug haloperidol was studied. Proposed iminium species of haloperidol were observed in the on-line electrochemical oxidation setup. Subsequent trapping with cyanide, both in liver microsomes and in the electrochemical system, strengthened the proposal of iminium intermediate formation in the oxidative metabolism of haloperidol. Further, in the cyanide trapping experiments the presence of the dihydropyridinium species and the absence of the corresponding cyano adduct indicated that an unstable cyano adduct was formed. Trapping of an exocyclic iminium species with cyanide in the electrochemical experiments but not in the liver microsomal incubations implied that this intermediate, obligatory in the electrochemically mediated N-dealkylation, may not be formed in the CYP-catalyzed reaction. Metabolic studies on haloperidol and trifluperidol, in comparison with their corresponding silicon analogues, were performed in liver microsomes and hepatocytes. The replacement of one single carbon atom by a silicon atom resulted in significant metabolic changes, including the absence of silapyridinium metabolites and glucuronidation on the silanol group. In conclusion, several different examples of how electrochemistry can be used in studies on <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolites</b> are provided in this thesis. For drug risk assessment, it is important to characterize formed <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolites</b> and if possible, alter chemical design to avoid reactivity...|$|R

However, the relationship between AMAP and CYP 2 E 1, the enzyme generally implicated in the amplification of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity after ethanol ingestion, has not been fully elucidated. The microsomal metabolism of AMAP to reactive metabolites has been studied however, the identity of the reactive metabolite(s) of AMAP that bind to CYP 2 E 1 has not been unequivocally determined. Therefore, we hypothesized that AMAP would covalently bind to and inhibit CYP 2 E 1 in a reconstituted system and that mass spectral analysis would provide structural information for the <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolite.</b> Deconvoluted mass spectra indicated that a <b>reactive</b> <b>metabolite</b> of AMAP forms mono- and diadducts with CYP 2 E 1 apoprotein (experimentally measured masses = 54622. 4 ± 8. 9 Da, 54791. 3 ± 6. 1 Da, and 54451. 7 ± 5. 5 Da, respectively) but not to other incubation components (i. e., heme, cytochrome b 5, or cytochrome P 450 reductase).
