25|$|By 1964, in {{the face}} of the superiority of tractors, the {{breeding}} of the heavy warmblood had completely collapsed. Stallions covered 10% of the mares that they had 20 years before. This scene played out in the 1950s and 60's throughout German horse breeding. During this time, though, increasing leisure time meant that horses soon found their modern cultural niche: recreational riding. The breeders of Ostfriesland aimed to develop their horses along this path, producing a lighter riding horse with all the economical traits that had made them popular before. Fearing that the Thoroughbred would detract from the amenable nature of their horses, the Ostfriesen breeders chose to use Arabian blood instead. Beginning in 1948, such stallions were made available to the breeders, who scarcely used them, being hard-put to change their beloved horses so drastically. However, the evidence was convincing, as the Freisen-Arabs were horses of excellent character, great capacity and <b>riding</b> <b>quality.</b> Unfortunately, they had missed the mark: the market demanded a light, elegant, but tall riding horses, and the Freisen-Arabs were smaller than their warmblood mothers. Limited in their competitiveness in dressage and jumping, the Freisen-Arabs did not sell, and the Ostfriesen horses seemed doomed to extinction.|$|E

40|$|When {{introducing}} autonomous functionality {{in personal}} vehicles {{the ability to}} control the <b>quality</b> of the <b>ride</b> is transferred from the driver to the vehicle control system. In this context, a reference method for quantifying <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> may be a useful tool in the development and tuning process. This master’s thesis investigates whether general quantitative measures of <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> can be of value in the tuning of motion controllers for autonomous vehicles. A set of tools is built for a specific case study, analysing a lateral path planning algorithm, based on a finite horizon linear quadratic tracking controller, and how its tuning affects <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> performance. A graphical user interface is built, with functionality for frequency domainanalysis of the path planning algorithm, individually and in combination with the remaining lateral control system, as well as <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation based on lateral acceleration data, from logged test runs and simulation results. In addition, a simulation environment for the lateral control system is modified to be used in combination with the evaluation tool. Results of the case study indicate a measurable difference in <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> performance when comparing manual and autonomous driving with the current implementation. Attempts were made to improve <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> by re-tuning the path planning algorithm but little or no improvement from the previous tuning was made. The work has recognized the potential of using <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> measures in the development and tuning process for autonomous vehicles as well as devising a tuning strategy incorporating frequency analysis and <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation through simulation for the lateral control system. To further increase <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> performance via the path planning algorithm an altered controller structure, such as a frequency weighted linear quadratic controller is suggested...|$|R

50|$|TransPeshawar {{is unique}} with other 3 BRT Metros in Pakistan in terms they way its to operate. Lahore/Multan & Rwalpindi Metros have a fixed {{corridor}} length and “air-conditioned” buses operate within that particular length. In contrast to that, TransPeshawar {{is designed for}} 8 different routes with an accumulated route length of 26Km and serving 31 bus stops along these 8 routes. TransPeshawar will serve 31 bus stops on-corridor and 100 new bus stops off-corridor. Other metros in Pakistan pick & drop the passengers from bus stops on the specialized corridor only whereas TransPeshawar is designed to pick & drop the passengers both on & off-corridor. 7 routes will operate as off-on-off-corridor sequence which will increase the utility of specialized corridor. Only 1 route will operate purely on-corridor just like other Metros in Pakistan. On Average all 57% route length of these routes will be on-corridor and 47% off-corridor. This arrangement significantly improves the utilization of the specialized corridor.Multan Metro bus has started its operations with 35 buses , with 68 for RWP/Islamabad and Lahore metro started with 45 buses. TransPeshawar is aiming to operate 383 buses of nearly same configuration as of Multan/Lahore on 8 routes throughout the city. The specialized corridor will have controlled entry and exit points for its 7 routes that will operate as off-on-off corridor. All 31 bus stops on-corridor are designed to provide park & ride facility. Bikers can park their bicycles on the station and take the bus to their destination. Similarly park & ride facility is provided for car drivers as well. There are 3 park & ride facilities each with a car parking capacity of 72, 90 & 100 cars and these facilities are located Hayatabad, Chmkani and Dabgari Garden. While its worth appreciating to provide park & ride facility to encourage the public transportation over private cars, more important is our attitudes. Can we prefer public transport over private? Will this affect our reputation in society? Other measures like increasing parking fee in areas near to on-corridor bus stops may help to some extent. However preference of TransPeshawar usage is directly proportional to the <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> & efficiency & reliability of same.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a summary index of a rutted profile for the estimation of <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> of road vehicles in a rutted road. First, the spatial frequency analysis of the rutted profiles by the continuous wavelet transform is conducted to comprehend the wavy characteristics of the profiles associated with the vehicle motion caused by the lane-change maneuver in the rutting. The result shows that the wavy characteristics in the wavelength of 0. 4 m affect the vehicle dynamics with respect to the <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> deterioration. Second, a difference filter is designed to detect the wavelength of 0. 4 m from a rutted profile. The filtering manipulation enhances the wavy characteristics of the profile corresponding to the <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> of the vehicle. Finally, we develop a summary index of the profile that is the difference between maximum and minimum elevation of the filtered profile. The result of regression analysis shows that the developed index highly correlates with the <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> rating value based on the vehicle dynamics.
