5|$|This {{equation}} can {{be solved}} by the Euclidean algorithm, as described above. Finding multiplicative inverses is an essential step in the RSA algorithm, which is widely used in electronic commerce; specifically, the equation determines the integer used to decrypt the message. Note that although the RSA algorithm uses rings rather than fields, the Euclidean algorithm can still be used to find a multiplicative inverse where one exists. The Euclidean algorithm also has other applications in error-correcting codes; for example, {{it can be used}} {{as an alternative to the}} Berlekamp–Massey algorithm for decoding BCH and <b>Reed–Solomon</b> codes, which are based on Galois fields.|$|E
25|$|A {{classical}} type {{of error}} correction coding used with OFDM-based systems is convolutional coding, often concatenated with <b>Reed-Solomon</b> coding. Usually, additional interleaving (on {{top of the}} time and frequency interleaving mentioned above) in between the two layers of coding is implemented. The choice for <b>Reed-Solomon</b> coding as the outer error correction code is based on the observation that the Viterbi decoder used for inner convolutional decoding produces short error bursts when there is a high concentration of errors, and <b>Reed-Solomon</b> codes are inherently well-suited to correcting bursts of errors.|$|E
25|$|Hamming {{codes are}} the most {{commonly}} used ECC for SLCNAND flash. <b>Reed-Solomon</b> codes and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes are commonly used ECC for MLCNAND flash. Some MLCNAND flash chips internally generate the appropriate BCHerror correction codes.|$|E
25|$|WorldDAB, the {{organisation}} {{in charge of}} the DAB standards, announced DAB+, a major upgrade to the DAB standard in 2006, when the HE-AAC v2 audio codec (also known as eAAC+) was adopted. The new standard, which is called DAB+, has also adopted the MPEG Surround audio format and stronger error correction coding in the form of <b>Reed-Solomon</b> coding. DAB+ has been standardised as European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) TS 102 563.|$|E
25|$|Without error {{correcting}} codes, {{digital audio}} {{would not be}} technically feasible. The <b>Reed–Solomon</b> codes can correct a corrupted symbol with a single bit error just as easily as it can correct a symbol with all bits wrong. This makes the RS codes particularly suitable for correcting burst errors. By far, the most common application of RS codes is in compact discs. In addition to basic error correction provided by RS codes, protection against burst errors due to scratches on the disc is provided by a cross interleaver.|$|E
25|$|Modern drives make {{extensive}} use of error correction codes (ECCs), particularly <b>Reed–Solomon</b> error correction. These techniques store extra bits, determined by mathematical formulas, for each block of data; the extra bits allow many errors to be corrected invisibly. The extra bits themselves take up space on the HDD, but allow higher recording densities to be employed without causing uncorrectable errors, resulting in much larger storage capacity. For example, a typical 1TB hard disk with 512-byte sectors provides additional capacity of about 93GB for the ECC data.|$|E
25|$|Newer systems, however, usually now adopt near-optimal {{types of}} error {{correction}} codes {{that use the}} turbo decoding principle, where the decoder iterates towards the desired solution. Examples of such error correction coding types include turbo codes and LDPC codes, which perform close to the Shannon limit for the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Some systems that have implemented these codes have concatenated them with either <b>Reed-Solomon</b> (for example on the MediaFLO system) or BCH codes (on the DVB-S2 system) to improve upon an error floor inherent to these codes at high signal-to-noise ratios.|$|E
25|$|Modern HDDs {{present a}} {{consistent}} interface {{to the rest}} of the computer, no matter what data encoding scheme is used internally. Typically a DSP in the electronics inside the HDD takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses PRML and <b>Reed–Solomon</b> error correction to decode the sector boundaries and sector data, then sends that data out the standard interface. That DSP also watches the error rate detected by error detection and correction, and performs bad sector remapping, data collection for Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, and other internal tasks.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} recover {{meaningful}} signal and error free audio from a signal impaired by interference and fading, the receiver uses concatenated <b>Reed-Solomon</b> block coding and Forward Error Correction encoding and decoding (codec). This technique was proven {{in the early}} days of satellite modems in the late 1970s. Linkabit, then run by Irwin Jacobs prior to his involvement with Qualcomm, offered such a codec for rack mounting in satellite earth stations. The Sirius signal uses more robust error correction on control channels than on the audio content, trading off error correction and bandwidth differently for separate categories of bits in the signal waveform.|$|E
25|$|The {{pits and}} lands do not {{directly}} represent the zeros and ones of binary data. Instead, non-return-to-zero, inverted encoding is used: {{a change from}} pit to land or land to pit indicates a one, while no change indicates a series of zeros. There {{must be at least}} two and no more than ten zeros between each one, which is defined by the length of the pit. This in turn is decoded by reversing the eight-to-fourteen modulation used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the cross-interleaved <b>Reed–Solomon</b> coding, finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the Red Book) were originally designed for CD Digital Audio, but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as CD-ROM).|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} subject to both burst errors and random errors. Burst errors include those due to disc {{material}} (defects of aluminum reflecting film, poor reflective index of transparent disc material), disc production (faults during disc forming and disc cutting etc.), disc handling (scratches – generally thin, radial and orthogonal to direction of recording) and variations in play-back mechanism. Random errors include those due to jitter of reconstructed signal wave and interference in signal. CIRC (Cross-Interleaved <b>Reed–Solomon</b> code) {{is the basis for}} error detection and correction in the CD process. It corrects error bursts up to 3,500 bits in sequence (2.4nbsp&mm in length as seen on CD surface) and compensates for error bursts up to 12,000 bits (8.5nbsp&mm) that may be caused by minor scratches.|$|E

2500|$|Certain {{families}} of codes, such as <b>Reed–Solomon,</b> operate on alphabet sizes larger than binary. This property awards such codes powerful burst error correction capabilities. Consider a code operating on [...] Each {{symbol of the}} alphabet can be represented by [...] bits.

2500|$|The new DAB+ {{standard}} has incorporated <b>Reed-Solomon</b> ECC as an [...] "inner layer" [...] of coding that {{is placed}} around the byte interleaved audio frame {{but inside the}} [...] "outer layer" [...] of convolutional coding used by the older DAB system, although on DAB+ the convolutional coding uses equal error protection (EEP) rather than UEP since each bit is equally important in DAB+. This combination of <b>Reed-Solomon</b> coding as the inner layer of coding, followed by an outer layer of convolutional coding – so-called [...] "concatenated coding" [...] – became a popular ECC scheme in the 1990s, and NASA adopted it for its deep-space missions. One slight difference between the concatenated coding used by the DAB+ system and that used on most other systems is that it uses a rectangular byte interleaver rather than Forney interleaving {{in order to provide}} a greater interleaver depth, which increases the distance over which error bursts will be spread out in the bit-stream, which in turn will allow the <b>Reed-Solomon</b> error decoder to correct a higher proportion of errors.|$|E
2500|$|Next, these 24 message {{symbols are}} encoded using C2 (28,24,5) <b>Reed–Solomon</b> code {{which is a}} {{shortened}} RS code over [...] This is two-error-correcting, being of minimum distance 5. This adds 4 bytes of redundancy, [...] forming a new frame: [...] The resulting 28-symbol codeword is passed through a (28.4) cross interleaver leading to 28 interleaved symbols. These are then passed through C1 (32,28,5) RS code, resulting in codewords of 32 coded output symbols. Further regrouping of odd numbered symbols of a codeword with even numbered symbols of the next codeword is done to break up any short bursts that may still be present after the above 4-frame delay interleaving. Thus, for every 24 input symbols there will be 32 output symbols giving [...] Finally one byte of control and display information is added. Each of the 33 bytes is then converted to 17 bits through EFM (eight to fourteen modulation) and addition of 3 merge bits. Therefore, the frame of six samples results in 33 bytes times&nbsp&17 bits (561 bits) to which are added 24 synchronization bits and 3 merging bits yielding a total of 588 bits.|$|E

To show how this might help, consider a folded <b>Reed-Solomon</b> code with [...] Decoding a <b>Reed-Solomon</b> code and folded <b>Reed-Solomon</b> code from the same fraction of errors [...] are tasks of almost of the same computational intensity: one can unfold the received word of the folded <b>Reed-Solomon</b> code, treat it as an received word of the original <b>Reed-Solomon</b> code, and run the <b>Reed-Solomon</b> list decoding algorithm on it.

So, even though <b>Reed-Solomon</b> is slow, it only has a small amount of data to handle.|$|E
