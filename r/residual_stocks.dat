50|$|The {{problem with}} igniferous fuzes {{was that they}} were not very precise and {{somewhat}} erratic, but good enough for flat trajectory shrapnel (ranges were relatively short by later standards) or high bursting carrier shells. While improvements in powder composition helped, there were several complex factors that prevented a high degree of regularity in the field. Britain in particular encountered great difficulty in achieving consistency early in World War I (1914 and 1915) with its attempts to use its by-then obsolescent gunpowder-train time fuzes for anti-aircraft fire against German bombers and airships which flew at altitudes up to 20,000 feet. It was then discovered that standard gunpowder burned differently at differing altitudes, and the problem was then rectified to some extent by specially designed fuzes with modified gunpowder formulations. Britain finally switched to mechanical (i.e. clockwork) time fuzes just after World War I which solved this problem. <b>Residual</b> <b>stocks</b> of igniferous fuzes lasted for many years after World War 2 with smoke and illuminating shells.|$|E
40|$|The Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus, is a {{pelagic species}} widely {{distributed}} in continental shelf waters along the Atlantic coast from the Gulf of Maine to Cape Hatteras. Even though the herring fishery {{is a relatively}} {{small portion of the}} East coast fishing industry, herring is important as bait for lobster fisheries and a component of the food web of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. Currently, the herring resource is in an under-exploited state and catches are less than one-third of Maximum Sustainable Yield. The herring fishery is reviewed in term of markets, resource, and management. Because herring is very vulnerable to environmental variables, it is hypothesized that egg and larval stage herring are very sensitive to low temperatures. The correlation and regression between temperature and two year-old recruitment stock was analyzed. The results suggest that environmental factors are significant in the production model for a fishery, and their inclusion is necessary to understand the cycle of fluctuating stock. ^ Ecosystem reserves (ER) {{in the context of the}} Atlantic herring fishery was discussed. A reduction in the TAC for the purpose of increasing the <b>residual</b> <b>stocks</b> available to other species in the ecosystem, I refer to as “Ecosystem Reserves” (ER). An increase in ER may imply reduced benefits of commercial harvest. In return for this reduction, we calculate added benefits for the ecosystem from the ER. The approximate magnitudes of these two components—Reduced Benefits and Added Benefits—are estimated. It must be admitted at the outset that the information at our disposal is very partial and, while our estimates are illustrative of method, their precision leaves much to be desired. Improved precision is always possible but requires a judgment of the value of increased precision versus cost. In particular, if policy decisions are insensitive to the precision of estimates, increased precision, whatever its scientific or methodological merit, has no current decision value, although it may become valuable in the future as circumstances and facts change. A basic bioeconomic model is reviewed, and a bioeconomic model for Atlantic herring is developed. Using scenario-dependent sensitivity analyses optimal exploitations were estimated, and compared in terms of stock size, harvest, and present value of net profit. These results will provide an optimal reference point to herring resource manager and policy makers. ...|$|E

And the fuel load includes forest litter, woody and herbaceous plants and dead wood. The research results show that the forest litter and the woody plants display significantly greater carbon content than herbaceous plants. The forest litter represents 36. 6 %, 50. 9 % and 66. 0 % of the total fuel load for the 50 % treatment, 70 % treatment and control respectively. Coarse woody debris accounts for 58. 4 %, 48. 0 %and 32. 6 % of the total fuel load for the 50 % treatment, 70 % treatment and control respectively. Small woody and herbaceous materials contribute very little to the fuel loading in all treatments. The total fuel loading was determined to be 54. 07 t/ha, 41. 98 t/ha and 20. 73 t/ha for the 50 % treatment, 70 % treatment, and the control, respectively.

It {{required}} urban {{authorities to}} make byelaws for new streets, to ensure structural stability of houses and prevent fires, {{and to provide}} for the drainage of buildings and the provision of air space around buildings. Section 57 determined that all houses must be through houses. Three years later the Building Act of 1878 provided more detail with constructions: it defined foundations, damp proof courses, thickness of walls, ceiling heights, space between dwellings, under floor ventilation, ventilation of rooms and size of windows. The Local Government Board, established in 1871, issued the first Model Bye-laws in 1877/78. Urban authorities either adopted them, or wrote their own versions adapted to local conditions. By 1930 when the first slum clearance measures were introduced there was a marked contrast between the <b>residual</b> <b>stock</b> of pre-regulation houses and the newer byelaw houses.

In Phase II of the study, 81 additional trees were sampled using only increment cores. Cumulative diameter increments from the cores were used in the polynomial models to compare tree volume growth changes during and after defoliation among the thinning treatments. Even though there was no significant difference in estimated volume lost during defoliation among treatments, post-defoliation growth was enhanced by thinning. Total volume reduction from defoliation ranged from 28, 049 (± 17, 462) cm 3 to 25, 993 (± 16, 251) cm 3 per tree.

40|$|Active {{portfolio}} management is commonly partitioned into {{two types of}} activities: market timing, which requires forecasts of broad-based market movements, and security analysis, which requires the selection of individual stocks that {{are perceived to be}} underpriced by the market. Merton (1981) has provided an inciteful and easily-implemented means to place a value on market timing skills. In contrast, while a normative theory of stock selection was outlined long ago in Treynor and Black's (1973) work, no convenient means of valuing potential selection ability has yet been devised. We present a framework in which the value of a security analyst can be computed. We also treat market timing ability in this framework, and therefore can compare the relative values of each type of investment analysts. We find that stock selection is potentially extremely valuable, but that its value depends critically on the forecast interval, on the correlation structure of <b>residual</b> <b>stock</b> returns, and on the ability to engage in short sales. Finally, we show how to modify the value of selection for the important case in which analysts' forecasts of stocks' alphas are subject to error. ...|$|R

When considering a chemical approach, we assumed that a process of oxidative polymerization is connected with radical-chain reactions. That is why when carrying out an oxidizing process of <b>residual</b> oil <b>stock,</b> it is necessary to use the modifiers, which are able to take part in this process, subjecting the segments of paraffin chains to chemical structuring with further formation of polycyclic naphthene-aromatic fragments, promoting the intense resin formation and preventing from the formation of the asphaltene crystalline phase.

The properties of air-blown asphaltic bitumen are regulated by resizing of the core and solvation shell of the complex structural unit (CSU) by injection of multicomponent bifunctional modifier (MBM), promoting the reduction of oxidation duration and the improvement of physical-mechanical and insulation properties of BIM.

30|$|The {{numbers of}} less {{frequently}} occurring tree species were not reduced through selection cutting; {{a fact that}} further supports the conclusion that single-tree selection cutting is compatible with preserving tree species diversity. While most dominant tree species experienced no severe losses through selection cutting, a clear impact was noted for the mid-tolerant species E. cordifolia. It clearly declined in abundance and IV, although it remained the second species in IV. The reason for this was the preferential harvest of old/large, poor-quality E. cordifolia trees, {{to improve the quality}} of the <b>residual</b> <b>stock</b> in the first harvest. Moreover, E. cordifolia trees were mostly large individuals, since regeneration for this mid-tolerant species is generally scarce under closed forests (Escobar et al. 2006; Donoso and Nyland 2005) and was thus strongly impacted by the harvesting criteria of a maximum residual diameter of 80  cm. In future harvests, impacts are likely to be more equally distributed, as most of the defective E. cordifolia trees would have already been harvested after this first selection cut. Also, E. cordifolia is one of the target tree species of selection silviculture due to its high economic value and expected fast growth and abundant regeneration at low residual basal areas (especially at 40  m 2  ha− 1). In addition, retaining some emergent E. cordifolia trees is a conservation priority as this species harbours an exceptional high diversity and abundance of epiphytes, acting as key structure for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem processes like water and nutrient cycling (Díaz et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Context: Forest landscapes are {{increasingly}} managed for fire resilience, {{particularly in the}} western US which has recently experienced drought and widespread, high-severity wildfires. Fuel reduction treatments have been effective where fires coincide with treated areas. Fuel treatments also {{have the potential to}} reduce drought-mortality if tree density is uncharacteristically high, and to increase long-term carbon storage by reducing high-severity fire probability. Objective: Assess whether fuel treatments reduce fire intensity and spread and increase carbon storage under climate change. Methods: We used a simulation modeling approach that couples a landscape model of forest disturbance and succession with an ecosystem model of carbon dynamics (Century), to quantify the interacting effects of climate change, fuel treatments and wildfire for carbon storage potential in a mixed-conifer forest in the western USA. Results: Our results suggest that fuel treatments have the potential to ‘bend the C curve’, maintaining carbon resilience despite climate change and climate-related changes to the fire regime. Simulated fuel treatments resulted in reduced fire spread and severity. There was partial compensation of C lost during fuel treatments with increased growth of <b>residual</b> <b>stock</b> due to greater available soil water, as well as a shift in species composition to more drought- and fire-tolerant Pinus jeffreyi at the expense of shade-tolerant, fire-susceptible Abies concolor.

40|$|Pinyon-juniper {{woodlands}} {{and forests}} cover well over 100 {{million acres of}} the western US. The cover type has generally received little attention from professional foresters, but is highly important due to its extent, its proximity to many communities, and its importance in providing wildlife habitat. The type is highly variable across its range {{with a variety of}} pinyon and/or juniper species, a variety of other tree and shrub species, a wide range of potential understory species, a diversity of age classes, and a wide range of geologic/soil substrates. Management objectives can vary widely and may include fuels modification, wildlife habitat improvement, improvement for livestock, forest and ecosystem health and sustainability, and landscape aesthetics. Nonsilvicultural methods have commonly been applied where management has been for the primary purpose of eliminating pinyon and juniper in favor of other vegetation types. Silvicultural methods are increasingly being applied to manage pinyon and juniper cover types for sustained tree cover as well as for other multipleuse goals. Both even and uneven-aged silvicultural methods can be used in pinyon-juniper ecosystems to manipulate stand density, structure, and composition to meet various resource objectives. No one prescription will fit all stands; and silvicultural prescriptions must be based upon current and predicted stand conditions, the silvics of the species on the site, and the ecological, economic, and social goals of the land owner/manager.

40|$|The {{effects of}} 57 years of {{uneven-aged}} management {{on the structure}} and quality of old-growth northern hardwood forests were examined within a long-term Forest Service study in the Dukes Experimental Forest, Michigan. Treatments within the study included several differing stocking levels (30, 50, 70, and 90 ft 2 /acre) and cutting cycles (5, 10, 15, and 20 years) replicated across three blocks. Tree growth and quality, as well as stand structural attributes were examined within each treatment and compared to an unmanaged Research Natural Area (RNA). Comparisons of tree grade between treatments indicated that cutting cycle length and stocking level {{had no effect on}} tree quality. In contrast, average annual diameter growth was greatest in lower stocking treatments, and regression analyses of tree growth versus <b>residual</b> <b>stocking</b> level indicated that optimum levels of growth were achieved between residual basal areas of 50 and 70 ft 2 /acre. Comparisons of stand structure between treatment areas and the unmanaged RNA suggested that volumes of CWD in the high residual basal area treatments most closely approximated those found within unmanaged old-growth. Treatments with high residual basal areas and longer cutting cycles had significantly greater snag basal area and volume than other treatments and were closer in this respect to the RNA than other treatments. Analysis of diameter distributions over time indicated that cutting cycle had little effect on distribution shape over the course of this study. In contrast, treatments with lower residual basal areas developed from increasing q to concave or negative exponential distributions over time, while the 90 ft 2 /acre treatment displayed an increasing q distribution throughout the experiment. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} manipulation of stocking levels within northern hardwood stands is of greater importance than cutting cycle in controlling stand growth, as well as influencing the development of structural complexity...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} the indications {{and the results}} of the treatment of severe deformities of the tibiotarsic joint, performed either with the external fixator or with the retrograde nail. The external fixation allows the execution of the arthrodesis independently from the tibiotarsic bone stock. The treatment can be an immediate correction, a gradual one, or associated to a bone transport, if necessary. The external fixation is mostly indicated in complex deformities, with a severe lack of bone stock, and in reviews of previous arthrodesis. The retrograde nail allows an immediate correction of the deformity, but requires more <b>residual</b> bone <b>stock</b> of the talus. In case of an insufficient bone stock, the nail stability is precarious or risky. The arthrodesis and the deformity correction with a retrograde nail, may result into an ipometry of more than 3 cm, that will require further surgical technique...|$|R
40|$|Thinning removes trees {{within a}} stand to {{regulate}} the level of site occupancy and subsequent stand development. Before thinning is applied, foresters {{determine the amount of}} <b>residual</b> growing <b>stock,</b> the spatial distribution of the residual trees, and the criteria used to select trees to cut. In this study, a portion of a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation was surveyed through a complete tree tally with the coordinates of each individual tree recorded. The dataset was then processed in a GIS program composed in Arc Marco Language (AML) applying a moving circular quadrat system superimposed over the study area. In each quadrant, tree attributes including DBH (nearest 0. 1 inch), basal area (ft 2 ac- 1), and density (trees per unit area) were utilized as determining factors for tree selection. A 3 D visualization before and after thinning was created with a goal of equal distribution of trees across the stand...|$|R
25|$|After the {{standing}} {{down of the}} original garrison, a battalion of the Swedish Home Guard is based on Gotland for emergencies {{as part of the}} Eastern Military Region (MR E). The unit, 32:a Gotlandsbataljonen (the 32nd Gotland battalion), acts as a reserve component of the Swedish Amphibious Corps. Among the <b>residual</b> war reserve <b>stocks</b> reported to be still in storage on Gotland in March 2015, were 14 tanks (Stridsvagn 122s) at the Tofta skjutfält (the Tofta firing range), but without any crews or dedicated maintenance personnel assigned to them.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{surgical}} technique for structural allograft reconstitution of the diaphysis of long bones, maximizing surface contact between host and allograft bone. This method, analogous to a telescope, overlaps the graft and host bone, theoretically increasing bone surface contact substantially. We report {{the outcome of}} 22 telescoped allograft junction sites in 19 patients who lacked sufficient host bone to accommodate a regular-length stemmed implant. This joint-sparing reconstruction preserved 15 of 16 adjacent joints at risk for replacement. Five patients needed additional surgery, but none for nonunion. The diaphyseal length could be reconstructed enough so that a short prosthesis (less than the critical 40 % of total bone length) could be used. This biologic method to reconstruct major segments of the diaphysis is best suited for patients with quantitatively or qualitatively deficient <b>residual</b> bone <b>stock</b> after tumor resection or prosthetic revision. We believe it is an excellent technique for revision knee megaprostheses {{when there is a}} short remnant of proximal femur...|$|R
