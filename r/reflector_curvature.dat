40|$|The {{familiar}} hyperbolic {{approximation of}} P-wave reflection moveout is exact for homogeneous isotropic or elliptically anisotropic media above a planar reflector. Any realistic combination of heterogeneity, <b>reflector</b> <b>curvature,</b> and nonelliptic anisotropy will cause departures from hyperbolic moveout at large offsets. Here, we analyze {{the similarities and}} differences in the influence of those three factors on P-wave reflection traveltimes. Using the weak-anisotropy approximation for velocities in transversely isotropic media with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI model), we show that although the nonhyperbolic moveout due to both vertical heterogeneity and <b>reflector</b> <b>curvature</b> can be interpreted in terms of effective anisotropy, such anisotropy is inherently different from that of a generic homogeneous VTI model...|$|E

The proposed resonator uses curved Bragg reflectors consisting of a stack of silicon-air wall pairs constructed by micromachining.

We report on the behavioral analysis of such resonators through analytical modeling along with numerical simulations supported by experimental results.

40|$|Multiparameter {{stacking}} is {{an important}} tool to obtain a first reliable time image of the subsurface. In addition, it provides wavefield attributes, which {{form the basis for}} many important applications. The quality of the image and the attribute estimates relies heavily on the accuracy of the traveltime moveout descrip-tion. The commonly used hyperbolic common-reflection-surface (CRS) operator reduces to the NMO hyperbola in the common-midpoint gather. Its accuracy, however, depends on the <b>curvature</b> of the <b>reflector</b> under consideration. The conven-tional multifocusing (MF) operator, a time-shifted double-square-root expression, leads to good results for high <b>reflector</b> <b>curvatures</b> and moderate inhomogeneities of the overburden. We used a new implicit CRS formulation that combines the ro-bustness of CRS regarding heterogeneities with the high sensi-tivity to curvature of the MF approach. It assumes reflectors to be locally circular and can be applied in an iterative fashion. For simple but common acquisition and subsurface configurations, the new traveltime expression reduces to familiar formulas. Quantitative studies revealed that the new operator performs equally well over the full range of curvatures even in the pres-ence of strong heterogeneities, while providing higher accuracy than the conventional CRS and MF methods. In addition, its application resulted in more reliable attribute estimates and an improved time-migrated section.

NASA Langley Research Center {{has been involved in}} the structural dynamics research on antenna structures. One of the goals of the research is to develop structural analysis methodology for prediction of the static and dynamic response characteristics of the inflatable antenna concepts. This research is focused on the computational studies to use nonlinear large deformation finite element analysis to characterize the ultra-thin membrane responses of the antennas. Recently, structural analyses have been performed on a few parabolic reflector antennas of varying size and shape, which are referred in the paper as 0. 3 meters subscale, 2 meters half-scale, and 4 meters full-scale antenna. The various aspects studied included nonlinear analysis methodology and solution techniques, ways to speed convergence in iterative methods, the sensitivities of responses with respect to structural loads, such as inflation pressure, gravity, and pretension loads in the ground and in-space conditions, and the ultra-thin membrane wrinkling characteristics. Several such intrinsic aspects studied have provided valuable insight into evaluation of structural characteristics of such antennas. While analyzing these structural characteristics, a quick study was also made to assess the applicability of dynamics scaling of the half-scale antenna. This paper presents the details of the nonlinear structural analysis results, and discusses the insight gained from the studies on the various intrinsic aspects of the analysis methodology. The predicted reflector surface characteristics of the three inflatable ultra-thin membrane parabolic reflector antenna concepts are presented as easily observable displacement fringe patterns with associated maximum values, and normal mode shapes and associated frequencies. Wrinkling patterns are presented to show how surface wrinkle progress with increasing tension loads.

40|$|Lightweight {{cylindrical}} reflectors of {{a proposed}} type would be made from reflective membranes stretched between pairs of identically curved and identically oriented end rails. In each such <b>reflector,</b> the <b>curvature</b> of the two beams would define the reflector shape required for the intended application. For example, the beams could be curved to define a reflector of parabolic cross section, so that light incident along the axis of symmetry perpendicular to the cylindrical axis would be focused to a line. In addition, by applying suitable forces {{to the ends of}} the beams, one could bend the beams to adjust the reflector surface figure to within a precision of the order of the wavelength of the radiation to be reflected. The figure depicts an example of beams shaped so that in the absence of applied forces, each would be flat on one side and would have a radius of curvature R on the opposite side. Alternatively, the curvature of the reflector-membrane side could be other than circular. In general, the initial curvature would be chosen to optimize the final reflector shape.

These geometric attributes include the well-established coherence t chnology, coupled with recent developments in pectrally limited esti-mates of volumetric curvature. Coherence measures lateral changes i waveform, and as such, is often sensitive to joints, small faults, sinkholes and collapse features. The many components of <b>reflector</b> <b>curvature,</b> including themost negative, most positive, Gaussian curvature nd related shape indices (e. g. valleys, saddles, domes), are complimentary to coherence measures. Short wavelength estimates of curvature will illuminate small-scale lineaments while longer wavelength estimates of curvature illuminate more subtle flexures and compaction features.

40|$|Three reflectors {{have been}} {{developed}} and tested to assess {{the performance of a}} distributed network of piezocomposite actuators for correcting thermal deformations and total wave-front error. The primary testbed article is an active composite reflector, composed of a spherically curved panel with a graphite face sheet and aluminum honeycomb core composite, and then augmented with a network of 90 distributed piezoelectric composite actuators. The piezoelectric actuator system may be used for correcting as-built residual shape errors, and for controlling low-order, thermally-induced quasi-static distortions of the panel. In this study, thermally-induced surface deformations of 1 to 5 microns were deliberately introduced onto the reflector, then measured using a speckle holography interferometer system. The reflector surface figure was subsequently corrected to a tolerance of 50 nm using the actuators embedded in the reflector's back face sheet.

40|$|Many {{problems}} in geometric optics or convex geometry can be recast as optimal transport problems: {{this includes the}} far-field <b>reflector</b> problem, Alexandrov's <b>curvature</b> prescription problem, etc. A popular way to solve these problems numerically is {{to assume that the}} source probability measure is absolutely continuous while the target measure is finitely supported. We refer to this setting as semi-discrete optimal transport. Among the several algorithms proposed to solve semi-discrete optimal transport problems, one currently needs to choose between algorithms that are slow but come with a convergence speed analysis (e. g. Oliker-Prussner) or algorithms that are much faster in practice but which come with no convergence guarantees Algorithms of the first kind rely on coordinate-wise increments and the number of iterations required to reach the solution up to an error of ϵ is of order N^ 3 /ϵ, where N is the number of Dirac masses in the target measure. On the other hand, algorithms of the second kind typically rely on the formulation of the semi-discrete optimal transport problem as an unconstrained convex optimization problem which is solved using a Newton or quasi-Newton method. The {{purpose of this article is}} to bridge this gap between theory and practice by introducing a damped Newton's algorithm which is experimentally efficient and by proving the global convergence of this algorithm with optimal rates. The main assumptions is that the cost function satisfies a condition that appears in the regularity theory for optimal transport (the Ma-Trudinger-Wang condition) and that the support of the source density is connected in a quantitative way (it must satisfy a weighted Poincaré-Wirtinger inequality).

40|$|Synthetic {{modeling}} of seismic wavefields scattered in the subsurface is of growing interest today {{due to its}} applicability in various forward and inverse problems of geophysics. It has been extensively used for general evaluation of the subsurface structure, in survey design and illumination studies, and also {{as the basis for}} imaging and inversion algorithms. A particular challenge is presented by models with complex geological structure containing strong-contrast or irregular reflectors and shadow zones, where conventional algorithms fail to simulate realistic wavefields. Therefore, the demand for advanced modeling techniques has dramatically increased. This thesis is based on a new analytic approach to the description and {{modeling of}} three-dimensional reflected wavefields. The method combines surface singular integrals describing the wave propagation inside smoothly heterogeneous layers and effective reflection and transmission coefficients (ERC and ETC) at reflectors. The propagators are implemented using a seismic-frequency approximation of the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral. The approximation {{is based on the assumption}} that a small (compared to the predominant wavelength) part of the reflector acts as a secondary source, which, in accordance with Huygens’ principle, emits a wave beam. The beam comprises not only the main reflection or transmission, but also the edgediffracted and tip-diffracted waves. Because the tip-diffracted waves contribute most to the beam, the method is called the “tip-wave superposition method” (TWSM). ERC and ETC generalize classical plane-wave reflection and transmission coefficients (PWRC and PWTC) for point sources and curved reflectors. Their definition accounts for the local interface curvature, sphericity of the wavefront, and finite frequency content of the incident wavelet. Therefore, they produce correct reflected and transmitted amplitudes at near-critical and post-critical incidence angles. Numerical experiments indicate that ERC and ETC also accurately reproduce amplitudes of the head waves. For a plane interface, ERC or ETC represents the exact reflection or transmission response at the reflector. For a curved interface, they are approximate and based on an “apparent“ source location, which depends on the incidence angle and the mean <b>reflector</b> <b>curvature.</b> Because ERC and ETC account for all amplitude-related effects, they are a useful tool for evaluation of reflected and transmitted wavefields at the reflector. The new approach comprising the TWSM with ERC and ETC gives the possibility of reproducing complex wave phenomena such as caustics, diffractions, and head waves. The modeled full wavefield is represented as a set of separate events, each corresponding to a particular wavecode. This makes the approach event-oriented: an event of interest can be modeled separately. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method simulates scattered 3 D synthetic wavefields in layered media with accurate traveltimes and amplitudes. Chapter 1 presents the basic principles of wave propagation in 3 D media and an overview of existing modeling techniques. Chapter 2 contains a paper about 3 D diffraction modeling of singly scattered acoustic wavefields. The paper introduces ERC and ETC for acoustic waves and gives a detailed overview of the acoustic version of TWSM. Chapter 3 contains a paper about 3 D diffraction modeling of acoustic scattering in layered media. The paper deals with the extension of the acoustic version of TWSM for layered media. It provides a thorough analysis of the modeling results for 3 D models with smoothly varying reflectors and for models containing diffracting edges. Chapter 4 contains a paper about ERC for curved interfaces in TI media. The paper analyzes the dependence of ERC on anisotropy parameters and reflector shape and demonstrates their advantages over PWRC in 3 D diffraction modeling of PP and PS reflection data.

However, as their size grow, {{it becomes more}} and more difficult to meet the requirements, due to the manufacturing complexity and the associated costs. Chapters 2 and 3 propose two concepts of Adaptive Optics deformable mirrors, intended to be used as secondary corrector to compensate for manufacturing errors, gravity release and thermal distortion of large lightweight primary mirrors of space telescopes: (i) A scalable segmented bimorph mirror, based on independent PZT patches glued on Silicon wafers, providing a large number of degrees of freedom, a low mass while overcoming the problem of a low resonance mode; and (ii) A monolithic bimorph mirror, controlled by an array of independent electrodes, done by laser ablation on a single PZT patch. The modelling, the control strategy and the technological aspects are described. The performances of the manufactured prototypes are demonstrated experimentally. These prototypes have been developed in the framework of the ESA project, Bimorph Adaptive Large Optical Mirror Demonstrator (BIALOM). Chapter 4 introduces alternative designs, allowing to face the thermal distortion inherent to the bimorph architecture. They are compared in terms of stroke, voltage budget and first resonance frequency. These designs are required to be controlled in both directions using only positive voltages.
