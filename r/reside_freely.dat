25|$|On 1 July 2013, Croatian {{nationals}} became European Union {{citizens and}} acquired {{the right to}} move and <b>reside</b> <b>freely</b> in other EU member states, {{as well as in}} Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. On the same day, 14 EU member states (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden) allowed Croatian nationals to work without restrictions in their country. However, 13 other EU member states imposed transitional restrictions on Croatian nationals wishing to access their labour markets. Annex V of the Treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union allows member states to apply national measures regulating Croatian nationals’ access to their labour markets for a period of up to five years, and in case of serious disturbance to their labour markets or the threat thereof, and after notifying the Commission, for a further two years (i.e. up to a maximum of seven years in total).|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{the right}} of free {{movement}} to work, the EU has increasingly sought to guarantee rights of citizens, and rights simply be being a human being. But although the Court of Justice stated that 'Citizenship is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States', political debate remains on who {{should have access to}} public services and welfare systems funded by taxation. In 2008, just 8 million people from 500million EU citizens (1.7 per cent) had in fact exercised rights of free movement, the vast majority workers. According to TFEU article 20, citizenship of the EU derives from nationality of a member state. Article 21 confers general rights to free movement in the EU and to <b>reside</b> <b>freely</b> within limits set by legislation. This applies for citizens and their immediate family members. This triggers four main groups of rights: (1) to enter, depart and return, without undue restrictions, (2) to reside, without becoming an unreasonable burden on social assistance, (3) to vote in local and European elections, and (4) the right to equal treatment with nationals of the host state, but for social assistance only after 3 months of residence.|$|E

25|$|The Ansei Treaties {{included}} stipulations {{restricting the}} area of activity open to foreign residents, and in Kobe this consisted of an area of ten ri (about 40km) around the Hyōgo prefectural office. In 1869, the prefecture released regulations concretely defining this 10-ri area in terms of actual travel distance, bounded by the sea {{to the south and}} by villages on all sides: to the east by Ōbe, Sakane, Hirai, and Nakashima in Kawabe District, the west by Sone and Amida in , and the north by Ōharano-mura in Kawabe District, Kawahara, Yado, Yakamishimo, and Inugai in , and Takō, Myōrakuji, and Yokō in Taka District. However, the foreign countries instead interpreted the ten ri as a radius of direct distance, expanding the treaty limits to encompass the entirety of Innami to the west and Kawabe, Taki, and Taka districts to the north. The space beyond this area was accessible to foreigners only for recreation and scholarship, and when foreigners did enter it they were obligated to carry a travel license from the prefectural office. In actuality, though, foreigners often left the treaty area without permission on excursions, which frequently caused trouble for the prefecture. When the settlement was returned in 1899, foreigners were permitted to <b>reside</b> and travel <b>freely</b> within Japan.|$|R

50|$|The Treaty of Paris (1951) {{establishing}} the European Coal and Steel Community established {{a right to}} free movement for workers in these industries and the Treaty of Rome (1957) provided a right for the free movement of workers within the European Economic Community.

Its practical implementation in EU law, however, has not been straightforward. It first involved the gradual phasing out, of internal borders under the Schengen agreements, initially in just a handful of Member States. Today, the provisions governing the free movement of persons are laid down in Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of EU citizens and their family members to move and <b>reside</b> <b>freely</b> within the territory of the Member States.

5000|$|In the 17th century, Jews were {{banished from}} Switzerland. However, a few {{families}} {{were permitted to}} live in two villages, Endingen and Lengnau, in Aargau which became the Jewish ghetto in Switzerland. During this period, Jews and Christians {{were not allowed to}} live under the same roof, neither were Jews allowed to own land or houses. They were taxed at a much higher rate than others and, in 1712, the Lengnau community was [...] "pillaged." [...] In 1760, they were further restricted regarding marriages and multiplying. This remained the case until the 19th century. In 1799, all special tolls were abolished, and, in 1802, the poll tax was removed. [...] On 5 May 1809, they were declared citizens and given broad rights regarding trade and farming. They were still restricted to Endingen and Lengnau until 7 May 1846, when their right to move and <b>reside</b> <b>freely</b> within the canton of Aargau was granted. On 24 September 1856, the Swiss Federal Council granted them full political rights within Aargau, as well as broad business rights; however the majority Christian population did not abide by these new liberal laws fully. The time of 1860 saw the canton government voting to grant suffrage in all local rights and to give their communities autonomy. Before the law was enacted, it was repealed due to vocal opposition led by the Ultramonte Party. Finally, the federal authorities in July 1863, granted all Jews full rights of citizens. However, they did not receive all of the rights in Endingen and Lengn until a resolution of the Grand Council, on 15 May 1877, granted citizens' rights {{to the members of the}} Jewish communities of those places, giving them charters under the names of New Endingen and New Lengnau. The Swiss Jewish Kulturverein was instrumental in this fight from its founding in 1862 until it was dissolved 20 years later. During this period of diminished rights, they were not even allowed to bury their dead in Swiss soil and had to bury their dead on an island called Judenäule (Jews' Isle) on the Rhine near Waldshut. Beginning in 1603, the deceased Jews of the Surbtal communities were buried on the river island which was leased by the Jewish community. As the island was repeatedly flooded and devastated, in 1750 the Surbtal Jews asked the Tagsatzung to establish the Endingen cemetery in the vicinity of their communities.|$|E

30|$|For {{the case}} of Belgium, {{existing}} evidence suggests that we can {{address the problem of}} heterogeneity among immigrants by distinguishing between individuals from the European Union and those from outside of the EU. Martens et al. (2005) show that workers born in Morocco and Turkey are underrepresented in high-wage jobs, whereas those from Western or Northern Europe are not. Similarly, recent studies by the Institute for the Equality of Women and Men (2010, 2012) find that the distinction between EU and non-EU workers is highly relevant for explaining wage differences in Belgium. Moreover, using the criterion of EU membership has the advantage of higher policy relevance than the simple native-immigrant dichotomy since immigration policy in EU Member States cannot regulate the flow of workers with EU nationality due to the EU Directive on the right to move and <b>reside</b> <b>freely.</b> A consequence of this Directive is that Member States can only influence non-EU flows, for instance via quotas, visas and asylum policies.|$|E
