The {{injunction}} was argued on June 19, 1898 and was partially granted and partially denied. Both sides claimed a partial victory. Attorneys Edward Nottingham, William Nottingham and Alfred Wilkinson represented Stearns <b>and</b> <b>Maslin</b> while Hey & Parson appeared for A.B.C. The injunction was denied except as {{to the use of}} the name Stearns, Yellow Fellow and the like on any wheel colored yellow or partly yellow.

We discuss both of these novel suggestions, and consider that there is insufficient stratigraphic basis for the former, whereas placing the latter {{at the peak of}} the signal rather than at its inception does not follow normal stratigraphical practice. Wherever the boundary is eventually placed, it should be optimized to reflect stratigraphical evidence with the least possible ambiguity. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

In the period and of winter significant differences were revealed between winter crops {{in the rate of}} respiration and content of carbohydrates. Respiration of wheat in mid-March increased over February to 33 %, and the content of carbohydrates during this period decreased by 10 %. Despite the increase in environment temperature by mid-March of winter <b>rye</b> <b>and</b> triticale showed not increase, but rather decrease in the rate of respiration. A higher level of plant resistance of winter <b>rye</b> <b>and</b> triticale to low temperatures, as compared to winter wheat is associated with carbohydrate status and higher stability of respiration process in winter <b>rye</b> <b>and</b> triticale in response to temperature rise in end of winter...|$|R
