Besides more substantial offerings, there were little cones of rice with a <b>round</b> <b>wafer</b> of butter at the top, ranged on the altar in order.* [The worshippers, on entering, walk straight up to the altar, and before, or after, having deposited their gifts, they lift both hands to the forehead, fall on their knees, and touch the ground three times with both head and hands, raising the body a little between each prostration. They then advance to the head Lama, kotow similarly to him, and he blesses them, laying both hands on their heads and repeating a short formula. Sometimes the dorje is used in blessing, as the cross is in Europe, and when a mass of people request a benediction, the Lama pronounces it from {{the door of the}} temple with outstretched arms, the people all being prostrate, with their foreheads touching the ground.] Six Lamas were at prayer, psalms, and contemplation, sitting cross-legged on two small benches that ran down the building: one was reading, with his hand and fore-finger elevated, whilst the others listened; anon they all sang hymns, repeated sacred or silly precepts to the bystanders, or joined in a chorus with boys, who struck brass cymbals, and blew straight copper trumpets six feet long, and conch-shells mounted with broad silver wings, elegantly carved with dragons. There were besides manis, or praying-cylinders, drums, gongs, books, and trumpets made of human thigh-bones, plain or mounted in silver.|$|E
50|$|Probe card {{efficiency}} {{is affected by}} many factors. Perhaps {{the most important factor}} impacting probe card {{efficiency is}} the number of DUTs that can be tested in parallel. Many wafers today are still tested one device at a time. If one wafer had 1000 of these devices and the time required to test one device was 10 seconds and the time for the prober to move from one device to another device was 1 second, then to test an entire wafer would take 1000 x 11 seconds = 11,000 seconds or roughly 3 hours. If however, the probe card and the tester could test 16 devices in parallel (with 16 times the electrical connections) than the test time would be reduced by almost exactly 16 times. Note that because now the probe card has 16 devices, as the prober touches down on the <b>round</b> <b>wafer,</b> it may not always contact an active device and will therefore be a little less than 16 times as fast to test one wafer.|$|E
40|$|The {{aggressive}} {{scaling of}} VLSI feature {{size and the}} pervasive use of advanced reticle enhancement technologies has led to dramatic increases in mask costs, pushing prototype and low volume production designs to the limit of economic feasibility. Multiple project wafers (MPW), or “shuttle ” runs, provide an attractive solution for such low volume designs, by providing a mechanism to share the cost of mask tooling among up to tens of designs. However, MPW reticle design and wafer dicing introduce complexities not encountered in typical, single-project wafers. Recent works on wafer dicing do not take in account several known degrees of freedom and requirements, which degrades the optimality and feasibility of the proposed solutions. Furthermore, the delay cost associated with schedule alignment has been completely ignored in all previous works. In this paper we propose an enhanced MPW flow comprising four main steps: (1) schedule-aware project partitioning, (2) multi-project reticle floorplanning, (3) wafer shot-map definition, and (4) wafer dicing plan definition. The proposed project partitioning algorithm gives improved trade-offs between mask cost and schedule delay cost. Our reticle floorplaner combines hierarchical quadrisection with a simulated annealing framework to generate more “diceable ” floorplans subject to given maximum reticle sizes. The <b>round</b> <b>wafer</b> shot-map definition step maximizes extraction of functional dies from partially printed reticle images. Finally, our dicing planner employs multiple side-to-side dicing plans for different wafers, as well as different reticle image rows/columns within a wafer. Experiments on industry testcases show that our methods significantly outperform not only previous methods in the literature, but also reticle floorplans manually designed by experienced engineers...|$|E

40|$|Fan-out Wafer Level Packaging (FOWLP) {{is one of}} {{the latest}} {{packaging}} trends in microelectronics. The technology offers not only solutions for single chip packaging but also approaches for 3 D system integration or RF suitable packaging. Mold embedding for this technology is currently done on wafer level up to 12 "/ 300 mm size. For higher productivity and therewith lower costs larger mold embedding form factors are forecasted for the near future. Besides increasing wafer sizes up to 450 mm an alternative option would be moving to panel sizes leading to Fan-out Panel Level Packaging (FOPLP). Sizes for the panel could range up to 18 "x 24 " or even larger. Increasing the embedding size does not only mean an upscaling of the existing technologies but may lead to a change from using wafer processing infrastructure to the ones used for panels. This is especially true when moving from <b>round</b> <b>wafer</b> sizes to larger rectangular panel formats. Here also new materials and processes have to be taken into account. Materials for reconfigured mold embedding as well as dielectric materials for electrical wiring redistribution are key factors for reliable packaging and proven functionality as required e. g. for RF packaging. For reconfigured mold embedding, compression mold processes are used in combination with liquid, granular or sheet compound. Within this paper the evaluation of panel level compression molding with a target form factor of 24 "x 18 " / 610 x 457 mm² is described for different materials. As basis for the redistribution on top of the mold embedded wafer typically a liquid photo-patternable dielectric polymer material is used and applied by spin coating. For large panel sizes photo-patternable materials are still of interest, these will most likely be used as dry films. These are expected to have advantages concerning processing and cost compared to liquid dielectric materials. Hence, a dry film dielectric material has been selected and evaluated for Fan-out Wafer/Panel Level Packaging. The main criterion for the selection of the thin film polymers is the curing temperature {{due to the fact that}} the final polymerization has to be done after the deposition on the molded wafer. Standard PIs and PBOs can therefore not be used because temperatures above 250 °C would damage the molding material. BCB-type materials are below this temperature limit, with cure temperatures as low as 200 °C, making them ideal candidates for FOWLP. In addition the electrical properties are paving the way to RF applications. However, regarding the RF performance the inhomogeneous material mix of the package can be a critical issue, because of complex wave propagation phenomena. In order to obtain a proper design an assessment of the RF properties is therefore essential. For material and process evaluation a test vehicle has been designed with focus on material and process evaluation as well as reliability testing. In addition test structures for basic RF characterization have been designed and integrated. The test structures comprise interconnect elements such as transmission lines (TML) and vias to assess the electrical performance of FOWLP packaged ICs. Single ended coplanar and differential ended transmission lines embedded into the BCB-based dry film dielectric are connected by vias with a specifically designed silicon IC. The design was done using 3 D full-wave simulations. An analysis of the RF characteristics shows low insertion loss and good return loss characteristics up to frequencies of 40 GHz. In summary this paper describes material and process trends for Fan-out packaging when moving from wafer sizes to large panel formats...|$|E

Full-automatically the thin liquid batter is poured onto the hot plates and baked in a passage within two minutes. Before Christmas and Easter we are experiencing the greatest demand, because of high religious holidays more people attend services, the demand for wafers is correspondingly greater. Every week about 30,000 brown and white 3,000 wafers are baked in Weesen. These are exclusively made of flour and water, without leavening agent such as yeast or baking powder. The Eucharist wafers must be baked, according to the canon law, of pure wheat flour. When the fully baked bread plates have been stored for a few hours in a room with high humidity, the small <b>round</b> <b>wafers</b> are subsequently cut.

40|$|Operando {{infrared}} spectroscopy {{is often used}} qualitatively to elucidate reaction mechanisms thanks to the observation of the catalyst under actual operating conditions.

40|$|This study {{details the}} dielectrophoretic {{assembly}} and mechanical characterization of boron nitride nanotubes on silicon chips with gold electrodes. The chips were fabricated from 4 in <b>round</b> silicon <b>wafers</b> with a 100 nm-thick low stress silicon nitride insulating layer {{on the top}} and bottom. The electrodes were patterned using photo- and electron-beam lithography and dry etching, and the wafers were cut into 4 x 6 mm chips. The boron nitride nanotubes studied were obtained from NIA and were synthesized via a unique pressurized vapor/condensor method, which produced long, small-diameter BNNTs without the use of a catalyst. These nanotubes were studied due to their desirable mechanical and electrical properties, which allow for unique applications in various areas of science, engineering, and technology. Applications span from magnetic manipulation to the formation of biocomposites, from nano-transistors to humidity and pH sensors, and from MRI contrast agents to drug delivery. The nanotubes and nanotube bundles characterized were suspended over gaps of 300 to 500 nm. This study was unique in that assembly was performed using dielectrophoresis, allowing for batch fabrication of chips and devices. Also, stiffness measurements were performed using AFM, eliminating the reliance of other methods upon electron microscopes, and allowing for imaging and measurements to occur simultaneously and at high resolution. It was found that DEP parameters of V = 2. 0 Vpp, f = 1 kHz, and t = 2 min provided the best results for mechanical testing. The nanotubes tested had suspended lengths of 300 nm, the width of the electrode gap, and diameters of 15 – 65 nm. Chips were imaged with both scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Force-displacement measurements with atomic force microscopy were used to find stiffness values in the range of 1 – 16 N/m. These stiffness values, when plugged into a simple double-clamped beam model, indicated Young’s moduli of approximately 1 – 1600 GPa. Within this wide range, it was shown that a decrease in diameter strongly correlated exponentially to an increase in Young’s modulus. Work in this study was divided between assembly and characterization. Therefore, a lot of time was spent working to optimize dielectrophoresis parameters, followed by SEM and AFM imaging. Parameters that were adjusted included DEP voltage and time, pre-DEP sonication times, as well as adding a centrifuging procedure to attempt to better separate nanotube bundles in solution. Another method discussed but not pursued was the use of surfactants to agitate the solution, thus separating the nanotubes. The reason this material in particular was so difficult to separate was twofold. First, the small size of the nanotubes—individual BNNTs have diameters on the order of ∼ 5 nanometers—generates very strong nanoscale van der Waals forces holding the nanotubes together. Larger nanotubes—with diameters on the order of 50 to 100 nm or more—suffer less from this problem. Also, the dipoles created by the boron-nitrogen bonds cause attraction between adjacent nanotubes. The results shown in this thesis include DEP parameters, SEM and AFM images, and force- displacement curves leading to nanotube stiffness and Young’s modulus values. The force-displacement tests via AFM are also detailed and explained...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrated}} circuit industry builds {{integrated circuit}}s (IC’s) by placing {{many layers of}} semi conductive material {{on top of each}} other, the smallest details in such a layer are called features. Each layer has its own specific layout and will form together with the other layers three dimensional structures such as transistors, diodes or resistors. The final result is an integrated circuit which is called a chip of which a large number of them are fabricated all at once on a <b>round</b> silicon <b>wafer.</b> A position error between these two layers is called an overlay error, the final chip might not function correctly or not at all if this overlay error exceeds certain limits. It is important to minimize this error to obtain a high yield per wafer. As the features are getting smaller in size, the position of a ’new’ layer with respect to the layer below becomes more critical. High end position measurement equipment is required to minimize this overlay error. The lithography-machines involved with the production of these IC’s are expensive due their advanced technology and are therefore subject to high wafer throughput to reduce costs. These processes require thus a measurement tool which can measure with low measurement uncertainty to minimize the overlay error, while allowing for high target velocity. A laser interferometer is such a measurement tool which is able to measure accurate and fast enough to be used for these processes. The laser light required by interferometers to operate in current lithography-machines is guided along corners by mirrors, over meters long optical pathways. This method of light transport is sensitive for environmental disturbances and requires realignment once maintenance is carried out, this is a time consuming and thus costly process. The current interferometer systems also contain small periodic nonlinearities, this nonlinear error presence in the position measurements will become problematic for future systems which require increasingly smaller overlay errors. At the TU Delft a theoretical periodic error free type of interferometer has been build (see Figure 6), based upon spatial separation of optical measurement pathways. This system has shown to operate with sub-nm measurement uncertainty (see Appendices B. 1 and B. 2) using free-space source frequency delivery. Replacing the free-space beam delivery by fiber-coupled delivery allows for modular plug-and-play systems. No more sensitive to air turbulence, but the light transported by the fibers is unfortunately negatively affected by several phenomena and requires more in depth research. The Delft interferometer concept (Figure 6) knows multiple configurations, two of them have been build for this research: the Delft Corner Cube- and the Generalized Delft-configuration. Three measurement systems have been realized to research operation when the source frequencies are delivered by different types of fibers. The first system, System I, concerns the Generalized Delft configuration with free-space beam delivery with the purpose of reproduction of previous results (see Appendices B. 1 and B. 2). The obtained results serve as reference for the measurements obtained from the second system, System II. In this system the source frequencies are delivered by polarization maintaining single mode fibers (i. e. pmfibers) instead of mirrors. The second system was build study the sub-nm measurement uncertainty using these pm-fibers for beam delivery, instead of free-space beam delivery. The results obtained from this research are published in the first article of this report, Article I: Fiber-coupled displacement interferometry without periodic nonlinearity. The third measurement system, System III, was build to research the performance of graded index multimode fibers (i. e. mm-fibers) for source frequency delivery for the Delft Corner Cube configuration. These fibers allow for easier alignment and higher optical coupling efficiency compared to pm-fibers. However the ease in handling results in lower optical output quality: the fiber does not maintain polarization state, the initial optical wavefront will be deformed during transport and multiple optical modes will be present in its output. The results obtained with this system are published in the second chapter of this report, Article II: Displacement interferometry with fiber-coupled delivery. Conclusions from the research: Yes, it is possible to measure with sub-nm measurement uncertainty using pm-fiber delivered source frequencies for the Generalized Delft interferometer. We have shown that the periodic nonlinearity was not visible down to the noisefloor (40 pm). The same conclusion holds for mm-fiber delivered source frequencies using the Delft Corner Cube interferometer. Both fiber-coupled systems show phase broadening behavior in their measurement results, caused by the birefringent nature of the fibers. This behavior can be seen best in the results using mm-fibers. At first sight this fortunately does not affect the measurement uncertainty. Experimental results confirm that fiber induced phase shifts caused by fiber deformation, are canceled out due the configuration of the Delft interferometer and the differential measurement between the photodetectors. The time varying polarization orientation of the light delivered by mm-fibers in System III, results in interference fluctuations as expected. Nevertheless, the interference signal was not lost during measurements and the fiber coupled system can still measure with sub-nm measurement uncertainty. Building the two fiber coupled systems (System II & III) has shown that pm-fibers require much effort regarding alignment and obtaining a sufficiently high optical coupling efficiency. The finally achieved optical output was of high quality. Multi mode fibers behaved opposite, they were very easy in handling but resulted in a less high optical output quality. Using fiber delivery for the Delft interferometers opens the way towards the design of a modular fibercoupled sub-nm interferometer measurement system. The optical symmetry of the design has shown to be very robust towards phase disturbances, but more research is required regarding system robustness and applicability.
