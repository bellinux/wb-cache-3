30|$|At 70 °C, {{protruded}} <b>rim</b> <b>shapes</b> at {{the edges}} and mounded trench bottom are observed morphologically in the surface profile and seen with different colours in the microscopic image (Figure 3 a). Having the master stamp pressed into the PR at the visco-elastic region temperature, the polymer started to flow vertically along the stamp sidewall, eventually resulting in protruded <b>rim</b> <b>shapes.</b> Additionally, an interesting shape of the mounded shape at the trench bottom appeared. As high stresses, which can be released evenly by polymer flow laterally at enough high temperature, are built up and maximized {{at the center of}} stamp intrusion at 70 °C, the polymer layer in that region is likely to recover to its original shape elastically to dissipate the local stress during the stamp demolding, resulting in the mounded trench bottom [20, 21].|$|R

The revolutionary Firecrest <b>rim</b> <b>shape,</b> with its wide profile and flat, U-shaped spoke bed, was quickly copied throughout the industry. The same year Zipp also discontinued its 404 and 808 aluminum/carbon hybrid clinchers and retooled its Indianapolis factory to produce only carbon wheels.|$|R

40|$|The {{profile of}} a liquid front of a polymer film {{dewetting}} a solid substrate is examined by atomic force microscopy. The material removed from the substrate is accumulated in a rim next to the three-phase contact line. Theory predicts {{the leading edge of}} the rim profile to be a damped harmonic oscillation for a large class of systems. This is investigated experimentally for the first time, and we show that a non-Newtonian liquid behaves qualitatively different due to viscoelastic effects.

5000|$|Firecrest {{technology}} was developed from Zipp’s earlier “toroidal” <b>rim</b> <b>shapes.</b> These were designed with a bulge {{in the rim}} cross-section to reduce turbulence behind the tire {{at the leading edge}} of the wheel. Firecrest essentially inverts this shape, placing {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil along the interior of the rim (towards the hub). As a result, Zipp claims that Firecrest rims show improved aerodynamic performance at all points around the wheel, combined with improved stability in crosswinds. A product review on the Cyclingnews website reported, “the Firecrest aero profile is noticeably fast at cruising speed” and that a Firecrest wheelset “offers handling stability in crosswinds unmatched by other aero wheels we've used.” ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: In normal {{patients}} the rim had a characteristic configuration with the rim width being broadest in the inferior disc region, {{followed by the}} superior, the nasal, and the temporal sector. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether the <b>rim</b> <b>shape</b> as measured by the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph 3 (HRT 3) followed the ISN'T rule or any other specific distribution pattern. METHODS: This is a prospectively planned cross-sectional study. Two hundred and twenty-six healthy eyes were recruited into this study. All the patients who were included had normal ocular examination, an intraocular pressure less than 21 mm Hg and a normal visual field by the Humphrey Field Analyzer (program 24 - 2, Swedish Interactive Threshold Analysis standard). For each patient, the optic nerve head was morphometrically evaluated by using the HRT 3. All data were analyzed by the analysis of variance test and Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test. RESULTS: When the rim area and rim volume were considered, a statistically significant difference (P< 0. 001) was found between the temporal rim area and superior, nasal, and inferior rim area. No significant difference was found among the superior, nasal, and inferior rim area. A similar result was found for the cup area. The temporal cup shape measure was significantly (P< 0. 001) different from the other disc sectors. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy participants the <b>rim</b> <b>shape</b> as measured by the HRT did not follow the ISN'T rule, except that the smallest rim part was located in the temporal disc region. The thickness of the rim was similar in the superior and the inferior sectors by HRT. PMID: 20717053 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study {{devoted to the}} understanding of break-up mechanisms of liquid sheets. The studied sheet is formed by the normal collision of a round jet on a solid rod which can oscillates vertically. The liquid expands radially in air initially at rest. A shear instability develops at the interface liquid/gas resulting in an undulated motion of the liquid sheet. Because of the velocity contrast between the liquid and the surface waves, the liquid is submitted to transient accelerations as it moves through the undulations. This situation trigs a Rayleigh-Taylor instability leading to azimuthal thickness modulations. The thickness profile governs the free <b>rim</b> <b>shape</b> and therefore the drops formation. A model including the development of both instabilities allows us to predict the sheet and drops sizes...|$|R
50|$|Nabataean pottery is {{characterized}} by its thin walls and floral motifs. The exclusive use of floral patterns links back to Nabataean aniconism in their religious practices. The designs on the wares are generally painted on or pressed into the surface with stamps and rouletting wheels. To put a finish on the pieces, the makers burnished them or used a sintering process. Most of the wares are pinkish in color, much like the cliffs surrounding the city. This is because Nabataean potters used local clay bodies in their work. Nabataean wares take many forms, and can be classified by their thickness, <b>rim</b> <b>shape,</b> bases, and decor.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} Norse Greenlandic portable objects of soapstone, based on the author’s Ph. D. dissertation (2009). An analysis of 1168 artefacts from six Norse sites and their comparison with soapstone artefacts {{from other parts of}} the Norse world is presented. The majority of the artefacts were vessel sherds and the analysis suggests that most vessel types of Norse Greenland have parallels in known types from Norway, Shetland and Hedeby. Two vessel types, one with straight vertical sides and one trapezoid, as well as one <b>rim</b> <b>shape</b> appear to be unique to Greenland. The analysed material also comprises e. g. spindle whorls, loom weights, mending patches, architectural details and even moulds for casting. Most of these artefact types are also paralleled in soapstone finds elsewhere in the Norse world. One area in which the Greenlandic material stands out is in the high frequency of various types of ornamentation on all types of soapstone artefacts. It is suggested that the Norse Greenlanders may have reproduced traditional motives in order to stress continuity with the past and the cultural connection with Scandinavia...|$|R
40|$|Ring Image Analyzer {{software}} analyzes {{images to}} recognize elliptical patterns. It determines the ellipse parameters (axes ratio, centroid coordinate, tilt angle). The program attempts to recognize elliptical fringes (e. g., Newton Rings) on a photograph and determine their centroid position, the short-to-long-axis ratio, and {{the angle of}} rotation of the long axis relative to the horizontal direction on the photograph. These capabilities are important in interferometric imaging and control of surfaces. In particular, {{this program has been}} developed and applied for determining the <b>rim</b> <b>shape</b> of precision-machined optical whispering gallery mode resonators. The program relies on a unique image recognition algorithm aimed at recognizing elliptical shapes, but can be easily adapted to other geometric shapes. It is robust against non-elliptical details of the image and against noise. Interferometric analysis of precision-machined surfaces remains an important technological instrument in hardware development and quality analysis. This software automates and increases the accuracy of this technique.

40|$|Background. Optic nerve diseases, such as glaucomas, lead {{to changes}} in the intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head. Conclusions. These changes can be {{described}} by the following variables: size and shape of the optic disc; size, shape, and pallor of the neuroretinal rim; size of the optic cup in relation to the area of the disc; configuration and depth of the optic cup; ratios of cup to disc diameter and cup to disc area; position of the exit of the central retinal vessel trunk on the lamina cribrosa surface; presence and location of splinter-shaped hemorrhages; occurence, size, configuration, and location of parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy; diffuse and/or focal decrease of the diameter of the retinal arterioles; and visibility of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). These variables can be assessed semiquantitively by ophthalmoscopy without applying sophisticated techniques. For the early detection of glaucomatous optic nerve damage in ocular hypertensive eyes before the development of visual field loss, the most important variables are neuroretinal <b>rim</b> <b>shape,</b> optic cup size in relation to optic disc size, diffusely or segmentally decreased visibility of the RNFL, occurence of localized RNFL defects, and presence of disc hemorrhages. </p...|$|R

40|$|Received [...] .; {{accepted}} [...] . Abstract. This paper {{discusses the}} properties of the inner puffed-up rim which forms in circumstellar disks when dust evaporates. We argue that the <b>rim</b> <b>shape</b> is controlled by a fundamental property of circumstellar disks, namely their very large vertical density gradient, through the dependence of grain evaporation temperature on gas density. As a result, the bright side of the rim is curved, rather than vertical, as expected when a constant evaporation temperature is assumed. We have computed a number of rim models, which take into account this effect in a self-consistent way. The results show that the curved rim (as the vertical rim) emits most of its radiation in the near and mid-IR, and provides a simple explanation to the observed values of the near-IR excess (the “ 3 µm bump ” of Herbig Ae stars). Contrary to the vertical rim, for curved rims the near-IR excess does not depend much on the inclination, being maximum for face-on objects. We have then computed synthetic images of the curved rim seen under different inclinations; face-on rims are seen as bright, centrally symmetric rings on the sky; increasing the inclination, the rim takes an elliptical shape, with one side brighter than the other. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{dewetting}} behavior of a thin liquid film on a solid substrate has received much attention. Such behavior {{is important for the}} preparation of polymer films, for microfluidic devices, and other applications. When a thin liquid film dewets, it may form a rim which spreads outwards, leaving behind a growing dry region. Experiments by Reiter and others [1] involving dewetting films of polystyrene on polydimethylsiloxane-coated silicon reveal an asymmetric <b>rim</b> <b>shape,</b> and spreading at various rates. To explain these observations, different mechanisms have been proposed, including slip at the liquid-solid interface [2]. We make use of a strong-slip model, which has been derived previously [3]. The coating thickness may vary with position x and time t, and is denoted by h(x, t), while its velocity is u(x, t). The coating evolution is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations for momentum and mass conservation of a viscous incompressible liquid, and the stress-strain relationship is assumed to be Newtonian. At the impermeable substrate, the Navier slip condition is imposed while the normal component is set to zero. Here the quantity B is a slip length, with B = 0 representing the no-slip case, while B becoming infinite represents the limit of perfect slip...|$|R

40|$|Models {{predict that}} in the {{innermost}} AU of the disk around Herbig Ae/Be star, the dust disk forms a "puffed-up" inner rim, which should result in a strongly asymmetric brightness distribution for disks seen under intermediate inclination. Using the VLTI/AMBER long-baseline interferometer, we obtained 24 near-infrared (H- and K-band) spectro-interferometric observations on the Herbig Ae star R CrA. In the derived visibility function, we detect the signatures of an extended (25 mas) and a compact component (5. 8 mas), with the compact component contributing about 2 / 3 of the total flux. The brightness distribution is highly asymmetric, {{as indicated by the}} strong closure phases (up to 40 deg) and the detected position angle dependence of the visibilities and closure phases. To interpret these asymmetries, we employ geometric as well as physical models, including a binary model, a skewed ring model, and a puffed-up inner rim model with a vertical or curved <b>rim</b> <b>shape.</b> Our curved puffed-up rim model can reasonably well reproduce the interferometric observables and the SED simultaneously and suggests a luminosity of 29 L_sun and the presence of relatively large (> 1. 2 micron) Silicate dust grains. Perpendicular to the disk, two bow shock-like structures appear in the associated reflection nebula NGC 6729, suggesting that the resolved sub-AU size disk is the driving engine of a large-scale outflow.

The RFID technique is one possibility to realise such an application. During system design, there is a big challenge to answer at least two important questions.

40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} the inferior to temporal neuroretinal rim width ratio and superior to temporal rim width ratio as measures of <b>rim</b> <b>shape</b> for diagnosis of glaucoma.  METHODS—Colour stereo optic disc photographs of 527  normal subjects, 100  ocular hypertensive individuals with normal visual fields, and 202  open angle glaucoma {{patients with a}} mean perimetric defect of less than 10  dB were morphometrically evaluated. Eyes with an optic cup area of <  0. 2  mm 2 were excluded.  RESULTS—In the normal subjects, inferior to temporal rim width ratio (1. 67  (SD 0. 53)) was significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher than superior to temporal rim width ratio (1. 56  (0. 49)). Both ratios were significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher the more vertically the optic disc was configured. In the normal eyes, both ratios were statistically independent of disc size, rim area, refractive error, age, and sex. With the differences being more marked for the inferior to temporal ratio than for the superior to temporal ratio, both rim width ratios were significantly (p< 0. 005) lower in the ocular hypertensive group than in the normal group. Despite the high significance of the differences, diagnostic power of the inferior ratio and the superior ratio was 59 % and 58 %, respectively, indicating a marked overlap between the groups.  CONCLUSIONS—Abnormally low inferior to temporal and superior to temporal rim width ratios can indicate glaucomatous optic nerve damage in some ocular hypertensive eyes. Being independent of optic disc size and ocular magnification, the rim width ratios may be taken as one among other variables for the ophthalmoscopic optic disc evaluation, taking into account, however, a pronounced overlap between normal eyes and ocular hypertensive eyes.    Keywords: neuroretinal rim width ratios; glaucoma; ocular hypertensio...|$|R
