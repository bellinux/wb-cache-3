5|$|All banksias have {{developed}} proteoid or cluster <b>roots</b> {{in response to}} the nutrient poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The plant develop masses of fine lateral <b>roots</b> that form a mat-like structure underneath the soil surface, and enable it to extract nutrients as efficiently possible out of the soil. A study of three co-occurring species in banksia woodland in southwestern Australia—Banksia menziesii, B. attenuata and B. ilicifolia—found that all three develop fresh <b>roots</b> in September after winter rainfall, and that the bacteria populations associated with the root systems of B. menziesii differ from the other two, and that they also change depending on the age of the <b>roots.</b>|$|E

Association analysis was performed in F 1 generation of rice {{in order to understand}} the nature and extent of association among various traits and grain yield under drought stress condition.

Among <b>root</b> traits, dry <b>root</b> weight recorded highly positive significant association with root: shoot ratio, <b>root</b> length, <b>root</b> thickness and <b>root</b> volume. <b>Root</b> traits viz., <b>root</b> volume, <b>root</b> thickness, <b>root</b> length, dry <b>root</b> weight and <b>root</b> length density were the major contributors of grain yield by way of their positive and high indirect effects...|$|R

40|$|While most {{temperate}} broad-leaved {{tree species}} form ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbioses, a few species have arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). It {{is not known}} whether EM and AM tree species differ systematically with respect to fine <b>root</b> morphology, fine <b>root</b> system size and <b>root</b> functioning. In a species-rich temperate mixed forest, we studied the fine <b>root</b> morphology and biomass of three EM and three AM tree species from the genera Acer, Carpinus, Fagus, Fraxinus and Tilia searching for principal differences between EM and AM trees. We further assessed the evidence of convergence or divergence in <b>root</b> traits among the six co-occurring species. Eight fine <b>root</b> morphological and chemical traits were investigated in <b>root</b> segments {{of the first to}} fourth <b>root</b> order in three different soil depths and the relative importance of the factors <b>root</b> order, tree species and soil depth for <b>root</b> morphology was determined. <b>Root</b> order was more influential than tree species while soil depth had only a small effect on <b>root</b> morphology All six species showed similar decreases in specific <b>root</b> length and specific <b>root</b> area from the 1 st to the 4 th <b>root</b> order, while the species patterns differed considerably in <b>root</b> tissue density, <b>root</b> N concentration, and particularly with respect to <b>root</b> tip abundance. Most <b>root</b> morphological traits were not significantly different between EM and AM species (except for specific <b>root</b> area that was larger in AM species), indicating that mycorrhiza type is not a key factor influencing fine <b>root</b> morphology in these species. The order-based <b>root</b> analysis detected species differences more clearly than the simple analysis of bulked fine <b>root</b> mass. Despite convergence in important <b>root</b> traits among AM and EM species, even congeneric species may differ in certain fine <b>root</b> morphological traits.
