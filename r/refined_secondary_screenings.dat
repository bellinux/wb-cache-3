40|$|The use of {{profiling}} by ethnicity or nationality {{to trigger}} secondary security screening is a controversial {{social and political}} issue. Overlooked {{is the question of}} whether such actuarial methods are in fact mathematically justified, even under the most idealized assumptions of completely accurate prior probabilities, and <b>secondary</b> <b>screenings</b> concentrated on the highest-probablity individuals. We show here that strong profiling (defined as screening at least in proportion to prior probability) is no more efficient than uniform random sampling of the entire population, because resources are wasted on the repeated screening of higher probability, but innocent, individuals. A mathematically optimal strategy would be “square-root biased sampling,” the geometric mean between strong profiling and uniform sampling, with <b>secondary</b> <b>screenings</b> distributed broadly, although not uniformly, over the population. Square-root biased sampling is a general idea that can be applied whenever a “bell-ringer” event must be found by sampling with replacement, but can be recognized (either with certainty, or with some probability) when seen...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{primary and}} <b>secondary</b> <b>screenings</b> were {{conducted}} to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-yeast potential of the eleven selected marine-derived Streptomyces spp., particularly against P. shigelloides. The strains were categorized into three colour groups for morphological grouping according to the colour of aerial mycelium; namely grey, yellow green, and white colour groups. Diffusible pigments were produced by eight of the strains tested. Strain(s) from grey and white with red diffusible pigments colour groups displayed strong antibacterial activity. The yeasts tested were resistant to the bioactive metabolite(s) produced {{by some of the}} Streptomyces spp. which had shown high activity against the bacteria tested. In primary screening, there was no inhibition of growth of yeasts tested; C. albicans and C. parasilopsis. Of the streptomycete strains tested, eight strains were active against at least one bacteria tested. In secondary screening, four strains inhibited all the yeasts tested. Meanwhile, all strains were active against at least one bacteria tested. Streptomyces strain T 15 displayed the best antibacterial activity against B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, and P. shigelloides. Of the streptomycetes tested, three strains were found to display strong inhibition against at least one pathogen tested in both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>screenings.</b> Meanwhile, two and three strains displayed moderate inhibition against at least one pathogen tested in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>screenings,</b> respectively. Furthermore, six and all the strains displayed weak inhibition against at least one pathogen tested in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>screenings,</b> respectively. The antibacterial and anti-yeast activities were prominent in secondary screening, where five of the strains exhibited broad spectrum activity. Streptomyces strain T 15 was selected for further studies. Culture conditions(media and agitation or static) were optimised to enhance the production of bioactive metabolite(s) in submerged fermentation. It was noted that fermentation of strain T 15 in ISP 2 medium at an incubation period of nine days at 28 ºC ± 2 ºC, pH 6. 10 ± 1. 70, and shaking at a speed of 120 rpm was the most ideal for growth and bioactive metabolite(s) production antagonistic to P. shigelloides at laboratory conditions. During the twelve days fermentation, the highest bioactive metabolite(s) production of strain T 15 was noted on day nine in all the fermentation media used in this study. The highest bioactive metabolite(s) production by nine-day old strain T 15 was achieved in ISP 2 medium; however, the bioactive metabolite(s) production started on day six. The nature of culture condition that is, either agitation or static had an effect on the production of bioactive metabolite(s). For agitation culture condition, ISP 2 medium was considered as the best fermentation medium for strain T 15 based on the higher production of bioactive metabolite(s) that it supported compared to SA medium. Meanwhile, for static culture condition, ISP 4 medium was the only fermentation medium that supported the bioactive metabolite(s) production by strain T 15...|$|R

In vitro primary screening for identifying bioactive compounds (inhibitors, activators or pharmacological chaperones) against a protein target {{results in the}} discovery of lead compounds that must be tested in cell-based efficacy <b>secondary</b> <b>screenings.</b> Very often lead compounds do not succeed because of an apparent low potency in cell assays, despite an excellent performance in primary screening. Primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>screenings</b> differ significantly according to the conditions and challenges the compounds must overcome in order to interact with their intended target. Cellular internalization and intracellular metabolism {{are some of the}} difficulties the compounds must confront and different strategies can be envisaged for minimizing that problem. Using a novel screening procedure we have identified 15 compounds inhibiting the hepatitis C NS 3 protease in an allosteric fashion. After characterizing biophysically the interaction with the target, some of the compounds were not able to inhibit viral replication in cell assays. In order to overcome this obstacle and potentially improve cellular internalization three of these compounds were complexed with γ-cyclodextrin. Two of them showed a five- and 16 -fold activity increase, compared to their activity when delivered as free compounds in solution (while γ-cyclodextrin did not show antiviral activity by itself). The most remarkable result came from a third compound that showed no antiviral activity in cell assays when delivered free in solution, but its γ-cyclodextrin complex exhibited a 50 % effective concentration of 5 µM. Thus, the antiviral activity of these compounds can be significantly improved, even completely rescued, using γ-cyclodextrin as carrier molecule.

The detection of HPV infection in genital samples may increase the sensitivity of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>screenings</b> of cervical cancer. HPV testing may also improve the specificity of screening programs, resulting in the avoidance of overtreatment and cost savings for confirmatory procedures. The major determinants of clinical progression of HPV infection include persistence of HPV infection, involvement of high-risk HPV types, high HPV viral load, integration of viral DNA and presence of several potential cofactors. Signal amplification HPV-DNA detection techniques (Hybrid Capture II, Digene Corporation, USA) are standardized, commercially available, and capable of detecting several high-risk HPV types. They also increase the sensitivity of screening for high-grade lesions in combination with cytology.

Amplification techniques are ideal for epidemiological studies because they minimize the misclassification of HPV infection status. These techniques can detect low HPV burden infections.

40|$|The modern {{pharmaceutical}} industry has achieved remarkable successes in medicinal chemistry. However, many diseases are incurable {{due to the}} difficulty of finding new drugs. De novo drug discovery contains two steps: the primary screening focuses on selecting protein (target) binding drug (ligand); the secondary screening concentrates on calculating kinetic binding parameters of target-ligand complex. Conventional methods for the primary screening are typically surface-based, which suffer intensely from nonspecific interactions; the existing methods for secondary screening are either affinity-based or require surface immobilization, both cannot accurately calculate kinetic binding parameters. Hence, this research focuses {{on the development of the}} solution-based kinetic platform that facilitates both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>screenings.</b> We combined kinetic capillary electrophoresis (KCE) with DNA-encoded ligand (DEL) technology to build a solution-based platform for primary screening of ligands. KCE offers high partitioning efficiency but requires the knowledge of electrophoretic mobility of target-ligand complex, and thus, we developed a mathematical model to predict electrophoretic mobility of target-DEL complex. This model was tested by using the targets interacted with 18 artificial DELs that contain various combinations of dsDNA and ssDNA regions, together with 2 DELs manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. The results confirmed the precision, accuracy, and ruggedness of our model. This model will facilitate the reliable use of KCE-DEL based primary screening. Next, we developed a kinetic size-exclusion chromatography-mass spectrometry (KSEC-MS) as the label-free solution-based platform for calculating kinetic binding parameters of target-ligand interactions in secondary screening. KSEC-MS employs size-exclusion chromatography to separate small molecule ligand from protein target-ligand complex without immobilization and mass spectrometry to detect small molecule without a label. The rate constants of complex formation and dissociation are calculated from the temporal ligand concentration profile. Methods of KSEC-MS have been developed by using 2 proteins with the corresponding drugs. The resulted kinetic and affinity binding parameters were validated, which confirmed the precision and accuracy of KSEC-MS. We foresee that the KSEC-MS will become a universal approach for the kinetic analysis of target-ligand interactions in secondary screening...|$|R

We describe a multi-step functionally based approach to guide the in-depth pyrosequencing of specific regions of the human gut metagenome encoding the CAZymes involved in dietary fiber breakdown. High-throughput functional screens were first applied to a library covering 5. 4 × 109 bp of metagenomic DNA, allowing the isolation of 310 clones showing beta-glucanase, hemicellulase, galactanase, amylase, or pectinase activities.

Thirty-three of these CAZy encoding genes are highly homologous to prevalent genes found in the gut microbiome of at least 20 individuals for whose metagenomic data are available.

All quadrangulations {{can be generated}} by a sequence of graph operations called vertex splitting, starting from the path P_ 2 of length 2. We define the degree D of a splitting S and consider restricted splittings S_i,j with i <= D <= j. It is known that S_ 2, 3 generate all simple quadrangulations. Here we investigate the cases S_ 1, 2, S_ 1, 3, S_ 1, 1, S_ 2, 2, S_ 3, 3. First we show that the splittings S_ 1, 2 are exactly the monotone ones {{in the sense that}} the resulting graph contains the original as a subgraph. Then we show that they define a set of nontrivial ancestors beyond P_ 2 and each quadrangulation has a unique ancestor. Our results have a direct geometric interpretation in the context of mechanical equilibria of convex bodies. The topology of the equilibria corresponds to a 2 -coloured quadrangulation with independent set sizes s, u. The numbers s, u identify the primary equilibrium class associated with the body by Várkonyi and Domokos. We show that both S_ 1, 1 and S_ 2, 2 generate all primary classes from a finite set of ancestors which is closely related to their geometric results. If, beyond s and u, the full topology of the quadrangulation is considered, we arrive at the more <b>refined</b> <b>secondary</b> equilibrium classes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has {{two major}} sections. In Chapter II, complete mitochondrial (mt DNA) genome sequences {{were used to}} construct a hypothesis for affinities of most major lineages of rodents that arose quickly in the Eocene and were well established {{by the end of}} the Oligocene. Determining the relationships among extant members of such old lineages can be difficult. Two traditional schemes on subordinal classification of rodents have persisted for over a century, dividing rodents into either two or three suborders, with relationships among families or superfamilies remaining problematic. The mtDNA sequences for four new rodent taxa (Aplodontia, Cratogeomys, Erethizon, and Hystrix), along with previously published Euarchontoglires taxa, were analyzed under parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian criteria. Likelihood and Bayesian analyses of the protein-coding genes converged on a single topology that weakly supported rodent monophyly and was significantly better than the parsimony trees. Analysis of the tRNAs failed to recover a monophyletic Rodentia and did not reach convergence on a stationary distribution after fifty million generations. Most relationships hypothesized in the likelihood topology have support from previous data. Mt tRNAs have been largely ignored with respect to molecular evolution or phylogenetic utility. In Chapter III, the mt tRNAs from 141 mammals were used to <b>refine</b> <b>secondary</b> structure models and examine their molecular evolution. Both H- and L-encoded tRNAs are AT-rich with different %G and GC-skew and a difference in skew between H- and L-strand stems. Proportion of W-C pairs is higher in the H-strand and GU/UG pairs are higher in the L-strand, suggesting increased mismatch compensation in L-strand tRNAs. Among rodents, the number of variable stem base-pairs was nearly 75 % of that observed across all mammals combined. Compensatory base changes were present only at divergences of 4 % or greater. Neither loop reduction nor an accumulation of deleterious mutations, both suggestive of mutational meltdown (Muller's ratchet), was observed.

50|$|Africa’s {{refined copper}} {{production}} rose by 40% from 2000 to 2005; increased production from the Bwana Mkubwa and the Mufulira plants in Zambia {{more than offset}} lower South African output. In South Africa, production declined because of lower output from the Palabora refinery. In 2005, Zambia accounted for 77% of African refined copper production; South Africa, 19%; and Egypt, 3%. Congo (Kinshasa), which accounted for 37% of continental refined copper output in 1990, had ceased production by 2000. Egypt was the only producer of <b>secondary</b> <b>refined</b> copper; primary production accounted for most African production.|$|R
