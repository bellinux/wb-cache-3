40|$|A {{technique}} {{for improving the}} momentum resolution for low momentum charged particles in few layer silicon based trackers is presented. The particle momenta are determined from the measured Landau dE/dx distribution and the Bethe-Bloch formula in the 1 /beta^ 2 region.

This improvement is important in large scale heavy ion experiments which cover the low transverse momentum spectra using stand-alone silicon tracking devices with a few planes like the ones used in STAR at RHIC and ALICE at LHC.

The grids with the ‘X’ marker are grids eliminated by the cleansing procedure. The yellow line shows the final borderline of the target cell coverage. As shown in the example of cell borderline detection, the cleansing and compensation are essential analytical tools to identify the cell coverage. A logical solution for many problems is to clean the data to enhance the solution quality: exploring the data set for possible problems and endeavoring to clean the errors. Of course, for any real world data set, doing this data cleansing and/or relational data integrity analysis ‘by hand’ is {{completely out of the}} question, given the amount of person-hours required [13]. While a data cleansing method can uncover a number of possible errors in a data set, it does not address other, more complex errors. Errors or irregularities that involve relationships among multiple fields are often very difficult to uncover. These types of errors require serious inspection and analysis to be cleaned: statistical [14], clustering [15], pattern-based [16], and association [17] techniques are used to identify patterns that can uncover the data error or irregularities. In addition, informative patterns [17] and ‘garbage patterns’ of meaningless or mislabeled patterns [18] are used to perform data cleansing. Machine learning techniques are also used to cleanse data in the written character classification problem. However, none of the mentioned researches can present an effective tool for general data cleansing. A data cleansing activity has a very domain-specific applicability [19]. General purpose data cleansing methods, such as the Kalman filter [20], do not have the specific knowledge needed to effectively eliminate the outliers to detect the borderline of a cell. Thus, we developed a customized data cleansing method for effective fingerprint-based cell coverage estimation.|$|R

Last identified olive allergen (Ole e 13) is a TLP, which may also importantly contribute to food allergy and cross-allergenicity to pollen allergen proteins. The goals {{of this study are}} the characterization of the structural-functionality of Ole e 13 with a focus in its catalytic mechanism, and its molecular allergenicity by extensive analysis using different molecular computer-aided approaches covering a) functional-regulatory motifs, b) comparative study of linear sequence, 2 -D and 3 D structural homology modeling, c) molecular docking with two different β-D-glucans, d) conservational and evolutionary analysis, e) catalytic mechanism modeling, and f) IgE-binding, B- and T-cell epitopes identification and comparison to other allergenic TLPs. Sequence comparison, structure-based features, and phylogenetic analysis identified Ole e 13 as a thaumatin-like protein. 3 D structural characterization revealed a conserved overall folding among plants TLPs, with mayor differences in the acidic (catalytic) cleft. Molecular docking analysis using two β-(1, 3) -glucans allowed to identify fundamental residues involved in the endo- 1, 3 -β-glucanase activity, and defining E 84 as one of the conserved residues of the TLPs responsible of the nucleophilic attack to initiate the enzymatic reaction and D 107 as proton donor, thus proposing a catalytic mechanism for Ole e 13.

40|$|Domestic solar {{hot water}} systems (SHWS), {{which are used}} to reduce {{domestic}} energy use, represent {{one of the most}} widely known technologies of solar thermal applications. Taking into account the sizing of these systems during its design phase, it is also important to consider the effects on the environment of their use from a life cycle perspective. An evaluation method based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology is used in this paper to analyse the environmental implications of SHWS considering the production, use, maintenance and end-of-life stages. As a case study, 32 different types of SWHS to meet the hot water demand (HWD) of 2 dwellings and 2 hotels, located in the region of Aragón in Spain, are studied. The aim of the case study is to compare the environmental performance of SHWS and to select the best environmentally friendly solution while considering their energy pay-back time (EPBT). From an environmental point of view, comparing the results obtained in all cases studies, e. g., in terms of kg CO 2 eq, the use of biomass as fuel for the auxiliary system in each SHWS considered provides the greatest environmental benefit in comparison with the other fuels, usually followed by the use of natural gas. However, in terms of the EPBT, because biomass is the fuel with lowest environmental impact and associated embodied energy, the avoided embodied energy due to the solar contribution in SHWS is the lowest in the biomass case, thereby resulting in a higher value of the EPBT.

40|$|We {{present results}} from an {{investigation}} of the dynamical behavior of buoyant magnetic flux rings in the radiative interior of a uniformly rotating early-type star. Our physical model describes a thin, axisymmetric, toroidal flux tube that is released from the outer boundary of the convective core, and is acted upon by buoyant, centrifugal, Coriolis, magnetic tension, and aerodynamic drag forces. We find that rings emitted in the equatorial plane can attain a stationary equilibrium state that is stable with respect to small displacements in radius, but is unstable when perturbed in the meridional direction. Rings emitted at other latitudes travel toward the surface along trajectories that largely parallel the rotation axis of the star. Over much of the ascent, the instantaneous rise speed is determined by the rate of heating by the absorption of radiation that diffuses into the tube from the external medium. Since the time scale for this heating varies like the square of the tube cross-sectional radius, for the same field strength, thin rings rise more rapidly than do thick rings. For a reasonable range of assumed ring sizes and field strengths, our results suggest that buoyancy is a viable mechanism for bringing magnetic flux from the core to the surface, being capable of accomplishing this transport in a time that is generally much less than the stellar main sequence lifetime.

What all of these solvents have in common is that they have limited proton donor or even hydrogen bond donor ability. However, the Br$nsted and Lewis basicities of different members vary widely. For example, their Gutmamn donor <b>numbers</b> (<b>Ref.</b> 1), which are the —iH 0 values for their interaction with antimony pentachloride in the relatively inert solvent l, 2 —dichloro— ethane, are the following: AN, 14. 1; SL, 14. 8; DMF, 26. 6; DMSO, 29. 8; and HNPA, 38. 8.

A weak emission signal was discernible, and could be fitted to the functional form a[exp(-t/tau 2) -exp(-t/tau 1), with a > 0 and tau 2 > tau 1. The value of tau 2 decreased from 11. 6 +/- 0. 5 μs under aerobic conditions to 4. 1 +/- 0. 2 μs in oxygen saturated samples, due to enhanced bimolecular quenching of the donor triplet by oxygen, whereas that of tau 1, identifiable with the lifetime of singlet oxygen, was close to 3 μs in both cases. Extrapolations based on the low amplitude of the emission signal of singlet oxygen formed by PSII RC in the aqueous buffer and the expected values of tau 1 and tau 2 in chloroplasts indicate that attempts to analyse the temporal profile of singlet oxygen in chloroplasts {{are unlikely to be}} rewarded with success without a significant advance in the sensitivity of the detection equipment.

A randomized, open label, 2 -period, crossover study was designed. Twelve volunteers were selected, of whom eight were extensive metabolizers (EM) of CYP 2 C 19 and 4 were poor metabolizers (PM). They received single dose of OMP either alone or in combination with CLOP (single dose) and samples were collected periodically to calculate various pharmacokinetic parameters. Changes in most of the pharmacokinetic parameters of OMP, 5 -OH-OMP and OMP- S were insignificant (P ˃ 0. 05) both in EM and PM except for the maximum concentration (Cmax) of 5 -OH-OMP and OMP-S in EM. The OMP Cmax and AUC 0 -∞ was increased both in EM and PM after concomitant administration of OMP with CLOP. The 5 -OH-OMP Cmax was decreased in both EM and PM, demonstrating that CLOP inhibits hydroxylation of OMP. The OMP-S Cmax and AUC 0 -∞ were increased both in EM and PM showing that CLOP may induce sulfoxidation of OMP. It was concluded that CLOP may inhibit hydroxylation of OMP to a greater extent in EM than in PM, leading to higher OMP Cmax and AUC 0 -∞. Furthermore, the sulfoxidation of OMP may also be induced by CLOP. So, it is suggested that both these drugs should be carefull prescribed together to avoid any harm to the patients.

It is,. together with dimethylsulfoxide and acetonitrile, one of the most widely used of the so—called dipolar aprotic solvents. Owing to its fairly high dielectric constant, it is a moderately dissociating solvent for electrolytes. Acid—base reactions as well as thermodynamic properties of electrolyte solutions have been studied by many authors. Con— trary to the N—methylamides it is a typically weakly associated solvent, as seen (Ref. 1) from dielectric studies (the Kirkwood g factor is about one at all temperatures). Owing to its electron—donor character, DMF reacts with many acids. For example, Gutmann's donicity <b>number</b> (<b>Ref.</b> 2) is 27. Its polarographic range is quite large, e. g., 3. 5 V at the dropping mercury electrode with 0. 1 N Bu 4 NC 1 O 4 as supporting electrolyte (Ref. 3). It is therefore widely used as a solvent for electrochemical reactions, especially reductions. Pure DMF is colorless and, at room temperature, odorless. It is subject to thermal as well as photochemical degradation.

40|$|The {{study of}} flow {{phenomena}} at the sediment-water interface {{is very important}} in the field of environmental hydraulics. When a porous layer is overlaid by viscous fluid flow, a thin transition zone between the layers is formed, which is responsible for the interfacial momentum and mass transfer.

The thickness of the transition layer, defined as the height below the permeable interface up to which the velocity decreases to Darcy scale was measured from the simulated flow field. Numerical data were generally lower than the experimental data, but they were in agreement with the observed trends because the thickness of the transition layer increased with the increasing Da whereas it was not greatly altered by the increasing Ref...|$|R
40|$|Falling film steam-heated {{evaporators}} {{are used}} in the food industry but their thermal characteristics are not well known. Absorption-driven falling film evaporators represent a new concept in evaporation. In these evaporators CaCl(, 2), LiCl or LiBr brine flows down the outside surface of falling film evaporator tubes while the liquid food flows down the inside surface of the same tubes. If the brine concentration is such that its boiling point is higher than the boiling point of the food there will be a temperature difference between the brine and the food which will induce heat transfer and evaporation of water from the food. The vapor generated from the evaporation of the water is transferred through a vapor return line and absorbed by the brine. ^ In this work a long tube falling film evaporator was built and operated as a steam-heated evaporator and as an absorption-driven evaporator. The thermal characteristics of both types were studied. It was found that: (a) in both modes of operation the overall heat transfer coefficient, U(,o), is a weak function of the food side Reynolds <b>number,</b> <b>Re(,f),</b> for 1000 3 ̆c Re(,f) 3 ̆c 4000. (b) U(,o) decreases drastically when the temperature difference between the heating medium and the evaporating medium increases. (c) U(,o) increases with brine Reynolds number, Re(,b), for Re(,b) 3 ̆c 600, but it does not change for 600 3 ̆c Re(,b) 3 ̆c 1300 and (d) U(,o) does not change with evaporation temperature in absorption-driven evaporation but it decreases as evaporation temperature increases in steam-heated evaporation. ^ The brine temperature profile is affected by such factors as inlet brine temperature, Re(,b) and amount of non-condensables present in the system. ...|$|R
