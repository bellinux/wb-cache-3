By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced <b>rural</b> <b>society.</b> Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Atlanta, Georgia's capital city, {{underwent}} significant {{economic and social}} change. To serve a growing economy based on manufacturing and commerce, many people left the countryside to relocate in Atlanta, often in primitive housing. Employment conditions in the city included child labor, a 66-hour work week, low wages, and unregulated and unsafe work sites. Men from the traditional and paternalistic <b>rural</b> <b>society</b> felt it degrading that their womenfolk were forced into the city to work in factories. Mixed gender workplaces were seen as places for potential corruption.|$|E

5|$|In the Scottish Highlands, popular {{education}} was challenged by problems of distance and physical isolation, {{as well as}} teachers' and ministers' limited knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, the primary local language. Here the Kirk's parish schools were supplemented by those established from 1709 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Its aim in the Highlands was to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. Though the SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to the erosion of Highland culture. Literacy rates were lower in the Highlands than in comparable Lowland <b>rural</b> <b>society,</b> and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|From {{the twelfth}} century there are sources that allow the {{stratification}} in society {{to be seen in}} detail, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably a large group of serfs, particularly in central Scotland. In this period the feudalism introduced under David I meant that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen (grazing tenants) with more modest landholdings. The combination of agnatic kinship and feudal obligations has been seen as creating the system of clans in the Highlands in this era. Scottish society adopted theories of the three estates to describe its society and English terminology to differentiate ranks.

5|$|The Peasants' Revolt, {{also called}} Wat Tyler's Rebellion or the Great Rising, {{was a major}} {{uprising}} across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years' War, and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in Essex on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of <b>rural</b> <b>society,</b> including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local gaols. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, {{an end to the}} system of unfree labour known as serfdom and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.|$|E
5|$|While {{the church}} in Norway {{initially}} had refused to recognise Haakon as King of Norway, it had largely turned to support his claim to the throne by the 1223 meeting, although later disagreements occurred. Despite additionally having become the undisputed ruler of Norway after 1240, Haakon had still not been approved as king by the Pope due to his illegitimate birth. He nonetheless had a strong personal desire to be approved fully as a European king. Several papal commissions were appointed to investigate the matter, and Haakon declared his legitimate son Haakon the Young his successor instead of an older living illegitimate son. Although Haakon had children with his mistress Kanga the Young prior to his marriage with Margrete, it was his children with Margrete that was designated as his successors in accordance with a papal recognition. The Catholic principle of legitimacy was thus established in the Norwegian order of succession, although Haakon's new law still maintained that illegitimate children could be designated as successor {{in the absence of}} any legitimate children or grandchildren—contrary to Catholic principles. While his strong position allowed him to set boundaries to the church's political influence, he was on the other hand prepared to give the church much autonomy in internal affairs and relations with the <b>rural</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E

5|$|Childhood {{mortality}} {{was high}} in Medieval Scotland. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, {{because of the}} belief that unbaptised children would be dammed. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents. Cemeteries may not represent {{a cross section of}} Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. Iron deficiency anaemia seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland <b>rural</b> <b>society,</b> as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have noted}} {{considerable}} political {{conflict in the}} burghs between the great merchants and craftsmen throughout the period. Merchants attempted to prevent lower crafts and gilds from infringing on their trade, monopolies and political power. Craftsmen attempted to emphasise their importance and to break into disputed areas of economic activity, setting prices and standards of workmanship. In the 15th century a series of statutes cemented the political position of the merchants, with limitations {{on the ability of}} residents to influence the composition of burgh councils and many of the functions of regulation taken on by the bailies. In <b>rural</b> <b>society</b> historians have noted a lack of evidence of widespread unrest similar to that evidenced the Jacquerie of 1358 in France and the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in England, possibly because there was relatively little of the type of change in agriculture, like the enclosure of common land, that could create widespread resentment before the modern era. Instead a major factor was the willingness of tenants to support their betters in any conflict in which they were involved, for which landlords reciprocated with charity and support. Highland and border society acquired a reputation for lawless activity, particularly the feud. However, more recent interpretations have pointed to the feud as a means of preventing and speedily resolving disputes by forcing arbitration, compensation and resolution.|$|E

5|$|Underlying {{social and}} racial {{tensions}} {{also had a}} great impact {{on the nature of the}} fighting. Rural areas were pitted against urban centers, as grievances against the authorities found an outlet in the political conflict. This was the case with Hidalgo's peasant revolt, which was fueled as much by discontent over several years of bad harvests as with events in the Peninsular War. Hidalgo was originally part of a circle of liberal urbanites in Querétaro, who sought to establish a junta. After this conspiracy was discovered, Hidalgo turned to the rural people of the Mexican Bajío to build his army, and their interests soon overshadowed those of the urban intellectuals. A similar tension existed in Venezuela, where the Spanish immigrant José Tomás Boves was able to form a nearly invincible, though informal, royalist army out of the Llanero, mixed-race, slave and plains people, by seeking to destroy the white landowning class. Boves and his followers often disregarded the command of Spanish officials and were not concerned with actually reestablishing the toppled royal government, choosing instead to keep real power among themselves. Finally in the backcountry of Upper Peru, the republiquetas kept the idea of independence alive by allying with disenfranchised members of <b>rural</b> <b>society</b> and Native groups, but were never able to take the major population centers. This period witnessed increasingly violent confrontations between Spaniards and Spanish Americans, but this tension was often related to class issues or fomented by patriot leaders to create a new sense of nationalism. After being incited to rid the country of the gachupines (a disparaging term for Peninsulares), Hidalgo's forces indiscriminately massacred hundreds of Criollos and Peninsulares who had taken refuge at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato. In Venezuela during his Admirable Campaign, Simón Bolívar instituted a policy of a war to the death—in which and royalist Spanish Americans would be purposely spared but even neutral Peninsulares would be killed—in order to drive a wedge between the two groups. This policy laid the ground for the violent royalist reaction under Boves. Often though, royalism or patriotism simply provided a banner to organize the aggrieved, and the political causes could be discarded just as quickly as they were picked up. The Venezuelan Llaneros switched to the patriot banner once the elites and the urban centers became securely royalist after 1815, and it was the royal army in Mexico that ultimately brought about that nation's independence.|$|E

40|$|This text {{represents}} {{the first part}} of the article published in the »Revue frangaise de sociologie«, special issue in 1965. It considers different typological classification of <b>rural</b> <b>societies.</b> Usually one starts from the continuum which extremes are the two confronted types. In literature there are numerous exemples of such dichotomies. But the typological method established on the principle of continuum leads to the greate simplifacion of reality and does not care for the varieties which characterise rural communities. The aim of typology presented bv the author is just in the discovery of peculiar dimensions that show differencies among <b>rural</b> <b>societies.</b> Without being hypothesis per se, the type helps the construction of hypothesis, it is a scheme, guide for the analysis and the description of the studied phenomenon. This approach rejects the idea of searching a unique continuum at which all societies could be placed. It is necessary to emphasize that every one of them has pecularities incompatible with the common order. As a matter of fact one tries to find out in this way significant differencies among <b>rural</b> <b>societies.</b> For the construction of such explicative types one uses the rules of the logical construction and opservation in the context of the particular <b>rural</b> <b>societies</b> which have their history, in which changes take place under the influence of the global society but with different intensity and forms. As units of analysis in France cantons have been selected. There is the most complete statistics about them. This enabled the elaboration of the Atlas of rural France. Several monographs on communes have questioned the cantonal hypothesis, so that the typological procedure was twice initiated in different circumstances...|$|R
