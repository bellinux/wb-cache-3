30|$|During {{the past}} few years an {{initiative}} to create a radar research center has been undertaken in Costa Rica. The location chosen for the radar site is a satellite campus of the University of Costa Rica located in Santa Cruz (Lat: 10.283720, Lon: − 85.595166, Elevation: 60 m a.s.l). Santa Cruz provides the project with a quiet <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>environment</b> and sufficient land to expand the arrays or deploy other instruments if the need arises. In Costa Rica there were no tropospheric radars before this project started. Consequently, {{this was the first time}} that a VHF radar could be used to obtain detailed information about tropospheric behavior and structure.|$|E

40|$|We {{design a}} custom {{spectrum}} sensing network, called RadioHound, capable of tuning from 25 MHz to 6 GHz, which covers nearly all widely-deployed wireless activity. We describe the system hardware and network infrastructure in detail {{with a view}} towards driving the cost, size, and power usage of the sensors as low as possible. The system estimates the spatial variation of radio-frequency power from an unknown random number of sources. System performance is measured by computing the mean square error against a simulated <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>environment.</b> We find that the system performance depends heavily on the deployment density of the sensors. Consequently, we derive an expression for the sensor density {{as a function of}} environmental characteristics and confidence in measurement quality. Comment: Submitted to DySPAN 201...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the mobile}} RFID (<b>Radio-Frequency</b> Identification) <b>environment,</b> {{scanning}} RFID tags which are personalized can bring some privacy infringe-ment issues. In {{spite of the}} case that private information is not stored in those tags, one can identify entities, analyze their preferences, and track them by col-lecting data related with the tags and aggregating it. Especially, {{it might be more}} serious at the point of that data collection may be done not only by enter-prises and government, but also by individuals. In this paper, we describe priva-cy infringements for the mobile RFID service environment. The proposed framework provides a means for securing the stability of mobile RFID services by suggesting personal policy based access control for personalized tags...|$|R

40|$|International audienceInterference {{are among}} the most penalizing error sources in global {{positioning}} system (GPS) navigation. So far, many effort has been devoted to developing GPS receivers more robust to the <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>environment.</b> Contrary to previous approaches, this paper does not aim at improving the estimation of the GPS pseudoranges between the mobile and the GPS satellites in the presence of interference. As an alternative, we propose to model interference effects as variance jumps affecting the GPS measurements which can be directly detected and compensated {{at the level of the}} navigation algorithm. Since the joint detection/estimation of the interference errors and motion parameters is a highly non linear problem, a particle filtering technique is used. An original particle filter is developed to improve the detection performance while ensuring a good accuracy of the positioning solution...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a system which}} combines a zero-velocity-update-(ZUPT-) aided inertial navigation system (INS), using a foot-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU), with opportunistic use of multi-frequency received signal strength (RSS) measurements. The system does not rely on maps or pre-collected data from surveys of the <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>environment.</b> Instead it builds its own database of collected RSS measurements {{during the course of}} the operation. New RSS measurements are continuously compared with the stored values in the database, and when the user returns to a previously visited area this can thus be detected. This enables loop-closures to be detected online and used for error drift correction. The system utilises a distributed particle simultaneous localization and mapping (DP-SLAM) algorithm which provides a flexible 2 D navigation platform that can be extended with more sensors. The experimental results presented in this paper indicates that the developed RSS SLAM algorithm can, in many cases, significantly improve the positioning performance of a foot-mounted INS. ...|$|R

We describe the automated radio-frequency interference detection strategy implemented for the Murchison Widefield Array, which is based on the aoflagger platform, and present 72 – 231 MHz radio-frequency interference statistics from 10 observing nights. Radio-frequency interference detection removes 1. 1 % of the data. Radio-frequency interference from digital TV is observed 3 % of the time due to occasional ionospheric or atmospheric propagation. After radio-frequency interference detection and excision, almost all data can be calibrated and imaged without further radio-frequency interference mitigation efforts, including observations within the FM and digital TV bands. The results are compared to a previously published Low-Frequency Array radio-frequency interference survey.

40|$|A <b>radio-frequency</b> {{interference}} (RFI) <b>environment</b> {{can cause}} serious problems for communications systems, {{such as the}} Deep Space Network (DSN). For this reason, {{it is necessary to}} determine first the RFI susceptibility characteristics for DSN receiving systgms. The present investigation is concerned with CW RFI's which are close in frequency to the carrier frequency. The carrier tracking loop is highly sensitive, and this type of RFI will degrade the carrier loop performance before saturation effects become noticeable. The investigation has the objective to develop an analytical model which will make it possible to predict the tracking performance of the Block IV receiver when operated {{in the presence of a}} CW RFI in the receiver passband. The Block IV receiver represents one of the DSN receivers. Attention is given to the effects of a CW RFI on a phase-locked loop, the effects of a bandpass limiter, numerical results, experimental verification, and aspects of computer simulation...|$|R
40|$|Internet of Things (IoT) {{is a new}} {{emerging}} paradigm {{which requires}} billions of wirelessly connected devices that {{communicate with each other}} in a complex <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>environment.</b> Considering the huge number of devices, recharging batteries or replacing them becomes impractical in real life. Therefore, harvesting ambient RF energy for powering IoT devices can be a practical solution to achieve self-charging operation. The antenna for the RF energy harvesting application must work on multiple frequency bands (multiband or wideband) to capture as much power as possible from ambient; it should be compact and small in size {{so that it can be}} integrated with IoT devices; and it should be low cost, considering the huge number of devices. This thesis presents a fully printed 3 D cube Cantor fractal RF energy harvesting unit, which meets the above-mentioned criteria. The multiband Cantor fractal antenna has been designed and implemented on a package of rectifying circuits using additive manufacturing (combination of 3 D inkjet printing of plastic substrate and 2 D metallic screen printing of silver paste) for the first time for RF energy harvesting application. The antenna, which is in a Cantor fractal shape, is folded on five faces of a 3 D cube where the bottom face accommodates rectifying circuit with matching network. The rectenna (rectifying antenna) harvests RF power from GSM 900, GSM 1800, and 3 G at 2100 MHz frequency. Indoor and outdoor field tests of the RF energy harvester have been conducted in the IMPACT lab and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) campus territory, and 252. 4 mV of maximum output voltage is harvested...|$|R

The use of C/A-code receivers for aeronautical applications requires high reliability and integrity. This study is an investigation of the potential sources of electromagnetic interference for the Standard Positioning Service of the GPS receivers using the C/A code and navigating inside an avionic <b>environment.</b> <b>Radio-frequency</b> emissions from several communication systems using frequencies adjacent to the GPS and GLONASS bands present considerable problems for the GNSS reception. An overcrowded frequency spectrum and weak GPS signals make RF interference from a variety of sources a potential threat that must be examined with care. This paper intends to give an overview of the potential sources of interference and their solutions. These sources of RFI are identified, and the vulnerability of GPS and GNSS to that interference is assessed. The study procures a quantitative comprehension of the impact of interference. The most important sources of interference are studied in terms of their technical characteristics, their jamming distance and the isolation or the rejection requirements needed to keep the good performance of the receiver. Candidate mitigation techniques are also examined, and selected techniques are recommended for adoption in appropriate standards...|$|R
